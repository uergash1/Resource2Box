Congress Avenue      Austin, Texas 78701      Phone :(512) 463-9455      Fax: (512) 305-8920             A CALL FOR EXCELLENCE:     RAISING THE BAR      FOR GIFTED STUDENTS         Texas Education Agency     January 15, 1999         A Call for Excellence: Raising the Bar for Gifted Students     Building on the past.  Throughout the United States, there has been a call for   America's students to master more complex skills and to demonstrate understanding of more   sophisticated content. In response, states throughout the country have increased their   expectations for student performance. However, while basic competencies are being raised,   often there is little done to enhance services for more advanced learners.  National   Excellence: A Case for Developing America's Talent,  published by the United States   Department of Education in 1993, notes that, ""Most American students are encouraged   to finish high school and earn good grades. But students are not asked to work hard or   master a body of challenging knowledge or skills. The message society often sends to   students is to aim for academic  adequacy , not academic  excellence    (p.1).""     In 1995 when the Texas Legislature passed Senate Bill 1, it created a new education   code with a new set of expectations for children that met the challenge implied in  National   Excellence . The law required that a new curriculum be developed that established what   knowledge and skills all students should achieve at each grade level. It also established   a new set of ""Public Education Academic Goals"" for the state. These goals   mandate that students should perform at exemplary levels in language arts, mathematics,   social studies, and science (Section 4.002, TEC). Taken together, the new curriculum and   the new goals promised that all students would receive a more challenging educational   program.     Senate Bill 1 did not stop there. It also redrafted the laws relating to the   state-mandated program for gifted students. The Texas Legislature had provided funding for   programs to gifted students on a voluntary basis since 1979. In 1987 it had mandated that   all districts must provide services to gifted students by the beginning of the 1990 school   year. Prior to 1995, however, although services for advanced students were required in all   districts, there was no oversight provided by the Texas Education Agency. According to   Section 29.123 of the Texas Education Code, the State Board of Education now is charged   with developing and updating ""a state plan for the education of gifted and talented   students to guide school districts in establishing and improving programs for identified   students."" Additionally, and most importantly, the plan is to ""be used for   accountability purposes  to measure the performance of districts  in providing   services to students identified as gifted and talented (29.123, TEC).""      The new plan, which was adopted in November 1996, was designed to meet the two charges   included in the law-it created criteria to be used for accountability of services for   gifted students, and it provided guidance on how to improve those services. The plan   provided an acceptable level of services that all districts must meet. At the same time,   it also established criteria that districts could strive to attain at a   ""recognized"" and ""exemplary"" level that raised the bar both for the   expansiveness of services provided to/for gifted students and on the level of student   performance. In keeping with Senate Bill 1, which encourages local control, the additional   levels above acceptable are voluntary on the part of districts and not a requirement of   state law or rule. Each level of the plan builds on the previous one-districts must meet   the acceptable level in order to adequately address the recognized level, which, in turn,   must be met if a district is to meet the standards at the exemplary level. As an example   of this, at the acceptable level, all teachers who provide services in the gifted program   must receive a minimum of 30 clock hours of professional development in the field   (indicator 4.1A). Indicator 4.1.1R states that teachers are encouraged to pursue advanced   degrees in their teaching discipline. The exemplary indicator, 4.1E, requires that   districts provide support for teachers to receive their endorsement in the area of gifted   education. A copy of the state plan is included in Appendix A.     Even at the acceptable level, which is a requirement of all districts, the new plan   expanded services in the following ways.        It requires that all districts offer services that emphasize content in the four     foundation areas of the curriculum.  In the past, districts could select to serve     students in one area-language arts for example-and ignore other areas of the curriculum.     Because the academic goals for public education outlined in Section 4.002 of the Texas     Education Code state that students perform at exemplary levels in language arts,     mathematics, social studies, and science, it is critical that services to gifted students     support these goals by addressing the four foundation areas. At the recognized and     exemplary level, the state plan encourages districts to expand their services to areas of     the arts, leadership, and creative endeavors.       The plan requires that districts provide a continuum of learning experiences that     lead to the development of advanced-level products/performances.  Prior to the adoption     of the plan in 1996, there were no requirements related to student performance for those     who participated in services for gifted students. Too often, detractors of services for     gifted students could turn to programs that did not have rigor, did not require effort,     and did not set high expectations for students. Even those who actively support gifted     education have admitted that the effort to get into gifted programs far exceeds, in some     cases, the effort needed to participate in those programs. The plan's goal focuses on     student performance by stating that students who participate in services that are part of     the gifted program will develop ""innovative products and performances that reflect     individuality and creativity and are advanced in relation to students of similar age,     experience, or environment. High school students who have participated in services for     gifted students will have produced products and performance of professional quality as     part of their program services (p.1)."" This goal clearly focuses district efforts on     what students are learning and accomplishing, thereby addressing a major concern related     to gifted education.       The concept of high school students producing products of professional quality may seem     beyond the reach of most students, and, indeed, it may be. However, it should be the goal     of those who either teach or are taught at an advanced level. The purpose of gifted     programs is not simply to get in them but to provide challenging curricular options that     demand effort and high performance.  National Excellence  suggested that there is a     pervasive ambivalence in America toward high intellectual achievement. The report notes     that high-ability students receive mixed messages. ""Negative stereotypes of     high-achieving students have created an atmosphere in which students do not want to be     identified as very smart…Students say they want to do well, but not exceptionally     well, because it is more important to be accepted by the popular students than it is to be     considered a 'brain'."" (p. 13). The new state plan removes this ambiguity and     emphasizes to both educators and students that high performance is not only applauded, but     expected.       The plan requires that districts offer gifted students a variety of curricular     options.  In working with students who need remedial services, it is a given that a     variety of educational techniques and options should be employed. The same need for     variety exists for all students. This requirement suggests that gifted students would not     only have the option of, for example, Advanced Placement at the high school level, but     also would be able to select from independent study courses or mentorships that enable     them to delve into an area of strength. Middle school students would not only have algebra     as an eighth grade mathematics option, but would participate in specially designed     mini-seminars or research projects that enable them to use their talents in specific     applications. Diversity of services assure that more advanced students will be served     appropriately and will meet the state goal of developing sophisticated products.       Inclusion of the ""recognized"" and ""exemplary"" levels of the     state plan emphasizes increasingly individualized services for highly gifted students.      At the ""acceptable"" level of the Texas state plan, districts are required to     develop general services that address advanced learners. As the plan moves to more     advanced degrees of implementation at the ""recognized"" and ""exemplary""     levels, more individualized services are expected. As an example, in the curriculum     section of the plan, all districts are expected to provide students with opportunities     ""to accelerate in areas of student strengths (3.3A)."" At the recognized level,     to meet criteria 3.3R, districts need to assure that ""Flexible pacing is employed,     allowing students to learn at the pace and level appropriate to their abilities and     skills."" At the exemplary level, 3.3E requires that ""Scheduling modifications     are implemented in order to meet the needs of individual students.""        Administrators and counselors must receive a one-time overview on gifted education.      Teacher training in the area of gifted education typically has been widely supported.     However, many times teachers' efforts to implement appropriate services are not supported     because of a lack of understanding on the part of administrators or counselors who must     balance the diverse needs of all students. The new state plan requires all administrators     and counselors with decision-making responsibilities for the program to receive a minimum     of six hours of professional development on the nature and needs of and program options     for gifted students. At the recognized level, local boards of trustees also would receive     minimal training on the state plan. At the exemplary level, administrators and counselors     would receive annual updates in the field.         Senate Bill 1 mandates that the state plan measure the performance of districts. The   District Effectiveness and Compliance (DEC) monitoring system established by the Texas   Education Agency determines whether or not districts are addressing the criteria required   for acceptable performance. Beginning in the spring of 1999, the Division of Advanced   Academic Services will pilot a process to recognize districts that exceed this level of   performance. Even with this system in place, no standard for student performance has been   adopted for students who participate in advanced level services. This is the next   challenge that faces Texas public schools.     The Status of Statewide Accountability of Performance of Gifted Students throughout   the Nation.  In 1998, the Texas Education Agency investigated current practices to   determine how states assess the performance of students participating in services for   gifted students. Appendix B contains an analysis of state assessment systems and explains   if and how they address advanced student performance. While some states recognize advanced   level performance, no state sets standards for performance of students served in gifted   programs. In part, this is due to the nature of the children themselves. Even when a group   of gifted students is identified, the group still consists of unique individuals whose   gifts and talents may be in different areas. For example, some students may be gifted in   the area of language arts, others in mathematics, some in leadership ability, others in   intellectual ability. This poses a dilemma when developing accountability of services.      Another factor in objective accountability of gifted student performance is that   standardized tests are simply not designed to measure this population. Even   norm-referenced assessments, the purpose of which is to describe the relative rank among   students, do not discriminate among gifted students. For example, a 40-item   norm-referenced exam may include 5 items that will challenge gifted students. This   five-item test will not differentiate the achievement of these students to any degree   useful for accountability. Criterion-referenced standardized exams could be developed for   this population. Development of such tests at the state level, however, could counteract   the goals of the state plan, which encourages more individualized services for gifted   students that would better meet student needs.     TEKS, TAAS, and Gifted Education.  Services to gifted students rest on the   foundation developed for the general school program. When Senate Bill 1 required that   Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) be developed for each content included in the   core and foundation areas of the curriculum, it provided the opportunity to increase   standards for all students. During the passage of the TEKS, which included input and   discussion from all segments of the educational community, each new draft provided a   higher level of sophistication than the previous one.     In most cases, the TEKS provide strong support for services to gifted students. This   foundation is intended to be enhanced as indicated by the curriculum standard included in   the  Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted Students.  That standard,   ""Curriculum and instruction meet the needs of gifted students by modifying the depth,   complexity, and pacing of the general school program,"" requires that the TEKS be   taught at a more sophisticated level and not necessarily rewritten when serving gifted   students. Before providing an example of this, it will be helpful to elaborate on what is   meant by pacing, depth, and complexity.     Depth, Complexity, and Pacing.  It is best to begin by stating that enhanced   depth and complexity are appropriate for all students at certain times. Most students   would be better served if the pacing of their classes were adjusted to specifically meet   their needs. However, in the case of advanced level students, these needs are more   consistent, and differentiated services are required for a greater proportion of the   student's school career. The services must be planned and educators need to develop a   continuum that reinforces already existing student strengths.     Modifications in pacing suggest that the curriculum is presented either more quickly or   more slowly than it might be in the general classroom. Many educators are familiar with   advanced students who frequently prove mastery of many of the basic skills of a particular   unit through a pre-test. In these cases, the students' progress might be accelerated. An   example of this might be those students who take algebra in the seventh or eighth grade   rather than taking the traditional mathematics courses taught at those grade levels.   However, it also is important to remember that gifted students sometimes have very deep   interests in certain areas and might need to spend more time exploring and developing   products in these areas. Adjusting the pacing of instruction was one recommendation   included in  Prisoners of Time  (1994), a report developed by the National Education   Commission on Time and Learning. The report notes that advanced students are often   ""forced to spend more time than they need on a curriculum developed for students of   moderate ability. Many become bored, unmotivated, and frustrated (p. 15)."" It further   recommends, ""(T)ime should be adjusted to meet the individual needs of learners,   rather than the administrative convenience of adults…The flexible use of time can   permit more individualized instruction."" This is where enhancement of the TEKS   through enrichment may be meaningfully employed. The term ""enrichment"" has been   overused and misused very often. However, frequently students possess the basic skills in   subjects in which they are interested. They can ""buy"" time--collapse the basic   skills part of the subject--that enables them to delve deeper into other areas of the   subject that will use and develop those basic skills.     This is where depth and complexity come into play. As used by Dr. Sandra Kaplan, the   term ""depth"" refers to exploration within a discipline. How do teachers and   students dig deeper into the curriculum? There are a number of attributes that are   critical, both for building academic awareness of a discipline and for assuring that the   needs of motivated and advanced students are met. First, teachers can introduce students   to the  language of the discipline . What does it mean to hold   ""revisionist"" views of history? What does it mean when a literary work is a   ""revision?"" Many times, teachers and parents unwittingly talk down to students,   thinking that is the best way to be understood. However, students with deep interest in a   discipline want to know, and need to know, how professionals in that field talk to one   another. This can start as early as elementary school, with the vocabulary building from   one year to the next.     Another way of adding depth to a discipline is to emphasize its  details --those   things that make it unique from other subject areas. As an example, teachers can discuss   the parts of a fairy tale with young children, the common characteristics of myths from   various countries with elementary and middle school students, and the distinctions between   legal systems with high school government students. It also is important for students to   understand the  rules  that govern a specific discipline. This covers areas as   diverse as developing a thorough understanding of how the parts of government interact   with one another to the way in which scientific experiments are carried out. Sometimes   educators overlook the importance of ""just the facts,"" but these details will be   critical building blocks in more fully developing the other dimensions of depth.     Two of these dimensions,  patterns and trends , can be established only if the   student has a good grasp on the details and rules of the disciplines. By studying   patterns, students will become more aware of recurring events, elements, and ideas that   are repeated over time. Emphasizing trends enable students to identify the various factors   that affect and influence major concepts and ideas within a discipline. One reason why it   is important for students to understand the patterns and trends of a discipline is because   these dimensions allow students to speculate knowledgeably on the final three dimensions   of depth-- the big ideas, which define the principles, theories and generalizations of an   area of study, the  ethical issues and the unanswered questions  of a discipline.   These last components of depth are not to be viewed as topics to be presented late in a   student's school career. Students at all grade levels often are asked to comment on   ethical considerations in the stories they read or in historical and scientific events.   However, only by offering students the opportunity to consider the details, patterns, and   trends of a discipline can students be provided with the evidence they need to present   their viewpoints. And only by encouraging them to use the language of a discipline can   their viewpoints be offered in a knowledgeable manner.     Just as depth provides a firm foundation within a discipline, complexity focuses on   building understanding within and across disciplines. As students look at subjects  over   time, across disciplines, and from multiple perspectives , those subjects become richer   and more complex. When high school students study primary sources written at the time   World War I was fought as opposed to a television documentary created in the 1990's, they   see how interpretations of events have changed over time. When students study the Civil   War by reading speeches made in the Confederate Congress and the U.S. Congress, they begin   to understand the different perspectives in which the war was viewed. Students use the   knowledge they have gained to begin to draw more sophisticated conclusions about issues,   concepts, and events within disciplines.     While this overview provides only a brief picture of what is implied by depth,   complexity, and pacing, it is intended to offer some idea of what is expected of teachers   and students who participate in services designed as part of the program for gifted   students. The task of developing these services, which are increasingly individualized to   address student strengths and interests, is extremely demanding. However, the TEKS that   were adopted in 1997 provide a powerful base from which to begin the process.     As an example, one of the history TEKS for fourth grade students states that students   should ""understand the causes and effects of the Texas Revolution, the Republic of   Texas, and the annexation of Texas to the United States (113.4.3 TAC)."" The student   is to accomplish this, in part by analyzing ""the causes, major events, and effects of   the Texas Revolution, including battles of the Alamo and San Jacinto"" and to   ""describe the successes and problems of the Republic of Texas."" (113.4.3 [A] and   [B] TAC). Students with a deep interest in social studies might read some passages on the   American Revolution and then be asked to draw some conclusions about patterns they observe   on how such conflicts begin. The same might be done regarding the first years of the   United States as opposed to the Republic of Texas. Teachers might discuss with students   how historical research is done and have them read diaries published from the days of the   early Republic, so they begin to understand the rules of studying history by using primary   sources and observing how these resources are used in secondary sources. Another approach   might be to have students read letters from soldiers on both sides of the Texas Revolution   and to guide a discussion on how each side viewed the conflict. While these activities may   be too detailed and sophisticated for some students, highly advanced students will welcome   the opportunity to participate in such in-depth analysis. In all cases, the activities   build on the TEKS that are used for all students, but provide more rigor and challenge for   those students who are able to go further. Additional examples in the four foundation   areas of the curriculum are included in Appendix C.     Even though the enhanced activities are based on existing TEKS, some educators might   suggest that they take away time that might better be spent on study of TAAS objectives.   All of the activities included above re-enforce and support a more sophisticated approach   to instruction designed to ensure mastery of TAAS objectives. To adequately explore the   patterns and trends of newly created republics, students will need to understand how to   interpret graphs, maps, and timelines, explain how their various readings support   conclusions they have drawn, and make generalizations based on comparisons of various   texts. These objectives are required TAAS reading objectives for the fourth grade. Rather   than using elementary, transparent material for ""TAAS review,"" students instead   hone their skills on challenging material and assignments that are commensurate with their   abilities and reflect a sophisticated mastery of TAAS objectives.     The Future for Texas.  Texas is a national leader in the area of gifted   education. The new state plan, as indicated in Texas state law, emphasizes  district    accountability. It sets in place a structure that can, like the TEKS, be used as a   starting point for establishing exemplary services that require both high degrees of   effort and performance from gifted students. As districts establish their acceptable   levels of services, it is time for gifted students who participate in the services also to   meet a certain level of performance.     Just as the current Texas State plan for gifted students is unique in its approach   because it recognizes districts that exceed state requirements, an innovative approach is   needed to assure that gifted students are offered services at a level commensurate with   their abilities. The ""test"" of this must be in the effort and skill exhibited in   the products developed by students who participate in the services. Because of the   inadequacy of test data to address the performance of gifted students, because of the   individualized nature of gifted students' talents and abilities, because the state of   Texas is committed to supporting services to gifted students by providing a mandate and   funding, it is necessary to establish both standards and methods of assessing products and   performances.      Report after report emphasizes that high school students are doing less and less to   obtain both good grades in high school and acceptance into colleges of their choice. In  Hard   Work and High Expectations: Motivating Students to Learn  (1990), Tommy Tomlinson   notes, ""By any calculation, American students do not take much time from their day to   study. But then, as it turns out, so long as they graduate, they have little reason to do   so. Traditional sources of motivation-college admission, workplace requirements, and   parental pressure-have all accommodated to the situation; indeed, students have learned   that, beyond the diploma, few doors are opened or closed to them by their record of high   school achievement or their academic work ethic (4)."" The report further notes that   more and more college professors, even at elite institutions, complain about the level of   preparedness of incoming college freshmen.     There has been little change in these concerns in the eight years since the report was   published. In 1998, 47% of Texas students who took the SAT-I reported having an   ""A"" average, a percentage significantly higher than the national average of 38%.   Students believe they are doing well and therefore may be avoiding testing themselves   against other students participating in high level learning opportunities. According to   the College Board, less than half of the Texas students who take an Advanced Placement   class take the examination that would assess them on their learning of the material. Many   Texas students, including those who are high achieving and college bound, are not being   assessed by high criteria commensurate with their abilities. Students have become adept at   determining what is required and doing just enough to get by. Students in services that   are part of the gifted program should be working with more complex content and   participating in more challenging opportunities. In turn, this premise suggests that the   students will be putting forth more effort and producing more sophisticated products that   reflect the advanced level instruction they have received. Participation in a program for   gifted students is not a reward or an entitlement-it comes with the expectation that   increased levels of rigor will be followed by increased levels of performance.     Campus and district performance improved when the expectations for accountability were   clearly established. If more sophisticated instruction is desired in classrooms, and if   more sophisticated products are desired of students who are capable of producing them, the   same formula of clear expectations tied to accountability will need to be developed. The   following recommendations are designed to support district efforts by providing standards   for student products/performances and to provide incentives for districts whose students   attain those standards.     Recommendation 1:   Legislation will be adopted requiring that the Texas   Education Agency develop standards of performance in language arts, mathematics, science,   and social studies for products developed by students participating in programs for the   gifted in grades four, eight, and eleven. These standards will be used by all Texas   districts to determine the effectiveness of their services to gifted students and will   form the basis of program modification.     Student performance indicators such as TAAS currently in place in Texas assess skills   for all students. TAAS does not include advanced levels that would be appropriate for   gifted students. At the secondary level, indicators such as performance on Advanced   Placement and International Baccalaureate examinations could be used for assessment;   however, all school districts do not offer these courses and there is debate as to whether   or not they are effective measures of gifted/talented student performance. There are no   equivalent measures to be used at the elementary or middle school levels.     Although the  Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students    provides school-based indicators that lead to recognized and exemplary levels of school   performance, currently, there are no specific student performance indicators. Student   performance is addressed in increasing increments moving from acceptable to recognized and   on to exemplary. To attain recognized designation, districts must have gifted students at   all grade levels involved in experiences that result in the development of sophisticated   products and/or performances. Student progress/performance in programs for the gifted must   be assessed periodically and information communicated to parents. To achieve an exemplary   rating, districts must assess student performance by standards developed by experts. This   recommendation would enable the agency to collaborate with experts and provide benchmarks   for districts assessing the level of sophistication of student products.     The recommendation would provide more specificity related to expectations of student   performance and give districts guidance on modifying the depth, complexity, and pacing of   curriculum and instruction. Provided clear, unambiguous targets, students would recognize   the need for hard work and effort in order to be successful in the challenging services   that were offered.     Recommendation 2:   Legislation will be adopted requiring that district   personnel present annual reports to local boards of trustees on the level of attainment of   students participating in gifted programs.  This recommendation builds on the previous   one and would require that a report be provided by district personnel annually to the   local board of trustees on the achievement of gifted students according to standards   established by the agency. Exemplary designation in the state plan requires that ongoing   formative and summative evaluation strategies be used for substantive program improvement   and reviewed by the school board. This recommendation would require formal reports that   would be made public at board meetings and would enable the community and parents to   determine the progress that was being made to address the state standards for student   performance.     Recommendation 3:   Legislation will be adopted amending TEC 42.156 (f) to   increase the $500,000 set-aside to be used to train personnel and provide program services   to up to $1,000,000 so that the Texas Education Agency can provide training and develop a   system to financially reward districts that attain recognized or exemplary levels of   performance in services to gifted students.     Section 42.156 of the TEC states that legislative set-aside money be used to provide   services that are effective and consistent with the state plan. Districts must put local   monies into services in order to attain recognized and exemplary designation. The   increased funding would be used to develop both student standards and a system of   financial remuneration, and to provide the actual financial awards.

GX068-19-7278670	A r c h i v e d  I n f o r m a t i o n        ATTENTION:  EDUCATION EDITOR                         June 1, 1994                A review of current programs and projects at the            U.S. Department of Education.  Use upon receipt.        CONTACT:  Melinda Kitchell  (202) 401-1008    ITEM:  MAGNET SCHOOLS SWELL IN NUMBER, DEMAND STILL UNMET     The number of magnet schools in America has more than doubled    since the early 1980s as they have become a significant part of    the nation's efforts to desegregate its schools, according to a    report issued today by the U.S. Department of Education.        Educational Innovation in Multiracial Contexts:  The Growth of    Magnet Schools in American Education notes that in 1991-92, 2,400    individual magnet schools and 3,200 magnet programs were open in    about 230 public school districts.  The number of students    enrolled in magnet programs totaled 1.2 million, up three-fold    since 1981-82.       First launched by school districts in the late 1970s, magnet    schools are used to help desegregate schools while also improving    the quality of education by offering a distinctive curriculum or    instructional approach to attract students from outside the    neighborhood.  They differ from other specialty schools and    school choice programs in that desegregation is an explicit    objective.  Most magnet school programs are associated with    formal desegregation plans, and more than a quarter of districts    operating under desegregation plans include magnets as part of    their plan.  More than half of magnet programs are found in large    urban districts.     Among the report's highlights:  Outreach Efforts           Magnet districts encourage enrollment through outreach              efforts and by providing transportation services.               Districts publicize magnet school offerings through              brochures and tours of school programs.  The study              found that districts with magnet schools put more              effort into outreach than do districts with other              school choice programs, and districts with magnet              programs are also more apt to provide transportation to              students who change schools (three-quarters of magnet              districts provide transportation).  More than 60              percent of magnet districts cannot accommodate all              students who wish to enroll, and about half of all              magnet programs maintain waiting lists.  Integration Efforts           Magnets appear to be effective in attracting opposite              race students to magnet schools.  One purpose of              magnets is to provide incentives for families to remain              in public schools and to send their children to              integrated schools.  In minority-dominant districts,              white students comprise 32 percent of magnet students,              versus 20 percent of overall district enrollment.  In              white-dominant districts, minority students comprise 46              percent of magnet students versus 31 percent of              district enrollment.  Of the students enrolled in              magnet programs, about three-quarters transferred              outside their neighborhood attendance zone.        Special Population Efforts           Low-income students, those with limited English              proficiency, and those in special education are              somewhat under-represented in magnet programs relative              to their proportions in the district.  Their under-              representation is more prevalent in high-minority and              high-poverty districts, where efforts to reduce              minority isolation may increase the enrollment of              higher-income students.      Federal Efforts                Between 1985 and 1993, the federal Magnet School              Assistance Program provided more than $739 million to              117 school districts to support growth of new magnet              programs and expansion of existing programs.  More than              three-quarters of districts use their funds to start              new magnet school programs or to add schools to their              existing magnet programs.           The report was prepared under contract for the department by the    American Institutes for Research in Palo Alto, Calif.  Much of    the data was collected through surveys and telephone interviews    of a nationally representative sample of 600 school districts.

GX252-26-12721784	"Texas School Performance Review        Austin Independent School District   April 2000            Chapter 2        EDUCATIONAL SERVICE DELIVERY          This chapter discusses the Austin Independent School District's (AISD's) educational service delivery system and student performance measures in nine sections:        A. Student Performance and Education Service Delivery       B. Dropout Prevention, Recovery and Leaver Codes       C. Instructional Resources       D. Bilingual Education       E. Advanced Academic Services       F. Special Education Programs       G. School to Career Programs       H. Health Services       I. Compensatory Support Programs            E.  ADVANCED ACADEMIC SERVICES    The Office of Advanced Academic Services for AISD is responsible for coordinating several programs, including the gifted and talented programs, honors programs, the Duke Talent Search Program, three magnet school programs, advanced placement studies, the International Baccalaureate program, Future Problem Solving and the summer institute.   FINDING    AISD has three magnet programs, one in a junior high school and two in high schools. The junior high school magnet program, housed at Kealing Junior High School, offers both a science and liberal arts magnet curricula. The Science Academy, housed at LBJ High School, offers science and math curricula. The third program, housed at Johnston High School, offers a liberal arts magnet curriculum. These three schools combined accept approximately 1000 students every school year. Currently, the district is planning to open a second junior high magnet program at Fulmore Middle School in the 2000-01 school year.   Magnet schools provide a challenging and innovative educational environment for qualified middle and high school students. The main goal is academic acceleration and excellence, with an emphasis on independent study and learning. These programs prepare students for higher-level educational opportunities. AISD students may apply to these programs by completing an application form that considers grades, ITBS scores, teacher evaluation and a personal essay. Usually, students must score at or above the 70th percentile on an achievement test and have grades of 80 or above.   Teachers and parents interviewed said that magnet programs are places where teachers can observe exemplary practices, and new, successful approaches to instructional delivery. Among the various programs and activities, one finds a rich variety of course offerings and an active involvement with area colleges, universities and local businesses. This involvement offers internship programs for both AISD and university students and brings expert speakers and tutors from various educational fields.   Students from every campus are encouraged to apply. Program directors make efforts to increase participation from schools with high minority student enrollment. Kealing Junior High School recruits from every sixth grade in the district. The school has a partnership with the University of Texas at Austin and with Ortega, Zavala, TA Brown, Walnut Creek, Barrington and Pecan Springs Elementary Schools to participate in a Young Scientists program that identifies and prepares students in the district's predominately minority schools for Kealing Magnet Program. In one elementary, a science teacher from Kealing works one period every other day with the grade 6 teachers.   At LBJ High School, the class of 1999 (120 students) included: 14 National Merit Scholars, 17 National Merit Semifinalists, 17 National Merit Commended Scholars, 2 National Achievement Scholarships for Outstanding Negro Students and 5 National Hispanic Scholarships. The Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) was administered to 120 students. The average verbal score was 613, and the average mathematics score was 636. At Kealing Junior High, approximately 60 students received state recognition in the Duke Talent Search.   COMMENDATION   Through the three magnet schools, AISD has done an outstanding job providing opportunities for students to explore in depth, advanced, challenging curricula in science, mathematics, technology and liberal arts.   FINDING    AISD's magnet program is challenging and exemplary, and many parents have urged the district to expand magnet programs to include other curricula. Seventy-two percent of community members responding to a survey said AISD should expand its magnet school offerings to include additional programs like engineering and fine arts. Community members also said that they would like the district's high school magnet programs to have their own campus.   AISD magnet programs function as a ""school within a school,"" with one segment of the student body enrolled in the magnet program. Interviews with program directors, teachers, principals and community members demonstrate an uncertainty over whether the original intended effect of housing magnet programs in campuses that educate high percentages of economically disadvantaged students helps the host school, or if they create an antagonistic, resentful relationship between magnet and non-magnet student and teacher groups.   AISD's first magnet program, the Science Academy at LBJ High School, was established in 1985 with magnet directors reporting directly to the assistant superintendent for Secondary Education. The original intent was to create a program that would have sufficient autonomy to allow program directors to develop innovative instructional programs. When the Liberal Arts program was established in Johnston High School in 1987, magnet directors began reporting to the school principal. Magnet program directors still report directly to the school principal, although area superintendents also routinely call upon them. Directors said that many times they are reporting to two people, and that they are not evaluated regularly, or by the same person from year to year.   In Kealing Junior High School, magnet students make up two-thirds of the school. In this case, the magnet director is responsible for two-thirds of the school, yet must report to the school principal. Several issues that should be left up to the magnet director's discretion, like budget decisions, teacher evaluations and when to hire teachers, must be approved by the school principal. Magnet directors and principals said their relationship is strained, and at times has led to resentment and distrust. Magnet directors are often called on to help the school principal perform duties that are completely unrelated to their jobs as magnet program directors.   Reagan High School's facilities have been significantly underused for years and operate at only 59 percent capacity. Underused facilities are costly, wasteful, and a drain on a district's resources. Reagan High School, located near the intersection of Interstate 35 and US Highway 290 in Austin's preferred growth corridor, is centrally located and accessible from surrounding Central Texas communities. The facility has both large permanent classroom capacity and ample parking.   Kealing Middle School, with a capacity of 1,176 students, has a 1999-2000 enrollment of 958, with approximately 600 magnet students. The district's magnet school at Kealing serves only 7th and 8th grade students; prospective magnet students completing elementary school must attend 6th grade at another campus before enrolling at Kealing. The Kealing magnet director and parents of magnet students agree that the Kealing magnet program needs to be open to 6th graders. Magnet directors and community members also said that middle school magnet offerings should be expanded and that magnet schools need their own campuses.   Recommendation 35:   Locate a new Regional Magnet Campus at the Reagan High School and make Kealing Middle School a magnet-only campus for grades six through eight.      The Science Academy at LBJ High School and the Liberal Arts Academy at Johnston High School should be relocated to the Reagan campus. Reagan High School would become a Regional Magnet Campus, open to students from AISD and other Central Texas school districts.   The Regional Magnet Campus should offer advanced programs in science and liberal arts, develop new magnet programs such as a fine arts academy, and establish a technology academy for students who wish to develop the skills that will make them employable in the Austin economy. The district should bring together representatives from Austin's high tech, business, and higher education communities to provide resources toward making the Reagan Regional Magnet Campus the educational crown jewel of Central Texas.   The magnet schools at LBJ and Johnston high schools currently serve 1,100 students (774 in the Science Academy and 326 in the Liberal Arts Academy). The capacity of Reagan High School means that it initially could accommodate at least 1,500 magnet students while also housing AISD central administrative staff. (TSPR recommends that AISD relocate its central office to the Reagan High School Facility. See Chapter 1, District Organization and Management.)   Creating an AISD Middle School Magnet Campus will enable the district to better meet the needs of its qualified middle school magnet students.  Kealing Middle School should be a magnet-only campus for grades six through eight with expanded magnet program offerings.   IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE       1.   Superintendent designates an area superintendent to whom magnet directors will report.        June 2000       2. The superintendent directs the deputy superintendents to develop a plan for converting Reagan High School into a Regional Magnet Campus, housing a Science Academy, a Liberal Arts Academy and a Technology Academy and for converting Kealing Middle School into the district's Middle School Magnet Campus.        July 2000       3. The superintendent and the executive cabinet redraw attendance zones so that students who would currently track to Reagan High School and Kealing Middle School will track to other high schools and middle schools.        March 2001       4. The superintendent presents the magnet campus plan and redrawn attendance zones to the board for approval.        August 2001       5. The board approves the plan.        September 2001 and Ongoing          FISCAL IMPACT    This recommendation can be implemented with existing staff and facilities. Magnet staff will follow students to the new Reagan Magnet at an estimated cost of $300,000 relocation and renovation expenses for the Science Academy and $200,000 for the Liberal Arts Academy. Transportation costs should not change significantly as students will need to be transported to two instead of three district magnet campuses.        Recommendation      2000-01      2001-02      2002-03      2003-04      2004-05       Locate a new Regional Magnet Campus at the Reagan High School facility and make Kealing Middle School a magnet-only campus for grades six through eight.      $0      $0     ($500,000)      $0      $0          FINDING    AISD does not regularly report student information separately, such as TAAS and ITBS scores or the percentage of students taking the SAT, for students enrolled in magnet programs and for students enrolled in the regular program on the same campus. If this information is available at the district office, it is not fully disseminated to parents or the community at large.   In interviews and focus groups, teachers, principals, parents and community members said that without this information, the real performance of non-magnet students is masked. TEA does not require districts to provide magnet vs. non-magnet program information, and accountability ratings do not reflect magnet program participation. Teachers, principals and parents said that schools that host magnet programs would be seriously at-risk of receiving a low-performance accountability rating if the magnet programs were not housed at these schools.   Exhibit 2-30  shows the percentage of students attending magnet schools and the percentage of students not attending magnet schools who passed the TAAS in 1996-97 and 1998-99. The data show that there is a large performance gap between students at magnet schools and students at non-magnet schools. For non-magnet students, less than 50 percent passed the mathematics test, except for Kealing Junior High School in 1998-99.  Exhibits 2-31, 2-32  and  2-33  present TAAS, math, reading and writing scores for 1998-99.

The Austin Magnet Committee Report (December 1998), said that there are concerns that the current magnet model (school-within-a-school) has a ""negative impact on the delivery of effective curricula to the non-magnet students in the host schools.""   The committee report states, ""The current magnet model serves to mask the academic difficulties of non-magnet students."" Using accountability standards for the 1998-99 school year, TAAS scores for these schools reinforce these concerns. The committee believes that disclosing the performance of non-magnet students would bring attention and possible state and federal financial resources to help improve the performance of non-magnet students at these campuses.   Recommendation 36:   Evaluate the educational and economic impact of magnet programs on host campuses.    Use comparative magnet/non-magnet test scores, course selection and other indicators to identify and focus services on students in host schools who are not succeeding academically.   To address all students' needs, school and district staff must have information that provides information on the performance of all students in a school. Teachers, campus administrators, parents and community members should have access to this information to make appropriate instructional decisions.   IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE       1.   The superintendent directs the appropriate departments to temporarily postpone opening a third magnet campus at Fulmore Middle School until findings and recommendations from an evaluation can be assessed.        May 2000       2. Magnet directors, campus principals and district data management staff coordinate efforts and provide comparative data for schools that host magnet programs. Data will include for each school: ITBS scores, TAAS scores, SAT participation and scores, grade point averages and dropout and attendance rates.        June 2000  Ongoing       3. The superintendent directs the appropriate departments to identify federal and state funds that current magnet schools would receive if magnet programs were housed elsewhere.        June 2000       4. The director of the Department of Transportation determines costs of providing transportation for students to one versus two campuses.        June 2000       5. The assistant director of the Office of Program Evaluation develops and implements strategies to assess the benefit of hosting magnet programs on campuses with specific socio-economic characteristics.        June - November 2000       6. Campus principals make data available to all parents in the annual school performance report.        August 2000       7. Principals and teachers use data to address specific student performance issues and develop strategies to include in campus improvement plans.        August 2000       8. Staff in the Office of Program Evaluation identify the positive and negative impact of AISD'S program placement policy.        December 2000       9. The superintendent directs the appropriate departments to implement recommendations on optimal placement for magnet programs.        February 2001          FISCAL IMPACT    This recommendation can be implemented with existing resources.   FINDING    There is no clear evidence that the district's approach for teaching gifted and talented children is effective. Texas state law requires all school districts to identify and provide services for gifted and talented students. In 1990, the State Board of Education (SBOE) adopted the  Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted and Talented Students.  This plan is a guide on how to meet the law's requirements. In 1996, the State Board of Education (SBOE) updated the plan to incorporate Texas Education Code Section 29.123 requirements. The updated plan forms the basis of program accountability for state-mandated services for gifted and talented students.   AISD's Office of Advanced Academic Services defines gifted and talented students as students who are advanced intellectually and academically. Their gifts may be apparent in one or more subjects, like English, math, science and social studies, or in their ability to learn rapidly.   In many cases, a regular or honors curriculum cannot meet the needs of gifted and talented students. According to the coordinator of Advanced Academic Services, the district does not meet the program standards recommended in the State Plan. Compliance varies from school to school. Some principals could describe the process of gifted and talented student identification and list the services provided for these students. Others, however, said there was no effort made to provide services for these students. Several principals, teachers and central administration staff said AISD's gifted and talented educational program was weak and in many instances non-existent.   Bilingual teachers and district administrators said there are no specific efforts to identify gifted bilingual education students. Campus and district staff said that even though it is recommended in the State Plan, there is no identification process for science and social studies; gifted students in those core subjects are not identified. Interviews with campus teachers involved in gifted education and with members of the Austin Association of Gifted and Talented Education indicated that, while the Office of Advanced Academic Services' responsibilities include coordinating several programs for high achieving students, the office does not have adequate resources to fulfill its responsibilities. Overall, AISD is not complying with the state plan for gifted and talented students.   State law requires teachers of gifted and talented students to receive 30 hours of instruction in teaching gifted and talented students.  The format in which gifted and talented services are delivered to students is a campus decision. All teachers in the district are encouraged to receive training. Training all teachers, with the current district turnover rate, however, is a difficult task. Even if a teacher is trained, that teacher may or may not be teaching gifted children.  Teachers told TSPR that most do not have enough time to provide appropriate services to gifted students. Although training may improve a teacher's instructional methods, it does not ensure that properly trained teachers will be teaching gifted students.   Program staff, parents and community association members noted that AISD does not have a district-level accountability system in place for assessing the quality of the gifted and talented program. Staff and parents said that the district is now implementing its own gifted and talented plan, and that this plan is still in draft form. The agenda published for the Office of Program Evaluation for the 1999-2000 school year, however, does not include any plans for evaluating gifted and talented education in this district. The assistant director of the Department of Accountability said that the gifted and talented educational program has not been evaluated in at least five years.   Recommendation 37:   Implement the  Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted and Talented Students .   IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE       1.   The Office of Program Evaluation and the Office of Academic Studies evaluate the effectiveness of the district's gifted and talented education program.        August 2000 -February 2001       2. The Office of Advanced Academic Services determines if every campus in the district is implementing the recommendations in the  Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted and Talented Students .      January 2001       3. The Office of Advanced Academic Services develops measures to ensure that every campus follows the State Plan.        March 2001- August 2001       4. The Office of Advanced Academic Services uses the State Plan to develop an accountability system for gifted and talented programs in AISD.         March 2001 -December 2001          FISCAL IMPACT    This recommendation can be implemented with existing resources.   FINDING    Several district and campus-level staff, in addition to members of the Austin Area Association of Gifted and Talented Education said how the district manages its information on its gifted and talented education program does not help teachers and principals to identify gifted and talented students on their own campuses. Most high school teachers do not know who their gifted students are. One principal, for instance, said, ""We don't know if anything is accurate...Sally may be identified as gifted and talented on three different campuses."" Another high school principal said, ""I cannot obtain a list of students on my campus that are gifted and talented; if it is available, it is extremely difficult to obtain.""   The assistant director of the Office of Research and Evaluation said that AISD does not have a code in the student master file that allows administrative staff to track gifted students. Although the data may be available, it is in different files and not easily accessible. The current information system does not provide administrators with information to improve services for gifted students, nor does it help in the decision-making process.

As shown in  Exhibit 2-34 , compared to the peer districts, AISD had the second highest number of students identified as gifted, yet the number and percentage of teachers assigned to gifted programs was the lowest. This number, however, does not accurately represent the number of teachers teaching gifted students in AISD.   The interim coordinator for Advanced Academic Services said that the number of teachers reported in the AEIS report is incorrect. She said that for the 1999-2000 school year, the correct number of certified gifted and talented teachers is 1,642. This number is significantly higher than the number of teachers reported in the AEIS reports for the peer districts. Both the interim coordinator for Advanced Academic Services, and an administrative assistant in TEA's Office of Advanced Academic Services said that the number of teachers reported in the AEIS report could vary considerably depending on the type of instructional delivery.   In AISD, gifted instruction is provided through the regular classroom, and because all teachers are encouraged to become certified, it is expected that the number of certified gifted teachers would be high. This number, however, does not provide any information on how much time regular classroom gifted and talented certified teachers allocate to gifted and talented instruction.   Recommendation 38:   Establish a system to accurately identify, track and report the number of gifted students and certified gifted and talented teachers involved in teaching gifted students.   IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE       1.   The Office of Academic Studies coordinates with the district data management system staff to add a field to the student database so gifted students are identified and the information is accessible to approved campus staff.        August 2000 -February 2001       2. Review number and percentage of teachers allocated to gifted and talented education reported to TEA and report a number that accurately reflects the number of teachers in gifted and talented education.        August 2000 -February 2001          FISCAL IMPACT    This recommendation can be implemented with existing resources.   FINDING      In AISD, there is no evidence how gifted and talented funds are used to meet the needs of gifted students. The coordinator of Advanced Academic Services and members of the Austin Area Gifted and Talented Education Association said that is impossible to track expenses for gifted education, in part, because the budget process does not include line-item descriptions of allocations for the gifted. Because of this problem, it is not known if the expenditures for gifted and talented education indicated in the AEIS reports are correct.

Exhibit 2-35  shows AISD's expenditures for gifted and talented education. For the 1998-99 school year, AISD ranked second to last among its peer districts on spending for gifted and talented education. Peer districts with similar numbers of identified gifted and talented students (more than 5,000) spent significantly more on gifted education. Budget allocations for gifted and talented education comprised 0.2 percent of the budgeted expenditures, also amongst the lowest compared to the peer districts. Compared to the peer districts, AISD ranked lowest in the per student expenditures for gifted education.   According to TEA's Division of Advanced Academic Services, AISD received approximately $1 million in state Gifted and Talented funds for the 1998-99; and for 1999-2000, according to TEA's Division of State Funding, the district received $1,161,118. According to the AEIS report, AISD budgeted less than half of the funds that it received for gifted and talented education.   The district has known about this reporting problem since at least 1996. To remedy this problem, the district's Comprehensive Plan (preliminary recommendations, April 19, 1996) states that ""Beginning in 1996-97 and annually thereafter, the AISD administration will produce an annual report of the distribution of all funds targeted for gifted and talented education which clearly identifies how these funds were allocated for expenditure."" The annual report has not been produced. Members of the Austin Area Gifted and Talented Association have requested copies of this report, but the district has not provided the association with the report.   Recommendation 39:   Annually report the distribution of funds allocated to gifted and talented education.   IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE       1.   The Budget Director and staff in the Office of Advanced Academic Services produce an annual report showing how all funds targeted for gifted and talented education were actually spent.        May 2001          FISCAL IMPACT      This recommendation can be implemented with existing resources.   FINDING    AISD requires teachers to modify the regular curriculum to meet the individual needs of each gifted student. The coordinator for Advanced Academic Services said that AISD does not have a grade-level, appropriate curriculum for gifted and talented education. Several parents expressed concern over the quality of the instruction that was considered gifted and talented. Likewise, several teachers expressed concern about their ability to meet their students' needs. Members of the PTA Council said there should be a defined gifted and talented program curriculum for different subjects and for each grade. They stressed this curriculum or lack thereof should not depend on the school or the teacher.   Recommendation 40:   Develop gifted and talented curriculum guides by grade level and content.      This will require the district to extend the contracts of four gifted and talented certified teachers during the summer months for four years to complete this task.   IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE       1.   The Department of Human Resources extends the contracts of four gifted and talented certified teachers, two for the elementary grades and two for secondary level.        May 2000 -  May 2002       2. The Office of Advanced Academic Services works with these teachers to develop gifted and talented curriculum guides for every grade level and every content area.        June 2000-August 2002         3. The Office of Advanced Academic Services distributes curriculum guides.        August 2000- August 2002          4.

GX070-07-8918915	"Profiles of Successful Schoolwide Programs - December 1998     A r c h i v e d  I n f o r m a t i o n     Secondary Schools   Achieving a World-Class Standard  in a Culturally Diverse Community   Gompers Secondary School Center for  Science,  Mathematics, and Computer Technology Magnet   San Diego City Schools · San Diego, California   OVERVIEW    When Gompers Secondary School Center for Science, Mathematics, and Computer Technology Magnet began its schoolwide program in 1995, it unified its seventh- through twelfth-grade program components into a single plan with the same ambitious vision for all students. ""Our vision is to educate all of our students with a challenging world-class curriculum in a safe, culturally diverse setting,"" stated Gompers Principal Marie Thornton. ""To do this, we have created a program that meets every student's needs.""  Gompers' academic program, a citywide magnet offering science, mathematics, and computer technology, is consistent with the demanding academic standards and other reforms mandated by the San Diego City Schools. Students participate in individually tailored academic programs, which are coordinated by one of five counselors. The same standards—with the appropriate modifications—apply for students with disabilities and for students who speak limited English. Honors courses and advanced placement classes are available to all students who meet the academic requirements.  The school's budget combines general state and local funds with resources from four ESEA programs—Title I  Eisenhower Professional Development, Safe and Drug-Free Schools, and Innovative Education Program Strategies—as well as from the Perkins Program, the National Science Foundation's Urban Systemic Initiative, a grant from the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, Gifted and Talented Education (GATE), and Healthy Start.        Gompers serves a multicultural, districtwide population of students, half of whom are from homes with a primary language other than English.             Grade Levels  7-12       Number of Students  (1997-98)  1,586         Schoolwide Since  1992-93       Racial/Ethnic Composition     36%   Hispanic   35%   African American   15%   Indo-Chinese   10%   White   3%    Other           VISION, LEADERSHIP, AND DECISION MAKING  Gompers serves students from 19 racial and ethnic groups, among them Hispanic, African American, Laotian, white, Somali, Japanese, and Chinese. Communitywide commitment transformed Gompers from a fragmented, low-achieving school to a cohesive schoolwide family of high- achievers, integrating its magnet program with a schoolwide philosophy.   Shared decisionmaking at Gompers occurs through several oversight structures. Department chairs and members of the classified staff head key committees, such as the Bilingual Advisory Committee and School Site Council. Proposals for new programs or activities move through committees, where members—including parents—debate ideas and flesh out concepts before sending the proposals to the faculty or Governance Team. The 10-member Governance Team finalizes committee decisions, which are then sent to either the principal's Administrative Council, three in-school decision-making bodies, or parents for approval. According to Dr. Thornton, ""Most of the time we use consensus, but when we're not quite sure if we have consensus we take a vote—sometimes one that includes a secret ballot.""      STUDENT PERFORMANCE RESULTS    To graduate from high school, students complete 44 credits, meet a citizenship standard, participate in community service, achieve a minimum 2.0 grade point average, and complete satisfactorily a comprehensive senior portfolio and exhibitions scored by school and community evaluators.   Gompers requires students to meet standards that exceed those of the district. It insists that students complete the district's 44-credit course requirements and its good citizenship standard, but then adds that students must earn a minimum 2.0 grade point average. Students must have a 2.5 grade point average and satisfactory citizenship to represent the school in off-campus activities. There is ""zero tolerance"" of truancies and uncleared absences. In addition to reviewing test scores, counselors regularly monitor each student's progress in content areas. Staff use in-class assessments and other performance data to continually align curricula with expected student performance results. The annual School Accountability Report Card informs Gompers staff and parents about students' progress on district and school goals.   Each year, the district and the school administer several measures of performance. The abbreviated Stanford Achievement Test (SAT) documents academic progress in basic reading, mathematics, language, and  spelling. Students in Spanish bilingual classes take the  Aprenda , Stanford's Spanish-language achievement test that parallels the SAT. The district also reports twelfth-grade students' results on the Scholastic Assessment Test. Other performance indicators include retention, dropout, and suspension rates, and the percent of students who meet university entrance requirements.     In 1997, 96% of graduating seniors pursued postsecondary educational opportunities; 51% of these  students enrolled in four-year colleges.   Gompers' 1996 and 1997 assessment results show steady progress in all subject areas and across all grades. Seventh-graders score well below nationally standardized norms when they enter Gompers; but, by the time they reach high school, more than half of its students will achieve at the national mean in reading, language arts, and mathematics. In 1996, 95 percent of graduating seniors pursued postsecondary education, with 55 percent enrolling in four-year colleges and 40 percent enrolling in two-year colleges. In 1997, those statistics were 51 percent and 45, respectively, with 96 percent of seniors pursuing postsecondary education. Graduates attend the most selective colleges, universities, and military academies in the nation, including Cornell, Stanford, Syracuse, Spelman, University of Chicago, and Fisk. In 1997, Gompers selected eight top students as valedictorians, and that year's graduating class received more than $400,000 in scholarships and grants.      RESEARCH-BASED REFORM STRATEGIES    From 8:20am to 8:40am the campus is quiet; everyone is reading.   Because many students who enter Gompers' seventh grade read at low levels, the staff initiated a schoolwide focus on literacy. According to Dr. Thornton, one of Gompers' most effective strategies for closing the reading achievement gap has been daily, sustained silent reading, which occurs from 8:20 am to 8:40 am. ""The campus is quiet. Everyone is reading. By encouraging students to read materials of interest and at their independent reading level, they get to the point where they enjoy reading. Once students enjoy it, success builds upon success,"" she said.   Gompers instituted an array of strategies to close the academic achievement gap, bolster students' confidence, and prepare them for a rigorous high school program. Entering seventh-graders begin their academic career at Gompers at a six-week camp. There they take mini-courses in English, science, mathematics, social studies, and computer applications, and learn about the school's expectations for homework, note taking, and keeping up with daily assignments. Enrollment is voluntary, but almost half the entering class attend the minicourses.     Seventh- and eighth-grade students receive intensive preparation for a demanding high school curriculum.    Students with weak literacy or numeracy skills enroll in double sessions of English or mathematics during their middle school years. These classes are taught by teachers specially trained to teach students the prerequisite skills they need to excel in the seventh- and eighth-grade English and mathematics programs. A highly skilled seventh-grade academic team prepares students for the school's high standards through a curriculum that integrates science, computers, social studies, mathematics, and English. Teachers use problem solving, critical thinking, and extended assignments and exhibitions to advance students' learning. Each classroom has access to the World Wide Web for research. Gompers is one of seven schools nationally that participates in NASA's KidSat. This program connects Gompers seventh-graders through an Internet hookup to the Student Mission Center, where they can meet astronauts and conduct online experiments with them.     There is ""zero tolerance"" for truancy or uncleared absences.   Nine special education teachers, three of whom are resource specialists, monitor the progress of students with disabilities as specified in their IEPs. These specialists collaborate with general education teachers. Entering students who do not speak English proficiently may take bilingual academic classes to keep up with content requirements while also developing the English-language skills needed to succeed in higher grades.     All Gompers' high school students take four years of English, four years of mathematics, two years of a foreign language, three years of social sciences, and four years of laboratory science.    Gompers high school students must take four years of English, four years of mathematics, two years of a foreign language, three years of social sciences, and four years of laboratory science. Up-to-date equipment and resources—including a ""sun station"" that powers an eight-inch telescope in the school's outdoor lab, a state-of-the-art computer network with 64 terminals, and a laser/holography apparatus—support advanced science, mathematics, and computer courses. Technology courses introduce students to robotics, electronics, computer graphics, desktop publishing, and computer-aided drafting and architecture; these courses also enhance school-to-work transitions. Students can combine computer applications courses with their business interests, and learn the language of computer data structures in courses on digital electronics. ""The thing I try to do is have the students with the greatest needs take as many challenging classes as they can,"" Dr. Thornton explained. Advanced mathematics, science, and social studies courses taught by faculty from nearby universities develop students' skills in research, experimentation, and use of technical equipment. The high school offers seven foreign languages. Four of the languages are introduced in an exploratory seventh-grade language course that teaches six weeks each of French, German, Japanese, and Russian language art and culture to help students decide which language they would like to continue studying in high school.     In-school programs and clubs reinforce the expectations to achieve and they provide students with a safety net for ensuring success.   A motivational program, Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID), lays the groundwork for students to meet the school's high expectations. An honor roll system recognizes students at all ranges of the academic continuum. The highest recognition, the Principal's Honor Roll, requires a minimum 4.0 grade point average; for students who achieve between the 2.0 and 2.9 grade point levels, the ""It's O.K. To Be Smart"" Honor Roll confers status if students have shown a willingness to challenge themselves. Satisfactory citizenship is a prerequisite for all honor roll students.     Every senior takes either the ACT or the SAT in preparation for postsecondary education.   Programs and clubs reinforce the school's expectations for achievement and provide a safety net for students. A mathematics, engineering, and science achievement program—funded by the National Science Foundation, the state of California, and private donations—encourages nonwhite students to study for careers in science and mathematics. The faculty collaborates with mathematics and science scholars at San Diego State University to raise students' awareness of study options in the hard sciences and to create opportunities for high school students to participate in mathematics, science, and computer activities, experiments, and performance demonstrations. Other faculty offer as many as 35 clubs and programs that appeal to students' interests, including academics, athletics, service, journalism, theater, student government, and technology. High school students interested in school-to-work opportunities may enroll in computer application and business courses that help prepare them for the world of work.      PROFESSIONAL LEARNING COMMUNITY    All of Gompers' professional staff are credentialed in their primary teaching fields; beginning teachers receive help from experienced mentors; parents participate with the faculty in staff development exercises.    Professional development is continuous for all faculty, administrative staff, and others affiliated with the school. Teachers present on-site workshops for their colleagues and regularly share new strategies, techniques, and effective problem-based instruction with professionals from other schools. Beginning teachers in the New Teacher Induction Program visit classrooms to observe other teachers and attend professional growth classes. Each month, mentor teachers observe new teachers and advise them on strengthening their use of curricula, instructional methods, and classroom management techniques. All of Gompers' professional staff are credentialed in their primary teaching fields.   The staff participates annually in at least eight days of professional development that includes workshops on content and performance standards, conflict resolution, and curriculum strategies. Continuing mentoring and collaboration give teachers the opportunity to implement their developing strategies in the classroom. Grant monies from the state legislature help send staff to regional and national conferences. Teaching assistants also receive periodic training in the methods used in classrooms by teachers. Part of the schoolwide budget is set aside to encourage parents to participate in conferences, professional development activities, and staff meetings. ""We try to run an open house where parents are welcome to participate in anything going on campus,"" said Dr. Thornton.      PARENT AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS   Gompers embraces the whole community in its educational effort. At the beginning of the school year, teachers visit the homes, workplaces, and religious institutions of their students and families. A letter to parents makes clear the important role that parents play in students' academic success. A supplement to the San Diego student handbook welcomes families and students, tells parents about homework requirements, lists the materials students must have on hand every day, and describes the dress code. It also discusses parents' responsibilities in monitoring their children's progress toward the school's ambitious academic curriculum.   ""Our diversity is our strength,"" Dr. Thornton asserts proudly. Through an active human and race relations program, students and teachers participate in activities and seminars that develop sensitivity toward the school's many cultures and traditions. In collaboration with various national organizations and the district's integration services office, 75 students, 15 teachers, and various other staff members spent four days at Camp Minitown in the Palamar Mountains. The program fosters interpersonal relationships by teaching students to understand diversity and commonality across cultures, to challenge the stereotypes they hold, and, in doing so, to develop a respect for other cultures and ethnic groups. A teacher and a classroom aide, who completed the training, teach a course on race and human relations at Gompers.   Parent committees and an active community advisory council are essential components of the school's decision-making structure. Professionals from San Diego State University, the University of California at San Diego, and the public library advise and contribute to planning and curriculum development. Individuals from these groups also consult on financial and organizational matters and arrange private tutoring, mentors, tours, workshops, paid summer laboratory internships, and other educational opportunities for students. In addition, one business partner provides $2,000 for students to participate in competitions, another business partner funds the school's outdoor science lab, and a local science museum provides opportunities for students to preview exhibits.     Diversity is Gompers' strength. To understand that diversity, teachers visit the homes, workplaces, and religious institutions of their students and families at the beginning of the school year.   A district-sponsored parent center located on Gompers' campus provides parenting classes, ESL classes, GED preparation, and cultural awareness for self-sufficiency classes. The center attracts more than 500 parents annually. Gompers' own parent center welcomes more than 1,800 parents annually to participate in various Gompers programs, including parent days at the school, school spirit activities, and senior class parent meetings. In October 1997, more than 300 members of the Gompers community attended the grand opening of the Lincoln/Gompers Cluster Family Service Center and health fair. Staffed by a psychologist and social workers from a coalition of community-based agencies, the center gives students and their families on-campus access to health services, counseling, and early childhood programs. A Healthy Start planning grant from the California legislature promises to expand health services for students and families.      SUSTAINING CHANGE   Encouraging teachers' ideas and initiatives is one of Gompers' primary strategies for ensuring that teachers are full partners in decisionmaking. When implementing the school's new ideas and programs, Dr. Thornton delegates as much responsibility as possible to staff leaders. ""So much evolves from our teachers that [it is not difficult] to keep them going,"" said Dr. Thornton. Major teacher-led initiatives include the AVID program, KidSat, and the Wildcat Cubs-MESH (Mathematics, English, Science, History) program.     Encouraging teachers' ideas and initiatives ensures that Gompers' teachers are full partners in decisionmaking.    Like many urban schools, Gompers is located in a neighborhood troubled with gang problems, substance abuse, low incomes, and crime. Still, according to the school's annual progress report, 92 percent of Gompers' parents say they feel safe sending their children to Gompers. One reason, Dr. Thornton observed, is that faculty have ""made curriculum [improvements], increased expectations of students, staff, parents, and community and increased the demands on our human and financial resources. Throughout this [process]...the staff continues to work tirelessly in helping our students excel and achieve.""   -###-           [ Preparing Students for Real-World Experiences ]             [ Addresses for Profiled Schools ]"

GX070-09-9869513	"Profiles of Successful Schoolwide Programs - December 1998     A r c h i v e d  I n f o r m a t i o n     Elementary Schools   A Standards-Based, Arts-Integrated  Schoolwide Curriculum   Worcester Arts Magnet School   Worcester Public Schools · Worcester, Massachusetts   OVERVIEW   Reflecting on her initial interest in the schoolwide concept, principal Margaret Venditti said, ""We were not only becoming a schoolwide, but we were designing a citywide magnet at the same time. The two efforts blended together. Suddenly, we [had the flexibility to] think about how to make the whole school a better place for learning.""  The state's ambitious academic program, defined in curriculum frameworks for every academic subject, is the focus of education at Worcester Arts. According to Venditti, the arts are the ""motivational tools and instruments with which to broaden children's understanding, skill, and knowledge."" All students, not just those targeted by a specific program, use a host of artistic experiences to achieve the state's high standards.  Worcester Arts Magnet combines federal Title I, Bilingual Education Act, and special education funds with state and local funding resources and grant awards earned competitively from numerous state and local organizations.        Located in a valley between two low-income housing communities, Worcester Arts serves students from the neighborhood and throughout the city.             Grade Levels  PreK-6       Number of Students  (1997-98)  453         Schoolwide Since  1992-93       Racial/Ethnic Composition     50%   White   44%   Hispanic   6%   African American           VISION, LEADERSHIP, AND DECISION MAKING    The Worcester Arts program offers a balanced education for the whole child, intellectually, aesthetically, and linguistically.      A small group of school faculty, parents, and district personnel saw the promise of creating an arts magnet at Worcester. ""It was the best way to bring this school back to life,"" Venditti recalls. So ""we met and met and met,"" bringing in district and state consultants and specialists when needed to help create the kind of program the planning team envisioned. Then-Chapter I coordinator, John Corcoran, also recognized the benefits of the schoolwide program, and he worked with the design team as it hammered out its plan, a process that continued for a year. Team members distributed newsletters to parents and faculty, surveyed the parents in both Spanish and English, and urged the community to become involved. They were committed to developing a ""balanced education for the whole child, intellectually, aesthetically, and linguistically,"" using a full-inclusion model that opened learning opportunities to all children. The school continues to closely monitor assessment results and ""checks the pulse of the community regularly;"" Venditti reports they are always asking: ""Are we meeting the goals of various programs? Are we accomplishing improvement goals for students?""   A fluid steering committee works under the principal's direction to keep the Worcester Arts program running smoothly. This is a ""loose group"" of teachers and administrators, says Venditti. ""We can deal with anything, discipline, curriculum, [teachers' ideas and concerns]....It's an idea forum...a continuing needs assessment team ranging from 20 to 25 people. The size depends on the topic,"" she explains. There is also an elected body, the School Governance Council, which is composed of parents and faculty, that meets monthly to consider schoolwide issues, including budgets, school improvement matters, and student activities.     Through the School Governance Council and other school committees, teachers and parents regularly advise the principal on the budget, school improvement, and student achievement.     Teachers and parents form a powerful partnership at Worcester Arts Magnet. In 1996-97, 18 committees—each comprising a mix of teachers, support staff, administrators, and parents—undertook a self-study to attain accreditation from the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. Over the course of a full year, the committees prepared a detailed status report about the school and reasserted the school's commitment to its unique integrated arts and academic program. According to the school's mission statement: ""Our faculty strives to...integrate the arts in everyday lessons [because] they help students tap into their creative strengths, raising their self-esteem and enabling them to experience both academic and artistic success.""      STUDENT PERFORMANCE RESULTS    For 1996-97, Worcester Arts Magnet achieved the state's sixth-highest relative gain in state assessment scores.    ""The term 'accountability' has hit home,"" principal Venditti reports. ""The ownership is really there. We are always asking, 'How can we prove we're successful?"" Teachers use portfolios, scored against a teacher-student developed rubric, combined with their own observations, to guide everyday instruction. In addition to standardized assessment scores, every student receives quarterly and interim report cards, twice yearly arts progress reports, and a teacher-designed checklist that keeps parents informed about students' behavior and academic progress.  The accountability orientation has so increased the faculty's commitment to using test results that, in 1996, Worcester Arts Magnet students achieved the state's sixth-highest relative gain on the Massachusetts Educational Assessment Program. Academic progress continues to grow in all other tested content areas as well. Each year, students at every grade level take a commercially developed test: the Stanford Achievement Test, the Iowa Reading Test, the Metropolitan Achievement Tests, or the new Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System. All bilingual students take the Ideal Proficiency Test and the Language Assessment Scale.  The central office prepares disaggregated test reports annually, and grade-level teaching teams scrutinize the results in light of students' portfolios and teachers' observations of student progress in their classrooms. Faculty members use these periodic analyses to redirect the academic program.  Parents receive a copy of all test results and a district-developed assessment information handbook. At periodic parent and teacher meetings on assessment, the curriculum specialist interprets the overall school and individual student's test results and helps parents understand how the school uses them on behalf of students.      RESEARCH-BASED REFORM STRATEGIES   The Worcester Arts curriculum is a faculty-designed framework of concepts and teaching processes that is oriented toward encouraging children's critical thinking, questioning, and problem solving by fully integrating the arts. These unifying principlesbased on state and national curriculum standardsare the basis of specific grade-level objectives that structure the schoolwide curriculum. Under the direction of the full-time curriculum specialist, research-based teaching strategies complement the approaches already in use. Curriculum writing teams periodically reconvene to determine whether program modifications are necessary based on the most recent student achievement results and observations from colleagues and parents.   Literacy is at the heart of the schoolwide program at Worcester Arts Magnet. Students learn to read using a ""balanced"" language arts program that teaches phonics, literature, and writing as a way for students to  better understand their world. The reading program also involves learning with parents and fellow students, poetry writing and reading, journal writing, performing, listening to stories on tapes, making charts, corresponding with pen pals, and writing and illustrating original stories. The arts teachers, along with the curriculum specialists and other support personnel, join regular classroom teachers during reading instruction so that instructional groups are as small as possible. Literacy is taught across the content areas when students study native cultures in social studies or promote a healthy community environment through their science program. Reading Recovery is available to lower-grade students who are not keeping up with their peers; a specialist in the Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) Program supports readers at risk in the third and fourth grades. A creative writing specialist visits each classroom for 50 minutes a week as part of the arts block.     Curriculum writing teams periodically reconvene to determine whether program modifications are  necessary based on the most recent student achievement results and observationsfrom colleagues and parents.    Learning occurs actively at Worcester Arts. As early as preschool, students prepare performances and exhibitions and display their work in classrooms and in hallways throughout the school. Each third- through sixth-grade student produces a research project or an exhibit and discusses it at the annual Projects Fair. Some students also serve as classroom ""facilitators"" in lower-grade classrooms. As part of the ""Drop Everything and Read in School Today"" program, teachers pair ""emerging readers"" with more experienced, upper-grade readers to help struggling students improve underdeveloped reading skills.   Although Howard Gardner's research on multiple intelligences is the intellectual foundation for arts-integrated instruction at Worcester Arts, other research-based programs complement the core curriculum. After reviewing student portfolios, teachers decided that students were adept at rote mathematics but appeared to be missing broader concepts. They adopted the Number Worlds program, an interactive, hands-on mathematics program that develops mathematical skills by letting students use manipulative tools to build on their spontaneous thinking about numbers. Dimensions of Learning and the Higher-Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) Laboratory promote problem-centered teaching and learning and support students who require more direct lessons on how to use their analytical thinking more effectively.     Learning occurs actively at Worcester Arts. Beginning in preschool, students share ""expeditions"" with one another and with parents through performances or through displays in classrooms and throughout the school's hallways. Both parents and students become involved in reading and writing poetry, journal writing, and corresponding with pen pals through the Internet.     The physical environment is the organizing theme for the science curriculum. Students study recycling as the content theme but they apply scientific concepts through the arts program. Some examples of activities that students undertake in science include recycling materials to design and build a robot, writing poetry about recycling and setting poems to music, and sharing what they learn about the environment in their projects, their poetry, and their music. In the upper grades, students use Science Through Experimental Procedures to conduct experiments and keep journals detailing what they learn each day.   Each grade level is fully staffed with certified teachers, supported by certified bilingual and special education teachers and classroom assistants. All teachers co-teach to reduce pupil-to-teacher ratios. Worcester Arts supports a growing population of Spanish-speaking students with ESL and bilingual classes. To help non-English-speakers achieve the same high standards as other students, the bilingual program coordinates its learning objectives, scope and sequence charts, and lesson plans with the other teachers. Bilingual students use native language textbooks that mirror those used in the student program; that way, when they transition out of bilingual classes, their core knowledge of the major disciplines is on the same level as their English-fluent peers.     All teachers co-teach to reduce pupil-to-teacher ratios.    A student support team, including the principal, the curriculum specialist, and current and former classroom teachers, is available to students facing continuing academic risks. Together the team identifies specific weaknesses and, after consultation with parents, determines how to help the student overcome the identified problems. Some possible solutions may include additional time for mathematics or reading instruction, a small instructional group setting for a particular subject area, or psychological testing for specific learning disabilities.      THE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING COMMUNITY    Staff development is one of the sustaining forces at Worcester Arts. ""We're using a supportive model, not just one-shot programs,"" Principal Margaret Venditti explains.     Venditti considers staff development one of the sustaining forces at Worcester Arts. ""We're using a supportive model, not just one-shot programs,"" she explains. Worcester Arts Magnet employs 32 full-time staff members, most of whom are continually involved in extending their own learning. The school's plan for professional development encourages staff to work collaboratively on a common goal and to share any knowledge acquired in the many workshops, conferences, and courses they attend. In a typical year, faculty participate in more than 40 different courses and workshops. More than half of the staff have been working on their masters' degree or, in some cases, have received a second or third masters' degree since they joined the faculty. Three staff members were awarded a sabbatical year at Harvard University and returned to the school to share the results of their studies or introduce the programs they initiated while on leave.  Teachers' areas of expertise include elementary education, the arts and cognition, special education, creative arts in learning, administration, planning, and social policy. One teacher participated in a museum education project to help kindergartners develop observation and experimentation skills through art. One of the Harvard scholars focused her studies on parent involvement and conducted workshops increasing parent involvement through decisionmaking and participation. Other workshops that Worcester Arts Magnet staff attended have addressed family involvement in children's education, classroom management, parenting, family literacy, and an introduction to  using Macintosh computers. As staff participate in citywide assessment workshops, they return to share their knowledge with their colleagues. Finally, preschool and kindergarten teachers' participation in the National Association for the Education of Young Children's accreditation program eventually resulted in the accreditation of  the Worcester Arts early childhood program.     In a typical year, faculty participate in more than 40 different courses and workshops. More than half of the staff have been working on their masters' degree or, in some cases, have received a second or third masters' degree since they joined the faculty.    Professional development at Worcester Arts is based on individual as well as building-level needs. New teachers are brought into the traditions of the arts-integrated approach by collegial mentors, and the school continually surveys the staff to assess areas in which they need additional training. New staff ""need the opportunities to become as proficient as others—especially in the arts and how to integrate them throughout the curriculum,"" Venditti explains. Evaluation is also integral to the professional development process. In the fall, as part of the annual staff evaluation, Venditti and each staff member review the past year's achievements and set new professional development goals for the coming year.      PARENT AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS    The doors are open at Worcester Arts early in the morning and late into the night. An arts-centered extended day program provides afterschool opportunities for students to participate in a wide array of arts programs.    Parents have been essential to the program's continuing success, Venditti proudly reports. The magnet concept was initiated by 17 families, and the school now brings more than half of its students from outside of the school boundaries. More than 200 families volunteer their time in various school activities: they help substitute in classes during staff development days, read to children, organize book fairs, sew costumes, and assist with many arts activities. The school's Parent Teacher Organization also provides each teacher with $150 to conduct field trips or  purchase supplementary materials for their classrooms.   The doors are open at Worcester Arts early in the morning and late into the night. The extended day for students provides one hour of extra time for special arts, music, and drama activities, including a student chorus and instrument lessons. A Community Partnerships Grant provides child care for families who work or attend school for 30 hours a week. This collaborative serves up to 20 preschoolers through third-graders and  is open on school vacations and school delay days.   Fliers in both Spanish and English invite parents to attend school meetings, where babysitting is available for children without other adult-supervised care. A bilingual staff member interprets for parents who do not speak English, and she often conveys their concerns to the school's various governance councils. In addition to the fliers and periodic information sheets, the principal and teachers each write and distribute newsletters to the community. A monthly calendar featuring field trips, special programs, and other events is also available in English and Spanish.  Worcester Arts' bilingual counselor and psychologist assist students and their families, and, in preparation for preschool, a bilingual family liaison conducts home visits to families with two-year-olds.   Community service is important to the staff and to the school community. Some examples of annual activities for students and their families include a bottle and can drive to raise money for Thanksgiving Baskets, a holiday fair to raise money for a local project supplying gifts to needy families, and a canned goods drive to help a local food bank. The staff and students assist at the Medical Center of Central Massachusetts. Parents and children fill ""love bowls"" with candy every month for patients receiving chemotherapy and radiation treatments. They also decorate monthly bulletin boards in the patient waiting area. The school values this exchange, ""a bridge to life outside of school,"" because it instills in students a sense of responsibility and commitment to the broader community.      SUSTAINING CHANGE   Principal Venditti reports that one of her greatest challenges is ""keeping up with the vast amount of research on teaching and learning...to make sure you don't just hop on the bandwagon because something is in vogue, but because you know that it works...and that it is based on a solid foundation of research...."" District-level expertise has been crucial in building a research-based program. Most recently, the district office has offered programs on balancing literacy through phonics, whole language, and student assessment, including portfolio and other authentic assessments.     Keeping up with the rapidly advancing research on teaching and learning is a major challenge to sustaining the momentum at Worcester Arts Magnet.    It is hard to keep a collaborative organization moving, Venditti acknowledges. ""It takes so much time to involve people, it's hard to schedule, and teachers are tired."" But she takes pleasure in the degree to which people rally around the school. Parents and teachers feel joint ownership of the school's major plans and activities, and the faculty has been very stable. Worcester Arts' administrative approach combines dedication and patience with two basic organizational principles: meetings that have tight agendas and a system for implementing what has been planned together. The process works well, confirms Barbara Ann Masley, the curriculum coordinator who chaired the school's self-study. According to her introduction to the school's accreditation report, at Worcester Arts Magnet, the community has created a school where ""the whole is much larger than the sum of the parts.""   -###-           [ A Beacon of Excellence ]             [ Secondary Schools ]"
GX070-12-0433851	"Profiles of Successful Schoolwide Programs - December 1998     A r c h i v e d  I n f o r m a t i o n     Elementary Schools   Ensuring Success for All Students   Lincoln WorldLab Magnet Elementary School   Palm Beach County Public Schools · Riviera Beach, Florida   OVERVIEW    An emphasis on early academic intervention, a strong, coherent curriculum, and coordinated instructional strategies ensure that students at Lincoln Elementary School meet or exceed grade-level benchmarks by the time they enter the sixth grade. ""If we can reach students early, we can solve any problem,"" said Penny Collins, a literacy resource teacher who works with kindergartners and first-graders. In this cooperative learning atmosphere, students achieve at the highest academic levels while developing positive attitudes toward themselves and their peers.   Lincoln's schoolwide program, first implemented in 1993-94, uses Success For All (SFA), MathWings, and WorldLab, the three coordinated curricula developed by the Center for the Education of Students Placed at Risk (CRESPAR) at Johns Hopkins University. Having these curricula at the core of the schoolwide program has successfully minimized the fragmentation in this very large kindergarten-through-fifth-grade school that serves a largely African American, Haitian, and Hispanic student population. Extensive on-site professional development that continues within the school day promotes a common instructional philosophy and teaching style across classrooms. It works, says Penny Collins, because ""students receive the same signals from [all the] teachers,"" and all instruction is structured similarly.   In its schoolwide budget, Lincoln combines federal resources from the Title I, Title V-Magnet, and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act programs, with funding from the Florida lottery and other state and local resources. According to principal Margaret Brockmiller, becoming a schoolwide program meant using all available funds more effectively. The result was that, without labeling, all students benefit from focused, specialized instruction.         Lincoln serves a predominantly nonwhite student population, 87% of whom qualify for free or reduced-price lunch.             Grade Levels  PreK-5       Number of Students  (1997-98)  1,181         Schoolwide Since  1993-94       Racial/Ethnic Composition     92%   African American   7%   Hispanic/White/Other           VISION, LEADERSHIP, AND DECISION MAKING    Lincoln faculty members are full participants in decisionmaking.  The school's improvement plan for 1997-98 includes a comprehensive  monitoring structure that outlines their roles and responsibilities to ensure  that school improvement strategies are implemented.      Two representative decision-making bodies, a faculty council and a school, parent, and community advisory committee, coordinate to review and update the school's improvement plan periodically.     Decision making occurs through two representative structures—a faculty council from each grade and the School Advisory Committee (SAC). The faculty council meets with the principal twice monthly to discuss the school's day-to-day organizational needs and strategies for integrating the research-based reform programs with other schoolwide activities. The SAC, which meets monthly, is chaired by a parent, co-chaired by the principal, and includes parents, teachers, noninstructional staff, community members, and administrators. At least 10 members represent parents or the community, including one designated representative from the school's large Haitian community. The SAC works by consensus to maintain an updated school improvement plan. The state allocates $10 per child for the SAC to spend on school improvement activities.      STUDENT PERFORMANCE RESULTS     In 1997, 29% of students scored in the top two quartiles of the CTBS test in reading, and 43% reached these levels in mathematics.    Student performance at Lincoln is measured through eight-week SFA and MathWings instructional assessments and by state-mandated standardized tests. Teachers submit continual improvement reports to the principal every nine weeks to track student progress. They also inform parents about student progress in quarterly report cards and interim progress reports with detailed information about individuals' skill development and changing academic needs.   Each year students in grades three through five take the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (CTBS) in the spring, and fourth-graders take the Florida Writing Assessment in February. The CTBS scores provide longitudinal data on individual students for three years. Between 1994 and 1997, the percent of students performing above the 50th percentile rose significantly in both reading and mathematics. In reading, the number of students above the 50th percentile rose from 18 to 29 percent during the three-year period; in mathematics, the percent jumped from 17 to  43. Based on data compiled from these scores, the school writes an annual curriculum plan, identifying areas of the test not sufficiently emphasized by the school's instructional program. Lincoln's scores on the Florida Writing Assessment have also increased steadily since 1994. Between 1994 and 1997, scores climbed from 1.6 to 2.5 on the narrative portion of the test and from 1.4 to 2.0 on the expository portion of the test. Both components are measured on a one-to-six scale. Every eight weeks, the SFA instructional assessments provide diagnostic information that teachers, in consultation with SFA facilitators, use to restructure reading groups according to appropriate skill levels.      RESEARCH-BASED REFORM STRATEGIES   The three instructional programs developed by CRESPAR and Johns Hopkins University researchers—SFA, MathWings, and WorldLab—guide reading, mathematics, social studies, and science instruction in grades one through five. The programs are aligned with Florida's Sunshine State Standards, and although each one is distinct, they are integrated across subject areas and grade levels, fitting together ""like a puzzle,"" reports principal Brockmiller.      Three Johns Hopkins-developed instructional programs, Success For All, MathWings, and WorldLab structure a coordinated academic curriculum that is fully aligned with Florida's Sunshine State Standards.     Success For All (SFA) . SFA structures the reading program for students across all grades. Homogeneous groups of students participate in daily, 120-minute uninterrupted reading and language arts instructional blocks. The SFA curriculum focuses on teaching comprehension, listening, speaking, and vocabulary skills, through multicultural stories that reflect students' cultures and heritages. The model uses literature to involve students personally in reading and to enhance their understanding of the story structures. Students learn to listen to, retell, and dramatize children's literature; to compose ideas orally and in writing; and to decode letters and sounds to support their advancing reading knowledge. SFA is a continual progress model in which students learn cooperatively. Students progress across achievement levels as they master certain skills, and they also develop the ability to assess their own progress and to correct their errors as they read and write. For students experiencing difficulty, tutoring and additional academic support services are immediately available so they can proceed through the reading program as quickly as their improving language skills will allow.  MathWings . The MathWings program gives students the opportunity to discover, experiment with, and apply their mathematical knowledge following the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' Curriculum and Evaluation Standards. Mathematics activities build on the practical mathematics knowledge students have when they enter school and incorporate real and simulated problem solving, skill practice, calculator use, alternative assessments, writing, and connections to literature and other disciplines. Students learn to apply multiple-problem solutions and then describe this new knowledge in their own mathematics journals. MathWings is cyclical; students at each grade level review and build on what they learned the previous year until they achieve mastery.    WorldLab . WorldLab is Lincoln's integrated science and social studies program in which students use written work, role playing, and cooperative teams to carry out experiments, investigations, and science and social studies projects. WorldLab adopts the same instructional strategies as does the overall SFA and MathWings programs. The program, written on various skill levels, revolves around thematic units that incorporate writing, reading, mathematics, fine arts, and music into the science and social studies curriculum.      Across all content areas, students learn cooperatively and individually to achieve mastery. Students learn to assess their own progress and they develop the habit of correcting their own errors before moving ahead.     Early childhood learning opportunities.  Teachers in Lincoln's prekindergarten and kindergarten classrooms learn the SFA methods through the same training programs their colleagues participated in. It focuses on providing a balanced and developmentally appropriate learning experience for children emphasizing the development and use of language, music, art, and movement activities in a series of thematic units. This consistency  of the preschool and kindergarten programs facilitates students' preparation for the first grade. Lincoln also uses the Breakthrough to Literacy Language Development Program, an interactive computer-based language  development curriculum for kindergartners and selected first-graders. Each day, students explore words, letters, and sounds on computer programs aligned with all other academic components. Teachers use the same programs to continually assess students' reading progress.    Support services to students . Reteaching students who struggle to make progress through the progressively more difficult learning cycles is an important component of all aspects of SFA, and this concept carries over to all academic disciplines at Lincoln. Students receive various supplementary support services, including tutoring by specially trained paraprofessionals, drop-out prevention assistance, and mentoring through the program HOSTS—Help One Student To Succeed, which targets students in grades three through five. Those who score in the lowest quartile on the CTBS receive additional one-to-one instruction each day from one of four diagnostically trained full-time tutors. Students in the highest quartile on the CTBS may participate in the county's Structures of Intellect (SOI) curriculum, which helps eligible students prepare for the district's Gifted and Talented program. Parents are an essential part of the formula for success in SFA.   The research-based reform programs at Lincoln accommodate all students, especially those at risk, because teachers continually reassess and regroup students according to their educational needs. For designated students with limited-English proficiency, a full-time ESL teacher provides additional assistance, supplementing classroom reading instruction in the morning and individually tutoring selected students in the afternoon.   All students have access to mental health services through the support of Lincoln's Family Support Team. Two assistant principals also help resolve conflicts and organize peer mediation sessions on campus. Lincoln's discipline plan features conflict resolution and encourages the school's ""Fight Free"" program to help students implement the schoolwide motto, ""Celebrating Peace Every Day.""      THE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING COMMUNITY   Lincoln's 89 teachers and 71 support and administrative staff bring a wealth of expertise to students. A multitalented professional team includes reading specialists; SFA, MathWings, and WorldLab facilitators; more than 20 special educators; art, music, physical education, computer, and ESL teachers; a counselor; and a social worker. Well-trained paraprofessionals assist professionals in implementing all aspects of the program. A parent liaison and three dropout prevention teachers are part of the overall support for students and families.      We help teachers question themselves by making them aware of what they're doing and not doing. They're constantly checking and rechecking their teaching against assessments of students' progress.   Penny Collins  Teacher Facilitator  Lincoln Elementary    When Lincoln initially adopted the CRESPAR/Hopkins programs, all staff received two weeks of intensive preparatory training on how to use the materials and the strategies incorporated into the research-based program. Professional development continues to be available from in-school and regional facilitators. Lincoln's two in-school facilitators—one who supports SFA and one who supports both MathWings and WorldLab—work with teachers to examine students' progress summary data, structure teaching around students' needs, determine the effectiveness of lessons, and, in the case of SFA, arrange students into homogeneous reading groups. Every eight weeks, facilitators issue checklists to teachers with information on each program component to help ensure that instruction is data-driven. According to facilitator Penny Collins, ""[We] help teachers question themselves and make them aware of what they're doing and not doing. They're constantly checking and rechecking [their teaching against assessments of students' progress]."" SFA-sponsored network facilitators who work in the region conduct periodic implementation checks and provide continuous feedback to the principal based on summary information about student performance.   In addition to training and support in the research-based SFA models, professional development opportunities at Lincoln include the Early Literacy Inservice Course (ELIC) for primary teachers, Professional Orientation Program mentors for new teachers, grade-level discussions, and early release days so that teachers can attend in-service courses on conflict resolution, writing, alternative assessments, inclusion, and test-taking preparation.      PARENT AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS   Lincoln is deeply committed to fostering parent and community involvement in students' lives. Parents are invited to participate in several educational opportunities at the school, including the Parent Power and Parent Power Kids program, adult education/GED preparation classes, and MegaSkills parenting classes. The Parent Power program helps parents prepare young children to enter school by modeling instruction in a class for three- and four-year-olds. These and other parent involvement activities occur weekly at Lincoln, scheduled at various times throughout the day and evening.      A Family Support Team conducts home visits, directs parents to appropriate agency services, and, when necessary, intervenes into situations at home or at school that negatively affect students' learning.    Lincoln's Family Support Team, including Lincoln's social worker, principal, counselor, and psychologist, is a vital component of the SFA model that provides an array of services to families. The team, headed by the school's social worker, visits families of students who are exhibiting behavioral, health, or academic problems; steers families toward agencies that can assist; conducts parent outreach; plans interventions for non-school situations that affect learning; and issues attendance plans for students who have a less than 95 percent attendance rate. When needed, the Family Support Team reviews information relevant to each student; discusses the needs with the student's teacher; and identifies a case manager for each family. Lincoln's parent liaison also assists the team in contacting parents and enlisting their cooperation.   The Lincoln staff reach beyond the school to familie—seven to those who are unable to visit the school. They use a number of communication devices: a parent compact, a daily calendar of student work and responsibilities referred to as a ""student agenda,"" and calendars of school events. Updated information about individual students facilitates the ongoing dialogue between parents and teachers, keeping the school and families tightly linked in support of students. Each day, students leave school with a progress report for parents that includes teachers' comments about their achievement. Parents are encouraged to talk with their students about the report and to respond with comments or questions. Quarterly curriculum nights, featuring grade-level presentations by the faculty, are a forum for parents to learn about curriculum content and instructional activities and to ask questions about testing. Parent-teacher conferences, held twice a year, take place at the school or over the telephone. Lincoln reports all assessment results to parents, including the results of both standardized and SFA tests. Written materials released by Lincoln are translated into Spanish, and an interpreter is available to Haitian families.      SUSTAINING CHANGE     The changes Lincoln initiated in the schoolwide program are sustained by a common instructional philosophy, an understanding of what is taught in other classrooms, and a commitment to all students achieving the same high standards.    Lincoln staff report that the changes initiated by the schoolwide program are sustained by a common instructional philosophy,an understanding of what is taught in other classrooms, and a commitment to all students achieving the same high standards. Coordinating Lincoln's magnet and schoolwide programs dramatically improved the resources available to the school, principal Brockmiller reported. The research-based curriculum engages students with familiar and active experiences. It is taught similarly across all subjects by skillful master teachers who ensure their colleagues have the support they need to implement the program effectively. The Family Support Team is also an essential part of the program's success. Collaboration within and across the grades keeps the program integrated schoolwide, enabling Lincoln to stand forcefully behind its commitment to ""Success For All.""   -###-           [ Academic Success Through a ""Full Service"" School ]             [ Commitment to Teacher Development ]"

Often even a good quality educational program            is not sufficiently challenging for a student with special gifts or            talents. The GATE funds are used to design and deliver a supplemental            differentiated program for individuals or groups of gifted and talented            students with special needs.                        Overview             In 1961, the California Legislature established the mentally gifted            minor (MGM) program for students scoring in the 98th percentile or above            on standardized intellectual ability tests. By 1980, 454 school districts            and 160,000 students were participating in the program. AB 1040, enacted            in 1980, established the GATE program allowing districts to set their            own criteria for entrance. It expanded service beyond the intellectually            gifted to students who were gifted, talented, or both in areas such            as specific academic ability, leadership, visual and performing arts,            and creativity.                         Currently, GATE programs are operated by 806 districts in California,            located in 58 counties. Approximately 425,653 public school students            have been identified as gifted and talented for the 2001-02 school year.            Participants in these programs compare favorably with students across            the nation and internationally when provided differentiated instruction            commensurate with their abilities and talents.                         Districts may elect to apply for GATE funding. Their applications may            be approved by the State Board of Education for up to five years. To            qualify for funding, districts must have an approved GATE plan. State            Law (AB 2313, effective January 1, 2001) requires that primary services            for gifted and talented students be integrated into the regular school            day.                            Objectives           Districts use GATE funds as a catalyst to start and maintain challenging            programs for gifted and talented students. High school districts use            GATE funding to start Advanced Placement (AP), honors, or International            Baccalaureate (IB) programs. After a year of GATE funding support, the            enrollment is usually sufficient to generate average daily attendance            (a.d.a.), and GATE funding is then used to start up another course.                     The GATE funding is also used to counsel economically disadvantaged            high potential students to ensure that they are enrolled in courses            which provide a foundation for college entrance. In rural areas, where            perhaps only one or two students are ready for an advanced course, GATE            funding is used for distance learning programs such as Stanford University's            Education Program for Gifted Youth (EPGY), which offers college level            courses on CD-ROM to middle and high-school age youth.                         At the elementary, middle, and secondary levels, GATE funding supports            the provision of services that are integrated into the regular school            day as differentiated learning experiences based on the core curriculum.            GATE funding also supports supplementary services such as pullout classes,            extended day classes, intercession opportunities, or Saturday seminars.                                    At all levels, GATE funding is used for staff development to provide            teachers with strategies to broaden or deepen their instruction, accelerate            programs, or design individual programs to meet students' needs. GATE            funding is often used to send teachers to AP or IB training. The regular            classroom teacher, with GATE students included in class, benefits from            training in instructional techniques which improve the quality of learning            for all students while stimulating our most able students.

GX010-29-2851104	BILL NUMBER: AB 2313 CHAPTERED  BILL TEXT   CHAPTER   748  FILED WITH SECRETARY OF STATE   SEPTEMBER 27, 2000  APPROVED BY GOVERNOR   SEPTEMBER 26, 2000  PASSED THE ASSEMBLY   AUGUST 31, 2000  PASSED THE SENATE   AUGUST 30, 2000  AMENDED IN SENATE   AUGUST 7, 2000  AMENDED IN ASSEMBLY   MAY 26, 2000  AMENDED IN ASSEMBLY   APRIL 5, 2000  INTRODUCED BY   Assembly Member Correa    (Coauthor: Assembly Member Lempert)                          FEBRUARY 24, 2000     An act to amend Sections 52205, 52206, 52209, and 52212 of, to repeal Sections 52204 and 52208 of, and to repeal and add Section 52211 of, the Education Code, relating to gifted and talented pupils.    LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST      AB 2313, Correa.  Education:  gifted and talented pupils.    (1) Under existing law, the Gifted and Talented Pupil Program authorizes school districts that provided a mentally gifted minor program in the 1978-79 school year to participate in that program. Under existing law, the Superintendent of Public Instruction is required to apportion funds to eligible school districts in a specified manner that apportions funds to each participating school district based on a different dollar amount per pupil depending on the number of participating pupils in the program.    This bill would delete those provisions and add provisions that revise the method of apportioning funds for the gifted and talented program so that each participating school district receives a per-pupil amount based on average daily attendance, determined as specified.  The bill would also remove certain restrictions on the use of funds for gifted and talented pupil programs.    (2) Under existing law, the Superintendent of Public Instruction is required to meet certain requirements in administering the Gifted and Talented Program, including giving priority in technical assistance to those districts receiving the greatest increase in funds.    This bill would delete that requirement.    (3) Under existing law, the governing boards of school districts that provide gifted and talented programs may establish programs consisting of special day classes,  part-time grouping, enrichment activities, cluster grouping, independent study, acceleration, postsecondary education opportunities, and other program approaches authorized by the governing board of the school district.  Existing law provides that if the school district provides any of these programs, it must provide them for a specified amount of time each week.    This bill would instead require that programs for gifted and talented pupils be planned and organized as an integrated differentiated learning experience within the regular school day, and may be augmented with other differentiated activities related to the core curriculum.    (4) Existing law requires the governing board of each school district providing gifted and talented programs to conduct an annual assessment of the program and to develop procedures that ensure the ongoing participation of parents of gifted and talented pupils in the planning and evaluation of those programs.    This bill would delete those provisions.  The bill would instead require a school district, each time it submits an application for renewal of its GATE authorization, to submit a program assessment, in accordance with criteria adopted by the State Board of Education.   THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:     SECTION 1.  Section 52204 of the Education Code is repealed.   SEC. 2.  Section 52205 of the Education Code is amended to read:    52205.  The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall:    (a) Apportion funds pursuant to this chapter to each district for which an application to offer programs pursuant to this chapter has been approved by the State Board of Education according to this chapter and regulations adopted by the board.    (b) Assist school district governing boards, upon their request, to design, implement, and evaluate programs funded under this chapter.    (c) Ensure that the expenditure of funds authorized for programs pursuant to this chapter is consistent with this chapter.    (d) Encourage the development of locally designed, innovative programs for gifted and talented pupils.    (e) Assist districts in the development and implementation of staff development programs related to gifted and talented pupils.    (f) Encourage the development of procedures that assure the ongoing participation of parents of gifted and talented pupils in the planning and evaluation of programs funded pursuant to this chapter.    SEC. 3.  Section 52206 of the Education Code is amended to read:    52206.  (a) The governing boards of school districts that elect to provide programs pursuant to this chapter may establish programs for gifted and talented pupils consisting of special day classes, part-time groupings, and cluster  groupings, consistent with the regulations of the State Board of Education. These programs shall be planned and organized as an integrated, differentiated learning experience within the regular school day, and may be augmented or supplemented with other differentiated activities related to the core curriculum using such strategies as independent study, acceleration, postsecondary education, and enrichment.    (b) Each participating governing board shall determine the most appropriate curricular components for participating pupils within its district.    (c) For all programs for gifted and talented pupils, including programs for pupils with high creative capabilities and talents in the performing and visual arts, each participating governing board shall concentrate part of its curriculum on providing participating pupils with an academic component and, where appropriate, with instruction in basic skills.   SEC. 4.  Section 52208 of the Education Code is repealed.   SEC. 5.  Section 52209 of the Education Code is amended to read:    52209.  The governing board of any school district that provides a program for gifted and talented pupils pursuant to this chapter may:     (a) Conduct programs, seminars, and classes for gifted and talented pupils within or without the boundaries of the school district and, for that purpose, employ instructors, supervisors, and other personnel and provide necessary equipment and supplies.    (b) Transport or arrange for transportation of pupils to or from educational institutions where regularly scheduled programs and classes are being conducted.    Attendance of pupils at these programs, seminars, and classes shall be included in computing the average daily attendance of the district for the purposes of apportionments from the State School Fund.    Funds provided in support of this chapter shall be used solely for the purposes of this chapter.  Allowances provided in any fiscal year but not expended in that year may be expended in subsequent fiscal years.   SEC. 6.  Section 52211 of the Education Code is repealed.   SEC. 7.  Section 52211 is added to the Education Code, to read:    52211.  The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall, beginning in the 2001-02 school year, apportion funds to school districts pursuant to the provisions of this section.  The superintendent shall perform the following calculations:    (a) Divide the total funding available for gifted and talented education (GATE) by the statewide total units of average daily attendance in kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive, at the second principle apportionment of the prior year, for all school districts participating in the GATE program in the current year.    (b) Multiply the dollar amount computed in subdivision (a) by the average daily attendance at the second principle apportionment of the prior year for each participating school district.    (c) No school district with fewer than 1,500 pupils in average daily attendance shall receive less to support its GATE program than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) or the amount it received in 1998-99, whichever is greater.    (d) No district shall receive less per average daily attendance than the amount it received per average daily attendance in the 1999-2000 school year.    (e) The dollar amount in subdivision (c) shall be increased annually by the percentage inflation adjustment provided to the revenue limits of unified school districts of over 1,500 pupils in average daily attendance.   SEC. 8.  Section 52212 of the Education Code is amended to read:    52212.  (a) (1) Each applicant school district shall submit an application for approval for a proposed program for gifted and talented pupils to the State Board of Education.  The application shall be submitted in the form and manner prescribed by the Superintendent of Public Instruction.  An application shall be approved for a period of one, two, or three years, or denied, based on the quality of the plan, in accordance with criteria adopted by the State Board of Education.  Those criteria shall be reviewed by the board at least once every four years and shall address, but are not limited to, the elements of program design, identification, curriculum and instruction, social and emotional development, professional development, parent and community involvement, program assessment and budgeting.  The application shall include budget information including separate data on identification and program costs, and any other data required by the Superintendent of Public Instruction to administer and evaluate the program effectively.  Each time a school district submits an application for renewal of its GATE authorization, the school district shall submit a program assessment in accordance with criteria adopted by the state board.    (2) Each participating governing board shall maintain auditable records.    (3) Each applicant school district shall designate, in its application to the State Board of Education, a person with responsibility for the development, identification procedure, and implementation of the local program for gifted and talented pupils, fiscal management, and the collection of auditable records for the independent evaluation.    (4)  Applications for district programs shall be developed by the State Department of Education and made available to districts no later than April 1 of each year.  The application shall not be part of the consolidated application.    (b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), the state may approve an application for a period of five years, if following a site validation of the application by the department, it determines that the districts's program for gifted and talented pupils is exemplary.

GX071-95-10877578	"Back to Press Releases     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                                             Contact: Ashley Westbrook  November 1, 2002                                                                                                (202) 225-3661                                                                                                                                 www.house.gov/delauro     DeLauro Secures $12.5 Million for New Haven Public Schools  –Money Will Expand Magnet School Program –     NEW HAVEN - Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro (Conn.-3) today announced that the New Haven Public Schools has received a new federal grant that, over the next five years, will provide $12.5 million to expand New Haven's popular magnet school program.   New Haven Public Schools already operates the largest magnet and interdistrict magnet school program in the State, with a total of 17 ""schools of choice"" and an enrollment of 7,000 students. Some 1,100 students are from 23 suburban towns.   The grant from the U.S. Department of Education's Voluntary School Choice Program, which takes effect immediately, will allot New Haven a total of $2 million through September 30, 2003, and, over five years, a total of $12.5 million. The funding is the largest federal grant that New Haven 's magnet school program has received to date.   ""This grant will make a difference in the lives of so many area children,"" said DeLauro. ""At a time when we are trying to give parents and their children more flexibility within our public school system, I'm so pleased to have been a part of an effort to provide our schools with the resources they need to make that a reality.""   New Haven was the only Connecticut school district to receive funding, and one of only 9 school districts in the country to receive an award. The U.S. Department of Education, in its award   letter, noted that New Haven Public Schools is a forerunner in offering attractive schools of choice.   ""Because New Haven's mayor, school board and superintendent have made school choice an important option, New Haven has developed more magnet schools than any other Connecticut district,"" noted the United States Department of Education.   ""This generous grant will keep us on the incredible and successful Magnet School program road we have been travelling for several years,"" Mayor John DeStefano, Jr. said. ""We are lucky to be able to expand the program to include more and more kids from the towns around the Elm City and increase the diversity of our student body.""   Superintendent of Schools Dr. Reginald Mayo said the funding will allow the New Haven Public Schools to open five to seven new schools of choice in the next few years.   ""We are indebted to Congresswoman DeLauro in helping us secure this necessary funding,"" Dr. Mayo said. ""This grant will help us continue to expand our Schools of Choice program, already the largest of its kind in the State of Connecticut. The funding will allow us to increase the numbers of schools with a magnet focus at all grade levels, so more parents will have the opportunity to attend a school of choice."""

GX248-04-15371645	Texas School Performance Review        Gifted and Talented Pilot Project       Executive Summary                       Findings                Conclusion                Appendix A                Appendix B                Acknowledgments                  This report documents the results of the Gifted and Talented Pilot Project conducted during the Spring of 2001. The report discusses the purpose of the pilot and the process by which the pilot was organized and implemented. It identifies relevant issues important for consideration for future pilots or programs evaluating electronic courses. Finally, there is an evaluation of the costs associated with the pilot. The findings in this report reflect the opinions of the participating parties. These include the students, teachers and Gifted and Talented coordinators, school district administrators, IBM, and the University of Texas at Austin Distance Education Center.          The purpose of the pilot was to demonstrate the use of electronic commerce in delivering educational opportunities to the students of Texas. The project aimed to provide eleventh grade Gifted and Talented students in four targeted areas around the state with access to an electronic U.S. Government course and further encourage the use of technology for education. Though this pilot focused on Gifted and Talented students, the findings have implications for all students in all parts of the state.       Findings suggest allowing Gifted and Talented Students access to electronic courses opens up opportunities for them to take other courses that advance their education and broaden their academic experience. These electronic courses provide students access to classes that might otherwise be unavailable due to rurality, limited resources, or inadequate class size. While accessibility to classes may increase, accessibility to an instructor may be needed to enhance the program’s success. The students’ success, however, was hampered by difficulties in organizing and implementing the pilot. Finally, the pilot findings indicate that as electronic classes become more Web-based, schools and students will need access to high-capacity phone lines.        Purpose        The purpose of the pilot was to determine the viability of providing special-population students, such as the Gifted and Talented, better access to technological resources in order to accelerate their education. These technological resources included access to an electronic U.S. Government course provided by the University of Texas at Austin and supplemented by IBM’s Web-based Learning Village application that provides students, parents, and teachers with online communication and collaborative tools. Videoconferences were also included in the pilot. Though this pilot was limited to the Gifted and Talented students, there is potential for all students in all parts of Texas to utilize electronic courses to gain access to educational opportunities.        Partners        To fulfill the scope and purpose of the project, several contributing partners came together. The Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts coordinated the efforts of the project participants and contracted with the University of Texas at Austin Distance Education Center to provide basic course content in the form of a CD-ROM-based curriculum as well as a textbook and study guide for a U.S. Government course. The University of Texas portion of the course would meet the Texas Education Association’s (TEA) statewide standards and allow the course to be accredited.       With the basic curriculum in place, IBM Global Education donated 31 laptop computers to the schools as well as access to the IBM Educational Software Learning Village. Cisco Systems, Inc. provided dial-up assistance. For this pilot, Learning Village provided the following:               Home Page Designer – Allows teachers and students to create and maintain Web pages;             Team Projects – Virtual project rooms that allow student collaboration on assignments; and             Private Conferences – Secure online communications between parents, teachers, and students.              With the help of the Texas Association for the Gifted and Talented, an instructor was chosen as the point-to-point contact for the pilot. Dr. Rosemary Morrow was contracted through the University of Texas to conduct three videoconferences with the students as well as serve as the pilot contact. The conferences were held at Education Service Centers across the state. The first videoconference was an introduction and overview of the course. The two subsequent videoconferences were specific to course assignments.        Participating Schools and Terms of Participation        The following school districts were selected to participate in the pilot due to their location and size: Paris Independent School District (in East Texas), Plainview Independent School District (in North Texas), Pharr-San Juan-Alamo Independent School District (in South Texas) and Donna Independent School District (in South Texas). These school districts agreed to participate according to the terms set forth in the Gifted and Talented Pilot Project General Information Packet. Those terms included:             Assist in determining and encouraging student participation.  This included the guidance of an appointed person on staff at the participating high school to aid in the recruitment and designation of those students who would most benefit from a technology-based course.                        Accept course credit awarded by the content provider to meet graduation requirements.                         Apply “weighted” Grade Point Average status to this course as determined appropriate by the local school board.  The basic course is TEA-approved and shall be accepted as any other TEA-approved course in the state of Texas. The enhancements to the course clearly designate it as Gifted and Talented curriculum and, as such, the district agrees to apply weight to the GPA as they would any other traditional Gifted and Talented course offered in their district.                        Make the required computer facilities available to participating students.  The district made computer labs available to participating students as needed including before and after school and at other times when it was appropriate for the students to work on their assignments.                        Maintain the inventory of ThinkPads.  IBM Global Education provided 10 ThinkPad laptop computers to each district. The computers were to aid those students who did not otherwise have access to an Internet-ready computer. They are also intended to allow students to utilize the 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week model of this program.                The districts were accountable for the computers. A library-style checkout procedure for the units was suggested so that the schools would know who had a laptop and when it should be returned.             IBM retained ownership of the laptops and provided maintenance on those laptops during the pilot project. The district can take ownership of the units at any time, but once ownership has transferred, IBM will no longer be responsible for maintenance. The units may remain in IBM’s inventory for up to one year while in the district’s possession. IBM will not be liable for lost or stolen computers. The school districts will not be required to replace lost or stolen units.             At the end of one year, the districts will take ownership of the laptops and be solely responsible for them from that point forward.                         Assist in the distribution, tracking and return of the textbooks.  The Comptroller’s office purchased the course materials, including CDs, study guides, and textbooks. Upon completion of the course, the University of Texas will buy back each textbook from the Comptroller’s office.                   Cooperate with all pilot partners to ensure the success of the project.  Accommodation of any participant was essential to the success of this program.                   Participate in the evaluation phase of the project.  The districts helped the project by keeping detailed records of day-to-day problems, concerns and successes, and by answering survey questions and participating in any needed exit interviews or activities.        Process      Each district’s Gifted and Talented Coordinator recruited Gifted and Talented students in the eleventh grade to participate in the pilot. During the recruitment, several incentives were given to the students. Many of the students were in the top 10 of their class and wanted to accelerate their learning and gain an edge over other high-ranking students. By participating in the pilot, the student could gain Level One credit (honors or weighted) as well as free up a semester of their senior year to take another Level One course and raise their GPA. The other incentive was the full-time use of a donated laptop computer for the duration of the pilot. Thirty-five students in the four districts signed up to participate. They included 10 students from Donna High School, seven students from Plainview High School, nine students from Paris High School, and nine students from Pharr-San Juan-Alamo North High School.     Students were required to complete an application to participate. The applications were reviewed and signed by each school district’s Gifted and Talented Coordinator. This coordinator had the authority to certify a student’s qualification as Gifted and Talented and of junior standing. The application was also signed by the parent or guardian of the student indicating the acceptance of the terms of the pilot. As soon as the applications were received, the information went to the University of Texas where the students were officially registered for the course. The course materials, including the CD-ROM, workbook and text, were mailed to the schools and distributed accordingly to the students. Laptops were then distributed to the students.     Due to delays in receiving laptop computers, timelines for assignment and videoconferences were pushed back. The program began in early February. Students began their first assignments prior to the first videoconference. During the first videoconference, students were introduced to the course instructor and received an overview of the course. There were a total of three videoconferences, six self-paced assignments, two independent research projects, one team project, and a final exam. The syllabus used for the course is presented in Appendix A.     In addition to the course materials, the Learning Village Web site was available to students at any time. Learning Village is a framework of applications that allows students to communicate and collaborate with other students. This online suite of services also allows students to communicate with mentors, parents to communicate privately with instructors, and gives teachers access to evaluated lesson plans. Students were encouraged to develop their own homepage through Learning Village as a means of introducing themselves to the instructor and other students.

The report documented key findings from 22 Congressional hearings featuring 237 witnesses who testified about what works in education. Four themes emerged:  rental empowerment and involvement; pa  al control; loc  ollars to the classroom; and d  focus on basic academics. a  Since publishing the Crossroads report, the Subcommittee has continued to hold hearings in Washington, D.C. and around the country to hear about what is working in education and what needs to change. The Subcommittee has also worked to ensure that the U.S. Department of Education does not waste tax dollars through its financial mismanagement, wasteful spending or fraudulent practices. Additionally, studies and reports released since the publication of Crossroads underscore the need for all levels of government to narrow achievement gaps so that no child is left behind. This report seeks to build on the Subcommittee's findings by compiling information gathered from hearings and oversight activities held in 1999 and 2000. Its primary focus concerns the underlying policies behind success in education at all levels of government: policies that put student performance first. Still, the goal of the Crossroads project remains the same: to make a case for change in federal education programs, and in the Department of Education  a change that will improve the quality of education for all children in America.  iii  Crossroads 2000   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY THE ROAD TO EXCELLENCE In Education at a Crossroads: What Works and What's Wasted in Education Today, the Subcommittee reported that America's education system is at the intersection of two paths: one leading to excellence, the other to mediocrity. Through hearings and extensive research, the Subcommittee examined the characteristics of schools and districts that lead down the road to excellence as well as down the road to mediocrity - what is wasted in education. During the 106th Congress, the Subcommittee has continued to look beyond the crossroads toward states, districts, and schools that have emerged as shining examples of excellence over the last two decades. How have they achieved excellence? By implementing policies that put student performance first.  We're Not There Yet: The Stagnant Nineties End Decades of Growth For the first time since the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) began measuring academic achievement 30 years ago, an entire decade has passed without significant and substantial achievement gains. Since the release of the previous Crossroads report, student achievement data has been released that gives us a complete picture of achievement over the last decade. The data shows that apart from some very small gains in math scores, achievement has leveled off in most grades and subject areas. This is after gains made during the 1970s and 80s. More troubling is that achievement gaps have not narrowed, despite intensive federal efforts to target funds to disadvantaged students. For example:  In 1998, NAEP reading scores for 4 1992 levels.1 th  and 12th graders failed to improve over their   Long-term trend NAEP scores for 1999 report only small, but statistically significant, gains in math scores for students aged 9 and 13.2  58 percent of disadvantaged children in 4th grade scored at the ""below basic"" level on the 1998 National NAEP Reading exam.3 National Center for Education Statistics, NAEP 1998 Reading Report Card for the Nation and the States, U.S. Department of Education, (Washington, D.C., March 1999), p. 17. 2 National Center for Education Statistics, NAEP 1999 Trends in Academic Progress, U.S. Department of Education, (Washington, D.C., August 2000), p. xi. 3 Ibid, p. 81. 1  Crossroads 2000 iv    American 12th graders outperformed only two out of 21 nations in mathematics (Cyprus and South Africa);4 Not one country scored below the United States on the assessment of advanced mathematics. In Physics, 12th grade scores were also at the bottom.  Inequitable Achievement Gains Unlike the 1970s and achievement gaps. For the widening, and the gains made about every age group and sub 1980s, the 1990s have witnessed little or no reduction in last 12 years, most achievement gaps have actually been during the 70s and 80s are beginning to evaporate. In just ject the gaps have grown since 1986. year-old students have in reading narrowed to points in 1999. For 171988 - 20 points  and   Achievement gaps between White and African American 9not narrowed since 1975. The thirteen-year-old score gap its lowest -18 points - in 1988, and have since widened to 29 year-old students, the gap in reading was also its lowest in has since widened to 31 points in 1999.5   Over the past decade, the disparity between African American and White SAT scores increased by 3 points on the verbal section and 8 points on the math portion.6  Frustration With the Status Quo According to Public Agenda, ""the prevailing view is that public education as a whole is in bad shape and renewed efforts are needed to fix it."" For example,  52 percent think local private schools do a better job of educating students  only 19 percent think public schools are better.7  4  The Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) represents the most extensive investigation of mathematics and science education ever conducted. The study is sponsored by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement, and is funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Center for Education Statistics. 5 National Center for Education Statistics, Trends in Academic Performance: Three Decades of Student Performance, U.S. Department of Education, (Washington, D.C., August 2000), p.37. 6 David Hoff, ""Gap Widens Between Black and White Students on NAEP,"" Education Week, September 6, 2000. 7 On Thin Ice, Public Agenda Online, www.publicagenda.org/specials/vouchers/voucherfindings6.htm.  Crossroads 2000 v    A 1999 Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies poll found that while 59 percent consider their local public schools to be excellent or good, only 39.7 percent of African-Americans rated their local schools that highly.8  58 percent of employers surveyed say that graduates coming from public schools lack the skills needed to succeed in the work world.9 In summary, while student performance has been the focus of recent education rhetoric, it has not been the focus in practice. Consequently, student achievement in America is not where it should be, and most Americans are not satisfied by the status quo. How did we arrive at this point?  The Current Federal Role Does Not Reward Results  ""...We must fundamentally change the way the federal government treats public schools. If we continue down the current road - where responsibility, authority, and accountability for American education flow not toward but away from parents, especially poor parents - then we will continue to see what we are seeing: too much low performance, too many bad schools, too many wasted lives."" 10  former Secretary of Education William Bennett Stagnant achievement and widening gaps are consequences of failing to put student performance first and to reward results. Instead of deciding what excellence in education should look like and putting together a plan that ensures students get there, education policymakers too often put first the primary need of the education ""system""  compliance with its rules and requirements. As Time Magazine reported earlier this year, over the last eight years, ""the Education Department has done little to reward schools that flourish and nothing to sanction schools that persistently fail.""11 Since 1965, when Washington embarked on its first major elementary-secondary education initiative, federal policy has strongly influenced America's schools. Although education is generally considered a state and local responsibility, over the years Congress has created hundreds of programs intended to address problems in education. Creating a ""program for every problem,"" as the Crossroads report found, begins to add up, so much so David A. Bositis, ""1999 National Opinion Poll, Education,"" Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, 1999. 9 Clarifying Issues 2000, ""Education"", Public Agenda, www.PublicAgenda.org. 10 Testimony of Dr. William Bennett, Field Hearing on ""Chicago Education Reforms and the Importance of Flexibility in Federal Education Programs"", Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Chicago, Illinois, April 19, 1999. 11 Eric Pooley, ""Who Gets the `A' in Education,"" Time, March 27, 2000. 8  Crossroads 2000 vi   that there are now more than 760 ""education"" and ""education-related"" programs spread across 39 federal agencies at a cost of $120 billion a year. The shape of new education programs is often determined by political polls and focus groups, rather than the actual needs of students and teachers.12 These program dollars come with significant strings attached. While federal dollars make up only about seven percent of America's total budget for K-12 education, the Subcommittee as well as other researchers have documented that Washington's role is significant when it comes to setting state and local priorities, and in determining the tenor and content of the national conversation about education.13 Without asking whether or not programs produce results, or knowing their impact on local needs, Washington each year funds an increasing number of education programs instead of focusing additional funds on proven programs. According to the Congressional Research Service, the number of Congressionally-funded programs at the Department of Education has steadily increased for the last four fiscal years.  ""In medieval times, people were sometimes pressed to death by having heavy stones piled upon their bodies until all breath and life was squeezed from them. The current U.S. Congress made a valiant attempt to lift some of those stones from the body of state and local folks. Certain very worthwhile successes were achieved but all too many stones remain. We still await the day when ESEA can truly be redesigned to fulfill the dreams we had for it in 1965...""14--Colorado Commissioner of Education The cr districts and attempting to waste federal funds to also invest in what eation of new and unproven programs increases the federal burden on states, which must adjust their priorities to match federal priorities in receive more federal dollars. Thus, ineffective new programs may not only dollars, since they can produce a ripple effect, causing district and state be spent inefficiently. It is essential, then, that the federal role be to works and to reward success.  Mark Pitsch, ""Clinton Casts Education in Starring Role,"" Education Week, October 23, 1996.

The priorities of researchers have been placed ahead of students, and as a result, education research has been impoverished. The current federal role in education research is to fund a confusing array of research centers, labs, technical assistance centers and other entities located around the country.  Federal research and evaluation is inadequate: According to the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), ""information about the federal education effort is needed by many different decision makers....much of that information, however, is not currently available.."" This is because ""few evaluations of successful strategies exist, and many of the existing evaluations lack the methodological rigor needed to determine effectiveness."" 15  The research community fails to deliver: According to the National Research Council, ""social science research currently provides few definitive answers about how to improve educational outcomes for [disadvantaged] children.""16 A RAND Education study found that ""the research and development community in education has been unable to provide consensus results or pilot tested policies and practices that could guide policy makers and educators to more effective practices.""17  So many studies, so little knowledge: Congress established the National Reading Panel to evaluate existing research on the most effective approaches for teaching children to read. The panel examined thousands of studies on reading instruction some conducted as far back as 1966. After an exhaustive review, the panel concluded that less than one third of the studies met their standards for academic and scientific rigor.18  U.S. General Accounting Office, Federal Education Funding: Multiple Programs and Lack of Data Raise Efficiency and Effectiveness Concerns, Statement of Carlotta Joyner before the Senate Education Task Force, GAO/T-HEHS-98-46, November 6, 1997, p. 12-13. 16 National Research Council, Making Money Matter: Financing America's Schools, National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., September 1999, p. 268. 17 David Grissmer, Ann Flanagan, Jennifer Kawata, Stephanie Williamson, Improving Student Achievement: What State NAEP Scores Tell Us, (RAND: Santa Monica, California, July 2000), p. xxxvi. 18 Testimony of Dr. Reid Lyon, Chief, Child Development and Behavior Branch, National Institutes of Health, Hearing on ""Options for the Future of the Office of Education Research and Improvement,"" Subcommittee on Early Childhood Youth and Families, Committee on Education and the Workforce, May 4, 2000.  15  Crossroads 2000 viii   Because so little is known about what programs work, it is all the more important for policymakers to grant flexibility at the state and local level, where schools and teachers know the unique needs of their students and how to help them succeed. Similarly, the federal government should not waste resources on unproven new programs whose methods are not backed by solid scientific research. The road to excellence cannot be traveled unless there is good information to provide signposts along the way. The Federal Role Takes its Toll The cumulative effect of hundreds of federally designed programs and requirements, many of which are not all grounded in credible research, continues to take its toll at the state and local level. After the first Crossroads report, the Subcommittee heard witnesses testify at hearings nationwide that many well-intentioned federal programs provide funding with burdensome requirements that have nothing to do with producing results. Others testified about the burden of the special education mandate and the significant resources it requires of districts.  Regulations: A Superintendent described his experience with federal programs: ""My staff and myself spent over 600 hours trying to decipher [federal special education requirements], so it may be something that you want to consider in the future once you pass something. Six hundred hours is a lot of hours. ...Every law that's passed has a tremendous impact on us as far as staff.""19  Accounting requirements: Another superintendent described her experience with a particular federal requirement: ""...the district currently spends a minimum of three man-days per month creating the documentation of use of federal funds as a supplement to district funds, rather than supplanting.""20  Unfunded Mandates: Many people working at the local level have concerns about special education funding. For example, one state representative told the Subcommittee ""one of the most positive things Congress could do is to fund the federal special education mandates, before you consider any new programs. You would all be heroes in your home states for doing so!""21  Testimony of John DeLine, Superintendent of Tekonsha Community Schools, Hearing on ""Improving Student Achievement and Reforming the Federal Role in Education,"" Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Battle Creek, Michigan, September 8, 1999. 20 Testimony of Susan Sclafani, Houston Independent School District, House Budget Committee's Education Task Force, June 14, 2000. 21 Testimony of Minnesota State Representative Alice Seagren, Hearing on ""School Choice and Parental Empowerment,"" Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Bloomington, Minnesota, June 6, 2000.  19  Crossroads 2000 ix    Paperwork: Despite recent reductions, the Department still requires more than 38 million hours of paperwork a year  the equivalent of 18,000 employees only filling out forms for one year.22 In short, little has changed about the burden federal requirements place on school districts. These requirements continue to divert local resources into federal programs of unknown effectiveness and require compliance with numerous rules that have little to do with improving educational outcomes.  BROKEN PROMISES: REINVENTION AT A CROSSROADS  ""The [education] department has suffered from mistrust and management neglect, almost from the beginning. To overcome this legacy and to lead the way in national education reform, ED must refashion and revitalize its programs, management and systems."" -The Report of the National Performance Review, Office of the Vice President, September 1993  The Administration has failed to achieve its goal of reducing the burden that the federal government imposes on school districts. As Vice President, Al Gore has presided over the National Performance Review (NPR), the stated purpose of which is ""to create a government that `works better, costs less, and gets results Americans care about."" Back in 1993, Gore and the NPR identified the Department of Education as a troubled agency in need of significant reform. ED was to be ""reinvented"" as a high-performing outfit. In retrospect, it is clear that this never came to pass. During the past eight years, Many NPR recommendations have not been fully implemented, others not at all. Despite the Vice-President's good intentions, NPR has not produced significant results, either for the Department of Education, or for America's children. The most obvious proof is ED's ongoing bookkeeping nightmares and the numerous reports of waste, fraud and abuse concerning the agency and its programs. Some examples: ""Vastly improved financial management is a critical part of the overall effort to reinvent government...if a publicly traded corporation kept its books the way the federal government does, the Securities and Exchange Commission would close it down immediately.""-The Report of the National Performance Review, Office of the Vice President, September 1993  22  See: U.S. Department of Education, 1999 Performance Indicators and 2001 Plan, p. 146.  Crossroads 2000 x    Flunking Math: The Department has failed its agency-wide audit for the past two years. ED was the last federal agency to receive an audit opinion FY 1998. The report was issued eight months after the statutory deadline. Even with the extra time, auditors could not express an opinion on any of the agency's financial statements. Anomalies included an $800 million balance for a single student loan, a $6 billion discrepancy in the financial statements and $700 million placed in an inappropriate account. The ensuing FY 1999 audit report, released on March 1, 2000, was another failure, and the immediate future also appears grim. The Department does not intend to have an effective accounting system in place until the middle of 2001, which means the FY 2000 and FY 2001 audits reports are likely to disclose continued severe financial management problems.  Readin', Ritin' And Robbery: A theft ring involving collaboration between ou contractors and ED employees operated for at least three years, stealing than $300,000 worth of electronic equipment, including computers, cell ph VCRs and even a 61"" television set. It also netted from the agency more $600,000 in false overtime pay. tside more ones, than   Dead...And Loving It: ED improperly discharged almost $77 million in student loans for borrowers who falsely claimed to be either permanently disabled or deceased, according to an Inspector General (IG) report released in June 1999.  Failing forms forms had to Proofreading 101: In September 1999, ED printed 3.5 million financial aid containing errors -- incorrect line references to the IRS tax form. The were destroyed and the 100,000 of them that were distributed to schools be recalled. The cost of the error, according to an ED official: $720,000.   Low-Impact Aid: The Impact Aid grant program sends money to school districts serving children living on military installations or Indian reservations. In April 2000, two South Dakota school districts failed to receive expected Impact Aid grant payments totaling $1.9 million. According to a Justice Department complaint filed in July, the money had been electronically wired by an ED employee into two bank accounts set up by con men. Stolen funds from one bank account were used to purchase a 2000 Cadillac Escalade and a 2000 Lincoln Navigator. Stolen funds from the other bank account were used to purchase real property in the State of Maryland worth $135,000.  Crossroads 2000 xi   ""We didn't have to empty the pop machines to make payroll, but it came close.""--Chris Anderson, superintendent of the Bennett County, South Dakota School District whose Impact Aid grant funds failed to arrive on schedule.   Congratulations, You're Not A Winner: When Linh Hua, a graduate student at the University of California, Irvine, received a letter informing her that she had been selected to receive an ED graduate fellowship worth as much as $100,000, she had no reason to question the integrity of the offer. But a few days later, Hua received a message on her answering machine that she had received the letter in error, due to a mistake by an ED contractor. The contractor had erroneously sent award notification letters to 39 students informing them that they had won the awards, which cover up to four years of graduate school tuition and living expenses. These are just a few examples of how the Administration has failed to ""reinvent"" the Department of Education so that it better serves the needs of parents and students.  HOW DO WE GET TO EXCELLENCE FROM HERE? At each level of education, excellence is achieved by putting student performance first. Results for all children from all backgrounds are what really matter. The way in which a given teacher, school, district or state decides to produce results will often vary. The key, however, is for everyone to be held to high standards. And it is not the government's role to micromanage how those standards are met. The federal role should be to remove obstacles that prevent state and local education officials from implementing programs that work for their students.  Flexibility for Schools and School Districts  ""Simply put, what we want is greater flexibility in the use of federal funds coupled with greater accountability for achieving the desired results."" - Paul Vallas, Superintendent of Chicago Public Schools23 In 1991, Minnesota's Governor Arne Carlson (R) enacted the first charter school law in the nation was enacted under. What started as just a trickle is now a tidal wave, with  Statement of Paul Vallas, Field Hearing on ""Chicago Education Reforms and the Importance of Flexibility in Federal Education Programs"", Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Chicago, Illinois, April 19, 1999.  23  Crossroads 2000 xii   more than 1,484 charter schools in 36 states, including Washington, D.C.24 For almost a decade, the idea of granting freedom from process requirements and regulations in exchange for accountability for producing results has swept many parts of the country and has inspired numerous education reforms at the state and federal level.  Charter Schools: State charter school laws free schools to put the needs of children first by giving them flexibility and freedom in managing their school and staff. The Subcommittee heard from a charter school in Florida that saw achievement gains and a $60,000 surplus in their first year. Another school used its charter status to creatively meet the needs of special education students.  States ""Demandating"" Districts: o Regulatory relief for Chicago: The Subcommittee visited Chicago in April 1999, the site of the first Crossroads hearing in 1995, and a city which ten years ago was one of the worst school districts in the country. In 1996, the state of Illinois ""de-mandated"" the city to free it to implement an aggressive reform plan. Since then the city has seen continuous improvement in academic achievement and graduation rates. Flexibility with Accountability Produces Achievement gains in Texas: By holding schools accountable for improving the achievement of all students and granting flexibility to reach those goals, Texas has led the country in improved achievement and narrowing achievement gaps, according to the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). From 1994 to 2000, the percentage of Texas students passing all parts of the state skills test (TAAS) has increased by 51 percent, and the number of both minority students and economically disadvantaged students passing TAAS increased by 89%. On the 1996 NAEP Math Test, Whites and African Americans in Texas had the highest scores in the nation, and Latinos in Texas had the second highest scores in the nation. ""Charter districts"": Florida is experimenting with the concept of charter districts, granting charter status to certain districts based on an application setting forth certain performance goals. In exchange, the districts are freed from 800 pages of state requirements.  o  o  As of September 1999. See: U.S. Department of Education, State of Charter Schools 2000: 4 Report, January 2000, p. 1.  24  th  Year  Crossroads 2000 xiii   Empower Parents Putting student performance first also means empowering parents to make the best decisions about their child's education.  Choice leads to achievement gains: The Subcommittee visited Florida, where the state empowers parents to send their children to a school of choice if their local school receives a failing grade for two years in a row. For the 2000-2001 school year, the second year of the program, no additional schools received ""failing"" grades and scores improved overall statewide. Further building the case for choice, two studies were released in August 2000 finding achievement gains among recipients of privately funded vouchers in Washington D.C., Dayton, OH, Charlotte, N.C., and New York City.  U.S. Department of Ed study calls for choice experiment: In addition to public opinion favoring testing vouchers, a 1999 National Research Council (NRC) study commissioned by the U.S. Department of Education called for a ""large and ambitious"" ten-year, multi-district voucher experiment. According to the report, a large-scale voucher study would help determine whether giving public school students vouchers to pay for tuition at private schools can improve achievement, especially for students in poor, urban areas.25   Study finds education freedom linked to higher student achievement: A recent  study found that even after controlling for income, population demographics, income, education spending and class size, the amount of education freedom in a state is a significant predictor of student achievement. Texas and South Carolina, for example, are similar in characteristics that are commonly thought to influence student achievement, but Texas test scores are significantly higher. Texas offers more freedom, ranking 6th among states. South Carolina received a score that placed them 43rd.26  Congress Works to Free States to Put Results First and Reward Success Inspired by the success of charter schools, and the success of Chicago and states like Texas, Congress took some important initial steps in rolling back federal requirements in order to place more of an emphasis on results.

Dollars to the Classroom: The House has made it a priority to send more dollars to the classroom. On September 18, 1998 the House passed the Dollars to the Classroom Act (H.R. 3248) by a vote of 212-198. This bill consolidates duplicative education programs and ensures that 95 percent of federal dollars reach the classroom. On October 12, 1999, the House passed H. Res. 303, the Dollars to the Classroom Resolution, which called on Congress to work towards ensuring that more federal dollars are used in the classroom to improve achievement  More flexibility by expanding ""Ed-Flex"": Congress lifted the cap on the number of states that can apply to participate in Ed-Flex through The Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-25). Ed-Flex allows states to approve local waiver requests, instead of locals having to apply directly to the U.S. Secretary.  ""Charter States"": The Academic Achievement for All Act (Straight A's) is similar to the concept of charter schools: grant freedom from regulations and process requirements in exchange for accountability for producing results. Under Straight A's, Washington assumes the role of shareholder, not CEO, of the nation's education enterprise. Rather than micromanaging the day-to-day uses of federal money, it lets states manage their schools and dollars as they see fit in return for an agreed-on return on the federal investment in terms of gains in academic achievement.   Fulfill Federal Commitment to Special Education: In order to assist states and  somewhat relieve the burden of this mandate, the House passed H.R. 4055, the IDEA Full Funding Act of 2000, which authorizes an increase of $2 billion for each fiscal year so that by FY 2010 the appropriation is authorized at $25 billion. According to Department of Education estimates, $25 billion is enough to ensure that the federal government's commitment to fund 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure would be met.  CONCLUSION: PUT CHILDREN FIRST SO THAT NO CHILD IS LEFT BEHIND Over the last two years the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations has collected research, oversight and hearing data that continue to make the case that changes need to be made at all levels of government to ensure that children are truly put first in education. The lack of progress in improving achievement and narrowing achievement gaps, as well as the continued inequities in access to high quality education are unacceptable. Years of mismanagement, fraud and waste at the Department have also hurt children by reflecting poorly on the federal government's commitment to education. Crossroads 2000 xv   Simply put, the interests of children and parents are second to too many other interests. Too often education policy debates are not honest because of a fear of change and of any new policy that disrupts the status quo. Americans are not satisfied with the status quo  especially Americans with children trapped in low-performing schools. Congress should act swiftly during the next Congress to enact legislation that is right for children and their parents.  Empower Parents  Expand, empower and protect charter schools.  Enact education tax deductions.  Encourage school choice.  Expand Flexibility and Accountability for Results  Empower school districts to improve teacher quality or reduce class size according to their needs.  Put performance and accountability first and enact the Straight A's Act.  Empower schools to pay teachers according to their performance  Focus the federal role in education on important goals and consolidate and eliminate duplicative and ineffective education programs.  Work to Ensure that ALL Have Access to a High Quality Education  Place a priority on raising the achievement of all students, even the lowest performing students.  Free children from failing schools.  Fight illiteracy among disadvantaged students.  Ensure that Federal Dollars are Spent With Integrity at the Department of Education  Conduct oversight to ensure that the Department meets its goal of receiving a clean, independent audit.  Institute institutional checks and balances to ensure that education research, statistics and evaluations are conducted and presented in a rigorous and unbiased manner.  Work to improve overall management and quality of the Department's management of its finances and internal operations in order to reduce waste, fraud and abuse.  Crossroads 2000 xvi   Make the Federal Role in Education Less Burdensome  Eliminate or consolidate duplicative programs.  Eliminate ineffective programs  Improve evaluation and oversight of federal programs to ensure that federal dollars produce results.  Reform the Department's Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) so that it serves the needs of teachers and students, not researchers, so that we know what really works in the classroom.  Ensure that federal research and program evaluation activities employ rigorous research methods in order to produce credible, useful results. There is too much at stake to allow the federal education system to dictate how children are educated in the United States. There is too much at stake to waste scarce resources on mismanagement and failed programs. Congress should work to make the difficult policy decisions that need to be made at the federal level, and empower states and parents to ensure that student performance is put first, not the status quo.  Crossroads 2000 xvii    THE ROAD TO EXCELLENCE PART I: WE' RE  NOT THERE YET  In Education at a Crossroads: What Works and What's Wasted in Education Today, the Subcommittee reported that America's education system is at the intersection of two paths: one leading to excellence, the other to mediocrity. Through hearings and extensive research, the Subcommittee examined the characteristics of schools and districts that lead down the road to excellence as well as down the road to mediocrity - what is wasted in education. During the 106th Congress, the Subcommittee has continued to look beyond the crossroads toward states, districts, and schools that have emerged as shining examples of excellence over the last two decades. How have they achieved excellence? By implementing policies that put student performance first. What Does Excellence Look Like? For the first time since the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) began measuring academic achievement 30 years ago, an entire decade has passed without significant and substantial achievement gains. Since the release of the previous Crossroads report, student achievement data has been released that gives us a complete picture of achievement over the last decade. The data shows that apart from some very small gains in math scores, achievement has leveled off in most grades and subject areas. This is after gains made during the 1970s and 80s. More troubling is that achievement gaps have not narrowed, despite intensive federal efforts to target funds to disadvantaged students. The Stagnant Nineties End Decades of Growth  In 1998, NAEP reading scores for 4th and 12th graders failed to improve over their 1992 levels.27  Long term trend NAEP scores for 1999 report only small, but statistically significant, gains in math scores for students aged 9 and 13.28  National Center for Education Statistics, NAEP 1998 Reading Report Card for the Nation and the States, U.S. Department of Education, Washington, D.C., March 1999, p. 17. 28 National Center for Education Statistics, NAEP 1999 Trends in Academic Progress, U.S. Department of Education, Washington, D.C., August 2000, p. xi.  27  Crossroads 2000 1    58 percent of disadvantaged children in fourth grade were ""below basic"" on the 1998 National NAEP Reading exam.29  U.S. 12th graders only outperformed two out of 21 nations in 30 mathematics; Not one single country scored below the United States on the assessment of advanced mathematics.

In Physics, 12th grader scores were also at the bottom.31  99   American students fall farther behind students from other countries the longer they are in school.32  A forthcoming study of national achievement data by the Education Trust concludes ""that public high schools have declined dramatically over the last 10 years - and now yield less academic growth among their students than in any other phase of the public school system.""33 According to the report, smaller gains in high school are the result of less rigorous curriculum that includes fewer challenging reading assignments than a decade ago.

In just about every age group and subjects, the gaps have grown since 1986.

Crossroads 2000 3   Public Frustrated with the Status Quo The stagnant achievement and education inequities of the nineties are reflected in public opinion about education. According to an analysis of recent polling by the non-partisan, nonprofit research organization Public Agenda, data indicates that the average American is ""hardly endorsing the status quo.""38 While most Americans do not want to dismantle the current system, frustration is running high  especially among minorities. Education is consistently cited in national polls as the most important policy issue during the 2000 election year. While many Americans are initially supportive of their local school, when questioned further they are more critical. According to Public Agenda, ""the prevailing view is that public education as a whole is in bad shape and renewed efforts are needed to fix it."" For example,  52 percent think local private schools do a better job of educating students  only 19 percent think public schools are better.  A 1999 Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies poll found that while 59 percent consider their local public schools to be excellent or good, only 39.7 percent of African-Americans rated their local schools that highly.39  58 percent of employers surveyed say that graduates coming from public schools lack the skills needed to succeed in the work world.40  Fewer Americans Believe that Reforming the Existing Education System Will Work 80% 70% 60% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% 0% Refo rm Existing Syste m 1997  71 % 59%  34% 23 %  F ind Alternative Syste m 200 0  Source: Public Agenda  38 39 40  Public Agenda Online: Clarifying Issues 2000, ""Education"", www.publicagenda.org.

Crossroads 2000 4    The percent of Americans who think that in order to improve education the focus should be on offering alternatives to the existing education system increased from 1997 to 2000.41 In summary, while student performance has been at the center of education rhetoric in America, it has not been in practice. Consequently, achievement is not where it should be, and most Americans are not satisfied by the status quo. We are not seeing the results we should expect to see for the nation's investments in education. T CURRENT FEDERAL ROLE DOES NOT REWA RESULTS  HE  RD  ""...We must fundamentally change the way the federal government treats public schools. If we continue down the current road - where responsibility, authority, and accountability for American education flow not toward but away from parents, especially poor parents - then we will continue to see what we are seeing: too much low performance, too many bad schools, too many wasted lives."" 42  Former Secretary of Education William Bennett Common to all of the principles of success highlighted in the previous Education at a Crossroads is that the needs of students and student performance should be central to all aspects of education policy. Rather than encouraging putting performance first, however, education policy, especially at the federal level, has too often put first the needs of the education ""system""  compliance with its rules and requirements. States and school districts have generally complied with federal requirements, but too often those requirements have very little to do with improving student performance, consequently diverting resources from achieving that purpose. As Time Magazine reported earlier this year, over the last eight years, ""the Education Department has done little to reward schools that flourish and nothing to sanction schools that persistently fail.""43 Since 1965, when Washington embarked on its first major elementary-secondary education initiative, federal policy has strongly influenced America's schools. Although education is generally considered a state and local responsibility, over the years Congress has created hundreds of programs intended to address problems in education. The shape of new education programs is often determined by political polls and focus groups, rather than the actual needs of students and teachers.44 Today, the federal government pursues its education agenda through a wide range of programs; over sixty of them, funded at nearly $14 billion, are included in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), which was reauthorized in 1994 and is presently due to be reauthorized. Creating a ""program for every problem,"" as the Crossroads report found, begins to add up, such that there are more than 760 ""education"" and  41 42  Ibid.

According to William Moloney, Superintendent of Colorado Schools, ""ESEA [has] remained as always a neutral phenomena based on inputs rather than results, more on accounting than accountability, an entity always more interested in what you were rather than what you were doing.""49 Indeed, without asking whether or not programs produce results, Washington each year funds an increasing number of education programs. Despite attempts to repeal and consolidate unnecessary and duplicative education programs, according to the Congressional Research Service, the number of Congressionally-funded programs at the Department of Education has steadily increased for the last four fiscal years (Table 1).  Dumping Education Dollars into Unproven Programs Because federal policy makers have long been content with measuring success in terms of inputs and compliance, in lieu of results, the nation lacks sufficient information to determine what really works and what does not when it comes to helping students succeed. The current federal role in education research funds a confusing array of research centers, labs, technical assistance centers and other entities located around the country. For a variety of reasons, ""educational research and development usually have not been held in high esteem in the twentieth century.""50 According to GAO, ""information about the federal education effort is For the most recent data on total federal funding of education, see Table 1 in the National Center for Education Statistics' Federal Support for Education, 1980-2000, September 2000, p. 5, http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2000/2000068.pdf. 46 Throughout this report, the U.S. Department of Education is referred to as either ""ED"" or ""the Department."" 47 This table only accounts for funded programs: There are authorized programs that do not receive funding, and unauthorized programs that do. 48 Chester Finn, Jr., Marci Kanstoroom, Michael Petrilli, ""Overview: Thirty-Four Years of Dashed Hopes,"" New Directions: Federal Education Policy in the Twenty-First Century, The Thomas B.

According to the National Research Council, ""social science research currently provides few definitive answers about how to improve educational outcomes for [disadvantaged] children.""53 A RAND Corporation study found that ""the research and development community in education has been unable to provide consensus results or pilot tested policies and practices that could guide policy makers and educators to more effective practices.""54 One reporter described the situation in this manner: ""[w]hen medical researchers want to know whether a drug works, they compare outcomes of a group taking the drug to those not taking it. But that type of experiment is rarely done in education.""55 Instead, educators rely on ""a hunch...[o]r at best, a hunch based on trial and error.""56 The largest federal elementary and secondary education program, Title I, which is designed to close the achievement gap between disadvantaged students and non-disadvantaged students, has yet to demonstrate that it has been effective in doing so. Today, even though the law requires states to ""turn-around"" low-performing schools, there are nearly 7,000 Title I schools (19% of Title I schools) and about 1,000 school districts (15% of Title I districts) that are officially designated as in need of ""improvement""--that are failing to make adequate annual achievement gains. The final report of the Prospects evaluation of Chapter 1 (later renamed as Title I) found that the program was not sufficient for at-risk students in high-poverty schools to close their academic achievement gaps with students in low-poverty schools.57 And most recently, early data available from the evaluation of Title I since the 1994 reauthorization indicate that the program is not narrowing achievement gaps any more effectively. The interim report found that Title I students in the study performed ""somewhat below national and urban norms,"" and were ""showing somewhat less progress than would be expected over a full year."" The proportion of students meeting the highest proficiency levels merely held steady during the two years for which data have been made available.58 In the last two years several studies further confirm this description of education research and practice: U.S. General Accounting Office, Federal Education Funding: Multiple Programs and Lack of Data Raise Efficiency and Effectiveness Concerns, Statement of Carlotta Joyner before the Senate Education Task Force, GAO/T-HEHS-98-46, November 6, 1997, p. 12. 52 Ibid, p. 13. 53 National Research Council, Making Money Matter: Financing America's Schools, National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., September 1999, p. 268. 54 David Grissmer, Ann Flanagan, Jennifer Kawata, Stephanie Williamson, Improving Student Achievement: What State NAEP Scores Tell Us, RAND, July 2000, p. xxxvi. 55 ""Bilingual Education Fails Test, Exposing Deeper Problem,"" USA Today editorial, August 28, 2000. 56 Richard Whitmire, ""Research  Education's Achilles Heel,"" Gannett New Service, May 5, 2000. 57 Michael J.

After an exhaustive review, the panel concluded that less than one third of the studies met their standards for academic and scientific rigor.59 Title I research unable to answer important questions about effectiveness: At the request of groups such as the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, the American Institutes of Research studied 24 Title I ""schoolwide"" comprehensive reform models currently marketed to local school districts. Of those 24 reform strategies, only three could provide strong evidence that the programs were likely to have positive effects on student achievement. Seven of the programs could not provide any research-based findings at all.""60 The Department has little information that enables anyone to conclude whether Title I schoolwides are effective. A national evaluation was conducted, but because there were so few schools, researchers could not draw conclusions on the basis its findings.61 Not only do we not the effectiveness of program's impact. Change (LESCP) is have research about Title I schoolwides, the most recent evaluation of Title I will not likely answer questions policy makers have about the GAO found that the Department's Longitudinal Evaluation of School ""unlikely to fully satisfy any of its three potential purposes.""62      Spending more money isn't the only answer: The National Research Council's 1999 report Making Money Matter, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education, reported that ""We have reviewed the literature on whether and how money matters. That review makes it clear that additional funding for education will not automatically and necessarily generate student achievement and in the past has not, in fact, generally led to higher achievement."" While there is currently a debate in the research community on the role of resources in improving education, it is clear that increasing funding alone will not guarantee results.  Dr. Reid Lyon of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development summed up at a Committee hearing how we have reached the end of the 20th century knowing so little about what works in the classroom: ... the investments we have made in research for the last 30 years have been investments that have been realized by mediocrity, by limited rigor, and by a misunderstanding on a large part of the research community how in fact to even do the research we drastically 59 Testimony of Dr. Reid Lyon, Chief, Child Development and Behavior Branch, National Institutes of Health, Hearing on ""Options for the Future of the Office of Education Research and Improvement,"" Subcommittee on Early Childhood Youth and Families, Committee on Education and the Workforce, May 4, 2000. 60 Rebecca Herman, An Educators' Guide to Schoolwide Reform, American Institutes for Research, 1999. 61 GAO, Title I Program: Stronger Accountability Needed for Performance of Disadvantaged Students, GAO/HEHS-00-89, June 2000. 62 GAO, Education for Disadvantaged Children: Research Purpose and Design Conclusions Drawn from Key Studies, GAO/HEHS-00-168, August 2000, p. 11.  Crossroads 2000 8   need. It is no wonder that teachers have no trust in having research guide their practice, because research that is not done well, that is not of good quality, does not inform and should not be trusted.63 It is impossible to make wise decisions about funding federal education programs when so little is known about what works in the classroom, and so little of valid research reaches the classroom. And yet despite this lack of research, each year new programs are created at the federal level, without anyone knowing whether they will truly help children learn. Federally Endorsed Math Curriculum The Department experienced disastrous results when it attempted to clarify what works in the classroom, but without basing their conclusions on scientific research. In October of 1999, the U.S. Department of Education endorsed five programs for K-12 mathematics classes as ""exemplary"" and another five as ""promising"". An ""Expert Panel"" selected by the Office of Education Research and Improvement (OERI) made the recommendations to Secretary Riley. ED approved the programs and sent out information about the endorsement to all school districts in the country. In response to the backing of the Department of Education for such programs, two hundred mathematicians and scientists from universities nationwide published an open letter of protest to Secretary Riley in the Washington Post. The letter cited ""serious mathematical shortcomings"" within the endorsed programs and asked that Riley withdraw the entire list of curricula followed by an announcement of the withdrawal to the public. The letter also noted that the Expert Panel that selected the ten programs was not comprised of active research mathematicians. Several concerns raised by the teaching of ""fuzzy math"" include: a lack of understanding of mathematical basics, the continuation of decreased standardized test scores, and the possible triggering of increased remedial education for students in higher education. In response to the Department's recognition of the ten ""exemplary"" and ""promising"" math programs, the Committee held a hearing on the ""Federal Role in K-12 Mathematics Reform"" on February 2, 2000. The human consequences of using unproven math curricula was illustrated at the hearing by a student who had learned math under one of the endorsed curriculum and related her own experience. University of Michigan student Rachel Tronstein testified that for all of high school, she was in an accelerated program within the Core Plus curriculum. After four years of Core Plus and the transition to math at the university level, she had this to say about the curriculum: I was enrolled in Algebra II in 8th grade, which traditionally is the curriculum for a junior in high school.... I then entered...High School, where I was in the Core Plus curriculum, and I went through four years. I took Calculus my senior year because I was in the accelerated track, and also I received private tutoring for my entire four years of high school because my parents were concerned that I wasn't getting a very good understanding of the fundamentals and basics of math. And I Testimony of Reid Lyon, ""Hearing on Options for the Future of the Office of Educational Research and Improvement,"" Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth and Families, May 4, 2000. 63  Crossroads 2000 9   also attended Stanford University's summer session for high school students in the summer of 1998, and I took a remedial pre-calculus course... And a lot of those concepts were concepts to which I had never been exposed, which was obviously very frustrating because every other student in the class had. Right now, I am a student at the University of Michigan... I took Calculus I fall term. I received a B minus, while in my other three classes I received A's, and I worked harder in the Calculus course. [Core Plus] fails to teach students basic mathematical skills required for postsecondary educational success. It creates a calculator dependency. And sure, you can compute an answer, but you have no understanding of how or why that answer is correct, which does not enable you to understand further calculations or applications. ED's pseudo-endorsement of math curricula is troubling, not only because the Department is prohibited by statute from officially endorsing any curriculum, but also because the process by which it selected ""exemplary"" math programs was based on peer reviewers and a panel of ""experts,"" not rigorous research demonstrating that the programs were effective. Any federal recognition, whether or not it is an ""official"" endorsement, can unduly influence school districts to select a math curriculum that is not necessarily a proven program. Federal Programs Take Their Toll ""One thing that Mayor Daley, Board President Gery Chico and I firmly believe and have urged Congress and the President repeatedly to do is to leave it up to the local school districts to decide how best to meet the student needs. Focus on results and leave it up to school districts to decide how to achieve them."" 64 Paul Vallas, Superintendent of Chicago Public Schools  The cumulative effect of federally designed programs and requirements that are not grounded in good research continues to take its toll at the state and local level. The Subcommittee continued to hear from witnesses at hearings around the country that many wellintentioned federal programs provide funding with burdensome requirements that have nothing to do with producing results. At a hearing in Battle Creek, Michigan on September 8, 1999, Mr. John DeLine, Superintendent of Tekonsha Community Schools, described his experience with federal programs: My staff and myself spent over 600 hours trying to decipher [federal special education requirements], so it may be something that you want to consider in the future once you pass something. Six hundred hours is a lot of hours. ...Every law that's passed has a tremendous impact on us as far as staff.65  Statement of Paul Vallas, Field Hearing, Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Chicago, Illinois, April 19, 1999.

They ""put about 200 hours into [federal grant applications] and got one grant out of about ten."" He asked the Committee to grant small school districts like his with fewer than 600 students more flexibility to deal with federal requirements. ""Hold us accountable and we will show you success."" Colorado Education Commissioner Bill Moloney observed in testimony before the Subcommittee on January 25, 2000, ""[i]n medieval times, people were sometimes pressed to death by having heavy stones piled upon their bodies until all breath and life was squeezed from them. The current U.S. Congress made a valiant attempt to lift some of those stones from the body of state and local folks. Certain very worthwhile successes were achieved but all too many stones remain. We still await the day when ESEA can truly be redesigned to fulfill the dreams we had for it in 1965..."" According to one witness, a fundamental lack of trust of states and school districts is what is primarily behind these burdensome federal requirements. In testimony before the House Budget Committee's Education Task Force (chaired by Rep. Hoekstra, (R-MI)), Susan Sclafani, the Chief of Staff of Educational Services of the Houston Independent School District, described how political compromise has resulted in mandates and requirements that divert attention and resources from the real needs of students. ...the district currently spends a minimum of three man-days per month creating the documentation of use of federal funds as a supplement to district funds, rather than supplanting [a federal fiscal requirement]. To demonstrate comparability-- that the district is not spending less in local funds in Title 1 schools than it spends in non-Title 1 schools--the accounting department staff must compute every expenditure for staff, materials, equipment, and contracted services. With staffing, this is particularly difficult to do on a monthly basis, since one must forecast stipends that are paid annually or semi-annually as part of the equation. However, it must be done monthly so that if a discrepancy is discovered it can be remedied over the rest of the year. If that does not happen...the district will be out of compliance....[T]he whole equation is thrown off whenever a teacher leaves one school and is replaced by a teacher with more or less experience. In a large urban district, this happens frequently, forcing the accounting department to recalculate their ...figures ... Clearly, this procedure has nothing to do with the district's commitment to equity nor does it ensure increased levels of student achievement.66 Ms. Sclafani's testimony provides a stark picture of the consequences of overdependence on process requirements and compliance at the local level: a diversion of resources from improving student achievement.

You would all be heroes in your home states for doing so!- Minnesota State Rep. Alice Seagren Aside from being a classic study of unintended consequences, this law [IDEA] made promises to local people that have not been remotely kept. It is not just the financial default. The most tragic result is that the suffocating blanket of regulation actively worked against the learning prospects of our handicapped children.  Colorado Commissioner of Education Bill Moloney  One of the most significant unfunded mandates on school districts is the special education mandate. Even the most efficient and effective schools and districts in the country are still confronted with the daunting task of complying with the federal special education mandate. The Subcommittee has heard from many school districts about the burden that the special education mandate places on them financially, and how it restricts their freedom in using their education dollars. In 1975, the United States Congress passed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which requires school districts to provide a free and appropriate public education to students with disabilities and to develop individual education plans (IEP) for those students. Congress has not yet met the funding commitment it made 24 years ago to children with special education needs. That commitment was to provide children with disabilities access to a quality public education and to contribute 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure to assist states and local school districts with the excess costs of educating such children. To date it only funds about 13 percent of those costs. Inadequately funding IDEA not only hinders the ability of schools to provide children with disabilities with an appropriate education, but also prevents all students from receiving a quality education. In order to assist states and somewhat relieve the burden of this mandate, the House or Representatives passed H.R. 4055, the IDEA Full Funding Act of 2000, which authorizes increasing appropriations for IDEA Part B (State Grants) for FY2001 through FY2010. H.R. 4055 authorizes an increase of $2 billion for each fiscal year so that by FY2010 the appropriation is authorized at $25 billion. According to the Department of Education's estimates, $25 billion would ensure that the federal government's commitment in to fund 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure would be met. Congress should continue its efforts to meet its IDEA funding obligations before investing in new programs of unknown effectiveness. As the Table 2 below indicates, this would provide significant sums of money for school districts and free up resources at the local level.

To overcome this legacy and to lead the way in national education reform, ED must refashion and revitalize its programs, management and systems."" --The Report of the National Performance Review, Office of the Vice President, September 1993  ""Here is a Department that is promoting standards and excellence [for schools] but appears to have less of a commitment to high standards for itself."" 67-- Paul C. Light, Brookings Institution  The federal role in education is carried out primarily by the Department of Education. While the present role of ED is to inject cutting edge reforms into America's classrooms, the agency is itself a showroom for obsolescent government management practices. As an inefficient bureaucracy, the Department was specifically targeted by Vice President Al Gore's National Performance Review (NPR), whose purpose is ""to create a government that `works better, costs less, and gets results Americans care about."" Back in 1993, Gore and the NPR identified ED as a troubled agency in need of significant reform. It was to be ""reinvented"" as a high-performing outfit. This has not come to pass. During the past eight years, the Administration has not accomplished its overall goals and promises for reinvention at the Department of Education. In 2000, ED spent nearly 50% more than it did in 1994, and administered more programs. Man y NPR recommendations have not been fully implemented, others not at all. Despite the VicePresident's promises to make government work better, the bottom line is that the NPR has not produced significant results at ED. The agency continues to be rife with waste, fraud and abuse.

These weaknesses have been very similar from year to year, starting with Education's first agency-wide audit for Fiscal Year 1995.""-Testimony of Gloria Jarmon of the General Accounting Office at March 1, 2000 Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee hearing  67  Judy Pasternak, ""Department a Haven for Clinton Loyalists,"" Los Angeles Times, October 3, 1999.  Crossroads 2000 14   The Department of Education failed its agency-wide audit each of the past two years. These audits were the focus of recent Subcommittee hearings held on December 6, 1999 and March 1, 2000. ED was the last federal agency to receive an audit report for FY 1998; the report was issued in November 1999, eight months after the statutory deadline. Even so, auditors could not express an opinion on any of the agency's financial statements. Anomalies included an $800 million balance for a single student loan, a $6 billion discrepancy in the financial statements and $700 million placed in an inappropriate account.  EVEN THE INSPECTOR GENERAL UNABLE TO QUANTIFY THE EXTENT OF WASTE AND ABUSE AT THE DEPARTMENT Rep. Norwood (R-GA): ""Is there anybody here that can answer the question how many dollars have been lost of the taxpayers' money to date either through criminal activity or abuse..."" Lorraine Lewis (ED Inspector General): ""No"" Rep. Norwood: ""Nobody knows? Well, you want to know why the American taxpayer gets upset with stuff like this? They want to know. This is not about public education. It is about a federal agency that has gone awry.  The FY 1999 audit report, (Exchange occurring during the Oversight Subcommittee's released on March 1, 2000, was another September 19, 2000 hearing on financial management problems failure. The number of material at the Department of Education) weaknesses in the agency's financial controls increased. The outlook for the FY 2000 audit report, due out in March 2001, also appears grim. ED officials have attributed financial management difficulties to a lack of funding for qualified personnel. An October 3, 1999 story appearing in the Los Angeles Times, however, offers another explanation, noting that ED has the highest ratio of political appointees to government workers of any Cabinet agency: ""Midway through Clinton's first term, Education's inspector general began warning that the department lacked employees with critical computer and financial skills and that it needed people with expertise to oversee outside contractors. This shortage has continued while increasing numbers of political appointees have been added, said Dianne van Riper, who retired in January as the department's assistant inspector general for investigations. `When you decide to spend a dollar on hiring one kind of employee and not another, you're making a decision,' Van Riper said.""  Crossroads 2000 15   A Lack of Accountability ""We all know the potential cost of lagging (financial management) systems: They contributed to the $300 billion savings and loan bailout, $47 in nontax delinquent debt, $3.6 billion in student loan defaults, and so on. Fortunately, the process of updating our management information systems has begun.""-The Report of the National Performance Review, Office of the Vice President, September 1993  ""The Department's new accounting system could not perform an automated year-end closing process and directly produce consolidated financial statements as would normally be expected from such systems. This meant that the Department had to use a costly, labor-intensive and time-consuming manual process to prepare its financial statements.""- Gloria Jarmon of the General Accounting Office, testifying at a Dec. 6, 1999 O & I hearing  During the recently completed fiscal year, FY 2000, the Department operated without an integrated financial management system that met generally accepted accounting standards. In the past, the lack of such an effective system has contributed to failed audits. This means it is unlikely that the Department will receive a clean audit opinion on its FY 2000 audit report, due out in March 2001. Despite Chairman Hoekstra's expressed interest in its progress, the deadline for implementation of such a system has been postponed several times by ED  the current deadline is the summer of 2001. In the meantime, without a good accounting system in place, Department staff compiles financial statements for auditors manually, and practically from scratch. This process is both time-consuming and expensive, typically involving the hiring of outside contractors, according to expert testimony delivered at hearings held by the Oversight Subcommittee. Congratulations, You're Not A Winner ""Public cynicism about government is a cancer on democracy.

But when Linh Hua, a graduate student at the University of California, Irvine, received a letter in February informing her that she had been selected to receive an ED graduate fellowship worth as much as $100,000, she had no reason to question the integrity of the offer.

Readin', Ritin' And Robbery  ""The recently discovered loss of U.S. Department of Education (ED) property has brought renewed visibility to lax management controls over information technology assets...The 1999 physical inventory of IT assets was the first since 1994. There was no attempt to reconcile the earlier inventory or to review computer surplusing actions.""- February 10, 2000 Memorandum from the Department's Office of the Inspector General to the Deputy Secretary of Education  A theft ring involving collaboration between outside contractors and ED employees operated for at least three years, stealing more than $300,000 worth of electronic equipment, including five $8,000 Gateway computers, cell phones, VCRs and a 61"" television set. It also netted from the agency more than $600,000 in false overtime pay. An ED employee charged with overseeing a telecommunications contract took advantage of her position by collaborating with contract employees working under her supervision to steer equipment bought with Department of Education dollars to her house and friends and relatives homes. Other ED employees were also in on the scheme. One of the contract workers confessed to doing personal errands for the ED contract officer, such as driving to Baltimore to bring her crab cakes to eat for lunch at her desk in Washington, DC. In return, she signed off on false weekend and holiday hours that the contractor never worked. This network operated undetected for at least three years. The theft ring is still under investigation, but several defendants have pled guilty in federal court, and more pleas are expected soon. Federal law enforcement officials are currently investigating several other instances of large-scale theft at ED. Crossroads 2000 17   Low-Impact Aid ""We didn't have to empty the pop machines to make payroll, but it came close.""- Chris Anderson, superintendent of the Bennett County, South Dakota School District, quoted in an Associated Press news story. Anderson was referring to the dilemma created for the district when federal Impact Aid grant funds failed to arrive on schedule.  The Impact Aid grant program sends money to school districts serving federally connected children, such as those living on military installations or Indian reservations. In April 2000, two South Dakota school districts failed to receive expected Impact Aid grant payments totaling $1.9 million. District administrators did not immediately notify the Department of Education, since delayed disbursement of Impact Aid grants by ED has become routine. It is not uncommon for school districts to be forced to borrow money from a local bank  and pay interest on the loan  while waiting for ED to get grant payments out the door. In this case, the $1.9 million was wired to the wrong bank accounts. According to a Justice Department complaint filed in July, the money was electronically wired by an ED employee into two bank accounts set up by con men. The thieves submitted fraudulent direct deposit forms to ED, substituting their own bank account numbers for those of the South Dakota school districts. Stolen funds from one bank account were used to purchase a 2000 Cadillac Escalade and a 2000 Lincoln Navigator. Stolen funds from the other bank account were used to purchase real property in the State of Maryland worth $135,000. Disturbingly, the potential for theft in the Impact Aid program had previously been raised in the Department's FY 1999 audit report. Concerning Impact Aid, the report describes, ""an inadequate segregation of duties in sensitive areas, such as payment processing,"" whereby the same individuals are able to process and approve a payment drawdown request. The theft of Impact Aid funds and the potential for similar fraud were examined at a September 19, 2000 hearing held by the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee.  It Takes A Village...On Mars The Subcommittee discovered that the Department of Education spent $2.7 million between FY 1998 and FY 2000 in support of the White House Millennium Council (run out of the Office of the First Lady) and its Mars Millennium Project. The Mars Project invites schools to imagine and design a village on Mars that might exist in 2030. Six ED employees were assigned to work full time on Millennium activities -- all but one of them worked out of the White House executive offices. The Department paid for a variety of printed materials, as well as the development of the White House Millennium Council logo and a Millennium Council web site.  Crossroads 2000 18   Dead...And Loving It ""Education continues to experience challenges in its management of student financial aid programs, which we have designated as at high risk for fraud, waste, abuse or mismanagement...The Department lacks the integrated financial systems to provide basic information...the current system cannot always identify where a student is enrolled, even after a student grant or loan is awarded, and thousands of dollars in student aid have been disbursed. As a result, ineligible students could be receiving funds.""--High-Risk Series: An Update, General Accounting Office, January 1999 ED improperly discharged almost $77 million in student loans for borrowers who falsely claimed to be either permanently disabled or deceased, according to an Inspector General (IG) report released in June 1999.  From July 1, 1994 through December 31, 1996, fully 23 percent of all individuals whose loans were discharged due to disability claims were actually holding jobs -some earning more than $50,000. A total of $73 million in loans was improperly forgiven. During the same time period, 708 borrowers receiving death discharges totaling over $3.8 million were earning wages after the discharge. (The Higher Education Act provides for loan discharges when the borrower either becomes totally and permanently disabled or dies. In enforcing this provision, however, ED did not require the disability form to include, e.g., the doctor's professional license number or office telephone number, and it did not require certified copies of death certificates.) The same IG study found that more than 6,800 new loans totaling almost $20 million were awarded to borrowers who returned to school after previously having loans discharged due to total and permanent disability. In other words, the $20 million in loans was awarded to ineligible individuals. Failing Proofreading 101 About 10 million American students fill out a federal financial aid form each year to apply for college aid. The job of designing, printing, distributing and processing these forms is entrusted to the Department of Education's Office of Student Financial Assistance (SFA), which the National Performance Review identified as one of the thirty-two ""High Impact"" federal agencies which have ninety-percent of the federal government's contact with the public. Unfortunately, SFA continues to experience problems annually with the student aid forms. In September 1999, SFA printed 3.5 million financial aid forms containing errors -incorrect line references to the IRS tax form. The forms were destroyed and the 100,000 of them that were distributed to schools had to be recalled. The cost of the mistake, according to the head Crossroads 2000 19     of SFA: $720,000. Perhaps most disturbing is the fact that SFA officials never noticed the flaws in the aid form they created and printed. It was an eagle-eyed university financial aid administrator who spotted the errors and brought them to attention. A $5 Million Technology Lesson ED invested several million dollars on a pet project of the Vice President's that was abandoned after just one year. At the urging of the Vice President's National Performance Review (NPR) team, ED initiated a project called ""Access America"" that was to eventually involve distributing to college students ATM-style ""smart cards"" to be used to access federal student aid and, eventually, other types of federal benefits. House Education Committee members, as well as most banks and colleges, objected that the project was unnecessary and required too much federal involvement. But ED initiated a pilot project soon after an NPR official transitioned into a high-level post in SFA. The pilot involved eight colleges, and the plan was to do a nationwide rollout within two years. In June 2000, however, the project was quietly terminated after its first year due to a lack of interest from colleges. ED had already spent $5.4 million on the initiative. Federal Frequent Fliers During fiscal year 1999, ED spent $13.5 million on travel expenses for agency employees. That translates into $2,882 per FTE (full-time equivalent employee). The office with the highest travel budget is SFA -- more than 100 SFA employees traveled to Disney World Headquarters in Orlando, Florida during 2000 to attend management-training seminars at the Disney Institute. The 192-Step Discretionary Grants Approval Process The Crossroads report described how the Vice-President's National Performance Review found in 1993 that the discretionary grant approval process lasted 26 weeks and took 487 steps from start to finish. In 1996 ED implemented a plan to begin ""streamlining"" the grant review process to 20 weeks and 216 steps. The Subcommittee submitted a letter to the Department in July 1998 to find out if the redesigned discretionary grant approval process had been successfully implemented, and whether it could verify that applications were being processed more quickly and efficiently. While it reported meeting many of its goals, ED did not provide any substantive documentation to prove that the implementation was successful in making the process more efficient. Of course, enhanced efficiency was the only legitimate goal of the streamlining effort. Therefore, Chairman Hoekstra requested GAO to look into the Department's management of discretionary grants to determine whether the approval process had in fact become more Crossroads 2000 20   efficient. GAO also looked at how grants were awarded, the peer review process, characteristics of grant recipients, and the costs of applying for a grant. In response to the GAO audit, Acting Deputy Secretary Mike Smith established a task force to address GAO recommendations.69 GAO recommended that the Department ensure that peer reviewers not have personal, professional or financial conflicts of interests, and the Department has since taken steps to ensure that peer reviewers provide sufficient documentation to prove that they have no such conflicts of interest. Another GAO recommendation addressed scoring variations among peer reviewers. Not every peer reviewer scores similar applications in the same manner, which can result in qualified applicants not receiving funds. The Department is beginning to implement some of GAO's recommendations to ensure that scoring is less likely to be perceived as unfair or subject to politics.70 GAO found that the Department had streamlined many aspects of its grant application process. However, only immediately before the GAO report went to print was the Department able to verify the number of steps it currently takes to approve an application. The Department had previously indicated that it would not be able to come up with such a figure. Nevertheless, it finally calculated that the process was reduced to a total of 192 steps. Due to the last minute nature of this finding, GAO was not able to verify the number. Without the oversight efforts of the Subcommittee, it is likely that important steps to improve the fairness and efficiency of the grants approval process would not have been put in place. It was only when GAO began to look into this process that the Department began to look at whether the redesigned grants process had been effective, and whether any additional steps should be taken to ensure that grants are fairly awarded to the highest quality applicants. It Keeps Growing.... and Growing...and Growing ""NPR recommends reducing the number of programs the department administers. ED runs 230 education programs, many of which overlap or have achieved the purpose for which they were created, or are better addressed by non-federal resources.""  The Report of the National Performance Review, Office of the Vice President, September 1993  While there have been some program eliminations in the past decade, each year since 1997 the number of funded programs at the Department of Education has actually grown. There are still at least 230 authorized programs at the Department. For FY 2001 alone the President proposed 20 new education programs. In addition, the number of employees at ED has grown each year since 1997, when it stood at 4,470. The FY 2001 budget request called for 4,749 employees. Furthermore, the Department's annual budget has increased from $23 billion in 1996 to $38 billion in FY 2000. A significant portion of the funding and staffing increases have been for the ED's Direct Lending program.

This was the first time that any official higher than the Secretary of Education has taken part in a NAEP release and constituted a violation of the longstanding NAGB policy designed to insulate the release of education results from political ""spin."" The Vice President did not merely report the results, according to the Los Angeles Times: ""In his eagerness to put a positive spin on the statistics, Gore glossed over the fact that long-term progress has been modest at best.""72 Test scores from 1992 were left out the Vice President's presentation, giving the appearance that scores had increased since 1994, although those scores were only returning to 1992 levels. Moreover, according to Mark Musick, the Chairman of NAGB, ""the format, tone, and substance of that event was not consistent with the principle of an independent, nonpartisan release of ... data."" E-mail messages exchanged between Education Department officials and an education adviser to the Vice President indicated, according to Education Week, that ""the Feb. 10 event was designed to give positive press coverage to Mr. Gore, who is running for president.""73 Because of concerns about the manner in which the 1998 NAEP reading test results were released, and the apparent violation of NAGB policy, the Subcommittee investigated the matter and held a hearing on May 27, 1999. During the hearing, Mr. Schaffer (R-CO) specifically questioned Dr. Forgione about the Vice-President's characterization of the results in his presentation: Mr. Schaffer. The Vice President used the time frame from 1994 to 1998. So is it fair for me to say that the President told the truth? Mr. Forgione. They certainly presented half of the truth. Mr. Schaffer. But he didn't tell the truth, right? Mr. Forgione. Not the whole truth...I prefer to say the Vice President presented part of the data and the Commissioner later presented all parts of the data.

What he did was not inappropriate, if in fact all of the information had gotten out. When the Vice President leaves, a lot of the press leaves with him. Dr. Forgione himself was critical of the Vice-President's involvement in the release of the NAEP scores, stating in press accounts that campaign style government ""can cloud the confidence people might have in the independence of the data.""74 In April 1999, Dr. Forgione found out that the White House would not re-nominate him to be Commissioner, despite the Secretary's attempts to intervene. In the words of the Chairman of the NCES advisory board, ""There's no question that his departure is a great loss to the agency...[h]e's been an effective and popular spokesperson for education statistics.""75 At the May Subcommittee hearing, Dr. Forgione asked Congress to insulate NCES from any potential political infringements: I would ask you and the Chairman to consider as you are looking at the reauthorization of my agency presently, to think about putting protections that would institutionalize this relationship so that the boundaries are very clear and it will not lead to these awkward solutions. Education statistics must be trustworthy in order to be of any value. The nation needs accurate information about student performance, not political spin. If NAGB and NCES policies are so easily set aside to advance the interests of the Administration, what assurances do the American people and Congress have that such incursions do not affect the trustworthiness of all research and statistics released by the Department? Regardless of which party is in power, statistics gathering should remain separate and independent from political interests. CONCLUSION It is clear that the Department of Education has not been successfully transformed into a high performance organization during the 1990s. Federal programs are not carried out effectively, and agency mismanagement wastes federal dollars that should be reaching schools and classrooms. The federal role in education continues to place a burden on states and school districts. We must protect the Nation's education resources and spend them wisely. During the 106th Congress, the Subcommittee has had the opportunity to continue to look beyond the crossroads  toward states, districts, and schools that have emerged over the last two decades as shining examples of excellence, fighting against bureaucratization of education at the in order to produce results. How have they achieved excellence? By implementing policies based on putting student performance first. We will now look at examples what the  74 75  Ibid.

Crossroads 2000 24   PART II: HOW DO WE REACH EXCELLEN  CE  FROM HERE?  ""DE-MANDATING"" SCHOOLS, SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND STATES The federal role in education needs to be reoriented to put student performance first. Over the last two years the Subcommittee has looked into how schools, school districts and states are being freed from mandates and requirements that get in the way of putting students first, holding six field hearings in 1999 and 2000 around the country, as well as several in Washington, D.C. Charter schools, school choice, state accountability programs, and federal flexibility legislation have all played an important role in making education more performance based at the school, school district and state level. FLEXIBILITY FOR SCHOOLS: Charter Schools Grant Flexibility To Put Children First In 1991, Minnesota's Governor Arne Carlson (R) enacted the first charter school law in the nation was enacted under. What started as just a trickle is now a tidal wave, with more than 1,484 charter schools in 36 states, including Washington, D.C.76 For almost a decade, the idea of granting freedom from process requirements and regulations in exchange for accountability for producing results has swept many parts of the country and has inspired numerous education reforms at the state and federal level. Charter schools have not only significantly changed the landscape of education in America, they have served as a model for lifting mandates on school districts and states: innovations like charter districts and Gov. Jeb Bush's A+ Education Plan in Florida, and federal legislation such as the Straight A's Act (H.R. 2300), Ed-Flex Partnership Act (P.L. 106-25), as well as other flexibility provisions. Flexibility with Accountability Leads to $61,000 Surplus in First Year of Charter School In March of 2000 the Subcommittee visited Temple Terrace, Florida, just outside of Tampa. The Terrace Community School (TCS), a charter junior high school, hosted the hearing. The Terrace Community School has excelled by expecting its students to meet high standards, and by using its resources creatively to address the needs of its students. Each day students focus on four core academic courses: math, English, science and history. In addition, they study Latin and Spanish, and are required to reserve two hours a day for homework. The head of the school, David Lourie, told the Subcommittee that the school's achievements were a direct result of the freedom and accountability that come with being a charter school. These freedoms have led to important innovations, which have contributed to the success of the students in the school. Terrace Community School operates all expenses, including textbooks, supplies, and utilities, transportation and payroll. Yet with a $61,000 surplus!

Crossroads 2000 25   processes that constrain non-charter schools, Mr. Lourie could decide how to run the school and seek out the most cost effective means available to them. The school, among other things,     purchased used and refurbished textbooks, saving thousands of dollars; solicited donations from members of the community to avoid spending large amounts on desks, tables, chairs, and bookshelves; was painted by parents, teachers, and students on weekends; enlisted the expertise of parents for many professional and technical services, including computer set-up and repair.  As a result of these efforts, in one summer, and for only $3,000, the school was able to set up a computer lab consisting of 22 networked computers, all connected to the Internet. Mr. Lourie said they were able to accomplish so much with so little because, ""we enjoy the fiscal freedom to spend our funds on only those goods and services that will benefit the students and teachers."" "" We promised to deliver a product in our charter application and our survival depends upon our delivering that promise.

I'm really for effective education for our children.""  Eric Mahmoud, Harvest Preparatory School Accountability to parents for results led one Minneapolis charter school to seek out the most effective curriculum available in order to best help its students. Harvest Preparatory School is a Minneapolis charter school that has seen tremendous achievement gains over the last few years. It serves 350 children from kindergarten through 6th grade, and 200 children are on the waiting list. Ninety-nine percent of the students are African-American, 63 percent are low income, and 65 percent come from single-parent families. The Subcommittee heard from Eric Mahmoud, head of the Harvest Preparatory School in Minneapolis, Minnesota, at a hearing on June 6, 2000. Testimony of David Lourie, Hearing on ""Putting Performance First: Academic Accountability and School Choice in Florida,"" Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Temple Terrace, Florida, March 27, 2000. 77  Crossroads 2000 26   In 1994, Mr. Mahmoud began to look around the country for models of successful schools, and found Wesley Elementary in Houston, Texas, which was also highlighted in the first Education at a Crossroads.78 Wesley Elementary uses a research based curriculum model known as Direct Instruction (DI), and despite the poverty of most of the children in the school, the students were performing at two and three grade levels above their actual grade. Based on these results, Mr. Mahmoud decided to implement DI at his school, which has been in place for five years. Mr. Mahmoud described for the Subcommittee the stunning results of this curriculum in his school: Since 1995 we've used Direct Instruction in our school, and we've had tremendous success. Our first year after using Direct Instruction our [kindergartners] went from 53 percent in reading on the reading comprehension tests for the California Achievement Test to 85 percent. Our second graders went from 49 percent to 71 percent. Just last year we took the Minnesota basic skills test. Our third and fifth graders, 93 percent of our third and fifth graders scored at or above grade level in reading, so we've had tremendous success using this instructional approach. Harvest Prep is also successfully using the Core Knowledge curriculum to teach geography and history.79 The school ranks in the top five percent of public elementary schools in the Minneapolis area. Its second grade African American students were outscoring white students in Minneapolis after the first year of using Direct Instruction. By putting the unique needs of its students first, this Minneapolis charter school has seen children that others would not expect to excel make achievement gains. Their flexibility and direct accountability to parents helped to bring this about. Building on Success: How to Empower and Expand Charter Schools Because charter schools are experiencing such tremendous growth and success around the country, it is important that all levels of government do as much as possible to empower them. In order to examine this issue more closely, on March 3, 2000, the Subcommittee held a hearing in Washington on the successes of charter schools and the challenges facing them today. The hearing highlighted several areas where charters will need assistance in the near future in order to expand. Present as witnesses were:   Irasema Salcido, principal of the Cesar Chavez Public Policy High School in Washington, D.C. and charter school advocate; Irene Sumida, Director of Instruction at Fenton Charter School in Lake View Terrace, California. The Subcommittee had heard from this school's principal, Mr. Lucente, at the hearing in Los Angeles on January 30, 1997;  78 79  See: Education at a Crossroads, p. 50. Ibid, p. 48.  Crossroads 2000 27      Kathryn Knox, Headmaster of Liberty Common Charter School, Ft. Collins, Colorado; and Jon Schroeder, Executive Director of the Charter Friends National Network, which is a network of organizations that provide assistance to charter schools around the nation.  In this hearing, as well as others where similar issues were addressed, the following were raised as being among the most significant issues facing charter schools today:  Start-up Funding: Each witness underscored the importance of continuing to increase the annual appropriation for charter schools as the number of charter schools grows, as Congress has done thus far. Increases in funding have allowed for more grants, and for the average-size grant to be larger. Since the 1998 reauthorization, larger grants will go to states with stronger charter laws, since stronger laws produce more schools.  Federal Role: The federal government needs to exercise caution and not tie strings to charter schools. As Mr. Schroeder testified to the Subcommittee, ""don't impose uniform, prescriptive national solutions on charters that discourage or impede their efforts to address these goals through a performance-based contract between each school and its sponsor.""80  Learn from schools, and should learn in all public according to Charters: It is important to document the growth and impact of charter their impact on students and districts. In addition, the federal government how charters can serve as an ""R&D program for changes and improvements schools in areas like special education, accountability and facilities funding,"" Mr. Schroeder.81   Facilities funding: The issue of facilities is a significant issue for charter schools, many of which start from scratch without a building or any capital to acquire one. Federal start-up funds are not intended to pay for facilities, and the per-pupil funding schools receive for operating expenses are not usually sufficient to make mortgage or rent payments. Consequently, charter schools are required to ""take money out of the classroom to put a roof over their heads.""82 Ms. Salcido described her situation to the Subcommittee: I don't think it is any longer appropriate to hear stories of schools opening in abandoned buildings, or in basements. Our school was forced to start in a basement, and I think that is not acceptable. We are public schools and we should be able to have the ability to have a building for our schools.

Alice Seagren cautioned the Subcommittee not to allow the federal government to get entangled in what is and should be an issue for states and school districts: ...I would be cautious of the federal government getting into programs for facilities, whether it's for charter schools or any public school. I think the states are the best ones to handle that situation....At the federal level I would stick to looking at start-up support for charter schools with the ability for the federal government to play a role in disseminating information, and helping other states examine the best charter school system. I would be a little bit cautious about going into a lot of federal programs for actual capital facilities for charters at this point. You could look at low-interest loans if you have a state that doesn't have a good bond rate.83 There is much that states can do to enable charter schools to need. States can learn from each other as they try different avenues issue. Colorado, for example, has been out in front on this, creating schools acquire buildings by creating designated entities with the ex exempt bonds on behalf of charter schools.84 acquire the facilities they of helping charters with this options to help their charter plicit authority to issue tax-   Charters Need Timely and Flexible Federal Dollars: In order to operate as flexibly as possible, charter schools would greatly benefit from relief from federal categorical program constraints. In addition, charters need to be treated fairly, and receive their fair share of federal grant dollars in a timely manner. According to Mr. Schroeder, There are... practical issues here involving getting a fair share of money on a per-pupil basis to individual school sites, especially from the federal level. It is a struggle at the state level as well. Perhaps some piloting there of the concept of a block grant that would cut through all of that red tape, take away the time that is needed for all of the preparation of grant proposals, and the administration of these individual categorical programs is something that could be tested in the charter environment with the extra accountability that exists there. Then, challenge states to do the same thing. Ms. Sumida expressed similar ideas in her testimony. Flexible federal dollars would provide relief for charter school operators and ultimately be better for the children:  Minnesota State Rep. Alice Seagren, responding to questions from Mr. Schaffer (R-CO), Field Hearing on ""School Choice and Parental Empowerment in Minnesota,"" Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Bloomington, Minnesota, June 6, 2000. 84 See testimony of Dr. Randy Everett, Liberty Common Charter School, Field Hearing on ""The Impact Of Federal Policies On State And Local Efforts To Reform Education,"" Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Lakewood, Colorado, January 25, 2000.  83  Crossroads 2000 29   The federal Government also could be of assistance with a block grant federal categorical funding model... Funding could still be distributed based on need, but this mechanism would relieve charter schools of the cumbersome and time-consuming documentation that is currently required of many of these programs. A block grant would free up more time to work on our primary objective, which is also the primary objective of all federal programs, to improve student achievement.  Opposition to Charter Schools: The opening of a charter school in a school district is not always celebrated on all fronts. Charter schools represent change, and could require the entire education system to change as a result. Too many adults have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo at the expense of the needs of children. Consequently, on top of the difficulties that come with opening a new school, charter schools are often required to fight political battles and divert resources from developing their school. Ms. Sumida and the Fenton Charter School had to fight their own battle with the local teachers union. Ultimately, the staff in her school chose to withdraw from the union and the school district, after paying dues for five years without receiving benefits. Ms. Sumida described in general for the Subcommittee the opposition that charters sometimes face: Finally, a challenge that many charter school developers must overcome is the sometimes hostile or uncooperative reaction of school districts, school boards and labor organizations, and institutions of the status quo, regarding the development of charters within their sphere of influence. Although there is little that can be done on the federal level, it should be noted that strong federal support of charter schools and the continued bipartisan support from the President on down, will continue to gradually change the attitude of those who may currently impede the development of charter schools. Congress can best help charters in conquering opposition by maintaining its strong support for charter schools through federal start-up funds and by protecting these schools from federal entanglement and bureaucracy.  Monitoring and Accountability: Many school districts and states around struggling to determine how to best monitor charter schools without interf success  how to trust, but verify, their results. Ms. Salcido underscored of not creating a local charter school bureaucracy that interferes with their the country are ering with their the importance success.  ...my hope is that as we grow and become permanent parts of the educational system, we are not going to be adding agencies and places to report and write reports just for the sake of reporting. I think it is very important that we keep in mind that we don't want to build any more bureaucracy. Crossroads 2000 30   How To Ensure Charters Will Fail At the Subcommittee's hearing in Florida, charter school principal Mr. Lourie eloquently described what would ultimately cause a charter school to fail: I believe that charter schools will fail for one of three reasons: (1) they are compelled to act like traditional public schools through local district pressure and regulation; (2) they do not deliver on their educational promises, or (3) they forget their responsibility to the public system as a whole. It is our duty to make other schools better, be that through sharing innovative programs or competing for students. If a local school principal looks at our program, sees value in what we offer, and borrows an idea or two, that is great. If a local school official looks at our school and feels threatened, that is great, too...both of those scenarios will make their schools better, and that is all that matters. If everyone involved in education at the local level puts students and their achievement first, charter schools can help bring about a higher quality education for all children, no matter where they attend school. And doing that, not ensuring process compliance, is true equity in education.  Crossroads 2000 31   Towards a More Perfect Union: How One School Resigned from Their Union and School District Chairman Hoekstra: Why did your teachers and the administrators have to leave the union in the L.A. school district? Ms. Sumida. ...[T]he teachers union had negotiated within the union contract that we in the charter school would take a leave of absence for 5 years. When the charter was up for renewal at the end of 5 years, we had to make a choice whether to resign from the school district or leave the charter school. The charter school leave could not be extended. It was something that the union and the school district had negotiated without charter schools. Our teachers were very involved in this process when they heard they actually had to resign. When they read it in the union contract, I don't think that they believed that it would really happen. When the 5 years came up, they attended union meetings, because we had been paying dues and everyone was paying dues. Even those teachers who were hired as just Fenton employees, and were not employees of Los Angeles unified school district, and who were not members of the teachers union per se, had to pay agency fees. As soon as we hired them, money was taken and it had to be sent to the teachers union. So there was a group that was not a member of the teachers union paying dues and not represented at all, and then another group that were members of the union and on leave from the school district. When our 5 years was up, they negotiated and the union told us that we could get a one-year extension and leave our charter as is, but there were things that [they] wanted to clean up. After 5 years we had learned a great deal and we unacceptable. It was a good time for us as well, becaus and staff member (and there were 170) had to decide if to take that chance. I had over 25 years of seniority with district. Should I take that chance and leave and bet on back to the school district? All but a handful resigned. felt that was e every teacher they were going the school Fenton or go  --Hearing on Charter Schools: Successes and Challenges, March 3, 2000.  Crossroads 2000 32   FLEXIBILITY  FOR SCHOOL  DISTRICTS  Building on the principle underlying charter schools, granting flexibility in exchange for a higher level of accountability has been implemented at the school district level in several states, including Chicago and Florida, and is also inspiring new ideas that address how to improve school districts and expand choice and competition. Mandate Relief Yields Results in Chicago Public School District ""By raising expectations, increasing flexibility and accountability, and shaking things up, they are improving the public schools - and, in so doing, improving the lives of Chicago's children. We should learn from the progress being made here, and we should replicate the common-sense reforms that have been undertaken. I believed, and once said, that Chicago's public schools were `the worst in the nation.' Happily for the people of Chicago, this is no longer the case."" 85-Dr. William Bennett, former Secretary of Education The Chicago Public Schools district (CPS) was one of the first districts to establish a ""charter-type"" relationship with the state educational agency. The city has recently seen tremendous results under a regime of increased accountability for results and freedom from certain state mandates and regulations. On April 19, 1999 the Subcommittee visited Chicago with former Secretary of Education William Bennett, in order to highlight the progress Chicago has made since Dr. Bennett visited the city as Secretary ten years ago. Chicago was also where the first Education at a Crossroads hearing was held in 1995. Flexibility in state funding has enabled Chicago Public Schools to balance its budget for the last four years and to negotiate two four-year contracts with their teachers. It has allowed them to create after-school and summer school programs for students needing extra help in reading and math, to expand preschool programs, and to create new opportunities for gifted students. All these changes have benefited their students, but especially students from lowincome families, underachieving students, students with limited English proficiency, and students with disabilities. On January 28, 1999, Gery Chico, the President of the Chicago School Reform Board of Trustees, testified before the Committee and described the freedom the Board was granted and the standards it had to meet: The Mayor gave us a clear mandate: improve student performan everyone in the system accountable for the results. He gave us a change curriculum, set new academic and disciplinary standards, disciplinary codes, and adjust virtually everything about the experience, from the length of the school day to the uniforms students ce and hold free hand to revise staff educational wear.86  Testimony of Dr. William Bennett, Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Chicago, Illinois, April 19, 1999.

Attendance has improved, and enrollment continues to rise as people once more choose the public schools over other options. But according to Chicago Public Schools Superintendent Paul Vallas, there is still more to be done: ""With the federal government as a partner, not a puppet master pulling strings, the Chicago Public Schools can do even more."" 87 Superintendent Vallas also expressed his desire for increased flexibility in federal funding: Simply put, what we want is greater flexibility in the use of federal funds coupled with greater accountability for achieving the desired results. We in Chicago, for example, would be delighted to enter into a contract with the Department of Education, specifying what we would achieve with our students, and with selected groups of students. And we would work diligently to fulfill  and exceed  the terms of such a contract. We would be held accountable for the result.88 Gery Chico expressed similar ideas in his testimony before the Committee: Mayor Daley and I believe that what works for one school system may not necessarily work for others. While many school systems share similar problems, the solutions need to be carefully tailored to match the specific needs and capabilities of each community. With that in mind, I strongly urge the federal government to be as flexible as possible with existing as well as new funds. Let local governments decide how best to spend the money and then hold us accountable for results.89 % of Students at or Above National Norms  Testimony of Paul Vallas, Superintendent of Chicago Public Schools, Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Committee on Education and the Workforce, Chicago, Illinois, April 19, 1999. 88 Ibid. 89 Gery Chico testimony, January 28, 1999.  87  Crossroads 2000 34   The testimony of Superintendent Vallas and Mr. Chico demonstrates the need not only for the federal government to grant flexibility, but also for states to grant flexibility as well, so that school districts can tailor their programs as closely as possible to the needs of their students. Narrowing Achievement Gaps in Texas with Flexibility and Accountability In addition to Illinois granting Chicago a certain amount of flexibility to produce better results, several other states have taken steps to provide flexibility to local school districts. Texas has used its status as an ""Ed-Flex"" state to enhance its statewide accountability system: rather than requiring each individual district to separately apply for common-sense flexibility, it waived certain federal requirements for all districts in the state. Over the last decade, Texas has Texas Students Outpace U.S. demonstrated how increased flexibility in Math Achivement Gains within the context of increased accountability for performance can NAEP 8th Grade Math Test produce achievement gains for 229 disadvantaged students. Based on test 230 scores over the last few years, Texas has accelerated the rate of learning for 225 222 disadvantaged students more than any 218 21 8 220 other state in the country. Houston and Fort Worth top the nation in their 215 success in narrowing achievement 90 gaps. The state ensures that no 210 students are left behind by requiring U.S . TX that all children meet high standards. Under the Texas accountability system, 1992 1996 schools are evaluated based on how well all groups of children are performing, not just on a school's average. Students are tested every year in every grade. This helps ensure that children do not fall through the cracks of the education system and that sufficient attention is devoted to ensuring that all children succeed. In exchange, the state grants school districts the freedom to pick the reforms they believe best suit their needs, and either rewards or sanctions them based on their performance. As one of the first additional flexibility tool. Title I funds to schools on Federal waivers for the states to become an ""Ed-Flex"" state, Texas has had at its disposal an It has effectively given its school districts the flexibility to allocate the basis of need.

For U.S. Texas the period 1996-1998, Texas achieved this goal for all students and for all groups of students, including African American, Hispanic, and economically disadvantaged students. Greater flexibility at the school level appears to be producing real results, both on the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).92 It is significant that these gains show up in both assessments, further validating Texas' progress as real and not just the result of students learning to take the TAAS test over time. A recent RAND Corporation study has also confirmed the reality of Texas' achievement gains, especially in math. In a cross-state comparison of achievement by students from similar families Texas led the nation in academic gains. The study found that ""although the two states are close demographic cousins, Texas students, on average, scored 11 percentile points higher on NAEP math and reading tests than their California counterparts. In fact, the Texans performed well with respect to most states.""93 Achievement Gains  Texas finished in the top ten, along with states such as Maine, North Dakota, and Wisconsin, in the 1996 NAEP fourth-grade math assessment. Whites and African Americans in Texas had the highest scores in the nation, and Latinos in Texas had the second highest scores in the nation.  Between 1992 and 1996, the percentage of Texas fourth-graders achieving at or above the NAEP's ""proficient"" level in math rose from 15 to 25 percent far outstripping Testimony of Madeleine Draeger Manigold, Coordinator of State and Federal Waivers, Texas Education Agency, Hearing on ""Putting Performance First: Hearing on ""Ed-Flex"" and its Role in Improving Student Performance and Reducing Bureaucracy,"" Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth and Families on February 25, 1999. 92 Jay Greene, ""The Texas School Miracle is for Real,"" City Journal, Summer 2000. 93 David Grissmer, Ann Flanagan, Jennifer Kawata, Stephanie Williamson, Improving Student Achievement: What State NAEP Scores Tell Us, RAND, July 2000, http://www.rand.org/centers/education/pubsnav.html. 91  Percentile Increase  Crossroads 2000 36   improvements nationwide. The share of Texas children scoring below the ""basic"" level in math fell from 44 to 31 percent during the same period.  From 1992-1996, African-American fourth graders in Texas made the largest gains in math in the nation. Fourth grade Latinos made the second largest gains in the nation.  In reading, the percentage of Texas fourth-graders achieving ""at or above proficient"" on the NAEP test increased from 28 to 31 percent from 1992 to 1998. The percent of students scoring below basic dropped from 43 to 37 percent.  The percentage of Texas 3rd graders passing the state reading test increased by 13 percent in two years. For low-income third graders, the passing rate improved by nearly 20 percent.  Texas students passing all parts of the state skills test (TAAS) has increased by 51 percent from 1994 to 2000. The number of both minority students and economically disadvantaged students passing TAAS increased by 89 percent. Texas has demonstrated that by shining light on how all categories of students perform, and not just the average student, schools monitor more closely the education of poor and minority students. Ensuring that the public knows how well a school is performing has been a successful accountability measure in Texas. The state can grant flexibility to local districts because it knows that they will be held accountable for the results. On the Cutting Edge of Accountability in Florida In addition to Texas efforts to dramatically increase accountability for student performance down to the school level, Florida has also implemented cutting edge reforms. Florida is the first state to offer state-paid tuition scholarships to children in failing public schools so that they may attend a better-performing public, private, or religious school of choice. It has also enacted a ""charter district"" pilot program to specifically grant mandate relief to school districts that agree to meet a higher level of accountability. These initiatives were enacted as part of Governor Jeb Bush and Lt. Gov. Brogan's ""A+ Plan,"" approved by the Florida legislature on April 28, 1999. The plan challenges the status quo by requiring everyone in the public school system to do better. The Subcommittee heard about Florida's efforts to improve education achievement from Commissioner of Education Tom Gallagher at the March 27, 2000 hearing in Temple Terrace, Florida. Central to Florida's accountability system are school ""report cards."" Based on standardized test scores (the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test), schools are assigned a grade between A and F based on how well they meet state standards for reading, math and writing. Schools receiving A's have to demonstrate that their student absences, suspensions, and dropout rates fell below state averages. Schools that improve scores are rewarded with up to $100 per pupil. Crossroads 2000 37   Freeing Disadvantaged Students from Failing Schools Students attending schools receiving a grade of F for two consecutive years are able to transfer either to a higher-scoring public school, or to a private or parochial school, by using an opportunity scholarship worth up to $4,000 a year. Students in two schools were eligible for scholarships in the fall of 1999, the only schools to receive Fs two years in a row. Both of these schools are elementary schools in Pensacola, Florida. Parents of the 900 students attending A.A. Dixon and Bibbs Elementary schools had a decision to make: whether to exercise their option to receive an opportunity scholarship to a private school, transfer to a higher performing public school, or stay put. Ultimately, out of nearly 900 students, the parents of 53 students opted to send their children to private schools and the parents of 85 students chose to send their children to ""C"" or better public schools. Contrary to charges that these schools would be abandoned under the A+ Plan, ""D"" and ""F"" schools receive significant additional resources to help turn the schools around. Each school receiving an ""F"" received $25,000 for reading enhancement programs, in addition to top priority for all other federal and state grants distributed. In the two failing schools, there are now Saturday remedial courses and a school year that is 30 days longer. States and the district must take a second look at how resources are allocated to these schools in order to ensure they are better served. Commissioner Gallagher told the subcommittee that in order to help, ""funding from the federal government must come with as few restrictions as possible. Send the states money and hold them accountable, which is the same philosophy we are applying to the districts from the state level.""94 The NAACP, ACLU, Florida teachers unions, the American Jewish Congress, and People for the American Way filed a lawsuit against the scholarship plan claiming that the program violates both Florida's constitution and the U.S. Constitution. As a result of their suit, on March 14, 2000 Circuit Judge L. Ralph Smith Jr. ruled that Florida's school voucher law is unconstitutional because it violates a provision in the Florida Constitution that requires the state to provide students with a ""uniform...and high-quality system of free public schools."" The judge issued this ruling, even though the two Pensacola elementary schools were not providing a ""uniform and high quality education"" consistent with this standard. The 53 children attending private schools in Pensacola were able to finish the school year. However, the state can take no other action to implement the law, according to the ruling. Florida has filed an appeal in what will likely be a long and drawn out fight to offer school choice to students in Florida. In the meantime, private citizens have committed to covering the tuition of the children in private schools. One of the recipients of the Florida scholarships testified at the Subcommittee's hearing in Florida. Tracey Richardson told the Committee that she ""felt like she won the lottery"" when her daughter was chosen to participate in the scholarship program. Her daughter Kahlilah was  Testimony of Commissioner Gallagher, Field Hearing on ""Putting Performance First: Academic Accountability and School Choice in Florida,"" Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Temple Terrace, Florida, March 27, 2000.  94  Crossroads 2000 38   able to transfer out of her failing public school and attend a local Montessori school with the scholarship. Ms. Richardson told the Subcommittee, in the six months that she's been there, the greatest single improvement in my daughter's education is her spirit: instead of frustration and despair, I see hope and excitement in her eyes...This has been so good for my daughter that she now looks forward to school in the mornings. This is a complete change from her attitude when she went to a public school... [she] recently joined the chess club and the Girl Scouts. Now instead of having to deal with a failing school I am faced with a new problem: Khalilah wants to be involved with every program.95 Not only is Khalilah doing better in school, her mother is also free to decide where to send her to school. Freeing disadvantaged students from failing schools empowers parents, no longer restricting their choices in order to protect the ""system"" and enforce arbitrary district boundaries. Failing Schools Successful in Improving Scores Contrary to the claims of those who charged that the A+ Plan would hurt the ability of failing schools to improve, all of the schools that had earned failing grades in 1999 raised their marks by at least one grade. By raising their grades, the schools were no longer in the ""failing"" category and their students would not be eligible to transfer out of the school to other public or private schools. According to state education officials, 20 percent of elementary schools moved up at least two grade levels, while 30 percent moved up one grade level. Despite these improvements, however, four schools received failing grades for the first time and two of the original 78 failing schools have since closed.96 In addition, parents who were looking forward to being able to provide their children with an improved educational setting will not have that option. The success of Florida's choice program illustrates the importance of putting student performance first. As Ms. Carrin from the Florida Department of Education was quoted in Education Week, ""the bottom line was to increase student performance, not to have a voucher program.""97 Thus far, Florida's efforts are promising. ""Getting out of the Way"" of Success: Charter Districts in Florida Republican Governor Jeb Bush has also enacted a pilot program to test the concept of ""charter districts."" The first districts to receive this status submitted their applications last fall to the State Board of Education. The purpose of this pilot program is to give public school districts the flexibility to improve student achievement and school management without the usual constraints placed upon them by the state.

The charter school district can be chartered for 3 years, at the end of which their performance will be evaluated. At the March 27, 2000 hearing in Temple Terrace, Florida, Dr. Lennard, Superintendent of Sarasota Public Schools in Florida described for the Subcommittee how the charter district proposal works: Basically, our plan asks for relief from more than 800 pages of state statutes, with the exception of those dealing with health, safety and equity issues. With this new freedom, our district and, in turn, our schools will have the opportunity to create innovative programs to meet the needs of their specific student population...The changes to the way our school system will operate as a charter district will significantly benefit our children's achievement because decisions affecting their education will be made by those closest to the students--their teachers and parents. Our charter district proposal creates a redesigned governance system that places schools, not the district, as the focal point for educational improvement....Just as the charter district legislation envisions Tallahassee ""getting out of the way"" of charter districts, Sarasota envisions using this legislation to ""get out of the way"" of creative, successful schools. Tallahassee will continue to monitor the progress of our charter district and hold us to exacting outcomes and standards. Likewise, the School Board will monitor the progress of all schools and will hold them to similar exacting standards of performance.98 Their proposal allows schools to choose whether they'll receive their funding in block grants and be held to higher standards, or stick with the current system that allocates their funding in categorical grants. Successful schools receive financial rewards that have few strings attached; schools in need of improvement receive additional funds that require district approval for how they are spent. The charter district concept in Sarasota County also gives employees in the central support services departments the ability to vote on becoming an enterprise service unit. With that status they can market their services to organizations outside the school district and thus compete in the open market and possibly bring in additional revenue. What remains to be seen about ""charter districts"" is whether they will produce any change at the school level in how they are governed, staffed, financed and operated. In addition, charter districts could be used as a means of slowing charter school growth, without providing the same level of flexibility and accountability at the school level that traditional charters provide for individual schools. While charter districts in Florida may result in streamlined bureaucracy at the district level, and may be an effective way of making government more performance oriented, they are not the same concept as charter schools, despite the fact that these districts are described as ""charter"" districts. In order to protect charter schools, it important to keep the lines 98  Testimony of Dr. Lennard, Field Hearing, Temple Terrace, Florida, March 27, 2000  Crossroads 2000 40   that separate them from traditional schools distinct so that they can maintain their unique characteristics and freedoms that have made them so successful. Charter Districts: School Districts of the Future? Other groups representing mainstream education are looking to the charter model to improve school districts. In November 1999, the Denver-based, non-partisan Education Commission of the States (ECS) released a major report outlining two approaches to school governance that states could use to turn around underachieving schools and districts. Much like charter schools, both approaches outlined in the Governing America's Schools initiative decentralize authority to the school level, give more options to parents, and allow taxpayer dollars to follow students to the publicly funded schools of their choice. The Subcommittee heard about this report from Tom Jandris, a representative of ECS, at a hearing held in Lakewood, Colorado in January of 2000. As the success of charter schools has demonstrated, school governance is an important issue when it comes to accountability for results. Mr. Jandris described its importance in this way: Governance arrangements establish the rules of the game. They determine, through statutes, collective bargaining and other legal agreements, regulations and court rulings, who is responsible and accountable for what within a system.... Without good governance, good schools are the exception, not the rule.99 The first governance approach developed by the National Commission on Governing America's Schools accelerates the promising changes already under way, moving from the traditional one-size-fits-all ""school system to a more dynamic, diversified and high-performing system of schools.""100 It involves strong state and district-level standards, school choice, and decentralized budgeting. Districts would continue to hire superintendents and principals, bargain with unions, and hold schools accountable for results, but individual schools would write their own budgets based on per-pupil funding, hire and fire teachers, and allocate their own resources.101 The second approach goes further, significantly redefining the roles, responsibilities and interrelationship of states, districts, schools, communities, and public and private organizations. It describes a ""charter district"" that functions as a contractor, and where schools are run by independent entities. Teachers, principals, parents and others would have considerable freedom to design, create and operate schools, limited only by state and federal laws and the terms of their contract with the district. Schools would negotiate salaries and benefits with teachers and principals, set standards, write curricula, and borrow and spend public funds at their own discretion. Districts would distribute money, recruit staff members, and provide the public with Testimony of Tom Jandris, Field Hearing on ""The Impact of Federal Policies on State and Local Efforts to Reform Education,"" Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations Lakewood, Colorado, January 25, 2000. 100 Ibid. 101 Jessica Sandham, ""ECS Report Tackles K-12 Governance,"" Education Week, November 10, 1999. 99  Crossroads 2000 41   information about the schools. School boards would oversee the schools, and would be empowered to shut down schools not meeting the terms of their charters. This option would have the potential to significantly enhance the power of local school boards, since they would be freed to hire contractors and implement their own policies.102 The group that produced the Governing America's Schools study included current and former state and local school board members, current and former state and local superintendents, current and former teachers, for-profit education and charter school representatives, governors, business leaders, education, social services and public-sector reformers, a state legislator, and a teachers' union leader. It is significant that such a broad range of views could come to an agreement that school districts and schools should be given more freedom in order to produce better results for children, and perhaps is an indication that such reforms are not as far away as one might think.  102  Ibid.  Crossroads 2000 42   FLEXIBILITY  FOR STATES:  STREAM  LINING  FEDERA  L REQUIREMENTS  During the 106th Congress, the House took several steps to reduce the burden of federal requirements on states and school districts, and to put student performance first. On April 27, 1999, President Clinton signed into law the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999, P.L. 106-25. The House took flexibility even farther by passing H.R. 2300, the Academic Achievement for All Act on October 21, 1999. Ed-Flex: Useful, But Not Sufficient to Address the Flexibility Needs of the States ""...the ""Ed Flex"" legislation that recently passed conference committee is a welcome start at lightening the regulatory burden, but we need to keep pushing. In fact, we need to push a lot further."" 103--former Secretary of Education William Bennett  The House passed H.R. 800, the Education Flexibility Partnership Act, which was signed into law on April 27, 1999. This bill removed the 12 state limit on participants in the ""Ed-Flex"" program, and strengthened accountability. Ed-Flex allows states to waive certain federal program requirements for local school districts. Previously school districts could only apply to the U.S. Secretary of Education for such waivers. Ed-Flex is designed to make federal categorical programs work better by allowing school districts to tailor them in certain ways so they more effectively meet the unique needs of students. The waivers can accomplish this by removing certain program requirements that are barriers to reform at the local level. It does not allow districts to change the purpose of federal programs, shift funds or consolidate programs. level. ready Office school The expansion of Ed-Flex is an important step towards increasing flexibility at the local For some states, Ed-Flex is adequate for their flexibility needs. Other states, however, are for additional flexibility and accountability. According to a U.S. General Accounting report on Ed-Flex, Ed-Flex's narrowly structured waivers generally do not address many districts' major concerns. GAO found that, in general, school districts' concerns did not [F]ocus on any single program or requirements; instead, they extended across several broad areas...Ed-Flex...waivers do not address these areas of concern because waivers are limited to a specific set of programs and requirements, and because districts' major concerns often lie outside the scope of the waiver authority.104 A separate GAO report found that Ed-Flex is limited because it does not ""reduce districts' financial obligations nor provide additional federal dollars""; and, because the flexibility is limited to specific programs, the districts' ""ability to reduce administrative effort and streamline procedures is also limited.""105 Additionally, GAO stated in testimony submitted to the Subcommittee, 103 104  Testimony of Dr. William Bennett, Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, April 19, 1999. U.S. General Accounting Office, Elementary and Secondary Education: Ed-Flex States Vary in Implementation of Waiver Process, HEHS-99-17, November 1998, p 14. 105 U.S. General Accounting Office, Elementary and Secondary Education: Flexibility Initiatives Do Not Address Districts' Key Concerns About Federal Requirements, HEHS-98-232, November 1998, p.8.  Crossroads 2000 43   rather than simplifying the necessary information on federal requirements, these flexibility initiatives actually expand the amount of information school district officials need...because these initiatives are program-specific, and each applies to a different set of programs, district officials need detailed information on each provision  information that is often difficult to find.106 In order to put student performance first, those states and school districts on the cutting edge of reform, and with a proven track record of improving student achievement, should be granted the greatest possible flexibility to educate their students. If a state has demonstrated that it is effectively improving student achievement, the federal government should empower those efforts and not require the implementation of federal one-size-fits all programs. In Texas, for example, the statewide accountability system has led to significant achievement gains. Texas, and other states that are producing results, should not be required to implement a federal program that is in many ways an imperfect attempt to reproduce their state's own effective education policy: they should be freed from constraining federal requirements and evaluated by the public in terms of the success of their students. More Freedom, More Accountability: The Academic Achievement for All Act The Academic Achievement for All Act (Straight A's) is also similar to the concept of charter schools: grant freedom from regulations and process requirements in exchange for accountability for producing results. Under Straight A's, Washington assumes the role of shareholder, not CEO, of the nation's education enterprise. Rather than micromanaging the dayto-day uses of federal money, it lets states manage their schools and dollars as they see fit in return for an agreed upon return on the federal investment. This has been demonstrated to be effective in charter schools, in states like Texas, and in cities like Chicago, where flexibility to innovate combined with high standards of achievement has produced significant gains in achievement. The purpose of Straight A's is to untie the hands of those states that have their accountability systems in place, in exchange for required results. It goes beyond Ed-Flex to more effectively address the flexibility needs of the states. States have the option of participating in Straight A's or staying with the current arrangement of separate categorical funding streams. Unlike many recent attempts by Congress to place accountability requirements into federal programs such as Title I, accountability in Straight A's is been coupled with fiscal and legal autonomy and flexibility, which allows reforms to be implemented quickly and efficiently at the state and local level. Providing states with flexibility to innovate is an important way to learn what works best in education. According to a recent study by the RAND Corporation, ""[h]aving 50 states take 106  U.S. General Accounting Office, Testimony submitted to the Committee on Education and the Workforce, Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Elementary and Secondary Education: Flexibility Initiatives Do Not Address Districts' Key Concerns About Federal Requirements, T-HEHES-00-51, January 25, 2000, p.9.  Crossroads 2000 44   different approaches to education can provide a powerful advantage in the long run if research and evaluation can identify what works and what does not.""107 Granting states and localities the flexibility to consolidate federal funding streams is not without precedent in federal law. Several programs and agencies have recognized the value of accountability based on performance, not compliance. Some examples:  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) allows states to enter into performance contracts, where states agree to meet certain environmental targets in exchange for receiving their grant money in the form of a consolidated grant. Territories and insular areas are allowed under current law to receive their federal grants from multiple agencies in one grant to be used for purposes determined by the insular area. Schoolwide projects under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 allow schools to combine all of their federal dollars for the purpose of improving the quality of the entire school and increasing student performance. Performance Partnership Grants are used in grants for substance abuse prevention and treatment services administered by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SMHSA).108 In recent years Congress has allowed states to submit one consolidated application for most federal education funds, and to consolidate administrative set-asides for those programs at the state and local level.          GAO has even recommended that the U.S. Department of Education consider ""Performance Partnership Grants"" (PPG) as a way giving states more control over the use of federal dollars, ""while encouraging them to accept greater accountability for results.""109 States and School Districts Support Straight A's The Committee has heard testimony from several individuals representing these states and cities who have asked Congress to grant them the freedom to have a more performancebased relationship with the U.S. Department of Education: Brett Shundler, the Mayor of Jersey City, NJ, testified before the Committee on May 20, 1999: 107  David Grissmer, Ann Flanagan, Jennifer Kawata, Stephanie Williamson, Improving Student Achievement: What State NAEP Scores Tell Us, RAND, July 2000, p. xxxvi. 108 See GAO, Substance Abuse and Mental Health: Reauthorization Issues Facing the Substance Abuse and mental Health Services Administration, GAO/T-HEHS-97-135, May 22, 1997. 109 GAO, Federal Education Funding: Multiple Programs and Lack of Data Raise Efficiency and Effectiveness Concerns, GAO/T-HEHS-98-46, November 1997.  Crossroads 2000 45   The sixty programs comprising the Elementary and Secondary Education Act are well intentioned. However, many of them have little to do with the reality of urban classrooms. I would...strongly recommend that you give the option of the Straight A's Act flexibility to large school districts in any states which do not choose to participate [in Straight A's]. The problems and needs of a large urban district can be quite different and are even at odds with those of the surrounding state. Governor Jeb Bush of Florida voiced his support of Straight A's in a House Budget Committee hearing on September 23, 1999: Without legislation like the Straight A's Act, Florida will not be able to use federal funds to fully support our reform efforts. But with the Straight A's Act, Florida's school districts could use federal funds to support their accountability-driven efforts in the manner they believe best to address their local solutions, whether those solutions are more technology, smaller class sizes, a longer school year, or individual tutoring...I have come here to offer you more accountability from Florida, in exchange for more flexibility. We can increase the impact that federal dollars will have on student learning in our state, if we are provided with more freedom and less one-size-fits-all regulations from the federal government. In her testimony before the Budget Committee's Education Task Fo the Houston School District recommended that more federal dollars be districts with the flexibility that they have under the Innovative Education (Title VI) block grant, which is similar in the flexibility Straight A's offers districts: rce, Ms. Scalfani of allocated to school Program Strategies to states and school  The Title VI program stands in contrast to the Title I program. Title 6 makes a significant difference in the lives of over 212,000 students in Houston ISD and over 13,000 students in surrounding nonprofit private schools and neglected and delinquent facilities. The program provides on-going professional development to 15,000 teachers. Title VI provides services to ten local district reform programs and projects, as well as fifty-four nonprofit private schools and facilities within the Houston Independent School District's boundaries... Title 6 funds have provided a mechanism to influence and provide opportunities for advancement in nationally identified areas such as technology, readiness skills, parental involvement, curriculum, school improvement, higher order thinking skills, combating illiteracy, and increased professional development for teachers and parents. All Title 6 funded programs have been designed specifically to improve overall student achievement. ...As one compares the Title 1 and Title VI programs, it becomes clear that Title 6 is effective in raising student achievement without all of the compliance Crossroads 2000 46   requirements of Title 1. One can deduce from that that the time spent complying with Title 1 requirements could be better spent focusing on improving student achievement. Ms. Sclafani observed that if the federal government put student performance first, they would focus their efforts where students are not succeeding: If a particular district cannot demonstrate improved student achievement, the state would be required to audit the programs serving the specific students and place the district under a technical assistance requirement until results improve. Otherwise the district would be able to apply the funds to programs and not to staff completing forms to demonstrate compliance. If this option were in place, fewer dollars would need to be allocated to state departments of education and central offices, and more would go directly to student services. Straight A's has the potential of serving as the catalyst for significantly improving the federal investment in education by encouraging reform-minded states to continue their successes. Federal funds should be focused on helping children and their schools, not on preserving separate funding streams and maintaining separate categorical federal programs. If Straight A's is signed into law, all students, especially the disadvantaged students who were the focus of federal legislation in 1965, may finally receive effective instruction and be held to high standards.  Crossroads 2000 47   FLEXIBILITY  F OR  PARENTS  Putting performance first means empowering parents to make the best decisions about their child's education. The Subcommittee has continued to examine policies that accomplish this goal, which include education tax credits and deductions, as well as school choice. Using the Tax Code to Expand Choice in Education Many people believe using the tax code is the most direct way to empower parents because benefits are not filtered through government agencies and programs before reaching parents and students. Moreover, parents control where the money is spent, not the government. On June 6, 2000, the Subcommittee visited Minnesota to find out more about education tax credits and school choice initiatives in that state. Minnesota has led the nation in school choice by enacting the first charter school law, and significantly expanding a longstanding education tax credit: Since 1955 Minnesota has had an income tax deduction for education expenses: until it was expanded in 1997, taxpayers could deduct $1,000 for students in grades 7 to 12, and $650 for students in kindergarten through sixth grade. In 1983 Minnesota taxpayers challenged the constitutionality of the education expense deduction in Mueller v. Allen. The taxpayers claimed that the deduction violated the First Amendment because it amounted to an establishment of religion, since nearly all of the taxpayers using the deduction had children in parochial schools. In a five-to-four decision, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Minnesota statute giving tax deductions to parents for tuition and other costs incurred in educating their children at public and private schools. The court found that the deduction met all three parts of the Lemon test set forth in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 492 U.S. 602 (1971), since the deduction was one of many deductions available to Minnesota taxpayers.110 In addition, it met the requirements of the Lemon test because:    The deduction was available to parents of both public and nonpublic school children. Public funds became available only as a result of ""numerous, private choices of individual parents."" The financial benefits to parochial schools were minor.  In 1997, due to the efforts of former Governor Arne Carlson (R), the state legislature increased the deduction to $2,500 and $1,625. The legislation expanded the list of deductible expenses to include academic summer school and camps, tutoring, personal computer hardware, and educational software. It also gave families with annual incomes of $33,500 or less a refundable education tax credit of $1,000 per child, with a maximum of $2,000 per family. The tax credit applies to all items that qualify for the deduction except tuition. The legislation also expanded the Working Family Tax Credit, which provides an average tax credit increase of $200 to $350 for families making $29,000 or less. ""Income Tax Deductions and Credits for Public and Nonpublic Education in Minnesota,"" House Research Information Brief, Minnesota House of Representatives, November 1999. 110  Crossroads 2000 48   In 1999, the legislature further expanded the state's education tax credit by raising the household income limit for eligibility from $33,500 to $37,500, thus adding over 30,000 middleclass families to the program. This expansion included a gradual ""phase-out"" of the tax credit so that families would no longer be penalized for modest increases in their earnings. The 1999 legislation also ensured that all custodial parents are eligible for the tax credit and/or deduction. The state Department of Revenue reported that 38,500 low-income families claimed an education tax credit in 1998 (the first year it was available) and estimated that an additional 150,000 families benefited from the tax deduction. With most of the 1999 state income tax forms processed, the Department of Revenue reported that almost 55,000 families claimed the state's education tax credit during the second year that it was available, a 40 percent increase from 1998.111 What does this mean for the average taxpayer in Minnesota? The greatest tax bill reduction possible for the maximum $2,500 deduction is $200, which goes to taxpayers that itemize deductions and tend to have higher incomes. The estimated average benefit to families claiming the education tax credit is $369, thus providing larger benefits to those with the lowest incomes. The tax credit is only available to families with incomes under $33,500, and gradually phased out for incomes between $33,500 and $37,500.112 The Subcommittee heard from Morgan Brown from the Partnership for Choice in Education (PCE), an organization dedicated to informing parents of their education options. PCE has been instrumental in educating parents in Minnesota about the tax credits and deductions. During the hearing, Mr. Brown described in particular how low-income families were helped by this particular choice option, despite accusations that tax benefits such as this are really designed for the ""wealthy"": The bottom line is that every child in the state stands to benefit from the incentives the 1997 law provides for parents to become more involved in their children's education. Our organization has focused on helping low-income families use the tax credit and has already seen evidence that it is giving parents a greater sense of financial empowerment. Not only are many parents now exploring enrichment opportunities for their kids, but they are also reexamining their basic options and assumptions about where their children attend school on a daily basis. PCE believes that this, in turn, is fostering greater accountability and positive competition within the education system. The initial results for the education credit have been promising. In 1998, the first year the credit was available, almost 40,000 low-income families (one out of every five eligible) claimed a total of more than $14 million. The average amount claimed by these families was about $400 -- double what had been estimated  111  Rees and Garrett, School Choice 2000: What's Happening in the States, The Heritage Foundation, July 2000 update, http://www.heritage.org/schools/minnesota.html#6. 112 Op Cit, p.3.  Crossroads 2000 49   originally by the Department of Revenue. Moreover, families in all of Minnesota's 87 counties used the credit, demonstrating its statewide appeal. The early data for 1999 are even more encouraging [showing a 40 percent increase in the number of parents claiming the credit]... these figures clearly show that low-income parents are eager to make choices that meet their children's educational needs. Opponents of the tax credit, who claimed originally that economically disadvantaged families either wouldn't utilize additional choices or wouldn't be able to come up with money for education expenses, are being proven wrong.113 Despite these achievements, there are still improvements that need to be made to ensure that the neediest families receive as much assistance as possible. PCE supports taking steps to: (1) make the credit more user-friendly for low-income parents, (2) increase the income limit to make the credit more accessible to moderate-income families, and (3) allow eligible parents to claim the credit for non-public school tuition. Because of the need for political compromise to enact the tax deduction legislation, there is a discrepancy between the credit and deduction regarding private school tuition: low-income parents cannot receive a tax credit for tuition expenses. Consequently, low-income parents, for whom the deduction is of little or no use, cannot defray at least some tuition costs through the credit, while middle- and upper-income parents can do so through the deduction. Mr. Brown urged Congress to pass legislation similar to Minnesota's but without its inherent inequity regarding private school tuition expenses. I would strongly encourage you and other members of the Committee to pursue the passage of a federal education tax credit based on the Minnesota model. I also ask you to make sure it allows parents to spend the dollars returned to them on the widest possible range of educational opportunities.  Using Tax Credits to Create Opportunities for Low-Income Families in A Minnesota Public School District The Subcommittee heard from Superintendent Keith Dixon, of the Fairbault School District in Minnesota. Fairbualt created the ""Kinderlinks"" program, where students spend onehalf of their day with the kindergarten teacher, and the other half with a Kinderlinks teacher. His testimony provides an example of how low-income parents take advantage of the tax credit, and how school districts can help these parents to use the credit to benefit their children as much as possible. He also responds to concerns Mr. Kind (D-WI) raised earlier in the hearing about the  Testimony of Morgan Brown, Field Hearing on School Choice and Parental Empowerment in Minnesota, Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Bloomington, Minnesota, June 6, 2000.  113  Crossroads 2000 50   how practicality of a tax deduction or tax credit program for low-income families when many of them aren't going to benefit from it,. In our state we fund a half-day-every-day program. And so what we did was say to parents ""We're going to offer an all-day option for you; We had about 60 percent of our families take advantage of that choice system... [w]e have certified staff in that program, so that a child is wit all day long and in essence attends all-day kindergarten in this program. in essence a choice."" within our h a teacher  Now, the one thing I want to focus on, that I think Mr. Kind [(D-WI)] brought out, is what our biggest challenge was. This was to provide this opportunity for lowincome families, and I want to address that specifically. The way it's set up in Minnesota, in order to receive the tax credit you have to buy the service first. Most low-income families cannot pay the $1,000 to even be eligible to get the $1,000 back. So we worked it out with one of our local banks to lend the families the $1,000 at 6 percent simple interest. If they paid it back at the end of the year when their tax return was processed, the interest would be reduced to zero as a motivation to pay off the loan early. That's the way we set up the program. ...[T]he way [the tax credit is] set up, the money goes directly back to the family. Then the family goes in and pays off the loan. I can tell you, working with banks, that when they first looked at this proposal, they asked, ""Why should we do this? It sounds as if we make no money and the risk is very high."" And that is the truth in the way it's set up. It would have been much easier for banks if the families signed something that said, ""Once you fill out your tax return, the money goes directly back to pay off the loan."" But the way we made it work, and in some way in answer to your question, Mr. Kind, is the relationship we have with families. I think we overlook that in schools. ...Frankly, most of these families see all of our bureaucratic s don't care if it's school systems or social services or what it is. to do is work directly with those families. We process the them; they don't go to the bank. We made it very simple. We we help them fill out a set of worksheets to fill out their tax make sure they get them in. We do all the work with families. ystems as foreign. I What this allows us loan application for work with the bank; returns so that they  ...I think the key is how we as the institutions work with families themselves. I think that's been our focus. We've been very successful getting our money back. I think we've loaned out over the years we've participated probably $34,000. I believe in two years we've had one family that was a challenge to get the money back from, and frankly the bank decided to split the risk.114 One of the results of this program has been that for the first time many of the low income families are establishing financial credit for the first time by taking out small, $1,000 loans and 114  Testimony of Superintendent Dixon, Field Hearing, Bloomington, Minnesota, June 6, 2000.  Crossroads 2000 51   then paying them off. They are also setting up accounts with the banks involved in the program. Even though the financial incentives were not apparent to the banks at first, they have new customers as a result of their willingness to participate. The Larger Strategy: Provide Many Opportunities for Choice Former Governor Carlson also testified before the Subcommittee, and urged the Congress to consider tax deductions and credits for education as part of a larger strategy of expanding educational choices for parents in order to improve student achievement. The real question that is before this committee and before Congress is what will it take to significantly improve educational outcomes. I would contend that education should consist of a variety of options designed for a variety of different needs. I strongly support a boutique approach. This would include charter schools which I signed into law during my first year in office, public school choice which was a favorite of my predecessor, post secondary options, as well as using the tax system to encourage and help parents achieve better educational results for their children including private school choice. The strength of the approach we took in Minnesota is the fact that all children have the opportunity to benefit. The assistance via the tax code goes not just toward private school tuition but also toward a variety of educational needs that will occur in either the private or public school system. Further, the tax approach utilizes a constitutionally safe method as opposed to the more legally doubtful voucher program. In summary, America has a real opportunity to reform its approach to education. If we focus entirely on the well-being of children and look toward satisfying outcomes, we will succeed. In Minnesota, educational choice has changed our whole discussion about education. The focus has shifted from inputs to outcomes. An increasing number of school superintendents and school boards want their systems to compete effectively. Virtually every day there is a news story on test scores or graduation standards. Increasingly, people are engaged. There is a far greater willingness to experiment in order to produce better outcomes. Many choice programs and proposals offer school choice as an option for those children in failing schools. Governor Carlson, however, urged Congress to not restrict choice to failing schools in order to prevent failure in the first place, instead of waiting for it to happen. It would be my hope that all of us would try to provide a system designed to enhance benefits and opportunities for all children. This move toward allowing school choice only after a school has become a demonstrated failure is folly. It may sound like good politics but it is poor policy. Imagine if medicine were to take the same approach. The result would be that the benefits of modern medicine would only be available to those near death. I would much prefer a system where Crossroads 2000 52   choice and competition are at play thereby maximizing opportunities for the success of everybody and preventing negative outcomes.115  115  Testimony of Gov. Arne Carlson, Field Hearing, Bloomington, Minnesota, June 6, 2000.  Crossroads 2000 53   TAX OPTIONS IN OTHER STATES ARIZONA Arizona offers parents two tax credits for education:  $500 for contributions to 501(c)(3) nonprofit scholarship or tuition grant programs that pay for non-governmental school tuition. Parents may not designate the donation to benefit their own children, and nonprofit organizations may not designate the funds to benefit students of only one school. $200 tax credit for extracurricular public school fees, such as equipment, uniforms and materials that students must have in order to participate in school-sponsored activities and for which a fee is charged.    Both credits were adopted in 1997 by the Arizona Legislature. Immediately, state taxpayers and education groups, including the Arizona Education Association, filed a lawsuit in the Arizona Supreme Court to gain an expedited ruling on whether the credit for private school tuition violates federal and state constitutional prohibitions against government aid to religion. The Court, however, voted 3-2 to allow the tax credit. ILLINOIS In June 1999 Illinois enacted legislation that provides taxpayers with a nonrefundable credit of up to $500 per family for qualified educational expenses for tuition, books, and lab fees. The credit equals 25 percent of qualified educational expenses above $250, up to the maximum of $500; a family must spend at least $2,250 to qualify for the full $500 credit. IOWA In 1987 the Iowa legislature first enacted legislation establishing tuition and textbook deductions or credits on personal income tax returns. The deduction was challenged in court, but found to be Constitutional since it was similar to the Minnesota tax deduction upheld by the Supreme Court in Mueller v. Allen. The tax credit for tuition is equal to 25 percent of the first $1,000 the taxpayer pays to others for tuition, nonreligious textbooks, and extracurricular activities for each child in kindergarten through grade 12. Under a 1998 modification, there is no income limit on eligibility for the credit.  Crossroads 2000 54   Choice and Performance Incentives in Michigan Education policy initiatives in Michigan have put results first by empowering parents with school options and performance incentives for students. In recent years Michigan has seen an increase in the number of charter schools: in the spring of 2000 there were 173 charter schools in Michigan, and enrollment is expected to rise 15 percent this fall to more than 57,000. Because of this strong demand and swelling waiting lists, existing charter schools are adding classes; almost every school that is eligible to add a grade has requested permission to do so. Michigan has an open enrollment policy, which empowers parents to send their children to public schools of their choosing, when space is available. In the last decade Michigan students' test scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) math test have increased at twice the national average, following right behind the nationally acclaimed progress of Texas and North Carolina.116 Students have also made gains in reading as well. The Subcommittee held a hearing in hear Michigan's perspective on how improve education. The Secretary of the Treasury, Michigan's recent policy success in the area o Battle Creek, Michigan on September 8, 1999, to student achievement and reform the federal role in Mark Murray, described for the Subcommittee f choice:  Governor Engler's leadership in the 1990s has made a big difference in education in the state. We've done financial reform, where we reduced the property taxes and found a new financing mechanism, and for the long term began to narrow the gap between the high and the low spending districts. Schools of choice and charter schools have given more opportunity to parents to select educational options for their children. These have set more consequences in place for both good and bad performance. The demand for choice is strong in Michigan. Through the leadership of Amway President and former Michigan Board of Education member Richard DeVos, school choice activists and business leaders have formed Kids First! Yes! to rally around an effort to amend the Michigan state constitution to give parents whose children attend ""at risk"" school districts a publicly funded voucher to attend a school of choice. The Kids First! Yes! school choice proposal earned a place on the Michigan ballot in early May 2000. The amendment would repeal a 1972 amendment passed by voters that outlaws public aid to religious schools: it would remove the ban on vouchers and tuition tax credits, while maintaining the prohibition on providing direct aid to private schools. This proposal would establish a higher statewide per-pupil funding allowance, as well as require that every public school teacher in Michigan undergo regular academic testing in his or her subject area. It would also provide equal education opportunities for all Michigan students currently attending failing school districts, which are defined as school districts that do not graduate at least two-thirds of their students. Parents could use the $3,100 scholarships to pay for tuition at a non-public school.  116  David Grissmer, Improving Student Achievement: What State NAEP Scores Tell Us, RAND, July 2000.  Crossroads 2000 55   Treasury Secretary Murray also described the Governor's newly enacted Michigan Merit Scholarship plan, which provides incentives for students to focus on individual achievement as well as to pursue post-secondary education. Academic achievement is measured using the Michigan Educational Assessment Program (MEAP). It is unique in the flexibility it provides students: the scholarship can be used to cover college (private or public) or vocational training expenses, and it also provides flexibility in the type of expenses the scholarship can cover. The $2,500 Michigan Merit Award Scholarship is first available to the graduating Class of 2000. Beginning with the graduating Class of 2005, there will be an additional award of up to $500 available. The Michigan Merit Scholarship program serves as another example of a state putting student performance first. As Secretary Murray said to the Subcommittee, With this program, we continue our commitment to and focus on student achievement and school performance. The Michigan Merit Award is a meaningful promise we can make to our students: ""Study hard and achieve, and your state will stand behind you."" I can't think of a better graduation gift to our high school seniors, or a better investment in our state's future. Education Freedom Linked to Higher Achievement School choice appears to be making a significant difference in the lives of disadvantaged students, especially African-American students. Researchers from Harvard, Georgetown, and the University of Wisconsin, released a study in August 2000 showing that African American students that received privately funded scholarships moved ahead of their peers who applied for scholarships, but did not receive them. Since the scholarships were awarded by lottery, it allowed researchers to set up an experiment that followed the progress of students that received the scholarship, and those that did not. The use of randomized field trials in this study is unusual for an education study, but is standard practice in medical and other fields of research. The study compares the students' reading and math scores on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills over the first two years of the voucher program. Those moving to private schools scored six percentile points higher than those who stayed in public schools in New York City, Dayton, Ohio, and the Washington, D.C. The effect was largest in the District, where students with vouchers worth up to $1,700 moved nine percentile points ahead of public school peers.117 The effect of vouchers over two years was twice as large as the effect of class size reduction among black students in the widely cited Tennessee class size reduction experiment.118 A similar study was also conducted by the Manhattan Institute of private voucher recipients in Charlotte, North Carolina. The study found that in one year, students using  117 118  Jay Matthews, ""Scores Improve for D.C. Students With Vouchers,"" The Washington Post, August 28, 2000, p.A1.

Crossroads 2000 56   vouchers gained six points in math and seven points in reading when compared to the students who remained in the public schools.119 Another recent study found that education freedom is linked to higher student achievement. The study found that even after controlling for income, population demographics, income, education spending and class size, the amount of education freedom in a state is a significant predictor of student achievement. Texas and South Carolina, for example, are similar in characteristics that are commonly thought to influence student achievement, but Texas test scores are significantly higher. Texas offers more freedom, ranking 6th among states. South Carolina received a score that placed them 43rd.120 Despite the Administration's opposition to experimenting with school choice, public support for choice and vouchers remains strong, according to recent polls:  A Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies poll found in 1999 that 53 percent of the general population and 60 percent of African Americans support vouchers.121  Public Agenda found in its 1999 study On Thin Ice that even though more than half of Americans are uninformed about vouchers, 57 percent of the general public favor the idea of parents being given a voucher and 70 percent would seriously consider or definitely use a voucher to send their child to a private school. 68 percent of African-Americans favor the vouchers to pay for al or part of tuition.122  In August 2000 a Hunter College survey of New York City residents found vouchers favored by 87 percent of Hispanics, 83 percent of African-Americans, and 86 percent of Asians.123 In addition to public opinion being on the side of testing vouchers, a 1999 study commissioned by the U.S. Department of Education called for a ""large and ambitious"" ten-year, multi-district voucher experiment. The report was written by the National Research Council's (NRC) committee on education finance, a group of 18 experts in education. According to the report, a large-scale voucher study would help determine whether giving public school students vouchers to pay for tuition at private schools can improve achievement, especially for students in poor, urban areas: ""Both theory and empirical evidence suggest that, among choice options, charter schools and vouchers, rather than inter-district and intra-district choice programs, [are] the approaches most worthy of further exploration as vehicles for improving poor-performing schools.""124 Darcia Bowman, ""Privately Financed Vouchers Help Black Students, Two Studies Find,"" Education Week, September 6, 2000. 120 Jay P.

ES-18-19. 119  Crossroads 2000 57   The Administration has not acted on the recommendations of the NRC report, and appears unswayed by public opinion on this issue. On July 5, 2000 at the National Education Association's national convention in Chicago, Vice-President Gore stated, ""I will never, ever support private school vouchers.... It's as clear as ABC. You cannot save the public schools of America by destroying public schools in America."" Instead of promising never to support initiatives involving vouchers, based on these results the Administration should be willing to experiment to see if these achievement gains could be replicated, and as the findings indicate, put the interests of students first by freeing them to attend schools that better address their needs.  Crossroads 2000 58   CONCLUSION: PUT CHILDREN FIRST SO THAT NO CHILD IS LEFT BEHIND Over the last two years the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations has collected research, oversight and hearing data that continue to make the case that changes need to be made at all levels of government to ensure that children are truly put first in education. The lack of progress in improving achievement and narrowing achievement gaps, as well as the continued inequities in access to high quality education are unacceptable. Years of mismanagement, fraud and waste at the Department have also hurt children by reflecting poorly on the federal government's commitment to education. Simply put, the interests of children and parents are second to too many other interests. Too often education policy debates are not honest because of a fear of change and of any new policy that disrupts the status quo. Americans are not satisfied with the status quo  especially Americans with children trapped in low-performing schools. Congress should act swiftly during the next Congress to enact legislation that is right for children and their parents. Empower Parents  Expand, empower and protect charter schools.  Enact education tax deductions.  Encourage school choice. Expand Flexibility and Accountability for Results  Empower school districts to improve teacher quality or reduce class size according to their needs.  Put performance and accountability first and enact the Straight A's Act.  Empower schools to pay teachers according to their performance  Focus the federal role in education on a few important goals and consolidate and eliminate duplicative and ineffective education programs. Work to Ensure that ALL Have Access to a High Quality Education  Place a priority on raising the achievement of all students, even the lowest performing students.  Free children from failing schools.  Fight illiteracy among disadvantaged students. Ensure that Federal Dollars are Spent With Integrity at the Department of Education  Conduct oversight to ensure that the Department meets its goal of receiving a clean, independent audit.  Institute institutional checks and balances to ensure that education research, statistics and evaluations are conducted and presented in a rigorous and unbiased manner. Crossroads 2000 59    Work to improve overall management and quality of the Department's management of its finances and internal operations in order to reduce waste, fraud and abuse. Make the Federal Role in Education Less Burdensome  Eliminate and consolidate duplicative and ineffective programs.  Improve evaluation and oversight of federal programs to ensure that federal dollars produce results.  Reform the Department's Office of Education Research and Improvement (OERI) so that it serves the needs of teachers and students, not researchers, so that we know what really works in the classroom.  Ensure that federal research and program evaluation activities employ rigorous research methods in order to produce credible, useful results. There is too much at stake to allow the federal education system to dictate how children are educated in the United States. There is too much at stake to waste scarce resources on mismanagement and failed programs. Congress should work to make the difficult policy decisions that need to be made at the federal level, and empower states and parents to ensure that student performance is put first, not the status quo.

Student Performance              B. Special Programs              C. School Management                   D. Instructional Technology                       B. SPECIAL PROGRAMS        The special programs discussed in this section are mandated by state and/or federal laws, and are designed to provide students with quality educational services that meet their individual learning needs. This section includes:         English as a Second Language (ESL)       Special Education       Gifted and Talented      Although the state sets minimum guidelines for providing special programs to its student population, each district has wide latitude in implementing these programs. The school board can control the level of funding these special programs receive, and parents may also influence expenditures for special education programs.         Exhibit 2-24      summarizes the special programs as a percent of the school's total population.     Even though Ricardo ISD's student-to-teacher ratio is below the state average, it trails all of its peer districts       (Exhibit 2-3) .

Bilingual Education/English as a Second Language       Ricardo ISD does not have enough students to warrant its own bilingual program and must rely upon the experience of its teachers in serving students who have difficulty learning English. To address this issue, principals take into consideration a student's ability to read, write and understand English when assigning the student to a teacher.     Ricardo ISD's student population is 75.9 percent Hispanic. This ethnicity of the district has remained fairly constant from 1996-97 to 1998-99       (Exhibit 2-25) .

The district had one of the lowest percentages of students in the ESL program among its peers, a somewhat surprising result given its large Hispanic student population. The district has ten teachers who are certified ESL teachers. These teachers' classes are largely Hispanic so that they can provide assistance as needed. These children are not in a special class but have been placed with a special teacher.       Exhibit 2-29      compares the number of students in the ESL program, as a percentage of total enrollment, against its peer districts.

FINDING       As illustrated in the preceding exhibits, Ricardo ISD has a good balance between Hispanic teachers and students. The district has taken the time to ensure that all of the students that have difficulty with English are in classes with certified teachers. The fact that the district does not have special classes for these students provides the opportunity for them to interact with English speaking students on a regular basis. This helps the students by increasing their exposure to English and encourages them to become proficient with the language.     In addition, Ricardo ISD spends the highest percentage of its instructional budget of it peer group on Bilingual/ESL programs. ( Exhibit 2-30 ).

Special Education        Services for special education students are federally mandated and must meet specific state and federal guidelines. The most comprehensive federal law governing special education is the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). In order to meet the requirements of IDEA, school districts complete a sequence of steps listed in       Exhibit 2-31 .           Exhibit 2-31        Steps to Meet Requirements of IDEA                       Required Steps                       1)               Pre-referral intervention in regular education. When a student experiences academic problems in regular education, intervention can and should occur to remediate academic problems. Pre-referral intervention can be implemented by individual teachers or by committees or teams charged with the responsibility of providing remedial strategies. If the strategies initiated in regular education do not result in improved achievement, a referral is made to special education.                        2)               Referral to special education for evaluation. Referring a student to special education means writing an official request, supported by documentation. Teachers, counselors, parents, administrators and the student can initiate a referral. Included in the referral information must be an explanation of steps that have been taken in regular education to try to remediate the student's problem before the referral.                       3)               Comprehensive non-discriminatory evaluation. Once a student has been referred, the district must provide a comprehensive non-discriminatory evaluation, commonly referred to as an assessment, within a prescribed amount of time.                       4)               Initial placement through a committee meeting. After the evaluation is complete, a meeting is held to discuss the results of the evaluation, decide if the student qualifies for special education services in one of the 13 federal special education categories, and if so, write a plan for educating the student. In Texas, the committee is commonly referred to an ARD (Admission, Review and Dismissal) committee and, according to federal guidelines, parents must be included as active participants in the process.                       5)               Provision of educational services and supports according to a written Individualized Education Plan (IEP). The IEP developed by the ARD committee includes information about which classes the student will take, how much time will be spent in regular education, the type of service delivery model, related services like speech therapy or counseling, mode of transportation and several other considerations required by state and federal law.                       6)               Annual program review. Each year after a student's initial qualification and placement, a review is conducted to assure the provision of an appropriate program for the student. In this annual ARD meeting, the results of any evaluations are discussed, progress reviewed, goals re-written, decisions made regarding placement and programming and a new IEP written.                       7)               Three-year re-evaluation. Every three years the student may again be given a comprehensive individual assessment. Another ARD is held to discuss the results of the re-evaluation and determine if the student still qualifies for special education. Again, a complete IEP is written and plans are made for its implementation.                       8)               Dismissal from the special education program. If and when a student no longer meets special education eligibility criteria, he or she is dismissed from special education and services are no longer provided. The ARD committee must make this decision.                   Source: Public Law 101-15, the 1997 amendment to the IDEA.      At every stage of the special education process and throughout a student's tenure in special education, state and federal guidelines must be followed. If there are disagreements or objections related to evaluation, placement or service delivery, students and their families have the right to due process. School districts do not have the burden of demonstrating that their special education services are the best possible; however, the education provided must meet the individual needs of each student. Special education is an important issue in any school district because the costs associated with special education are high. While the federal government mandates specific special education services, its share of the funding for special education is usually less than 10 percent, with the rest of the costs paid from state and local funds.     Two special education teachers and two aides are responsible for coordinating the delivery of comprehensive specialized education and related services to Ricardo ISD students who meet the program's state and federal eligibility requirements. This may include specialized education, supplementary aids or transportation.         FINDING       Ricardo ISD tries to mainstream its special education students into the general student population. The elementary and middle schools each have one special education teacher and one teacher's aide. The program is a pull-out program, where the students are removed from their regular classrooms once or twice a day for special reading, math and writing instruction.     Ricardo ISD's special education program serves about 75 students or 12.5 percent of the students at Ricardo ISD. From 1997-98 to 1999-2000, the enrollment has grown 20 percent      (Exhibit 2-32) .

To provide the necessary services, Ricardo contracts with a local special education cooperative to supplement its special education services.     Ricardo ISD uses the cooperative to determine if students meet the criteria for special education. If a teacher believes that a particular student is eligible for special education, he/she must fill out a referral form. The principal and the counselor at Ricardo ISD complete the referral forms. The referral form is signed by the principal and sent to the cooperative. The referral, if completely filled out, is logged and given to the diagnostician that works with Ricardo ISD. The diagnostician then makes his/her report within 60 calendar days of the date that the referral was first initiated by Ricardo ISD. Before any testing can be done on a student, the parents must give written consent and must receive a copy of the       Procedural Safeguards     and have its contents explained. After receiving the permission the diagnostician schedules the student for the appropriate testing.     Ricardo ISD has participated in the special education cooperative, Laguna Madre Special Education Cooperative, since 1996 with two other school districts, Kingsville ISD and Kenedy County Wide ISD. The cooperative's board consists of each school district's superintendent. The board elects two officers, a chairman and a vice-chairman of the board. All members meet twice a year. The board has three primary functions:         To establish policies necessary to provide comprehensive special education services for eligible disabled children in the participating school district;       To determine the efficiency of operation of general activities and the overall value of the program; and       To annually approve an operating budget for cooperative management.

The district encourages students to take the TAAS, although 27 of the 75 students are exempt. This population includes 15 elementary school students and 12 middle school students.     The TAAS makes up a large part of a student's education. Encouraging special education students to take the test, if they wish, makes them feel more a part of the overall community, and they can take pride in the district's accomplishments as well.         COMMENDATION           Ricardo ISD attempts to mainstream its special education students into the regular student population and encourages these students to participate in the entire educational process, including TAAS testing.           FINDING       A large portion of the special education support from the special education cooperative is provided by aides rather than the professional staff. A diagnostician is assigned to Ricardo ISD to keep a regular weekly schedule on the campus. The diagnostician is responsible for performing the testing, sitting in on all Admission, Review and Dismissal meetings, writing up progress reports and conferring with parents and teachers about a particular student's progress.     Ricardo ISD also has a speech therapist assigned to the district. The speech therapist is required to keep a regular weekly schedule on the campus, and is responsible for student instruction, testing, report and schedule writing and sitting in on speech-only ARDs.     There have been mixed reviews of the effectiveness of the cooperative from other school districts. Riviera pulled out of the cooperative in 1997 citing that it did not serve the district's needs properly. However, the special education teachers at Ricardo ISD seem satisfied with the performance of the cooperative.         Recommendation 10:           Document the percentage of time that an aide instead of a specialist provides campus support, and use the findings to improve the level of professional support from the special education cooperative.           IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE                1.            The principals prepare a sign-in sheet for Laguna Madre staff.             September 2000                  2.            The superintendent sets a policy that the cooperative staff must sign in every time they are on site.             September 2000                  3.            The principals close the log out at the end of each month.             September 2000                  4.            The principals tally the number of times an aide performed the service that contractually should have been performed by a specialist.             October 2000                  5.            The principals report the findings to the superintendent and director of the cooperative.             Quarterly                  6.            The superintendent negotiates improvement.             Quarterly                 FISCAL IMPACT       This recommendation could be implemented with existing resources.         Gifted and Talented Program       Since 1987, state law has required that all Texas school districts have educational programs to serve the needs of gifted and talented (G/T) students, and that programs be available in all districts and at all grades. Gifted and talented students are characterized as having high levels of achievement, intellectual and academic ability, creativity, leadership skills and talent in the visual and performing arts.     Districts are required to have a systematic process for identifying gifted and talented students. TEA issues guidelines for the identification of gifted and talented students in an effort to ensure all these students receive a quality education. Additionally, funding for the identification of gifted and talented students and programs is available through the Texas Foundation School Program. This program is intended to provide gifted and talented programs for students from various cultural, linguistic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Districts can receive state funds for gifted and talented programs serving up to 5 percent of a district's total student population.     Texas funds gifted and talented education at 0.12 percent for up to 5 percent of the student population. In other words, districts receive an additional 12 percent of the average daily attendance for up to 5 percent of its gifted and talented student population.     Ricardo ISD's gifted and talented program has 34 students in grades K-8. This figure represents 5.6 percent of total enrollment. The district allocated 2.6 percent of its instructional expenditures to the gifted and talented program. Among its peer groups, Ricardo ISD ranks second in the percentage of the instructional budget going to G/T       (Exhibit 2-36) .

The gifted and talented program is a pull-out program where each student spends one hour per day in the gifted and talented classes. The district has one teacher for the gifted and talented program.     The selection criteria for the gifted and talented program involves a five-part evaluation:         intellectual ability (standardized test);       achievement (standardized test);       creativity (standardized test);       portfolio of student work; and       teacher referral based on observable gifted behaviors.       The process for being selected to participate in the gifted and talented program entails:         a student is nominated;       the student is tested;       the results of the tests are evaluated;       the parents are notified; and       if desired, an appeal can be filed and the process repeated.          Recommendation 11:           Explore opportunities for Internet or distance learning instruction to expand services for gifted and talented students.       Since the district cannot easily increase the teaching staff for the G/T program, Ricardo ISD should explore other options for expanding the classes available to G/T students.         IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE                1.            The principals examine classes offered via the Internet or distance learning for students and enlists the support of students in these activities.             September 2000                  2.            The principals determine which of the classes identified would be challenging in the spirit of the G/T program.             October 2000                  3.            The principals recommend possible computer-based G/T classes to the superintendent.             November 2000                  4.            The superintendent share the findings of the principals with the Board of Trustees for approval.

GX253-66-5617719	2002 Showcase of Promising Practices    Waco Independent School District | Lake Waco Montessori School  Effective Teaching Strategies for Students with Disabilities   View PowerPoint Slide Show    Lake Waco Montessori Magnet is one of five magnet schools in Waco.  The magnets are designed to provide a choice for WISD families.  The only requirement to apply for any magnet is being a resident of the WISD attendance areas.  A lottery is held every year for new applicants and the number of students drawn is based on the number of openings available at the magnet for the coming school year.  After a family has a child accepted into a magnet, all siblings are given priority and do not have to go through the lottery.  Magnets have all the same expectations and accountability requirements of any Texas public school. The Montessori classrooms are multi-aged classrooms. Students stay in each level three years (same classroom teacher.) The levels are: Primary level---three, four, and five year olds; Elementary level---first, second, and third grade; Intermediate level---fourth, fifth, and sixth grade; Middle level----seventh and eighth grade.  Special education (inclusion teachers) serve identified students in the general education classroom.  Services are stated as a minimum of thirty minutes a day.   The Lake Waco Montessori Magnet Schools pre-k through third grade program in the Waco Independent School District was validated in the category of effective teaching strategies for students with disabilities.  The practice focuses on strategies that support the students with disabilities to be successful in integrated placements.  The districts magnet school uses the curriculum and materials developed by Maria Montessori.  The curriculum emphasizes a multi-sensory approach in a multi-age environment.  The general education teachers are certified Montessori teachers.  Students with a variety of disabilities, including pervasive developmental disorders, learning disabilities, and cerebral palsy have been successfully integrated with their peers. The inclusion teacher works collaboratively as a team with the Montessori teachers, instructional assistants, therapists and parents in planning the strategies to support the students goals.  Effective technology is used to support students with disabilities to successfully master their IEP goals and to access aspects of the Montessori curriculum.  The inclusion teacher works directly with the students in the classroom during the independent work time, which is a daily component of the Montessori curriculum.  The mixed-age programming and the variety of instructional materials in the Montessori classroom are particularly effective to support the diverse needs of learners.

East Rock School is finishing its first school year of the  program, which tests the impact of introducing laptops in third through fifth  grade classrooms. Thanks in part to DeLauro’s work, East Rock was one of only  five schools in the country to receive a grant from the US Department of  Education to fund the program.     Each student in the third and fourth grade at East Rock has  their own laptop to work on throughout the day, and students complete and turn  in assignments through the school’s wireless network, creating a  nearly-paperless classroom. The project integrates curriculum, planning,  standards (state and national) and assessments infused with the latest hardware  and software. At the end of the project, a national report will be available  indicating the effects of one-to-one computing in an e-learning setting. The  project is designed to provide a collaborative and technology-rich school  culture.          “I am pleased to be here to celebrate the end of the first  year of East Rock’s fully-implemented, laptop classroom,” said DeLauro. “The  lessons these students are learning will be tremendously valuable in introducing  them to the skills they will need to thrive in today’s high-tech professional  world.”      “This program is improving student success through the  effective use of computer technology that is integrated into the daily  curriculum and supports both national and state education requirements, said  Principal Salvatore Punzo, East Rock Magnet School. “The Model Laptop Program  has also enhanced the students’ ability to work together collaboratively –  similar to the teaming skills required in higher education and the workplace.”     “My congratulations to all of East Rock’s students and  administrators for their hard work and dedication to this program,” said  DeLauro. “These children’s futures are certainly enriched by the knowledge they  are gaining.”      “Teachers, students and parents all realize the benefits and  tremendous progress we’ve made this year with the laptops in the daily  curriculum,” said Domenic Grignano, East Rock Technology Facilitator. “At an  early age, these students are becoming sophisticated users of commercial  applications like Microsoft Office, as well as being confident in their online  research skills. This program is preparing these students to become life-long  learners using all the necessary information-processing skills for the 21 st  century. ”          ###

GX023-85-11901102	"A r c h i v e d  I n f o r m a t i o n   Promising Initiatives to Improve Education in Your Community - February 2000     New American High Schools    The Department recognizes outstanding high schools that are committed to high standards for all students and have achieved excellent results.  The initiative showcases schools throughout the country that represent a broad range: comprehensive, magnet, redesigned vocational-technical schools, theme, and pilot schools as well as alternative schools serving the needs of at-risk youth.  As part of the initiative, the Department provides information and technical assistance, conducts research and evaluations, and promotes standards-based reform efforts.    In 2000, $1.4 million will be used to identify and support up to 100 new showcase sites.    New American High Schools differ from traditional high schools in many ways:      High Standards.  They have established clear standards and high expectations for all students.   Small and Safe Environments.  They are creating small, safe learning environments where students feel connected to the school and are known well and supported by caring adults.   Teachers Working Together.  They have well-prepared teachers and provide time for teachers to plan and work together.   Strong Principal Leadership.  They have principals who provide strong, effective leadership, and who work collaboratively with teachers on school improvement.   A Focus on Student Learning.  They focus on learning rather than accumulating credits, offer internships and community service learning opportunities, and provide extra help to students to help them meet high standards.   Technology to Enhance Achievement.  They use technology to expand access to information, enhance instruction, manage schedules and analyze student progress.   Results Oriented.  They use a wide variety of student assessment and data evaluation to ensure that students have mastered their subjects.    Strong Partnerships.  They cultivate strong partnerships with parents, middle schools, postsecondary institutions, community leaders, and employers.    How can your school become a New American High School?    Schools compete to become New American High Schools. Schools must supply compelling evidence indicating that they have undertaken standards-based, locally driven reform efforts that have had a positive effect on key indicators of school improvement and student success.  Schools must provide documentation showing increases in student achievement, increases in student enrollment at postsecondary institutions, increases in student attendance, and reductions in student dropout rates.    What are the benefits of becoming a New American High School?   Schools that receive New American High Schools recognition receive immediate benefits. Schools, their districts, and communities gain public recognition of their success. The 1999 award recipients were recognized at the White House by Secretary Riley.  Each school receives a small stipend to cover the cost of outreach and information-sharing activities, including participating in a network with other New American High Schools. Schools have access to a wide variety of technical assistance from the Department, including assistance on ways to improve their accountability systems and use data for continuously improving school performance. New American High Schools also inform policy and practice at the federal and state levels.    For more information call Gail Schwartz at (202) 205-5445.     Examples    Brooklyn Technical High School, Brooklyn, New York    Project Abstract:  Brooklyn Tech was instituted by a New York State legislative mandate and is open to all students of the City of New York by competitive examination.  Expectations for high academic achievement are reflected in the rigorous curriculum of this science and technology magnet.  All students take courses in all academic areas mandated by the New York State Board of Regents, including: four years of English, four years of social studies, three years of mathematics, three years of science and three years of foreign language.  Building on a ""house"" guidance system used in the first two years, students select one of fifteen career majors for their junior and senior year experience.  This system allows students with common interests to work together and establishes, within a school of 4,000 students, a smaller, more personalized learning environment.  As a result of its continuous pursuit of excellence, Brooklyn Tech was named a ""1999 U.S. News and World Report Outstanding American High School.""    Adlai Stevenson High School, Lincolnshire, Illinois    Project Abstract:  The curriculum at suburban Adlai Stevenson High School is a model of challenge and relevance for the 3,300 + students enrolled.   Newsweek  (1998) rated Stevenson among the top 20 high schools in the United States on efforts to give as many students as possible the opportunity to do the most advanced work.  The payoff at Stevenson is remarkable: more than 90 percent of 1997 graduates exceed Illinois state math and science course requirements; the College Board (1997) ranked Stevenson first in the Midwest and among the top 10 schools in the world in the Advanced Placement program for producing more AP scholars than any school in the  world ; and more than 95 percent of 1996 graduates enrolled in postsecondary education.    Michael E. DeBakey High School for Health Professions, Houston, Texas    Project Abstract:    The Michael E. DeBakey High School for Health Professions, located approximately one mile from the world renowned Texas Medical Center, is recognized as one of the finest public high schools in Texas.  The school was established in 1972 as a partnership between the Houston Independent School District and Baylor College of Medicine to address a critical shortage of health-care providers in Houston.  Today this urban school, which recruits students from across the city, has gone beyond that original mission to become a state model of pre-professional college prep in a public high school.  It prepares the most diverse student body in Texas for programs leading to potential careers in medicine, nursing, and allied health, as well as engineering, communications and finance.    Sussex Technical High School, Georgetown, Delaware    Project Abstract:    Rural Sussex Tech is one of the nation's best success stories about how a school transformed itself from an area vocational school to a school-of-choice that competes successfully for student enrollment with public and private schools.  Sussex has been restructured to promote both high standards and the integration of academic and vocational education.  The high school reorganized its occupational program into four clusters, each with a challenging program of study that includes academic and technical courses. The programs of study include advanced math and science courses in each occupational area. Sussex has eliminated all remedial and general track courses and study halls.     Publications           Key High School Reform Strategies.  A review of the literature in the education field to assess the evidence in published research that the key reform strategies being used in the ten New American High Schools have been found to be effective in improving student-level outcomes.     Seeing the Future: A Planning Guide for High Schools  offers a step-by-step planning process for new and restructuring high schools. Created by and for teachers, administrators, and community partner.     The NUHS Practitioner's Guide   presents case studies of innovative schools and offers hands-on materials for integrated, project-based learning in the school, workplace, and community.      -###-       [ The Learning Anytime Anywhere Partnerships (LAAP) ]           [ 2000 New Initiatives and Funding Opportunities ]"

GX023-60-14021207	"Archived Information    Educational Technology Expert Panel: Exemplary and Promising Educational Technology Programs 2000     Maryland Virtual High School Core Models Project   Promising Program   Program Description    The Maryland Virtual High School (MVHS) CoreModels Project has two primary goals: (1) to use computer modeling to help all high school students achieve state and national science standards, and (2) by developing and refining a process of network-based peer leadership and collaboration, to give teachers in their classrooms the support they need to integrate modeling activities into their instruction.  Started in 1997, CoreModels is based on, and is intended to institutionalize, the gains achieved by the Maryland Virtual High School program that connected rural and underserved Maryland schools to a magnet high school via the Internet.  Through this connection, MVHS supported teachers in developing and implementing computational science projects with their students.  Crucial components of the MVHS program were: (1) its focus on using computational modeling to teach complex science content, and (2) its mentoring and support for remote teachers and students provided by magnet teachers and their students.  The mentors won national recognition for their computational science projects and gained experience through a student-run laboratory at Montgomery Blair High School Magnet Program.   A model of distributed support that creates the conditions for sustainability of the changes and gains achieved by schools, the program is active in 6 to 15 schools in each of 3 CoreModels regional centers in Maryland.   Students construct their own models, utilizing the software STELLA, in areas of science such as wildlife populations, the carbon cycle, hurricane prediction, projectile motion, chemical reactions, and rock formation cycles.  Students hypothesize about the results of their model based on the parameters used in the graphical model definition.  They compare their results with other predictions, such as those from scientists or developed by other students, or with actual results as measured in practice, thus gaining an understanding of important recurring scientific concepts involving equilibrium processes, feedback, and multiple causal relationships, among others.     This process of learning brings students closer to science as it is practiced in the world outside of school.  As an example of the conceptual core of the use of modeling, students not only learn about the laws of conservation of mass and conservation of energy, but they learn to apply them in many different situations; to identify control and independent variables; to collect data and analyze the results; and to write clear step-by-step instructions for investigating their hypotheses.  In the process, students apply higher-level mathematics skills, such as ratio and proportion and setting up equations.  For example, in the glucose regulation model students simulate the glucose-insulin feedback process that the body uses in attempting to maintain homeostasis (equilibrium) and predict the effect on the body of eating a candy bar.  They practice graph analysis by determining how the model output differs from their prediction and describe what the graphs mean in terms of the body's response.  They also use the graphs to describe how the body's blood glucose and insulin concentrations differ when pasta is eaten instead of a candy bar.    The MVHS CoreModels project works through regional centers to integrate curriculum reform, staff development, and teacher professionalism in a sustainable manner.  Technology enhances and facilitates this initiative by allowing educators and students to become better at teaching and learning.  Teachers are recruited and trained to   implement computer modeling to help students understand and learn more complex scientific concepts central to biology and physics;  help students learn in a collaborative, problem-solving, interactive manner that brings them closer to the world of science; and  implement innovative pedagogical practices by being provided with scientific and technology support.   Ideally, as more teachers are recruited and trained, the pool of trainers for new teachers becomes larger, and more and more teachers become trained in the use of CoreModels.  The project had been in existence for 2 full years as of September 1, 1999.   Program Costs   For cost information, please contact program designee.   Quality and Educational Significance   Learning   MVHS CoreModels increases students' in-depth understanding and competence in their current science subject area by focusing on an analysis of change over time and on the transfer of understanding from one activity to the next.  One of the hallmarks of the project is the alignment of CoreModels activities with Maryland Science Core Learning Goals (CLGs).  CoreModels materials also focus on the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Benchmark common themes (similar to National Science Education Standards themes), which emphasize connections between seemingly disparate science content.    In using and creating computer models, student attention can be focused on similar structures and behavior across areas of study.  For example, a predator-prey interaction model and a physical spring model share the same mathematical oscillatory structure.  Disruption and resumption of equilibrium can be found in both biological and Earth systems.  Assimilating an understanding of such core structure and behavior concepts leads to acquisition of the ""schemas"" of science content, which have been shown to distinguish experts from novices (P. Chandler & J. Sweller [1991], ""Cognitive Load Theory and the Format of Instruction,""  Cognition and Instruction  8, 293-332).   Excellence for All   Modeling activities have been used with mainstreamed special education students as well as with advanced placement students.  MVHS CoreModels developed Earth science and environmental science activities because these classes often target students considered less successful in previous science courses.  In addition, center directors, who observe all teachers within their region, help teachers develop higher expectations for students in nonacademic classes by suggesting visits to teachers already successfully using activities with similar groups of students.   One reason exemplary science activities are not available to all students is that only a fraction of eligible teachers take the initiative to investigate and apply to summer training programs.  Facilitating organizational change through the CoreModels Centers is needed to provide training for additional teachers and learning opportunities for all their students.  The group of teachers thus targeted typically teach the non-AP and nonhonors classes so that affecting the practice of these teachers is one step toward contributing to educational excellence for all.   Organizational Change   One vital component of the MVHS CoreModels project is the role of the teacher in developing activities and evaluating their effectiveness in the classroom.  Extending the initial success of MVHS in developing a remote, network-based collaborative learning environment, the CoreModels program supports teachers' ability to change and integrate curriculum and technology through the use of peer mentors.   Capacity building is another important aspect of MVHS CoreModels.  The project is deeply committed to the development of leadership among participating teachers; its predecessor, MVHS, was a teacher-developed, teacher-led program.  Although the CoreModel program's institutionalization goals call for a leadership team (the project director, three regional center directors, and eight supporting teachers), the participating teachers collaborate with leaders in presenting outreach workshops and in developing materials.  This expanding leadership has allowed the project to respond to opportunities to create districtwide and school-based training opportunities as well as to reach out to all teachers, meeting them where they are.  Teachers are immersed in a profound form of professional development when they work together to adapt materials for the specific needs of a particular class; when they prepare a presentation for a group of colleagues; or when they think through how modeling can be used to facilitate and assess student learning in a new content or skill area.    Evidence of Effectiveness   Preliminary results show that learning appeared to have been enhanced by the use of the CoreModels project.    Students in one science class using the CoreModels project improved their scores 46 percent on the Force Concept Inventory test, while students in another school, regarded as the best in the county but not using the program, improved by only 27 percent.  In addition, a school with all its biology teachers involved in the CoreModels project led its district in the initial results of the state biology exam.   Usefulness to Others   The very structure of MVHS CoreModels lends credence to a claim of usefulness to others.  The project includes regional centers, 15 local educational authorities, and 31 schools.  Growth and dissemination have been extremely successful in regions with very different demographic and political characteristics, and the program has been adapted differently on the school, district, and regional levels.    The program's technology requirements are relatively simple, understandable, and affordable.  Schools can purchase the site license for STELLA software for $500.  Unlike subject-specific simulation software, STELLA is technology problem-solving software (National Educational Technology Standards).  In addition to computers running STELLA, Internet access should be available for teachers to collaborate with peers and to access models and materials.  In adapting the MVHS CoreModels program, leaders could access materials available through the MVHS site, as well as other system dynamic modeling archives such as the Creative Learning Exchange.

GX059-40-6447018	Remarks by Charles Alex Martin before the United States Committee on Education and the Workforce’s field hearing on  Excellence in Education through Innovation and Alternatives , Thursday, August 12, 1999.    Representatives DeMint and Norwood:    It is both a privilege and an honor to have the opportunity to come before you this morning to participate in this important field hearing on  Excellence in Education through Innovation and Alternatives.  As a life-long educator, I believe that adapting our school programs to meet the ever-changing requirements of our students is our greatest challenge. At Greenville Senior High Academy, we use innovation and alternatives to encourage every student to reach his or her greatest potential. I am delighted to share our program with you this morning.    Greenville Senior High School Academy is located in the heart of downtown Greenville and serves a diverse population consisting of students from our city’s most affluent and most poverty stricken communities.    The mission of Greenville Senior High School is to prepare students for life as contributing members in a democratic, multi-cultural society for the 21 st  century; to provide all students the opportunity to achieve success in a safe, non-threatening environment; and to encourage students to develop a life-long love for learning.     As one of our district’s 13 magnet academies, Greenville Senior High School Academy of Academic Excellence offers students a curriculum with increased academic opportunities in all programs of instruction. Recognition of academic excellence is awarded in two areas of distinction: the Advanced Academic Program and the Career Pathways Program.     The Advanced Academic Program requires a minimum of five units of Advanced Placement courses; four years of foreign language; increased units in science, math, fine arts, and computer technology; and a senior project. This course of study enhances a student’s admission opportunities to leading colleges and universities while increasing their scholarship possibilities.     The Career Pathways Program offers an emphasis on School-to-Work components and includes applied academic/technology courses; two-years of foreign language; increased units in science, math and computer technology; a shadowing experience; and a two-year cooperative education program. Students who select this program should be highly marketable in both business and industry and should perform well at high level technical schools.     The College Preparatory Program serves students who do not wish to apply for either program. This option provides a rigorous academic course of study and increased availability of computer technology.    This dual magnet program in both academics and career pathways offers students a variety of ways to reach their personal objectives either in college placement, immediate employment or a combination of the two.     The more demanding requirements for the Advanced Academic Program result in a greater number of students taking higher level science and math classes with a correspondingly higher student population taking Advanced Placement classes.     Advanced technology and cooperative learning opportunities with local industries heavily support the Career Pathways Program. An apprenticeship program further serves to integrate school and work environments. The Cooperative Learning Program also assists local industries as they struggle to hire qualified individuals in what is now a very tight job market.     How has this magnet program positively affected Greenville High School Academy?    More than 230 students have been accepted into the magnet program at Greenville High School since its inception in 1997. These students have helped alleviate the school’s once declining enrollment and have had a tremendously positive impact on the staff and student body. In addition, student achievement has risen significantly. Test scores have increased and student achievement in the classroom has soared with the number of honor roll students reaching all time highs.    Are other schools with magnet schools enjoying similar successes?    I am happy to report that they are. As I stated earlier, Greenville High is one of 13 magnet schools in the district. Our magnet programs offer unique educational choices to the students of Greenville County by providing a strong core curriculum enhanced with extensive course work in a specialized area of study. Elementary Programs include: Blythe Academy of Languages, East North Street Academy of Math and Science, Hollis Academy of Year-Round Education, and Stone Academy of Communication Arts.    Our middle school programs include: Beck Academy Middle Years International Studies Program, Greenville Middle School Academy of Traditional Studies, Hughes Academy of Science and Technology, League Academy of Communication Arts, and Parker Academy of Fine Arts and Humanities.     And finally, our high school programs include our programs as we as: Carolina High School and Academy of Pre-Engineering Technology and Health Professions, J.L. Mann High School Academy of Mathematics, Science and Technology and Southside High/Center for International Studies.     I am proud that The School District of Greenville County has placed an importance in Excellence in Education through Innovation and Alternatives by establishing our magnet school programs. While our children benefit from these programs now, our community, state and nation will ultimately reap the greatest benefits. For as these children succeed in our classrooms, they prepare themselves for success in our businesses, boardrooms and perhaps even halls of Congress.    I applaud you for taking time away from what I know are very busy schedules to let us share our programs with you today.     Now, I will be happy to answer any questions you might have for me.

GX251-56-5382393	"Innovative Practices  V. Innovative Educational Methods and Practices in MSAP Schools This chapter examines the extent to which federally funded magnet projects and schools feature innovative educational methods and practices that meet identified student needs and interests. In examining this question, we take a broad view of innovative practices. These include: innovation in the overall school program or mission (e.g., a new school focus or theme); innovations in instructional practices (e.g., new curriculum content or pedagogy); and innovations in supports for teaching and learning (e.g., new professional development activities for teachers, or improvements in the school climate). Drawing on recent research on school effectiveness, we hypothesize that changes in these three areas may lead to improved student achievement in several ways. In particular, as shown in Figure V-1, we anticipate that adopting a clear school mission or focus and implementing strong supports for teaching and learning will help improve the quality of instruction.1 Improvements in instructional quality, in turn, should lead to gains in student achievement. 2, 3  1  2  3  See, for example, Bryk, A., V.

As shown in Figure V-1, we also hypothesize effects of external policies and supports, including alignment with standards and assessments and coordination with other reforms.

The results are based on data from a survey completed by MSAP principals during the 1999-2000 school year--the second year of the MSAP grant. In our second and third evaluation reports, to appear in 2001 and 2002, we will report results based on a survey of principals to be conducted during 2000-01, the third year of the MSAP grant, and we will examine the relationships between the innovations adopted by MSAP schools and student achievement.4 The chapter is organized in five sections. In the first three sections, we describe the key innovations that MSAP schools have implemented in their programs, classroom instruction, and supports for teaching and learning. Then, we consider the approaches that MSAP schools have taken to identify and respond to student needs. Finally, we examine the extent to which MSAP schools have served as models for other schools and districts interested in adopting new practices.  Innovations in the School Program One key characteristic of magnet schools is the adoption of a theme or focus area. A theme is expected to enhance the effectiveness of magnet schools by nurturing the development of a unique school identity and by promoting a coherent curriculum and program of instruction. To identify the theme or themes adopted by each MSAP school, we reviewed the MSAP grant applications, and, for each school, we classified the themes using the following categories. (We classified each school's theme in multiple categories if more than one category fit.)               Mathematics--usually specified only as ""math""; often linked to science Science--both general science and, less frequently, specific areas of study such as zoological sciences or medical sciences Technology--generally one of several descriptors by schools emphasizing the use of computers and other high-tech equipment; often linked to mathematics and science Academics--themes focusing on academic subject areas other than mathematics and science (e.g., language arts, humanities, government, or law) Language--foreign language study, including language immersion programs Gifted and Talented Education (GATE)--special academic programs designed for high-achieving students Arts--fine, graphic, integrated, performing, and visual arts; drama; and music all included Careers--programs to help prepare students for careers in general (most common at the elementary level) or for specific careers (most common at the high school level, with themes such as Aerospace/Aviation, Pre-Engineering, Medical Professions, and Travel and Tourism) Communications--mass media, broadcasting, written communication, and communication in general Community--programs that either conduct studies of the community or are linked to it through volunteer service or special projects Global studies--expansion of the curriculum to take in the world, for a general orientation or for a specific focus such as Pacific Rim Studies  4  See Chapter VI and the Methodology section of the Overview Appendix for more information on our planned analyses of student achievement.  American Institutes for Research  V-3   Innovative Practices     Comprehensive models--externally developed education models or teaching methodologies that MSAP schools identify as an important aspect of their theme Other themes--themes that do not fit into the other categories  Figure V-2, below, displays the percentage of the 286 MSAP schools that have themes in each of these areas.5 At the elementary level, the most common themes are science, technology, the arts, and communications. At the middle school level, the common themes are similar: science, mathematics, technology, and the arts. At the high school level, programs in science, technology, and academics, as well as career-oriented programs, are quite frequent. Themes based on externally developed comprehensive educational models and teaching methodologies also are fairly common, especially in elementary and middle schools. The models most frequently mentioned are the Pre- or Primary International Baccalaureate (16 schools), Montessori (12 schools), Microsociety (5 schools), Paideia (5 schools), Multiple Intelligences (3 schools), and Core Knowledge (3 schools).

In fact, about 56 percent of MSAP schools report adopting an externally designed model.6 The adoption of comprehensive designs is especially likely in school-wide Title I schools. Sixty-one percent of MSAP schools operating school-wide Title I programs have adopted external designs, compared to 54 percent of schools operating Title I targeted assistance programs, and 48 percent of non-Title I schools. The percentage of MSAP Title I schools adopting comprehensive models 5 6  See Table A-V-1 in Appendix V. See Table A-V-2 in Appendix V.  V-4  Global  American Institutes for Research   Innovative Practices  is considerably higher than the percentage for Title I schools overall. Nationally, in 1998-99, about 31 percent of Title I schools had adopted comprehensive reform models.7 The ten most commonly adopted externally developed models adopted by MSAP schools include five of the six identified above as part of magnet school themes (International Baccalaureate, Montessori, Microsociety, Paideia, and Multiple Intelligences), as well as five others (Success for All, Coalition of Essential Schools, Mastery Learning, Accelerated Schools, and the Comer School Development Program). About half of the MSAP schools that adopted models selected one of these ten.8 (See Figure V3.) The models selected by the other schools are relatively uncommon--each by and large being selected by only one or two schools.

Thus, we asked the principal of each MSAP school to indicate whether the school had introduced changes in instruction in mathematics, science, language arts, or social studies since the MSAP award. Overall, about 53 percent of MSAP schools report making changes in instructional practices in mathematics, 48 percent in science, 59 percent in language arts, and 41 percent in social studies.9 The data indicate that MSAP Title I schools are more likely to report making changes in instructional practices in the core subjects than non-Title I schools. Figure V-4 displays the results for MSAP elementary schools.10 For example, in mathematics 30 percent of non-Title I elementary schools report changes in instruction, compared to 63 percent for Title I targeted assistance schools and nearly 60 percent for Title I school-wide programs. These differences between Title I and non-Title I schools suggest that receipt of an MSAP award may engender a process of curriculum reform in Title I schools. In non-Title I schools, an MSAP award may help develop a new curriculum area or theme, without necessarily affecting the full program of instruction.

In mathematics, many principals report increasing the emphasis given to higher order thinking skills--for example, problem solving, reasoning, work with open-ended problems, and inquiry. About 35 percent of the elementary schools that report making changes in the instruction of elementary mathematics cite increasing the emphasis on higher order thinking.11 At the middle and high school level, schools report adding new mathematics courses and, especially at the high school level, increasing the use of technology. Similarly, in science, at all levels, schools report an increased emphasis on higher order thinking, content integration across courses, and technology. In addition, about 20 percent of elementary and middle schools report increasing the integration of science with other subjects. In language arts, elementary schools report an increased emphasis on balanced instructional methods (e.g., phonemic awareness in the early grades), integration across subjects, and changes in grouping for instruction (for example, periodic regrouping of students based on achievement). At the middle and high school levels, principals report the addition of new courses, as well as increased efforts to align instruction with state and district standards, and the incorporation of technology. Finally, in social studies, elementary and middle school principals report increased integration of social studies with other subjects. At the high school level, they report increased alignment with state and district standards, the addition of new courses, and the incorporation of technology.  Innovations in Supports for Teaching and Learning We gathered data on each of the nine types of supports for teaching and learning in MSAP schools that were included in the conceptual model in Figure V-1:            Ongoing professional development for teachers Professional community among teachers Positive school climate Mechanisms for student academic support and personalization Mechanisms for parental involvement Organization of school day and staff configuration focused on learning High standards for all students School leadership focused on teaching and learning Continuous improvement processes  In the discussion below, we focus on three of these: high standards for all students, a strong professional community among teachers, and a positive school climate. These three types of supports for teaching and learning have been given particular attention in the literature on effective schools (see footnote 1, in this chapter), and thus they are especially critical. We plan to focus on other dimensions in later reports. Standards. The adoption of high standards for all students is a key element of current school reform efforts. At the state and district levels, such reforms include the development of curriculum 11  See Table A-V-5 in Appendix V.  American Institutes for Research  V-7   Innovative Practices  frameworks, aligned assessments, and student performance standards. (See Chapter IV for a discussion of these state- and district-level reforms.) If standards are to have an effect at the school level, they must be translated into specific curriculum interventions and required activities for students--for example, requirements that all students encounter particular types of content or engage in particular types of intellectual tasks. To examine the standards set for students at the school level, we asked each MSAP principal whether the school required particular types of content or instructional practices for all students. The specific required practices we asked about differed at the elementary, middle, and high school levels, reflecting differences in the curriculum across the three levels. At the elementary level, we asked about eight required practices that have been suggested in the literature on effective schools: one hour of reading each day; one hour of math each day; three hours of science each week; a required number of books to read; a required amount of writing; a required oral presentation; a required amount of homework; and a required portfolio. Figure V-5 shows the percentage of MSAP elementary schools that have adopted each type of requirement, separately for non-Title I, Title I targeted assistance, and Title I school-wide schools.12 (The results of comparable analyses for middle and high school are shown in Appendix V.) The results indicate that nearly all MSAP schools require at least one hour of reading and math each day. A smaller but still substantial proportion of MSAP schools requires each of the other activities. In general, Title I schools are somewhat less likely than non-Title I schools to have adopted the specific requirements we asked about.  12  See Table A-V-6(a) in Appendix V.

The results for MSAP elementary schools are presented in Figure V-6, with each dot indicating one MSAP elementary school. For example, 0 practices has three dots, indicating that three elementary schools require none of the eight practices; 1 also has three dots, indicating that three schools require one of the eight practices, and so on to 8 practices, with 42 dots, indicating that 42 elementary schools require all eight practices. (The 42 elementary schools account for 27 percent of all the MSAP elementary schools summarized in the figure.13) As Figure V-6 shows, substantial variation is found across MSAP elementary schools in the extent to which these high standards for all students have been implemented. While 42 MSAP elementary schools require all eight practices, 13 schools (8 percent) require none, one, or two.  13  See Table A-V-7 in Appendix V. Results for middle and high schools also are shown in this table.

Recent research has called attention to professional community among school staff as an important element of effective schools (e.g., the research cited in footnote 1 of this chapter). For example, Newmann and Wehlage have defined professional community in terms of three conditions: a shared sense of purpose among teachers focusing on student learning; collaborative activity to achieve the shared purpose; and a sense of collective responsibility for student learning.14 To gather data on aspects of professional community in each MSAP school, we asked each principal to express agreement or disagreement with 14 short statements about the work environment in the school. The results are presented in Figure V-7.15 The results show that some aspects of professional community are more common than others in MSAP schools. For example, principals of most MSAP schools strongly agree that their teachers care about students. About half strongly agree that their teachers support each other, are willing to put in extra hours, and collaborate. Fewer principals strongly agree that rules are enforced or that there is coordination across grades. For all but three of the 14 elements of professional community we asked about, elementary principals reported more positive conditions that did secondary principals. The three exceptions are teacher coordination across grades, principal confidence in the expertise of their staff, and the principal's belief that it is worthwhile to do his or her best. (On the latter, the percentage of principals reporting this as a problem is very small for both elementary and secondary schools.) 14 15  Newmann, F. and G. Wehlage. Successful School Restructuring.

First we created an index by averaging each principal's degree of agreement with the 14 statements about the school work environment described above, coding strongly agree=4, agree=3, disagree=2, and strongly disagree=1. A value of the composite index of 4 indicates that the principal strongly agreed with all 14 statements about the school work environment we included on the survey. Since the statements generally describe positive aspects of professional community, this implies a strong professional community in the school.16 An index value of 3 might indicate that the principal expressed agreement (but not strong agreement) with each statement, or it might indicate a mix of strong agreement on some items and disagreement on others. Thus, an index value of 3 represents a somewhat less strong sense of professional community than an index value of 4. Similarly, an index value of 2 might indicate that the principal expressed disagreement with each statement, or it might indicate a mix of strong disagreement and agreement, implying a relatively weak sense of community. Finally, an index value of 1 indicates that the principal strongly disagreed with all 14 statements included on the survey. This implies little sense of professional community in the school.  16  We reverse-coded two negative items: ethnic differences create tensions, and it is sometimes a waste of time to do my best.

Figure V-8 shows that most of the schools have index values between 3 (agree) and 4 (strongly agree), indicating that relatively high levels of professional community are reported for the MSAP elementary schools. Some variation is also evident: some MSAP elementary schools have index values between 2 and 3, indicating moderate levels of professional community, and two schools have index values below 2.

As a final measure of the supports for teaching and learning in MSAP schools, we asked the principal of each MSAP school to report on the extent to which eight types of student problems are present in the school.19 The eight types of problems include: tardiness, absenteeism, transience, apathy, lack of parental involvement, poverty, students unprepared to learn, and poor health. 17 18 19  See Table A-V-9 in Appendix V. See Table A-V-9 in Appendix V. The items we used are drawn from the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS). Analyses based on the 1993-94 SASS, the most recent year for which data are currently available, indicate that principals tend to report that school problems are somewhat less severe than do teachers in the same school. Thus, we expect that the results presented above may be more positive than the results we would have obtained if we had surveyed teachers. See Henke, R.R., S.P. Choy, S. Geis, and S.P. Broughman, Schools and Staffing in the United States: A Statistical Profile, 1993-94. Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Education, 1996.  V-12  American Institutes for Research   Innovative Practices  As shown in Figure V-9, more than 30 percent of MSAP elementary, middle, and high school principals report that poverty is a serious problem in their schools, and more than 20 percent report that students arriving unprepared to learn is a serious problem.20 More than 10 percent of elementary school principals, more than 15 percent of middle school principals, and more than 20 percent of high school principals report that lack of parental involvement and student transience are serious problems. One way to assess these results is to compare them with the results obtained by the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) in a national sample of schools. SASS results are available for the nation as a whole, as well as for central city, suburban (urban fringe/large town), and rural/small town schools. This comparison suggests that the percent of MSAP principals reporting serious problems is higher than the percent for the overall national population of schools, and slightly lower than the national results for principals in central city schools.21 Figure V-9 Percentage of Principals Reporting Serious Student Problems in MSAP Schools, by Level 40 % Percent of MSAP principals reporting serious problem  35 %  Elem entary School Middle School H igh School  30 %  25 %  20 %  15 %  10 %  5%  0% Ta rdin ess A bse ntee ism Transie nce A pathy La ck of pa rental invo lvem ent P ove rty U nprepa red to lea rn P oor hea lth  Ty pe of S tude nt Problem  n=264 to 266 schools (varies with items) Source: MSAP Principal Survey, 1999-2000, Item 11  To summarize our data on problems in each MSAP school, we created another composite index by averaging each principal's responses concerning the eight problems shown in Figure V-9, coding each response as follows: serious problem=4, moderate problem=3, minor problem=2, and not a problem=1. The results for MSAP elementary schools are shown in Figure V-10, with each dot again representing one MSAP elementary school.22 As the figure shows, the variation across schools is quite substantial. Some 20 21  22  See Table A-V-10 in Appendix V. For example, in 1993-94, the most recent year for which SASS data are currently available, 26 percent of principals of central city elementary schools reported that poverty was a serious problem, as did 11 percent of suburban elementary principals, 22 percent of central city secondary principals, and 8 percent of suburban secondary principals. The percents of principals reporting that students arrive unprepared to learn are 19, 8, 17, and 9 respectively. (See Henke et al., 1996.) See Table A-V-11 in Appendix V.  American Institutes for Research  V-13   Innovative Practices  MSAP elementary schools have index values between 1 and 2, indicating that, on average, the problems in the school range from none to minor. At the same time, some schools have index values between 3 and 4, indicating that, on average, the problems in the school range from moderate to serious. (Results for middle and high schools are shown in the Appendix.23) Figure V-10 Extent of Student Problems in MSAP Elementary Schools 25  20  Number of MSAP schools  15  10  5  0  1 Not a problem  2 Minor problem  3 Moderate problem Extent of problems  4 Serious problem  How to read: Each dot represents one MSAP elementary school. n=159 schools Source: MSAP Principal Survey, 1999-2000, Item 12  In addition to asking about the student problems discussed above, we also asked about several other types of problems some MSAP schools face, including vandalism and physical abuse of teachers, as well as alcohol and drug abuse. The results are shown in Figure V-11.24 While these problems are less common than the types of student problems shown in Figure V-9, some of them do occur in MSAP schools, especially in MSAP middle and high schools. For example, six percent of the principals of MSAP middle and high schools report that disrespect for teachers is a serious problem, and eight percent of the principals of MSAP high schools report that pregnancy is a serious problem.  23 24  See Table A-V-11 in Appendix V.

MSAP Project Directors told us:  The MSAP Project Director in one district says that the integrated thematic instruction in one MSAP school has two benefits. It is raising student achievement and reducing the number of behavior problems.  A number of Project Directors have reported that the MSAP grants bring new energy to their schools, but it takes time and effort to get the programs started. As one Project Director stated, ""For the first time since our project started 12 months ago, this month I began to hear principals saying, `My students and staff are energized by this grant.' We are `settling in' after all sorts of efforts to get things going. It took a lot of time, and it was a challenge to get the computers hooked up.""  American Institutes for Research  Dropping  for  Alcohol  or  of  of  out  V-15   Innovative Practices    An MSAP school is one of 30 schools in the state recognized for its educational reforms in incorporating arts into the core subjects, and it has established links with a community college, business partners, and other members of the community. For example, students and faculty at an MSAP high school worked together, creating a sculpture to celebrate the millennium through a state Art Museum effort. The Project Director says, ""The community has benefited so much from this grant,"" and notes that ""students have a thriving school that would otherwise be dying.""  Responding to Student Needs and Interests MSAP schools are intended to adopt innovative practices that meet identified student needs and interests. We set out to examine the extent to which this objective has been met, in several ways. First, we asked each MSAP principal whether the school administers a parent satisfaction survey or student survey to assess school performance. We reasoned that surveys of this type would indicate a commitment to identify student needs and interests. Overall, about 57 percent of MSAP school principals report using a parent satisfaction survey for school self-assessment, and about 58 percent report using a student survey.25 As a second approach to examining the extent to which MSAP programs incorporate information on students' needs and interests, we asked whether several specific practices have been implemented, including the provision of additional time for low achievers, individualized instruction, and tutoring by non-school staff. Between 55 and 62 percent of MSAP schools had adopted each of these practices prior to the MSAP award, and between 30 and 41 percent of MSAP schools have adopted each of these practices since the award or plan to do so in the next two years. Only 2 to 7 percent of MSAP schools have no plans to implement these practices.26 Finally, we asked principals to report on the ways in which two types of students with special needs are engaged in magnet programs: students with individual education plans (IEPs), and limited English proficient (LEP) students. We found that, on average, in MSAP elementary schools, 86 percent of students with IEPs are involved in regular magnet activities (i.e., magnet activities intended for all students), 78 percent are involved in MSAP middle schools, and 69 percent are involved in MSAP high schools. In addition, 40 percent of elementary students with IEPs are also involved in magnet activities specially designed to accommodate students with special needs, as are 44 percent of middle school students with IEPs, and 25 percent of high school students with IEPs.27 Similarly, in MSAP elementary schools, 80 percent of LEP students are involved in regular magnet activities, as are 86 percent in MSAP middle schools, and 72 percent in MSAP high schools. In addition, at the elementary level, 37 percent of LEP students are involved in magnet activities specifically designed to accommodate LEP students, as are 32 percent at the middle school level, and 26 percent at the high school level. About 22 percent of elementary LEP students are involved in bilingual magnet activities, as are 10 percent of middle school LEP students, and 2 percent of high school LEP students. All of these results suggest that magnet school programs are making efforts to respond to students with special needs and interests.  25 26 27  See Appendix Table A-V-13 in Appendix V. See Appendix Table A-V-14 in Appendix V. See Appendix Table A-V-15 in Appendix V.  V-16  American Institutes for Research   Innovative Practices  The interviews we conducted with district MSAP project directors provide a detailed illustration of the strategies one project has implemented to accommodate the specific needs of at-risk students. An MSAP Project Director told us:    One MSAP project is making special efforts to serve low-achieving students. They are using funds normally set aside for summer school to identify the most at-risk students and involve them in extended-day schooling. They have also developed instructional packages aimed directly at working with low-achieving students. As a result, other schools are requesting the materials and asking to participate in the professional development activities that focus on the materials. In addition, the project has developed training packages on innovative practices, drawing considerable attention from other schools.  Role of MSAP Schools as Models To examine the role of MSAP schools as models of the implementation of innovative practices, we asked each MSAP principal whether the school has provided information to other schools. Overall, about 70 percent of MSAP principals report that they have provided such information.28 MSAP high schools are somewhat more likely than elementary schools to serve as models: about 81 percent of MSAP high school principals report that they have shared information with other schools, compared to about 66 percent of elementary school principals. Nearly three-quarters of the MSAP principals also report that they have received requests for information from researchers and others outside the schools. We asked about the types of information most frequently requested. Principals report that the most frequent requests are for information about the school's theme. Requests for information on classroom instruction also are relatively common, especially about the use of computers and other technology; as are requests about instructional supports, including information on the use of time (e.g., block scheduling), parental involvement, and improvements in school safety and climate. Our telephone interviews with district MSAP project directors provide several specific examples of the ways MSAP schools have served as models.  28  See Table A-V-16 in Appendix V.  American Institutes for Research  V-17   Innovative Practices  MSAP Project Directors told us:       The teachers in one MSAP school developed a checklist tool to make the database of objectives more manageable. It has been circulated within the district, and other, nonMSAP staff are now using it as well. A grantee district that received a Global Connection grant to increase the use of technology across subject areas in all of its schools has turned to its MSAP high school as a source of ideas for other schools in the city. At state and national conferences as well as local training sessions, the school's teachers have shared innovative practices on the integration of academic and vocational classes through the use of technology. The school has had many visitors from other states and countries who are interested in the innovative practices developed at the school. One MSAP project has found professional development particularly useful, and it has fostered certain practices in other district schools. These practices include, for example, being able to schedule common planning and discussion time for teachers; and giving teachers blank tapes so that they can videotape themselves in the classroom and review the tapes in private. Some of the program's MSAP teachers have received national recognition as being exemplary.  What We Have Learned  MSAP schools have adopted a variety of themes, with many focusing on science, technology, the arts, communication, and careers. Many MSAP schools have also adopted programs based on externally developed comprehensive models, such as the International Baccalaureate, Montessori, and Success for All. Many MSAP schools--especially Title I schools--have introduced changes in the instruction of mathematics, science, language arts, and social studies since receiving the MSAP award. These changes frequently involve giving additional emphasis to higher order thinking, including problem solving, reasoning inquiry, and applications. There is considerable variation across MSAP schools in supports for teaching and learning. In particular, schools vary in the extent to which they have established high standards for all students, in the sense of professional community among teachers, and in school climate. There is evidence that many MSAP schools have developed programs that respond to individual students' needs--for example, through the provision of extended learning time, or through the inclusion of students with special needs in magnet programs. Some magnet schools--especially high schools--serve as models for other schools in their areas or provide information to researchers and other audiences. In particular, MSAP schools provide information on their school themes and focus areas, on changes in instructional practices, and on supports for teaching and learning.         What We Hope to Learn  While our data from the MSAP applications and the MSAP Principal Survey provide a broad overview of the themes that MSAP schools have selected, we do not yet  V-18  American Institutes for Research   Innovative Practices          know how well the schools have been able to implement instructional practices consistent with these themes. Our Case Study data should provide important new information on this topic. The information on instruction available for this report is entirely based on the principal's perspective; we do not yet know how teachers describe instruction in their classrooms. We are observing classrooms in Case Study schools and plan to collect data from teachers in Case Study schools in spring 2001. While we have provided an initial portrait of the supports for teaching and learning in MSAP schools, this picture is entirely based on data from MSAP principals. We should learn much more about professional development, leadership, and the sense of community and climate, based on data from teachers to be collected in spring 2001. Our survey data indicate that many MSAP schools have developed programs designed to respond to individual student needs; we lack information from students about the extent to which the MSAP programs have succeeded in meeting these needs. Our student focus groups should provide important information about this. While we know that many MSAP schools have served as models or provided information on their magnet programs, we do not know how well MSAP schools have played this role. We should learn much more about this in our upcoming site visits.  American Institutes for Research  V-19"

GX019-61-3630599	"A r c h i v e d  I n f o r m a t i o n   Family Involvement in Children's Education - October 1997     Wendell Phillips Visual and Performing Arts Magnet:   An Open-Door Policy for Inner-City Parents  Kansas City Public Schools  Kansas City, Missouri    Overview     A goal of Phillips Visual and Performing Arts Magnet School is to empower families and school staff by making them equally responsible for student learning.  It is exemplified by the staff and principal's open door policy--parents are always encouraged to voice their opinion and participate in school activities.  Each day, the Title I-funded parent-community liaison coordinates parent participation in activities such as the school's active tutoring program and provides family outreach and support services designed to draw parents into their children's educational lives.  In January 1996, Phillips adopted the Accelerated Schools approach to learning that seeks to raise student achievement through a learning environment built around high expectations and substantial parent involvement.  The principal, teachers, students, parents, and interested community members all participate in setting goals under this approach.    Students at Phillips concentrate not only on excelling academically but also on the arts. The school has music labs, a fully equipped dance studio, and an art studio; it also employs full-time staff members who specialize in each of these areas.    Context    Phillips, a schoolwide program, is located in the inner city within blocks of the historic section of Kansas City.  Years ago much of the neighborhood housing was demolished to make room for a freeway, but today moderate and low-income housing units are being built as part of the revitalization of the local neighborhood.  The neighborhood around the school is predominantly African American, and Phillips' student population of about 400 students in grades K-5 is 70 percent African American, 22 percent white, and 8 percent Hispanic.  Most students are from moderate to low-income households located within ten miles of the school, 79 percent are eligible for free or reduced price lunches, and at least 33 percent come from single-parent families.   Breaking Down Barriers to Family Involvement  A major goal of Phillips' parent involvement efforts is to build trust between the school and parents, many of whom live in poverty.  To do this, the school works to meet those family needs (such as transportation and child care) that will help draw parents into the school, offers information and training to support parent involvement, and actively solicits and implements parents' advice on school-related decisions.         ""We will have a school that addresses the needs of all students.  We recognize that to be successful in this endeavor we must include and involve all entities surrounding each child. Therefore, the major components of our plan will be: school, parents, and the community working together collaboratively to support the academic, emotional, and cultural development of our children.""   Principal, Wendell Phillips Visual and Performing Arts Magnet    Overcoming Time and Resource Constraints    In a high-poverty school like Phillips, administrators recognize that family problems can be overwhelming at times--for both the individual family members and the school staff who work with them.  Phillips ranks among its top priorities not only finding time for teachers to work with families but also meeting families' needs for transportation and child care.  Simply getting parents into the school is often key to laying the foundation for a successful partnership.      Finding time for teachers.   Using Title I funds, Wendell Phillips hired a full-time parent-community liaison in 1995.  She helps organize all school-family events, allowing teachers and principals to devote more time to meeting with parents to discuss student learning and spend less time making logistical and administrative arrangements.  The liaison keeps teachers informed about family needs, makes referrals for students with medical or behavioral needs, and helps teachers spread information on school-related issues to all parents.  For example, last year the liaison led an orientation for parents on state and district policies on attendance, discipline, bussing, grading procedures, and educational goals and objectives.  She also discussed parents' rights and responsibilities under the Title I program.  In addition, the liaison visits parents at home--often in the evening or on weekends--or at work, or calls them if their children are having problems or not attending school.  Each week, she averages about ten home visits.     Helping families find the time and other resources to support their children's education.  The liaison schedules all school meetings at times when parents can conveniently attend.  Given that this magnet school draws students from different parts of the city, the liaison finds parents' transportation to be essential to parent attendance.  She arranges carpools, picks up parents, and occasionally sends a taxi for parents who need transportation.  Also, she ensures that babysitting is available for those parents who are unable to attend unless they bring their small children. This year the school plans to serve food at meetings and activities to attract those parents who might come straight from work.      The liaison also responds to staff concerns that some students have personal needs that interfere with their overall academic progress.  For instance, in 1995-96 the faculty noted that some students needed haircuts, so the school brought in a barber who gave 15 haircuts to students each month.  This year, the school arranged for parents who work as barbers to visit the school every Monday to give haircuts to students who need them.  The liaison said that improving students' self-image can often lead to improvement in their self-confidence and ability to concentrate on schoolwork.  School staff also arranged to provide warm clothing, eyeglasses, and dental work for students in need.   Providing Information and Training to Parents and School Staff   Through workshops and outreach activities, the parents of children attending Wendell Phillips can learn skills and strategies to form a meaningful home-school partnership.  Training parents to support children's academic progress.   Phillips provides training to teach parents and other caregivers to support children's academic progress.  For example, Wendell Phillips pays for parents to attend a two-day regional conference sponsored by the National Coalition of Title I/Chapter 1 parents that focuses on making parents more aware of the issues concerning their child's education.  Topics covered include strategies to assist students with reading at home, standards and assessments, effective discipline, and understanding the Title I program.  At least five parents and three staff members from Wendell Phillips attended in spring 1997; they will report what they learned to other parents in late April.    Additionally, in spring 1997 Wendell Phillips invited parents to attend two strategy sessions to generate ideas for information and training to improve the school climate.  One session specifically targets parent involvement activities, and participants planned the following parent workshops for the 1997–98 school year:    A Trash Can Learning make-and-take workshop will teach parents to use common household items as educational tools.  Old socks and buttons can be used to make puppets for storytelling, which can improve children's reading comprehension skills.    A Saturday workshop will provide training on how to use computers and how to determine which educational software is appropriate for children at any given age.  Another workshop, entitled Man-to-Man, will focus on involving male authority figures in students' lives.  And because an increasing number of students live with grandparents, Phillips will sponsor a one-day event called With Love to Grandparents, a day when they are invited to visit the classroom and discuss the way things were when they were at school.     Other workshops for parents have included:    improving reading skills through storytelling;   self-esteem training;   how to talk so children will listen and how to listen so children will talk;   strategies to teach children to read;   child behavior and discipline; and   hygiene for children (a seminar for parents and children taught by a nurse and teachers who provide attendees with hygiene kits).     Generally, about 35 to 50 parents attend these workshops, which are held in the morning or evening to accommodate their work schedules.  In addition to workshops, Phillips sometimes offers lengthier parent courses.  For example, during 1995-96 approximately 50 parents from Phillips and other area schools attended a six-week course for parents called Love and Logic, in which a local psychologist taught parenting skills.  And in fall 1997 a parent who is a computer programmer will offer a computing course.      Training parents to participate in decision-making.  Phillips actively involves parents in the planning, implementation, and review of the schoolwide program.  After determining the times when most parents can attend (Saturday, Sunday, and evening meetings are not uncommon), the regular site-based management School Advisory Council (SAC) meetings typically attract 50 to 100 parents each month.  SAC meetings incorporate Title I issues and training, such as an overview and history of the Title I program, a review of program services and eligibility, and discussion of the Phillips schoolwide program plan for the upcoming year.           ""It is crucial that parents are part of planning, even though they are having a hard time understanding that the school wants them to be part of the decision-making process.""    Parent/community liaison, Phillips Magnet    Restructuring Schools to Support Family Involvement    Through the newly adopted Accelerated Schools approach, the schoolwide program, and the site-based management SAC, parents and teachers play new and expanded roles in school restructuring.  They regularly make decisions about curriculum and instruction, parent involvement, and strategies for using resources to maximize student progress.     Parents as partners in schoolwide restructuring.    In the hopes of enriching the learning process for disadvantaged students, Phillips adopted the Accelerated Schools approach in January 1996.  The model, designed by Henry Levin at Stanford University, is guided by three overarching principles: unity of purpose, empowerment, and building on strengths.  Accelerated Schools strive to create a learning environment distinguished by high expectations for students,high status for teachers, and substantial involvement by parents.  The model is based on the premise that a school's fundamental purpose is to ensure that every student achieves at least at grade level by the time he or she leaves the school.    The model calls for each school to tailor other goals by engaging the principal, teachers, students, parents, and interested community members in serious reflection and debate.  By joining not only cadres that are formed to deal with specific problems but also steering committees that oversee all school activities, administrators, teachers, and especially parents play a key role in determining curriculum and instruction.  For example, Phillips parents recently voiced a desire for higher science standards, and asked for a greater emphasis on biology at an earlier age.  In addition, eight parents and faculty members to date have been trained as coaches, who encourage all school staff, including janitors and bus drivers, to participate in determining what goals the school should strive to accomplish.  Coaches also train school staff to evaluate the school program.    Parents and teachers collaborate to plan the schoolwide program, including how to spend the parent involvement program budget (about $2,500).  Last year, approximately 25 parents attended, brainstormed, and voted at each of two meetings of the parent budget planning meetings; they decided to use some of these funds to present the six-week course on Love and Logic.  This year the parent-community liaison hopes they will support the use of a portion of Title I funds for a family night dedicated to improving students' reading skills.    Also, during the 1995-96 school year, parents, teachers, and the principal developed a home-school compact in response to the new Title I requirement.  It consists of three separate pledges that participants sign:    Parents pledge to cooperate with teachers, read and respond to school communications, and provide their children with opportunities for enrichment activities, among other things.  All parents whose children attend Phillips have signed the compact.   Teachers pledge to maintain high expectations, communicate clearly with their students, and provide regular and detailed progress reports.   Students pledge to work hard, attend school regularly, and turn in homework. Students are required to sign the compact, a copy of which is included in their portfolio.     Parents and teachers also collaborate to make decisions through the SAC.  For example, during 1996, parents requested that the SAC address the timing of student report cards.  Many parents said they wanted to know about student progress earlier in order to intervene if necessary. Brainstorming sessions led parents and teachers to agree that a new academic progress form would be sent home every two weeks; the form indicates assignments completed, assignments not completed, and the quality of student work.  This form ensures that parents are kept abreast of their children's academic performance between report cards and thus know what to expect when the cumulative quarterly grades come home.      Building parent involvement around family needs.   The liaison solicits input from parents on school programs through surveys (conducted twice a year) and through the informal polling of parents who attend school functions.  Other informal discussions--held as parents drop off and pick up students in front of the school--also help the liaison learn of parents' needs.  With this information she can determine the demand for services such as transportation and babysitting and tailor workshops and programs to address parents' concerns.     New uses of school space.   Wendell Phillips operates a parent resource area located in the administration office, where parents can check out educational kits and videos, how-to materials, books, tapes, and more to give them the skills and resources to help their children with both schoolwork and homework.  For example, parents can check out videos and tapes on topics such as phonics and parenting skills as well as reading, math, and writing textbooks.  The area is open all day, and an average of 10 to 15 parents visit daily.  Further, parents can use the school's computer lab (when students are not using it) for their own personal use or to help their children with homework or schoolwork.     Encouraging parental participation; the Wendell Phillips 3000 Gold Club.   The school offers incentives to encourage parents to participate in school events, such as tutoring or serving as chaperons for field trips.  Parents earn points for attending school programs and SAC or committee meetings, accompanying classes on field trips, tutoring children at school, and supervising class parties.  They can also earn points for completing home learning activities, such as reading with their child, taking them to the library, or helping teachers with forms for progress reports or census cards.  The school honors parents who earn points at an awards banquet/ceremony held in June, and parents earn prizes donated by local businesses.      Evidence of Success    The principal and liaison report that parent involvement activities, both academically oriented events and those involving parents in school decision-making, are well attended.  For example:     One hundred fifty parents attended parent-teacher conferences during the 1995-96 school year; because many parents have more than one child enrolled at the school, this represents a high proportion of the school's parents.   One hundred fifty parents attended a back-to-school-Title I conference held in August 1996.   SAC meetings draw 12 to 70 parents, averaging about 30.   Workshops regularly draw 25 to 70 participants.     In addition, the liaison reports that, as a result of her efforts and those of the principal and a core of involved parents, parents at the school have become increasingly aware of the schoolwide program requirements, including the expectation that they will take an active part in their children's education.  In support of this, a parent commented about the September orientation meeting, ""It's so good to start a year when you feel like everyone is working together!""     -###-   [Parent Resource Center]          [Roosevelt High School   (The Alliance Schools Initiative)]"
GX252-23-3143549	"Texas School Performance Review        Austin Independent School District   April 2000                  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY               Exhibit 2 (Summary of Cost Savings by Recommendation)             In July 1999, Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts Carole Keeton Rylander announced her intention to have her nationally recognized Texas School Performance Review (TSPR) team conduct a management and performance review of the Austin Independent School District (AISD). Comptroller Rylander is an AISD graduate, former AISD teacher, former AISD school board president, mother of AISD graduates, and her first granddaughter will enter AISD kindergarten this fall. The Comptroller was motivated by reports that AISD officials had manipulated student dropout data and the results of the state-mandated student achievement test, the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS); by AISD's lagging student performance; and by its escalating property tax rate.   After six months of work, this report suggests concrete ways to improve the district's operational efficiency, while identifying exemplary district programs. TSPR offers 163 detailed recommendations that could save AISD more than $70 million over the next five years, and proposes nearly $13 million in reinvestments to improve the district's educational services and other operations. Net savings are estimated at more than $57 million.   Improving the Texas School Performance Review    Soon after taking office in January 1999, Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander consulted school district officials, parents, and teachers from across Texas and carefully examined past reviews and progress reports in an effort to make the Texas School Performance Review more valuable to the state's school districts. With the perspective of a former teacher and school board president, the Comptroller has vowed to use TSPR to increase the accountability of local school districts toward the communities they serve.   Recognizing that statewide only 51 cents of every education dollar is spent on instruction, Comptroller Rylander's approach is designed to give local school officials in Austin and in other Texas communities the ability to move more of every education dollar directly into the classroom. Comptroller Rylander also has ordered best practices and exemplary programs to be shared quickly and systematically among all the state's school districts and with anyone else who requests such information. Comptroller Rylander has directed TSPR to serve as a clearinghouse of the best ideas in Texas public education.   Under Comptroller Rylander's approach, consultants and the TSPR team will work with districts to:      ensure students and teachers receive the support and resources necessary to succeed;   identify innovative ways to address the district's core management challenges;   ensure administrative duties are performed efficiently, without duplication, and in a way that fosters education;   develop strategies to ensure that the district's processes and programs are continuously assessed and improved;   challenge any process, procedure, program, or policy that impedes instruction and recommend ways to reduce or eliminate obstacles; and   put goods and services to the ""Yellow Pages test--government should do no job if a business in the Yellow Pages can do that job better and at a lower cost.    Finally, Comptroller Rylander has opened her door to Texans who share her optimism about the potential for public education. Suggestions to improve Texas schools or the school reviews are welcome at any time. The Comptroller believes that public schools deserve all the attention and assistance they can get.

AISD in Profile    Unlike many urban school districts, AISD generally has enjoyed widespread community support. But in recent years, this support has eroded under the strain of one management failure after another.   AISD is Texas' fourth-largest school district, with more than 78,000 students. But from the 1995-96 school year through 1999-2000, student enrollment grew at an average annual rate of slightly more than 1 percent-at a time when the city's population and enrollment in surrounding school districts boomed.   Some 49 percent of AISD students are economically disadvantaged, about on par with the state average. At the same time, with a property tax wealth per student estimated to exceed $301,000, AISD is one of the state's 88 ""property-wealthy"" districts and, in 2000-01, will become subject to provisions of the Texas Education Code, requiring it to share its property wealth with the state's poorer districts. Although AISD is among the wealthiest of the state's school districts, the district spends only 48 cents of every education dollar on instruction.   AISD's 1999-2000 budget is more than $579 million. More than 80 percent of its revenues come from local property taxes. From 1996-97 to 1999-2000, AISD's budgeted expenditures rose by an average of $39 million a year. AISD's 1999-2000 tax rate is $1.54 per $100 of property valuation, 12 cents higher than in the previous year. The rate hike is expected to generate an estimated $34 million per year in additional revenue.   In 1999-2000, the district had more than 9,600 full-time employees, making it one of the largest employers in the greater Austin area. More than 5,000 of these employees are teachers. The student body is 44 percent Hispanic, 36 percent Anglo, 17 percent African-American, and 3 percent ""other."" The teaching staff is 70 percent Anglo, 21 percent Hispanic, 8 percent African-American, and 1 percent ""other."" The district has more than 100 campuses, including 11 high schools.       TSPR in AISD    Typically, the Comptroller's review team goes to a school district in response to a local call for assistance. The AISD study, however, is the second school review that Comptroller Rylander has ordered under her statutory authority and under criteria she established for selecting school districts for reviews. Under these criteria, the Comptroller gives priority to districts that are judged poor performing academically or financially and to hands-on reviews that will benefit the greatest number of students.  These are the school districts and children that need help the most .   In the 1990s, AISD had  six  superintendents, a recipe for instability. Before the start of the 1999-2000 school year, the AISD Board of Trustees hired Dr. Pascal D. Forgione, Jr. as the district's new superintendent. Dr. Forgione is a former U.S. Commissioner of Education Statistics, with experience in educational administration at both the state and federal levels. He won early, enthusiastic praise in Austin for his blunt assessment of AISD's chronic managerial problems. With board approval, he reorganized AISD's executive cabinet and put a new management team into place.   Under a previous Comptroller, TSPR reviewed AISD in 1993. That report contained 174 recommendations with projected five-year savings of $9.3 million. Following its release, AISD's administration initially rejected the recommendations outright. Subsequent work by the board resulted in the district accepting 88 percent of the recommendations, but the district reported savings of only $1.8 million.   Comptroller Rylander began this second review of AISD in October 1999, just after Dr. Forgione assumed leadership of the district. The new superintendent inherited an educational system that lacked accountability at all levels. In recent years AISD's board--and parents, taxpayers, and community members--faced repeated setbacks in student performance, data integrity, and financial management.   AISD's student performance falls below state and regional averages. The district's overall 1998-99 TAAS passing rate of 68 percent (most recent data available) trailed behind both the statewide average of 78 percent and the Central Texas regional average of nearly 79 percent. Under the state's school accountability system, the Texas Education Agency (TEA) assigns annual ratings to each district and campus based upon its TAAS student passing rate, student attendance and dropout rates, and data quality, as measured by information reported to the state.   In 1998-99, AISD had 16 schools rated by TEA as ""low-performing,"" up from four in 1997-98. The 1998-99 results gave AISD the highest percentage of low-performing schools in the state. Two are alternate schools. Of the remaining 14 low-performing schools, 13 have a majority of minority students. Six of the district's 10 regular high schools were rated as low-performing for high dropout rates or poor TAAS scores. Five AISD schools have been rated as low-performing for three of the last five years. When a school is in trouble and does not improve, children are trapped. On the other hand, AISD also has had some remarkable successes, with nine schools rated as exemplary and seven as recognized schools for about 17 percent of its campuses.   AISD's reporting of dropout students is another agonizing challenge for the district. TEA created a new category, ""Unacceptable: Data Quality,"" for AISD and three other Texas districts whose dropout data was judged to be so severely flawed that the state could not be confident of its accuracy or completeness. In February 2000, TEA revised AISD's ratings for the 1997-98 school year (most recent data available), bringing the district's overall dropout rate to 8.5 percent, more than  four times  the rate AISD originally reported.   In April 1999, a Travis County grand jury indicted the AISD Board of Trustees on criminal charges of tampering with 1998 state--reported TAAS data. The board later reached a settlement with the county attorney and pledged to create dropout prevention strategies and better controls on its data reporting system. AISD officials acknowledge that its methods for data gathering and reporting--including student enrollment and dropout information required by the state--have been flawed and unreliable for years. AISD blames its data integrity problems on outdated information systems. An AISD-funded assessment of its information technology, however, found that human error has been a significant factor in its data integrity problems--one previously unrecognized and unacknowledged by the district.   For years, AISD has had inefficient, obsolete, or cumbersome systems for personnel, business and technological functions. Some remain manual and paper-driven. From 1997 through 1999, AISD was unable to produce accurate, timely student report cards, progress reports or transcripts. While, as already noted, AISD cites outdated technology as the cause of its data integrity problems, it has taken no significant action to upgrade its information technology. In 2000, AISD began a new initiative to replace its current business and student information systems.   AISD's financial oversight and accounting practices are unsound at best. The district's finance personnel are located on school campuses and in various departments, including Food Services, Athletics, and Community Education. These separate functions have little direct interaction with the central finance department. AISD's new chief financial officer is attempting to consolidate the district's fragmented financial services, an encouraging first step.   The district's employee policies and performance expectations are not clearly defined and documented, making performance appraisals ineffective. Some campus administrators have been repeatedly moved from one position or school to another, without meaningful job appraisals or counseling.   Another persistent challenge is AISD's inefficient use of school facilities. On many elementary campuses, enrollment growth is high and classrooms are crowded. Elsewhere in AISD, facilities at several middle and high schools are significantly underused--a fact TSPR had noted in its 1993 performance review. In 1996, Austin voters approved a $369 million bond package to finance one of the state's largest school construction and renovation projects. Cost overruns and additional scope later added $54.9 million to the program, and total costs are currently estimated at $424 million. With funding from the 1996 bond issue, AISD opened three elementaries and one middle school in 1999 and a middle school in January 2000. A high school and two more elementary schools are set to open later in 2000 and one more elementary school opens in 2001.   In summary, AISD has a new leadership team that is not tied to previous administrations and business-as-usual practices. By selecting this team, the AISD board has set a promising new course for the district. AISD now must seize the opportunity to regain the community's confidence. To do this, the superintendent must demonstrate that AISD is accountable, committed to improving low-performing schools, ready to meet the needs of at-risk students, and serious about redirecting dollars back into the classroom.       Listening to the AISD Community    Deloitte & Touche was selected to assist the Comptroller with this review. The TSPR team interviewed district employees, school board members, students, parents, business leaders, and community members. TSPR also held informal public forums over two nights at 10 district high schools. Participants were invited to submit written observations on major topics of concern or to be interviewed by a member of the TSPR review team. The team also collected comments from letters to the Comptroller and calls to the Comptroller's toll-free hotline. TSPR also sent written surveys to a random sample of district administrators and support staff, principals, teachers, and students.   To gain additional insight into community concerns and perceptions, TSPR held 12 focus groups with AISD stakeholders, including the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce; the Austin Area Research Organization; the League of United Latin-American Citizens; Austin Latino Alliance; the Austin Council of Parent-Teacher Associations; the Community Education Consortium; representatives of the Hispanic and African-American communities; Spanish-speaking parents; and AISD principals, assistant principals, teachers, and bilingual teachers. Community members and AISD staff who participated in focus groups gave oral and written comments about 12 functional areas under review in this report.   TSPR also conducted 650 telephone interviews with adults in a random sample of households in AISD's service area. Details from TSPR's surveys and public forums appear in  Appendices A  through  H . It should be noted that comments received by TSPR illustrate community and AISD school staff perceptions and do not necessarily reflect the findings or opinions of the Comptroller or TSPR.   TSPR also consulted two databases of comparative educational information maintained by TEA--the Academic Excellence Indicator System and the Public Education Information Management System. Finally, TSPR asked AISD to select ""peer"" school districts with similar characteristics for comparative purposes. AISD chose Alief, Corpus Christi, Fort Worth, Northside (Bexar County), and Pasadena Independent School Districts as peers. TSPR also compared AISD to district averages in TEA's Region 13 Education Service Center, to which AISD belongs, and to state averages.         Acknowledgments    The Comptroller and Deloitte & Touche wish to express their appreciation to the AISD Board of Trustees, Superintendent Forgione, and the many district employees, students, and community residents who helped during the review. Special thanks are due to Drs. David C. Duty and Lynda L. Haynes, who acted as AISD's liaisons with TSPR. Drs. Duty and Haynes worked tirelessly and cheerfully to accommodate the review team's requests for staff interviews, campus visits, and information. They also devised an innovative method to facilitate TSPR's findings meeting with the district--no small feat for a district of AISD's size and complexity.       Exemplary Programs and Practices    AISD is a school district with some notable successes, and TSPR has identified numerous ""best practices."" Through commendations in each chapter, this report highlights model programs, operations, and services provided by AISD administrators, teachers, and staff members. Other school districts throughout Texas are encouraged to examine these exemplary programs and services to see if they could be adapted to meet local needs. TSPR's commendations include the following:      Superintendent's Performance Contract : The AISD board has hired a new superintendent using a contract including job-specific goals that will aid trustees in objectively measuring performance.   Magnet Program : Through three magnet schools, AISD has done an outstanding job providing opportunities for students to explore advanced, challenging curricula in science, mathematics and liberal arts. At LBJ High School, the class of 1999 (120 students) included 14 National Merit Scholars, 17 National Merit semifinalists, 17 National Merit Commended Scholars, two National Achievement Scholarships for Outstanding Negro Students and five National Hispanic Scholarships. At Kealing Junior High, about 60 students received state recognition for academic achievement in the Duke University Talent Search.   Account for Learning : AISD has developed a locally funded initiative, Account for Learning, to assist campuses with a high percentage of economically disadvantaged students in improving their reading and mathematics performance.   School to Career : AISD offers a School-to-Career program that moves students into career preparation while allowing them flexibility for movement from one pathway to another as their interests and skills evolve.   Student Health Care : Through partnerships with Travis County, the City of Austin, and the Children's Hospital of Austin, AISD provides high-quality health care services to its students.   Austin Partners in Education:  This nationally recognized program involves businesses and community organizations in enriching all AISD schools through volunteer services, in-kind contributions, and financial support.   Community Education : Over its 25-year history, AISD's Community Education program has worked effectively with local organizations to provide tutorial and after-school services for more than one million area children and their families. The program has received national recognition.   Qualified Substitutes : AISD's automated substitute teacher calling system has proven effective in ensuring the availability of qualified substitute teachers.   Building Prototypes : AISD uses building prototype designs to ensure quality and control school construction costs. In 1996, AISD developed building prototypes for elementary, middle, junior-high, and high schools with specific interior and exterior features. The district uses these prototypes in all new construction and renovation.   Insurance : AISD adopted a novel insurance initiative known as the Rolling Owner Control Insurance Program (ROCIP) as part of its 1996 bond construction program. ROCIP has achieved estimated savings of $3.6 million and has expanded the participation of smaller local contractors in the district's bond construction program.   Bonds : AISD saved $4.8 million after refunding its Series 1996 bonds and has effectively managed its debt since the 1996 bond election.   Telecommunications : The Greater Austin Area Telecommunications Network is a state-of-the-art wide area network capable of delivering virtually unlimited volumes of data directly to any computer system anywhere in the district.   School Resource Officers : AISD's school resource officers are the focal point of the district's safety and security efforts. They work harmoniously with schools and provide an important asset to the AISD community.   Absent Student Assistance Project  (ASAP): ASAP, a community-based collaborative effort involving the Austin and Del Valle school districts and the Travis County constables, improves school attendance by providing timely responses to student absenteeism.   Campus Crime Stoppers : A collaborative community effort between AISD and the Travis County sheriff's office, Campus Crime Stoppers provides a ""hot-line"" and rewards for students who report weapons and possible criminal activity in and around schools.          Key Recommendations and Findings    District Organization and Management       Board Election Sequence : The trustee structure and election sequence of the district's board do not contribute to stable governance, as two-thirds of the AISD board can be up for election at one time. By board resolution, AISD can restructure its trustee elections to change the number of positions up for election to an alternating four- and five-member sequence every two years. The new structure would improve continuity in the board's decision-making process.   Central Administration:  AISD's central administrative budget has grown by 22 percent since 1996-97 while student enrollment grew by only 4.6 percent. By initiating a reduction in force of 15 percent to bring down the number of administrative positions specifically assigned to work in the central office, the district can redirect resources into direct classroom instruction. A 15 percent reduction in force of central administration would result in five-year savings of more than $18 million.   Central Office:   The layout of AISD's central offices on West 6th Street is not functional and parking is limited. The boardroom's location and design do not promote public participation or facilitate trustee communication. By moving the district's entire central administration to the campus of Reagan High School, AISD could make more efficient use of an existing facility and bring administrators back to a school environment. As an added benefit, AISD can net nearly $12 million from the sale.   Legal Costs:  Compared to other districts of similar size and complexity, AISD's legal expenses are excessive. The district outsources all of its legal services and spent more than $4 million on legal fees from 1996-97 through 1998-99. A small in-house legal staff could manage routine legal services and assist with litigation. Moreover, AISD's board should adopt a policy to control costs while outlining a framework for the use of legal counsel.        Educational Service Delivery       Chronically Low-Performing Schools:  AISD has an unacceptably high number of campuses consistently rated low-performing by TEA. When a school fails repeatedly, new and decisive measures should be implemented. One such measure is reconstitution, a step that brings a new faculty and staff to the campus. By developing a formal district policy to allow for the reconstitution of chronically low-performing campuses, AISD could begin to free children from a school's cycle of failure.   Magnet Programs:  AISD's magnet school program is challenging and exemplary, and many parents have urged the district to expand the program to other curricula. By relocating the Science Academy at LBJ High School and the Liberal Arts Academy at Johnston to the Reagan campus and adding a high-tech component, AISD could create a regional magnet program open to transfer students from surrounding districts, giving more qualified students an opportunity to succeed. Moreover, the district's magnet middle school at Kealing serves only 7th and 8th grade students, and prospective students completing elementary school must attend 6th grade at another campus. Expanding the magnet program at Kealing to include a 6th grade would allow the district to better meet the needs of its middle school magnet students.    Special Education:  Although AISD reports high expenditures for special education and low student-to-teacher ratios, a number of serious concerns have been voiced by parents and teachers. AISD can improve its special education services and bring accountability to its program by creating prereferral intervention teams, creating an accountability system to track successful changes to the regular education curriculum, and improving data reporting to appropriately allocate teachers throughout the district.      Facilities Use and Management       Facility Management:  Facilities at three AISD high schools are significantly underused, as are the district's middle schools as a group. In contrast, many elementary campuses are crowded and require portables to sustain their current enrollment. By using a balanced combination of facility closings, shifts of grade levels to underused facilities, and attendance zone changes, the district can make better use of its resources.   Portable Buildings:  AISD has the highest number of portable buildings per student among its peer districts and continues to acquire more, while many permanent facilities are not used to capacity. Each year, AISD spends in excess of $1 million on new portable buildings, which are more expensive to maintain than permanent facilities. By adopting a policy to control portable purchases and relocations, AISD could manage its portable space more effectively and reduce the number of portables in use, with accompanying savings in maintenance and custodial costs. By better use of existing underused space in brick and mortar buildings, new purchases could be curtailed and surplus portable buildings could then be sold. Five-year savings are projected at more than $16 million.   Facilities Master Plan:  Although AISD is implementing a $424 million bond program, it lacks a comprehensive facilities master plan. For any future bond programs, such a plan would allow the district to identify the current and future needs of its educational programs, the condition of existing schools, student and community growth, and capital requirements.   Custodial Shifts and Staffing:  AISD has not standardized its custodial shifts and responsibilities. Although the district central office makes recommendations to improve the quality and efficiency of custodial services, school principals, who manage custodians on campuses, are not obligated to follow them. A consistent approach to maximizing the efficiency of AISD's custodial services, including the elimination of some custodial positions, would yield savings of more than $1.8 million over five years.      Financial Management       Cash Reserves:  AISD is not maintaining an optimum fund balance, and the board is not clearly informed of the impact of budget amendments on the district's total reserves. By amending board policy to require a fiscal impact statement showing the impact on the optimum fund balance, the board will be able to make more fiscally appropriate decisions.   Financial Accountability and Continuity:  The district recently hired an experienced and respected school financial administrator to serve as chief financial officer (CFO). Until this action, AISD's financial functions were in disarray, with staff located in a number of departments, resulting in uncoordinated procedures and controls. By forecasting and tracking AISD's financial condition, the new CFO can ensure accountability for the district's half-billion dollar budget.   Payroll Functions : AISD's payroll operation is manual and paper-intensive. As a substitute for an efficient, fully automated payroll system, AISD maintains a separate, color-coded index card file for each employee in the district. By outsourcing payroll data collection, processing, check printing, and direct deposit functions to an external vendor, AISD can improve services and streamline operations.   Internal Audit:  AISD's internal audit function chiefly audits student activity funds instead of district operations, and audit activities receive little attention from board members. The district would benefit from a balanced audit approach that involves an annual audit planning process and a formal risk assessment of AISD operations, programs, and controls. To ensure an independent reporting relationship, trustees should create an audit committee of the board that would hear audit findings directly and oversee Internal Audit activities.      Personnel       Personnel Policies:  AISD's personnel policies are outdated. A comprehensive overhaul of personnel policies can ensure that the district complies with recent changes in the Texas Education Code and reduce the district's exposure to risk and litigation.   Employee Performance Evaluations:  State law requires each school district to evaluate each administrator annually, yet AISD has no formal policy holding supervisors accountable for completing these evaluations. An important first step is an automated system to track the timely completion of employee performance appraisals.    Poor-Performing Employees:  AISD reassigns some principals and campus administrators to various positions each school year with little documentation to explain the reason for such reassignments. By clarifying its policy on involuntary reassignments, the district can ensure that administrators address employee performance problems through counseling, development plans, or progressive discipline.   Employee Contracts:  AISD issues employment contracts to a wide array of employees. The district should provide only those employment contracts required by law for positions that require certification. By limiting employment contracts to certified personnel, the district would lessen its exposure to the risk and expense of litigation. In addition, this recommendation would reduce the time spent administering contracts.      Asset and Risk Management       Employee Health Care Services:  AISD has no strategy for reducing or controlling its employee health-care costs at a time when group health care costs are rising across the nation. The expertise of its benefits consultant could help the district oversee the legal, pricing, and quality issues associated with group health plans.   Fixed Assets:  In 1999, 28 district VCRs and a violin were discovered in a local pawnshop, yet none of the equipment had been reported stolen. As early as 1990, internal and external auditors raised concerns about AISD's fixed-asset control weaknesses. A thorough fixed asset system would ensure accountability for district assets, provide accurate values for assets for internal and external reporting purposes, and protect the district against theft, deterioration, or other losses.      Purchasing and Warehouse Services       Textbooks : From 1996-97 through 1998-99, AISD repaid the state $576,000 for lost textbooks, and students in some classes began the 1999-2000 school year without books. By requiring principals to document and control textbook inventories in their schools, the district could reduce lost textbook charges and ensure an adequate supply of textbooks for all students.      Computers and Technology       Technology Planning:  AISD has repeatedly attempted to acquire new technologies, but the board has not acted on long-range technology solutions. The district has earmarked a $16.7 million annual tax increase to fix its business and student information systems, and the board must take steps to ensure that this money is spent only to replace and overhaul technology. By committing to a viable technology plan that identifies necessary changes in information systems over the next five years, the district could make significant progress.   AISD also should reorganize its technology services to provide better service to customers and support a new technology infrastructure. This reorganization would allow AISD to hire knowledgeable staff to support its new systems.       Transportation       Student Transportation:  AISD experiences some benefits from privatization in the form of savings realized from its outsourcing of transportation for magnet program students. By developing a request for proposals, the district could attract competitive bids that will enable the district to decide if outsourcing would deliver better transportation service and result in savings.   Staggered Bell Schedule:  AISD has adopted a staggered bell schedule for its school start and end times, but not all campuses follow it. Staggered bell times allows a district to use its buses more efficiently, with each vehicle servicing an elementary, middle, and high school. Failure to comply with the schedule forces the district to run more buses than necessary. Five-year savings are estimated at nearly $2.3 million.   Student Census Data:  AISD does not currently have accurate and timely student census data. With student census and demographic information, AISD can create more efficient routes, increasing the ratio of riders to miles and the district's state transportation reimbursement. Better routing should result in a five-year savings of nearly $1.2 million.        Food Services       Food Service Deficit:  AISD has not addressed and remedied key operational deficiencies in food services that have contributed to substantial financial losses since 1997-98. A series of extensive corrective measures are detailed for making the district's operation more effective and efficient. A regular evaluation of the desirability of outsourcing food services could also be a useful tool in ensuring that students receive the highest-quality meals at the lowest cost.        Safety and Security       Crime Incident Data:  AISD has not updated its district and campus improvement plans to meet new state requirements for disclosure of statistics on the number, rate, and type of violent or criminal incidents occurring on each district campus. State law also requires campus improvement plans to contain goals and methods for crime prevention and intervention. By sharing such information with the AISD community, AISD can enhance its commitment to a safe and secure learning environment for all students.           Savings and Investment Requirements    Many of TSPR's recommendations would result in savings and increased revenue that could be used to improve classroom instruction. The savings opportunities identified in this report are conservative and should be considered minimums. Proposed investments of additional funds usually are related to savings or the enhancement of productivity and effectiveness.   Summary of Net Savings    Full implementation of the recommendations in this report could produce net savings of nearly $6 million in the first year  (Exhibit 1) . AISD could achieve total net savings of more than $57 million by 2004-05 if all of TSPR's recommendations are implemented.

The page number for each recommendation is listed in the summary chart for reference purposes. Detailed implementation strategies, timelines, and estimates of fiscal impacts follow each recommendation in this report. The implementation section associated with each recommendation highlights the actions needed to achieve the proposed results. Some items should be implemented immediately, some over the next year or two, and some over several years. Many TSPR recommendations would not have a direct financial impact but nonetheless would improve the district's operations.   TSPR recommends that the AISD board ask district administrators to review the recommendations, develop an implementation plan, and monitor its progress. As always, TSPR staff members are available to help implement these proposals.

The report documented key findings from 22 Congressional hearings featuring 237 witnesses who testified about what works in education. Four themes emerged:  rental empowerment and involvement; pa  al control; loc  ollars to the classroom; and d  focus on basic academics. a  Since publishing the Crossroads report, the Subcommittee has continued to hold hearings in Washington, D.C. and around the country to hear about what is working in education and what needs to change. The Subcommittee has also worked to ensure that the U.S. Department of Education does not waste tax dollars through its financial mismanagement, wasteful spending or fraudulent practices. Additionally, studies and reports released since the publication of Crossroads underscore the need for all levels of government to narrow achievement gaps so that no child is left behind. This report seeks to build on the Subcommittee's findings by compiling information gathered from hearings and oversight activities held in 1999 and 2000. Its primary focus concerns the underlying policies behind success in education at all levels of government: policies that put student performance first. Still, the goal of the Crossroads project remains the same: to make a case for change in federal education programs, and in the Department of Education  a change that will improve the quality of education for all children in America.  iii  Crossroads 2000   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY THE ROAD TO EXCELLENCE In Education at a Crossroads: What Works and What's Wasted in Education Today, the Subcommittee reported that America's education system is at the intersection of two paths: one leading to excellence, the other to mediocrity. Through hearings and extensive research, the Subcommittee examined the characteristics of schools and districts that lead down the road to excellence as well as down the road to mediocrity - what is wasted in education. During the 106th Congress, the Subcommittee has continued to look beyond the crossroads toward states, districts, and schools that have emerged as shining examples of excellence over the last two decades. How have they achieved excellence? By implementing policies that put student performance first.  We're Not There Yet: The Stagnant Nineties End Decades of Growth For the first time since the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) began measuring academic achievement 30 years ago, an entire decade has passed without significant and substantial achievement gains. Since the release of the previous Crossroads report, student achievement data has been released that gives us a complete picture of achievement over the last decade. The data shows that apart from some very small gains in math scores, achievement has leveled off in most grades and subject areas. This is after gains made during the 1970s and 80s. More troubling is that achievement gaps have not narrowed, despite intensive federal efforts to target funds to disadvantaged students. For example:  In 1998, NAEP reading scores for 4 1992 levels.1 th  and 12th graders failed to improve over their   Long-term trend NAEP scores for 1999 report only small, but statistically significant, gains in math scores for students aged 9 and 13.2  58 percent of disadvantaged children in 4th grade scored at the ""below basic"" level on the 1998 National NAEP Reading exam.3 National Center for Education Statistics, NAEP 1998 Reading Report Card for the Nation and the States, U.S. Department of Education, (Washington, D.C., March 1999), p. 17. 2 National Center for Education Statistics, NAEP 1999 Trends in Academic Progress, U.S. Department of Education, (Washington, D.C., August 2000), p. xi. 3 Ibid, p. 81. 1  Crossroads 2000 iv    American 12th graders outperformed only two out of 21 nations in mathematics (Cyprus and South Africa);4 Not one country scored below the United States on the assessment of advanced mathematics. In Physics, 12th grade scores were also at the bottom.  Inequitable Achievement Gains Unlike the 1970s and achievement gaps. For the widening, and the gains made about every age group and sub 1980s, the 1990s have witnessed little or no reduction in last 12 years, most achievement gaps have actually been during the 70s and 80s are beginning to evaporate. In just ject the gaps have grown since 1986. year-old students have in reading narrowed to points in 1999. For 171988 - 20 points  and   Achievement gaps between White and African American 9not narrowed since 1975. The thirteen-year-old score gap its lowest -18 points - in 1988, and have since widened to 29 year-old students, the gap in reading was also its lowest in has since widened to 31 points in 1999.5   Over the past decade, the disparity between African American and White SAT scores increased by 3 points on the verbal section and 8 points on the math portion.6  Frustration With the Status Quo According to Public Agenda, ""the prevailing view is that public education as a whole is in bad shape and renewed efforts are needed to fix it."" For example,  52 percent think local private schools do a better job of educating students  only 19 percent think public schools are better.7  4  The Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) represents the most extensive investigation of mathematics and science education ever conducted. The study is sponsored by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement, and is funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Center for Education Statistics. 5 National Center for Education Statistics, Trends in Academic Performance: Three Decades of Student Performance, U.S. Department of Education, (Washington, D.C., August 2000), p.37. 6 David Hoff, ""Gap Widens Between Black and White Students on NAEP,"" Education Week, September 6, 2000. 7 On Thin Ice, Public Agenda Online, www.publicagenda.org/specials/vouchers/voucherfindings6.htm.  Crossroads 2000 v    A 1999 Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies poll found that while 59 percent consider their local public schools to be excellent or good, only 39.7 percent of African-Americans rated their local schools that highly.8  58 percent of employers surveyed say that graduates coming from public schools lack the skills needed to succeed in the work world.9 In summary, while student performance has been the focus of recent education rhetoric, it has not been the focus in practice. Consequently, student achievement in America is not where it should be, and most Americans are not satisfied by the status quo. How did we arrive at this point?  The Current Federal Role Does Not Reward Results  ""...We must fundamentally change the way the federal government treats public schools. If we continue down the current road - where responsibility, authority, and accountability for American education flow not toward but away from parents, especially poor parents - then we will continue to see what we are seeing: too much low performance, too many bad schools, too many wasted lives."" 10  former Secretary of Education William Bennett Stagnant achievement and widening gaps are consequences of failing to put student performance first and to reward results. Instead of deciding what excellence in education should look like and putting together a plan that ensures students get there, education policymakers too often put first the primary need of the education ""system""  compliance with its rules and requirements. As Time Magazine reported earlier this year, over the last eight years, ""the Education Department has done little to reward schools that flourish and nothing to sanction schools that persistently fail.""11 Since 1965, when Washington embarked on its first major elementary-secondary education initiative, federal policy has strongly influenced America's schools. Although education is generally considered a state and local responsibility, over the years Congress has created hundreds of programs intended to address problems in education. Creating a ""program for every problem,"" as the Crossroads report found, begins to add up, so much so David A. Bositis, ""1999 National Opinion Poll, Education,"" Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, 1999. 9 Clarifying Issues 2000, ""Education"", Public Agenda, www.PublicAgenda.org. 10 Testimony of Dr. William Bennett, Field Hearing on ""Chicago Education Reforms and the Importance of Flexibility in Federal Education Programs"", Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Chicago, Illinois, April 19, 1999. 11 Eric Pooley, ""Who Gets the `A' in Education,"" Time, March 27, 2000. 8  Crossroads 2000 vi   that there are now more than 760 ""education"" and ""education-related"" programs spread across 39 federal agencies at a cost of $120 billion a year. The shape of new education programs is often determined by political polls and focus groups, rather than the actual needs of students and teachers.12 These program dollars come with significant strings attached. While federal dollars make up only about seven percent of America's total budget for K-12 education, the Subcommittee as well as other researchers have documented that Washington's role is significant when it comes to setting state and local priorities, and in determining the tenor and content of the national conversation about education.13 Without asking whether or not programs produce results, or knowing their impact on local needs, Washington each year funds an increasing number of education programs instead of focusing additional funds on proven programs. According to the Congressional Research Service, the number of Congressionally-funded programs at the Department of Education has steadily increased for the last four fiscal years.  ""In medieval times, people were sometimes pressed to death by having heavy stones piled upon their bodies until all breath and life was squeezed from them. The current U.S. Congress made a valiant attempt to lift some of those stones from the body of state and local folks. Certain very worthwhile successes were achieved but all too many stones remain. We still await the day when ESEA can truly be redesigned to fulfill the dreams we had for it in 1965...""14--Colorado Commissioner of Education The cr districts and attempting to waste federal funds to also invest in what eation of new and unproven programs increases the federal burden on States, which must adjust their priorities to match federal priorities in receive more federal dollars. Thus, ineffective new programs may not only dollars, since they can produce a ripple effect, causing district and state be spent inefficiently. It is essential, then, that the federal role be to works and to reward success.  Mark Pitsch, ""Clinton Casts Education in Starring Role,"" Education Week, October 23, 1996.

The priorities of researchers have been placed ahead of students, and as a result, education research has been impoverished. The current federal role in education research is to fund a confusing array of research centers, labs, technical assistance centers and other entities located around the country.  Federal research and evaluation is inadequate: According to the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), ""information about the federal education effort is needed by many different decision makers....much of that information, however, is not currently available.."" This is because ""few evaluations of successful strategies exist, and many of the existing evaluations lack the methodological rigor needed to determine effectiveness."" 15  The research community fails to deliver: According to the National Research Council, ""social science research currently provides few definitive answers about how to improve educational outcomes for [disadvantaged] children.""16 A RAND Education study found that ""the research and development community in education has been unable to provide consensus results or pilot tested policies and practices that could guide policy makers and educators to more effective practices.""17  So many studies, so little knowledge: Congress established the National Reading Panel to evaluate existing research on the most effective approaches for teaching children to read. The panel examined thousands of studies on reading instruction some conducted as far back as 1966. After an exhaustive review, the panel concluded that less than one third of the studies met their standards for academic and scientific rigor.18  U.S. General Accounting Office, Federal Education Funding: Multiple Programs and Lack of Data Raise Efficiency and Effectiveness Concerns, Statement of Carlotta Joyner before the Senate Education Task Force, GAO/T-HEHS-98-46, November 6, 1997, p. 12-13. 16 National Research Council, Making Money Matter: Financing America's Schools, National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., September 1999, p. 268. 17 David Grissmer, Ann Flanagan, Jennifer Kawata, Stephanie Williamson, Improving Student Achievement: What State NAEP Scores Tell Us, (RAND: Santa Monica, California, July 2000), p. xxxvi. 18 Testimony of Dr. Reid Lyon, Chief, Child Development and Behavior Branch, National Institutes of Health, Hearing on ""Options for the Future of the Office of Education Research and Improvement,"" Subcommittee on Early Childhood Youth and Families, Committee on Education and the Workforce, May 4, 2000.  15  Crossroads 2000 viii   Because so little is known about what programs work, it is all the more important for policymakers to grant flexibility at the state and local level, where schools and teachers know the unique needs of their students and how to help them succeed. Similarly, the federal government should not waste resources on unproven new programs whose methods are not backed by solid scientific research. The road to excellence cannot be traveled unless there is good information to provide signposts along the way. The Federal Role Takes its Toll The cumulative effect of hundreds of federally designed programs and requirements, many of which are not all grounded in credible research, continues to take its toll at the state and local level. After the first Crossroads report, the Subcommittee heard witnesses testify at hearings nationwide that many well-intentioned federal programs provide funding with burdensome requirements that have nothing to do with producing results. Others testified about the burden of the special education mandate and the significant resources it requires of districts.  Regulations: A Superintendent described his experience with federal programs: ""My staff and myself spent over 600 hours trying to decipher [federal special education requirements], so it may be something that you want to consider in the future once you pass something. Six hundred hours is a lot of hours. ...Every law that's passed has a tremendous impact on us as far as staff.""19  Accounting requirements: Another superintendent described her experience with a particular federal requirement: ""...the district currently spends a minimum of three man-days per month creating the documentation of use of federal funds as a supplement to district funds, rather than supplanting.""20  Unfunded Mandates: Many people working at the local level have concerns about special education funding. For example, one state representative told the Subcommittee ""one of the most positive things Congress could do is to fund the federal special education mandates, before you consider any new programs. You would all be heroes in your home states for doing so!""21  Testimony of John DeLine, Superintendent of Tekonsha Community Schools, Hearing on ""Improving Student Achievement and Reforming the Federal Role in Education,"" Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Battle Creek, Michigan, September 8, 1999. 20 Testimony of Susan Sclafani, Houston Independent School District, House Budget Committee's Education Task Force, June 14, 2000. 21 Testimony of Minnesota State Representative Alice Seagren, Hearing on ""School Choice and Parental Empowerment,"" Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Bloomington, Minnesota, June 6, 2000.  19  Crossroads 2000 ix    Paperwork: Despite recent reductions, the Department still requires more than 38 million hours of paperwork a year  the equivalent of 18,000 employees only filling out forms for one year.22 In short, little has changed about the burden federal requirements place on school districts. These requirements continue to divert local resources into federal programs of unknown effectiveness and require compliance with numerous rules that have little to do with improving educational outcomes.  BROKEN PROMISES: REINVENTION AT A CROSSROADS  ""The [education] department has suffered from mistrust and management neglect, almost from the beginning. To overcome this legacy and to lead the way in national education reform, ED must refashion and revitalize its programs, management and systems."" -The Report of the National Performance Review, Office of the Vice President, September 1993  The Administration has failed to achieve its goal of reducing the burden that the federal government imposes on school districts. As Vice President, Al Gore has presided over the National Performance Review (NPR), the stated purpose of which is ""to create a government that `works better, costs less, and gets results Americans care about."" Back in 1993, Gore and the NPR identified the Department of Education as a troubled agency in need of significant reform. ED was to be ""reinvented"" as a high-performing outfit. In retrospect, it is clear that this never came to pass. During the past eight years, Many NPR recommendations have not been fully implemented, others not at all. Despite the Vice-President's good intentions, NPR has not produced significant results, either for the Department of Education, or for America's children. The most obvious proof is ED's ongoing bookkeeping nightmares and the numerous reports of waste, fraud and abuse concerning the agency and its programs. Some examples: ""Vastly improved financial management is a critical part of the overall effort to reinvent government...if a publicly traded corporation kept its books the way the federal government does, the Securities and Exchange Commission would close it down immediately.""-The Report of the National Performance Review, Office of the Vice President, September 1993 22  See: U.S. Department of Education, 1999 Performance Indicators and 2001 Plan, p. 146.  Crossroads 2000 x    Flunking Math: The Department has failed its agency-wide audit for the past two years. ED was the last federal agency to receive an audit opinion FY 1998. The report was issued eight months after the statutory deadline. Even with the extra time, auditors could not express an opinion on any of the agency's financial statements. Anomalies included an $800 million balance for a single student loan, a $6 billion discrepancy in the financial statements and $700 million placed in an inappropriate account. The ensuing FY 1999 audit report, released on March 1, 2000, was another failure, and the immediate future also appears grim. The Department does not intend to have an effective accounting system in place until the middle of 2001, which means the FY 2000 and FY 2001 audits reports are likely to disclose continued severe financial management problems.  Readin', Ritin' And Robbery: A theft ring involving collaboration between ou contractors and ED employees operated for at least three years, stealing than $300,000 worth of electronic equipment, including computers, cell ph VCRs and even a 61"" television set. It also netted from the agency more $600,000 in false overtime pay. tside more ones, than   Dead...And Loving It: ED improperly discharged almost $77 million in student loans for borrowers who falsely claimed to be either permanently disabled or deceased, according to an Inspector General (IG) report released in June 1999.  Failing forms forms had to Proofreading 101: In September 1999, ED printed 3.5 million financial aid containing errors -- incorrect line references to the IRS tax form. The were destroyed and the 100,000 of them that were distributed to schools be recalled. The cost of the error, according to an ED official: $720,000.   Low-Impact Aid: The Impact Aid grant program sends money to school districts serving children living on military installations or Indian reservations. In April 2000, two South Dakota school districts failed to receive expected Impact Aid grant payments totaling $1.9 million. According to a Justice Department complaint filed in July, the money had been electronically wired by an ED employee into two bank accounts set up by con men. Stolen funds from one bank account were used to purchase a 2000 Cadillac Escalade and a 2000 Lincoln Navigator. Stolen funds from the other bank account were used to purchase real property in the State of Maryland worth $135,000.  Crossroads 2000 xi   ""We didn't have to empty the pop machines to make payroll, but it came close.""--Chris Anderson, superintendent of the Bennett County, South Dakota School District whose Impact Aid grant funds failed to arrive on schedule.   Congratulations, You're Not A Winner: When Linh Hua, a graduate student at the University of California, Irvine, received a letter informing her that she had been selected to receive an ED graduate fellowship worth as much as $100,000, she had no reason to question the integrity of the offer. But a few days later, Hua received a message on her answering machine that she had received the letter in error, due to a mistake by an ED contractor. The contractor had erroneously sent award notification letters to 39 students informing them that they had won the awards, which cover up to four years of graduate school tuition and living expenses. These are just a few examples of how the Administration has failed to ""reinvent"" the Department of Education so that it better serves the needs of parents and students.  HOW DO WE GET TO EXCELLENCE FROM HERE? At each level of education, excellence is achieved by putting student performance first. Results for all children from all backgrounds are what really matter. The way in which a given teacher, school, district or state decides to produce results will often vary. The key, however, is for everyone to be held to high standards. And it is not the government's role to micromanage how those standards are met. The federal role should be to remove obstacles that prevent state and local education officials from implementing programs that work for their students.  Flexibility for Schools and School Districts  ""Simply put, what we want is greater flexibility in the use of federal funds coupled with greater accountability for achieving the desired results."" - Paul Vallas, Superintendent of Chicago Public Schools23 In 1991, Minnesota's Governor Arne Carlson (R) enacted the first charter school law in the nation was enacted under. What started as just a trickle is now a tidal wave, with  Statement of Paul Vallas, Field Hearing on ""Chicago Education Reforms and the Importance of Flexibility in Federal Education Programs"", Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Chicago, Illinois, April 19, 1999.  23  Crossroads 2000 xii   more than 1,484 charter schools in 36 states, including Washington, D.C.24 For almost a decade, the idea of granting freedom from process requirements and regulations in exchange for accountability for producing results has swept many parts of the country and has inspired numerous education reforms at the state and federal level.  Charter Schools: State charter school laws free schools to put the needs of children first by giving them flexibility and freedom in managing their school and staff. The Subcommittee heard from a charter school in Florida that saw achievement gains and a $60,000 surplus in their first year. Another school used its charter status to creatively meet the needs of special education students.  States ""Demandating"" Districts: o Regulatory relief for Chicago: The Subcommittee visited Chicago in April 1999, the site of the first Crossroads hearing in 1995, and a city which ten years ago was one of the worst school districts in the country. In 1996, the state of Illinois ""de-mandated"" the city to free it to implement an aggressive reform plan. Since then the city has seen continuous improvement in academic achievement and graduation rates. Flexibility with Accountability Produces Achievement gains in Texas: By holding schools accountable for improving the achievement of all students and granting flexibility to reach those goals, Texas has led the country in improved achievement and narrowing achievement gaps, according to the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). From 1994 to 2000, the percentage of Texas students passing all parts of the state skills test (TAAS) has increased by 51 percent, and the number of both minority students and economically disadvantaged students passing TAAS increased by 89%. On the 1996 NAEP Math Test, Whites and African Americans in Texas had the highest scores in the nation, and Latinos in Texas had the second highest scores in the nation. ""Charter districts"": Florida is experimenting with the concept of charter districts, granting charter status to certain districts based on an application setting forth certain performance goals. In exchange, the districts are freed from 800 pages of state requirements.  o  o  As of September 1999. See: U.S. Department of Education, State of Charter Schools 2000: 4 Report, January 2000, p. 1.  24  th  Year  Crossroads 2000 xiii   Empower Parents Putting student performance first also means empowering parents to make the best decisions about their child's education.  Choice leads to achievement gains: The Subcommittee visited Florida, where the state empowers parents to send their children to a school of choice if their local school receives a failing grade for two years in a row. For the 2000-2001 school year, the second year of the program, no additional schools received ""failing"" grades and scores improved overall statewide. Further building the case for choice, two studies were released in August 2000 finding achievement gains among recipients of privately funded vouchers in Washington D.C., Dayton, OH, Charlotte, N.C., and New York City.  U.S. Department of Ed study calls for choice experiment: In addition to public opinion favoring testing vouchers, a 1999 National Research Council (NRC) study commissioned by the U.S. Department of Education called for a ""large and ambitious"" ten-year, multi-district voucher experiment. According to the report, a large-scale voucher study would help determine whether giving public school students vouchers to pay for tuition at private schools can improve achievement, especially for students in poor, urban areas.25   Study finds education freedom linked to higher student achievement: A recent  study found that even after controlling for income, population demographics, income, education spending and class size, the amount of education freedom in a state is a significant predictor of student achievement. Texas and South Carolina, for example, are similar in characteristics that are commonly thought to influence student achievement, but Texas test scores are significantly higher. Texas offers more freedom, ranking 6th among states. South Carolina received a score that placed them 43rd.26  Congress Works to Free States to Put Results First and Reward Success Inspired by the success of charter schools, and the success of Chicago and states like Texas, Congress took some important initial steps in rolling back federal requirements in order to place more of an emphasis on results.

Greene, The Education Freedom Index, Center for Civic Innovation at the Manhattan Institute, Civic Repot No. 14, September 2000, p. 15. 26 25  Crossroads 2000 xiv   .   Dollars to the Classroom: The House has made it a priority to send more dollars to the classroom. On September 18, 1998 the House passed the Dollars to the Classroom Act (H.R. 3248) by a vote of 212-198. This bill consolidates duplicative education programs and ensures that 95 percent of federal dollars reach the classroom. On October 12, 1999, the House passed H. Res. 303, the Dollars to the Classroom Resolution, which called on Congress to work towards ensuring that more federal dollars are used in the classroom to improve achievement  More flexibility by expanding ""Ed-Flex"": Congress lifted the cap on the number of states that can apply to participate in Ed-Flex through The Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-25). Ed-Flex allows states to approve local waiver requests, instead of locals having to apply directly to the U.S. Secretary.  ""Charter States"": The Academic Achievement for All Act (Straight A's) is similar to the concept of charter schools: grant freedom from regulations and process requirements in exchange for accountability for producing results. Under Straight A's, Washington assumes the role of shareholder, not CEO, of the nation's education enterprise. Rather than micromanaging the day-to-day uses of federal money, it lets States manage their schools and dollars as they see fit in return for an agreed-on return on the federal investment in terms of gains in academic achievement.   Fulfill Federal Commitment to Special Education: In order to assist states and  somewhat relieve the burden of this mandate, the House passed H.R. 4055, the IDEA Full Funding Act of 2000, which authorizes an increase of $2 billion for each fiscal year so that by FY 2010 the appropriation is authorized at $25 billion. According to Department of Education estimates, $25 billion is enough to ensure that the federal government's commitment to fund 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure would be met.  CONCLUSION: PUT CHILDREN FIRST SO THAT NO CHILD IS LEFT BEHIND Over the last two years the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations has collected research, oversight and hearing data that continue to make the case that changes need to be made at all levels of government to ensure that children are truly put first in education. The lack of progress in improving achievement and narrowing achievement gaps, as well as the continued inequities in access to high quality education are unacceptable. Years of mismanagement, fraud and waste at the Department have also hurt children by reflecting poorly on the federal government's commitment to education. Crossroads 2000 xv   Simply put, the interests of children and parents are second to too many other interests. Too often education policy debates are not honest because of a fear of change and of any new policy that disrupts the status quo. Americans are not satisfied with the status quo  especially Americans with children trapped in low-performing schools. Congress should act swiftly during the next Congress to enact legislation that is right for children and their parents.  Empower Parents  Expand, empower and protect charter schools.  Enact education tax deductions.  Encourage school choice.  Expand Flexibility and Accountability for Results  Empower school districts to improve teacher quality or reduce class size according to their needs.  Put performance and accountability first and enact the Straight A's Act.  Empower schools to pay teachers according to their performance  Focus the federal role in education on important goals and consolidate and eliminate duplicative and ineffective education programs.  Work to Ensure that ALL Have Access to a High Quality Education  Place a priority on raising the achievement of all students, even the lowest performing students.  Free children from failing schools.  Fight illiteracy among disadvantaged students.  Ensure that Federal Dollars are Spent With Integrity at the Department of Education  Conduct oversight to ensure that the Department meets its goal of receiving a clean, independent audit.  Institute institutional checks and balances to ensure that education research, statistics and evaluations are conducted and presented in a rigorous and unbiased manner.  Work to improve overall management and quality of the Department's management of its finances and internal operations in order to reduce waste, fraud and abuse.  Crossroads 2000 xvi   Make the Federal Role in Education Less Burdensome  Eliminate or consolidate duplicative programs.  Eliminate ineffective programs  Improve evaluation and oversight of federal programs to ensure that federal dollars produce results.  Reform the Department's Office of Education Research and Improvement (OERI) so that it serves the needs of teachers and students, not researchers, so that we know what really works in the classroom.  Ensure that federal research and program evaluation activities employ rigorous research methods in order to produce credible, useful results. There is too much at stake to allow the federal education system to dictate how children are educated in the United States. There is too much at stake to waste scarce resources on mismanagement and failed programs. Congress should work to make the difficult policy decisions that need to be made at the federal level, and empower states and parents to ensure that student performance is put first, not the status quo.  Crossroads 2000 xvii    THE ROAD TO EXCELLENCE PART I: WE' RE  NOT THERE YET  In Education at a Crossroads: What Works and What's Wasted in Education Today, the Subcommittee reported that America's education system is at the intersection of two paths: one leading to excellence, the other to mediocrity. Through hearings and extensive research, the Subcommittee examined the characteristics of schools and districts that lead down the road to excellence as well as down the road to mediocrity - what is wasted in education. During the 106th Congress, the Subcommittee has continued to look beyond the crossroads toward states, districts, and schools that have emerged as shining examples of excellence over the last two decades. How have they achieved excellence? By implementing policies that put student performance first. What Does Excellence Look Like? For the first time since the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) began measuring academic achievement 30 years ago, an entire decade has passed without significant and substantial achievement gains. Since the release of the previous Crossroads report, student achievement data has been released that gives us a complete picture of achievement over the last decade. The data shows that apart from some very small gains in math scores, achievement has leveled off in most grades and subject areas. This is after gains made during the 1970s and 80s. More troubling is that achievement gaps have not narrowed, despite intensive federal efforts to target funds to disadvantaged students.

Crossroads 2000 3   Public Frustrated with the Status Quo The stagnant achievement and education inequities of the nineties are reflected in public opinion about education. According to an analysis of recent polling by the non-partisan, nonprofit research organization Public Agenda, data indicates that the average American is ""hardly endorsing the status quo.""38 While most Americans do not want to dismantle the current system, frustration is running high  especially among minorities. Education is consistently cited in national polls as the most important policy issue during the 2000 election year. While many Americans are initially supportive of their local school, when questioned further they are more critical. According to Public Agenda, ""the prevailing view is that public education as a whole is in bad shape and renewed efforts are needed to fix it."" For example,  52 percent think local private schools do a better job of educating students  only 19 percent think public schools are better.  A 1999 Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies poll found that while 59 percent consider their local public schools to be excellent or good, only 39.7 percent of African-Americans rated their local schools that highly.39  58 percent of employers surveyed say that graduates coming from public schools lack the skills needed to succeed in the work world.40  Fewer Americans Believe that Reforming the Existing Education System Will Work 80% 70% 60% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% 0% Refo rm Existing Syste m 1997  71 % 59%  34% 23 %  F ind Alternative Syste m 200 0  Source: Public Agenda  38 39 40  Public Agenda Online: Clarifying Issues 2000, ""Education"", www.publicagenda.org.

Crossroads 2000 4    The percent of Americans who think that in order to improve education the focus should be on offering alternatives to the existing education system increased from 1997 to 2000.41 In summary, while student performance has been at the center of education rhetoric in America, it has not been in practice. Consequently, achievement is not where it should be, and most Americans are not satisfied by the status quo. We are not seeing the results we should expect to see for the nation's investments in education. THE CURRENT FEDERAL ROLE DOES NOT REWARD RESULTS ""...We must fundamentally change the way the federal government treats public schools. If we continue down the current road - where responsibility, authority, and accountability for American education flow not toward but away from parents, especially poor parents - then we will continue to see what we are seeing: too much low performance, too many bad schools, too many wasted lives."" 42  Former Secretary of Education William Bennett Common to all of the principles of success highlighted in the previous Education at a Crossroads is that the needs of students and student performance should be central to all aspects of education policy. Rather than encouraging putting performance first, however, education policy, especially at the federal level, has too often put first the needs of the education ""system""  compliance with its rules and requirements. States and school districts have generally complied with federal requirements, but too often those requirements have very little to do with improving student performance, consequently diverting resources from achieving that purpose. As Time Magazine reported earlier this year, over the last eight years, ""the Education Department has done little to reward schools that flourish and nothing to sanction schools that persistently fail.""43 Since 1965, when Washington embarked on its first major elementary-secondary education initiative, federal policy has strongly influenced America's schools. Although education is generally considered a state and local responsibility, over the years Congress has created hundreds of programs intended to address problems in education. The shape of new education programs is often determined by political polls and focus groups, rather than the actual needs of students and teachers.44 Today, the federal government pursues its education agenda through a wide range of programs; over sixty of them, funded at nearly $14 billion, are included in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), which was reauthorized in 1994 and is presently due to be reauthorized. Creating a ""program for every problem,"" as the Crossroads report found, begins to add up, such that there are more than 760 ""education"" and 41 42  Ibid.

According to William Moloney, Superintendent of Colorado Schools, ""ESEA [has] remained as always a neutral phenomena based on inputs rather than results, more on accounting than accountability, an entity always more interested in what you were rather than what you were doing.""49 Indeed, without asking whether or not programs produce results, Washington each year funds an increasing number of education programs. Despite attempts to repeal and consolidate unnecessary and duplicative education programs, according to the Congressional Research Service, the number of Congressionally-funded programs at the Department of Education has steadily increased for the last four fiscal years (Table 1).  Dumping Education Dollars into Unproven Programs Because federal policy makers have long been content with measuring success in terms of inputs and compliance, in lieu of results, the nation lacks sufficient information to determine what really works and what does not when it comes to helping students succeed. The current federal role in education research funds a confusing array of research centers, labs, technical assistance centers and other entities located around the country. For a variety of reasons, ""educational research and development usually have not been held in high esteem in the twentieth century.""50 According to GAO, ""information about the federal education effort is For the most recent data on total federal funding of education, see Table 1 in the National Center for Education Statistics' Federal Support for Education, 1980-2000, September 2000, p. 5, http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2000/2000068.pdf. 46 Throughout this report, the U.S. Department of Education is referred to as either ""ED"" or ""the Department."" 47 This table only accounts for funded programs: There are authorized programs that do not receive funding, and unauthorized programs that do. 48 Chester Finn, Jr., Marci Kanstoroom, Michael Petrilli, ""Overview: Thirty-Four Years of Dashed Hopes,"" New Directions: Federal Education Policy in the Twenty-First Century, The Thomas B.

According to the National Research Council, ""social science research currently provides few definitive answers about how to improve educational outcomes for [disadvantaged] children.""53 A RAND Corporation study found that ""the research and development community in education has been unable to provide consensus results or pilot tested policies and practices that could guide policy makers and educators to more effective practices.""54 One reporter described the situation in this manner: ""[w]hen medical researchers want to know whether a drug works, they compare outcomes of a group taking the drug to those not taking it. But that type of experiment is rarely done in education.""55 Instead, educators rely on ""a hunch...[o]r at best, a hunch based on trial and error.""56 The largest federal elementary and secondary education program, Title I, which is designed to close the achievement gap between disadvantaged students and non-disadvantaged students, has yet to demonstrate that it has been effective in doing so. Today, even though the law requires States to ""turn-around"" low-performing schools, there are nearly 7,000 Title I schools (19% of Title I schools) and about 1,000 school districts (15% of Title I districts) that are officially designated as in need of ""improvement""--that are failing to make adequate annual achievement gains. The final report of the Prospects evaluation of Chapter 1 (later renamed as Title I) found that the program was not sufficient for at-risk students in high-poverty schools to close their academic achievement gaps with students in low-poverty schools.57 And most recently, early data available from the evaluation of Title I since the 1994 reauthorization indicate that the program is not narrowing achievement gaps any more effectively. The interim report found that Title I students in the study performed ""somewhat below national and urban norms,"" and were ""showing somewhat less progress than would be expected over a full year."" The proportion of students meeting the highest proficiency levels merely held steady during the two years for which data have been made available.58 In the last two years several studies further confirm this description of education research and practice: U.S. General Accounting Office, Federal Education Funding: Multiple Programs and Lack of Data Raise Efficiency and Effectiveness Concerns, Statement of Carlotta Joyner before the Senate Education Task Force, GAO/T-HEHS-98-46, November 6, 1997, p. 12. 52 Ibid, p. 13. 53 National Research Council, Making Money Matter: Financing America's Schools, National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., September 1999, p. 268. 54 David Grissmer, Ann Flanagan, Jennifer Kawata, Stephanie Williamson, Improving Student Achievement: What State NAEP Scores Tell Us, RAND, July 2000, p. xxxvi. 55 ""Bilingual Education Fails Test, Exposing Deeper Problem,"" USA Today editorial, August 28, 2000. 56 Richard Whitmire, ""Research  Education's Achilles Heel,"" Gannett New Service, May 5, 2000. 57 Michael J.

After an exhaustive review, the panel concluded that less than one third of the studies met their standards for academic and scientific rigor.59 Title I research unable to answer important questions about effectiveness: At the request of groups such as the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, the American Institutes of Research studied 24 Title I ""schoolwide"" comprehensive reform models currently marketed to local school districts.

A national evaluation was conducted, but because there were so few schools, researchers could not draw conclusions on the basis its findings.61 Not only do we not the effectiveness of program's impact. Change (LESCP) is have research about Title I schoolwides, the most recent evaluation of Title I will not likely answer questions policy makers have about the GAO found that the Department's Longitudinal Evaluation of School ""unlikely to fully satisfy any of its three potential purposes.""62      Spending more money isn't the only answer: The National Research Council's 1999 report Making Money Matter, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education, reported that ""We have reviewed the literature on whether and how money matters. That review makes it clear that additional funding for education will not automatically and necessarily generate student achievement and in the past has not, in fact, generally led to higher achievement."" While there is currently a debate in the research community on the role of resources in improving education, it is clear that increasing funding alone will not guarantee results.  Dr. Reid Lyon of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development summed up at a Committee hearing how we have reached the end of the 20th century knowing so little about what works in the classroom: ... the investments we have made in research for the last 30 years have been investments that have been realized by mediocrity, by limited rigor, and by a misunderstanding on a large part of the research community how in fact to even do the research we drastically 59 Testimony of Dr. Reid Lyon, Chief, Child Development and Behavior Branch, National Institutes of Health, Hearing on ""Options for the Future of the Office of Education Research and Improvement,"" Subcommittee on Early Childhood Youth and Families, Committee on Education and the Workforce, May 4, 2000. 60 Rebecca Herman, An Educators' Guide to Schoolwide Reform, American Institutes for Research, 1999. 61 GAO, Title I Program: Stronger Accountability Needed for Performance of Disadvantaged Students, GAO/HEHS-00-89, June 2000. 62 GAO, Education for Disadvantaged Children: Research Purpose and Design Conclusions Drawn from Key Studies, GAO/HEHS-00-168, August 2000, p. 11.

It is no wonder that teachers have no trust in having research guide their practice, because research that is not done well, that is not of good quality, does not inform and should not be trusted.63 It is impossible to make wise decisions about funding federal education programs when so little is known about what works in the classroom, and so little of valid research reaches the classroom. And yet despite this lack of research, each year new programs are created at the federal level, without anyone knowing whether they will truly help children learn. Federally Endorsed Math Curriculum The Department experienced disastrous results when it attempted to clarify what works in the classroom, but without basing their conclusions on scientific research. In October of 1999, the U.S. Department of Education endorsed five programs for K-12 mathematics classes as ""exemplary"" and another five as ""promising"". An ""Expert Panel"" selected by the Office of Education Research and Improvement (OERI) made the recommendations to Secretary Riley. ED approved the programs and sent out information about the endorsement to all school districts in the country. In response to the backing of the Department of Education for such programs, two hundred mathematicians and scientists from universities nationwide published an open letter of protest to Secretary Riley in the Washington Post. The letter cited ""serious mathematical shortcomings"" within the endorsed programs and asked that Riley withdraw the entire list of curricula followed by an announcement of the withdrawal to the public. The letter also noted that the Expert Panel that selected the ten programs was not comprised of active research mathematicians. Several concerns raised by the teaching of ""fuzzy math"" include: a lack of understanding of mathematical basics, the continuation of decreased standardized test scores, and the possible triggering of increased remedial education for students in higher education. In response to the Department's recognition of the ten ""exemplary"" and ""promising"" math programs, the Committee held a hearing on the ""Federal Role in K-12 Mathematics Reform"" on February 2, 2000. The human consequences of using unproven math curricula was illustrated at the hearing by a student who had learned math under one of the endorsed curriculum and related her own experience. University of Michigan student Rachel Tronstein testified that for all of high school, she was in an accelerated program within the Core Plus curriculum. After four years of Core Plus and the transition to math at the university level, she had this to say about the curriculum: I was enrolled in Algebra II in 8th grade, which traditionally is the curriculum for a junior in high school.... I then entered...High School, where I was in the Core Plus curriculum, and I went through four years. I took Calculus my senior year because I was in the accelerated track, and also I received private tutoring for my entire four years of high school because my parents were concerned that I wasn't getting a very good understanding of the fundamentals and basics of math. And I Testimony of Reid Lyon, ""Hearing on Options for the Future of the Office of Educational Research and Improvement,"" Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth and Families, May 4, 2000. 63  Crossroads 2000 9   also attended Stanford University's summer session for high school students in the summer of 1998, and I took a remedial pre-calculus course... And a lot of those concepts were concepts to which I had never been exposed, which was obviously very frustrating because every other student in the class had. Right now, I am a student at the University of Michigan... I took Calculus I fall term. I received a B minus, while in my other three classes I received A's, and I worked harder in the Calculus course. [Core Plus] fails to teach students basic mathematical skills required for postsecondary educational success. It creates a calculator dependency. And sure, you can compute an answer, but you have no understanding of how or why that answer is correct, which does not enable you to understand further calculations or applications. ED's pseudo-endorsement of math curricula is troubling, not only because the Department is prohibited by statute from officially endorsing any curriculum, but also because the process by which it selected ""exemplary"" math programs was based on peer reviewers and a panel of ""experts,"" not rigorous research demonstrating that the programs were effective. Any federal recognition, whether or not it is an ""official"" endorsement, can unduly influence school districts to select a math curriculum that is not necessarily a proven program. Federal Programs Take Their Toll ""One thing that Mayor Daley, Board President Gery Chico and I firmly believe and have urged Congress and the President repeatedly to do is to leave it up to the local school districts to decide how best to meet the student needs. Focus on results and leave it up to school districts to decide how to achieve them."" 64 Paul Vallas, Superintendent of Chicago Public Schools  The cumulative effect of federally designed programs and requirements that are not grounded in good research continues to take its toll at the state and local level. The Subcommittee continued to hear from witnesses at hearings around the country that many wellintentioned federal programs provide funding with burdensome requirements that have nothing to do with producing results. At a hearing in Battle Creek, Michigan on September 8, 1999, Mr. John DeLine, Superintendent of Tekonsha Community Schools, described his experience with federal programs: My staff and myself spent over 600 hours trying to decipher [federal special education requirements], so it may be something that you want to consider in the future once you pass something. Six hundred hours is a lot of hours. ...Every law that's passed has a tremendous impact on us as far as staff.65  Statement of Paul Vallas, Field Hearing, Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Chicago, Illinois, April 19, 1999.

They ""put about 200 hours into [federal grant applications] and got one grant out of about ten."" He asked the Committee to grant small school districts like his with fewer than 600 students more flexibility to deal with federal requirements. ""Hold us accountable and we will show you success."" Colorado Education Commissioner Bill Moloney observed in testimony before the Subcommittee on January 25, 2000, ""[i]n medieval times, people were sometimes pressed to death by having heavy stones piled upon their bodies until all breath and life was squeezed from them. The current U.S. Congress made a valiant attempt to lift some of those stones from the body of state and local folks. Certain very worthwhile successes were achieved but all too many stones remain. We still await the day when ESEA can truly be redesigned to fulfill the dreams we had for it in 1965..."" According to one witness, a fundamental lack of trust of states and school districts is what is primarily behind these burdensome federal requirements. In testimony before the House Budget Committee's Education Task Force (chaired by Rep. Hoekstra, (R-MI)), Susan Sclafani, the Chief of Staff of Educational Services of the Houston Independent School District, described how political compromise has resulted in mandates and requirements that divert attention and resources from the real needs of students. ...the district currently spends a minimum of three man-days per month creating the documentation of use of federal funds as a supplement to district funds, rather than supplanting [a federal fiscal requirement]. To demonstrate comparability-- that the district is not spending less in local funds in Title 1 schools than it spends in non-Title 1 schools--the accounting department staff must compute every expenditure for staff, materials, equipment, and contracted services. With staffing, this is particularly difficult to do on a monthly basis, since one must forecast stipends that are paid annually or semi-annually as part of the equation. However, it must be done monthly so that if a discrepancy is discovered it can be remedied over the rest of the year. If that does not happen...the district will be out of compliance....[T]he whole equation is thrown off whenever a teacher leaves one school and is replaced by a teacher with more or less experience. In a large urban district, this happens frequently, forcing the accounting department to recalculate their ...figures ... Clearly, this procedure has nothing to do with the district's commitment to equity nor does it ensure increased levels of student achievement.66 Ms. Sclafani's testimony provides a stark picture of the consequences of overdependence on process requirements and compliance at the local level: a diversion of resources from improving student achievement.

You would all be heroes in your home states for doing so!- Minnesota State Rep. Alice Seagren Aside from being a classic study of unintended consequences, this law [IDEA] made promises to local people that have not been remotely kept. It is not just the financial default. The most tragic result is that the suffocating blanket of regulation actively worked against the learning prospects of our handicapped children.  Colorado Commissioner of Education Bill Moloney  One of the most significant undfunded mandates on school districts is the special education mandate. Even the most efficient and effective schools and districts in the country are still confronted with the daunting task of complying with the federal special education mandate. The Subcommittee has heard from many school districts about the burden that the special education mandate places on them financially, and how it restricts their freedom in using their education dollars. In 1975, the United States Congress passed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which requires school districts to provide a free and appropriate public education to students with disabilities and to develop individual education plans (IEP) for those students. Congress has not yet met the funding commitment it made 24 years ago to children with special education needs. That commitment was to provide children with disabilities access to a quality public education and to contribute 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure to assist states and local school districts with the excess costs of educating such children. To date it only funds about 13 percent of those costs. Inadequately funding IDEA not only hinders the ability of schools to provide children with disabilities with an appropriate education, but also prevents all students from receiving a quality education. In order to assist states and somewhat relieve the burden of this mandate, the House or Representatives passed H.R. 4055, the IDEA Full Funding Act of 2000, which authorizes increasing appropriations for IDEA Part B (State Grants) for FY2001 through FY2010. H.R. 4055 authorizes an increase of $2 billion for each fiscal year so that by FY2010 the appropriation is authorized at $25 billion. According to the Department of Education's estimates, $25 billion would ensure that the federal government's commitment in to fund 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure would be met. Congress should continue its efforts to meet its IDEA funding obligations before investing in new programs of unknown effectiveness. As the Table 2 below indicates, this would provide significant sums of money for school districts and free up resources at the local level.

To overcome this legacy and to lead the way in national education reform, ED must refashion and revitalize its programs, management and systems."" --The Report of the National Performance Review, Office of the Vice President, September 1993  ""Here is a Department that is promoting standards and excellence [for schools] but appears to have less of a commitment to high standards for itself."" 67-- Paul C. Light, Brookings Institution  The federal role in education is carried out primarily by the Department of Education. While the present role of ED is to inject cutting edge reforms into America's classrooms, the agency is itself a showroom for obsolescent government management practices. As an inefficient bureaucracy, the Department was specifically targeted by Vice President Al Gore's National Performance Review (NPR), whose purpose is ""to create a government that `works better, costs less, and gets results Americans care about."" Back in 1993, Gore and the NPR identified ED as a troubled agency in need of significant reform. It was to be ""reinvented"" as a high-performing outfit. This has not come to pass. During the past eight years, the Administration has not accomplished its overall goals and promises for reinvention at the Department of Education. In 2000, ED spent nearly 50% more than it did in 1994, and administered more programs. Man y NPR recommendations have not been fully implemented, others not at all. Despite the VicePresident's promises to make government work better, the bottom line is that the NPR has not produced significant results at ED. The agency continues to be rife with waste, fraud and abuse.

These weaknesses have been very similar from year to year, starting with Education's first agency-wide audit for Fiscal Year 1995.""-Testimony of Gloria Jarmon of the General Accounting Office at March 1, 2000 Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee hearing  67  Judy Pasternak, ""Department a Haven for Clinton Loyalists,"" Los Angeles Times, October 3, 1999.  Crossroads 2000 14   The Department of Education failed its agency-wide audit each of the past two years. These audits were the focus of recent Subcommittee hearings held on December 6, 1999 and March 1, 2000. ED was the last federal agency to receive an audit report for FY 1998; the report was issued in November 1999, eight months after the statutory deadline. Even so, auditors could not express an opinion on any of the agency's financial statements. Anomalies included an $800 million balance for a single student loan, a $6 billion discrepancy in the financial statements and $700 million placed in an inappropriate account.  EVEN THE INSPECTOR GENERAL UNABLE TO QUANTIFY THE EXTENT WASTE AND ABUSE AT THE DEPARTMENT Rep. Norwood (R-GA): ""Is there anybody here that can answer the question how many dollars have been lost of the taxpayers' money to date either through criminal activity or abuse..."" Lorraine Lewis (ED Inspector General): ""No"" Rep. Norwood: ""Nobody knows? Well, you want to know why the American taxpayer gets upset with stuff like this? They want to know. This is not about public education. It is about a federal agency that has gone awry.  The FY 1999 audit report, (Exchange occurring during the Oversight Subcommittee's released on March 1, 2000, was another September 19, 2000 hearing on financial management problems failure. The number of material at the Department of Education) weaknesses in the agency's financial controls increased. The outlook for the FY 2000 audit report, due out in March 2001, also appears grim. ED officials have attributed financial management difficulties to a lack of funding for qualified personnel. An October 3, 1999 story appearing in the Los Angeles Times, however, offers another explanation, noting that ED has the highest ratio of political appointees to government workers of any Cabinet agency: ""Midway through Clinton's first term, Education's inspector general began warning that the department lacked employees with critical computer and financial skills and that it needed people with expertise to oversee outside contractors. This shortage has continued while increasing numbers of political appointees have been added, said Dianne van Riper, who retired in January as the department's assistant inspector general for investigations. `When you decide to spend a dollar on hiring one kind of employee and not another, you're making a decision,' Van Riper said.""  Crossroads 2000 15   A Lack of Accountability ""We all know the potential cost of lagging (financial management) systems: They contributed to the $300 billion savings and loan bailout, $47 in nontax delinquent debt, $3.6 billion in student loan defaults, and so on. Fortunately, the process of updating our management information systems has begun.""-The Report of the National Performance Review, Office of the Vice President, September 1993  ""The Department's new accounting system could not perform an automated year-end closing process and directly produce consolidated financial statements as would normally be expected from such systems. This meant that the Department had to use a costly, labor-intensive and time-consuming manual process to prepare its financial statements.""- Gloria Jarmon of the General Accounting Office, testifying at a Dec. 6, 1999 O & I hearing  During the recently completed fiscal year, FY 2000, the Department operated without an integrated financial management system that met generally accepted accounting standards. In the past, the lack of such an effective system has contributed to failed audits. This means it is unlikely that the Department will receive a clean audit opinion on its FY 2000 audit report, due out in March 2001. Despite Chairman Hoekstra's expressed interest in its progress, the deadline for implementation of such a system has been postponed several times by ED  the current deadline is the summer of 2001. In the meantime, without a good accounting system in place, Department staff compiles financial statements for auditors manually, and practically from scratch. This process is both time-consuming and expensive, typically involving the hiring of outside contractors, according to expert testimony delivered at hearings held by the Oversight Subcommittee.

Readin', Ritin' And Robbery  ""The recently discovered loss of U.S. Department of Education (ED) property has brought renewed visibility to lax management controls over information technology assets...The 1999 physical inventory of IT assets was the first since 1994. There was no attempt to reconcile the earlier inventory or to review computer surplusing actions.""- February 10, 2000 Memorandum from the Department's Office of the Inspector General to the Deputy Secretary of Education  68  http://easi.ed.gov/inside_projecteasi/HTML/enews/highimpact.html  Crossroads 2000 17   A theft ring involving collaboration between outside contractors and ED employees operated for at least three years, stealing more than $300,000 worth of electronic equipment, including five $8,000 Gateway computers, cell phones, VCRs and a 61"" television set. It also netted from the agency more than $600,000 in false overtime pay. An ED employee charged with overseeing a telecommunications contract took advantage of her position by collaborating with contract employees working under her supervision to steer equipment bought with Department of Education dollars to her house and friends and relatives homes. Other ED employees were also in on the scheme. One of the contract workers confessed to doing personal errands for the ED contract officer, such as driving to Baltimore to bring her crab cakes to eat for lunch at her desk in Washington, DC. In return, she signed off on false weekend and holiday hours that the contractor never worked. This network operated undetected for at least three years. The theft ring is still under investigation, but several defendants have pled guilty in federal court, and more pleas are expected soon. Federal law enforcement officials are currently investigating several other instances of large-scale theft at ED. Low-Impact Aid ""We didn't have to empty the pop machines to make payroll, but it came close.""Chris Anderson, superintendent of the Bennett County, South Dakota School District, quoted in an Associated Press news story. Anderson was referring to the dilemma created for the district when federal Impact Aid grant funds failed to arrive on schedule.  The Impact Aid grant program sends money to school districts serving federally connected children, such as those living on military installations or Indian reservations. In April 2000, two South Dakota school districts failed to receive expected Impact Aid grant payments totaling $1.9 million. District administrators did not immediately notify the Department of Education, since delayed disbursement of Impact Aid grants by ED has become routine. It is not uncommon for school districts to be forced to borrow money from a local bank  and pay interest on the loan  while waiting for ED to get grant payments out the door. In this case, the $1.9 million was wired to the wrong bank accounts. According to a Justice Department complaint filed in July, the money was electronically wired by an ED employee into two bank accounts set up by con men. The thieves submitted fraudulent direct deposit forms to ED, substituting their own bank account numbers for those of the South Dakota school districts. Stolen funds from one bank account were used to purchase a 2000 Cadillac Escalade and a 2000 Lincoln Navigator. Stolen funds from the other bank account were used to purchase real property in the State of Maryland worth $135,000.  Crossroads 2000 18   Disturbingly, the potential for theft in the Impact Aid program had previously been raised in the Department's FY 1999 audit report. Concerning Impact Aid, the report describes, ""an inadequate segregation of duties in sensitive areas, such as payment processing,"" whereby the same individuals are able to process and approve a payment drawdown request. The theft of Impact Aid funds and the potential for similar fraud were examined at a September 19, 2000 hearing held by the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. It Takes A Village...On Mars The Subcommittee discovered that the Department of Education spent $2.7 million between FY 1998 and FY 2000 in support of the White House Millennium Council (run out of the Office of the First Lady) and its Mars Millennium Project. The Mars Project invites schools to imagine and design a village on Mars that might exist in 2030. Six ED employees were assigned to work full time on Millennium activities -- all but one of them worked out of the White House executive offices. The Department paid for a variety of printed materials, as well as the development of the White House Millennium Council logo and a Millennium Council web site. Dead...And Loving It ""Education continues to experience challenges in its management of student financial aid programs, which we have designated as at high risk for fraud, waste, abuse or mismanagement...The Department lacks the integrated financial systems to provide basic information...the current system cannot always identify where a student is enrolled, even after a student grant or loan is awarded, and thousands of dollars in student aid have been disbursed. As a result, ineligible students could be receiving funds.""--High-Risk Series: An Update, General Accounting Office, January 1999 ED improperly discharged almost $77 million in student loans for borrowers who falsely claimed to be either permanently disabled or deceased, according to an Inspector General (IG) report released in June 1999.  From July 1, 1994 through December 31, 1996, fully 23 percent of all individuals whose loans were discharged due to disability claims were actually holding jobs -some earning more than $50,000. A total of $73 million in loans was improperly forgiven. During the same time period, 708 borrowers receiving death discharges totaling over $3.8 million were earning wages after the discharge.    Crossroads 2000 19   (The Higher Education Act provides for loan discharges when the borrower either becomes totally and permanently disabled or dies. In enforcing this provision, however, ED did not require the disability form to include, e.g., the doctor's professional license number or office telephone number, and it did not require certified copies of death certificates.) The same IG study found that more than 6,800 new loans totaling almost $20 million were awarded to borrowers who returned to school after previously having loans discharged due to total and permanent disability. In other words, the $20 million in loans was awarded to ineligible individuals. Failing Proofreading 101 About 10 million American students fill out a federal financial aid form each year to apply for college aid. The job of designing, printing, distributing and processing these forms is entrusted to the Department of Education's Office of Student Financial Assistance (SFA), which the National Performance Review identified as one of the thirty-two ""High Impact"" federal agencies which have ninety-percent of the federal government's contact with the public. Unfortunately, SFA continues to experience problems annually with the student aid forms. In September 1999, SFA printed 3.5 million financial aid forms containing errors -incorrect line references to the IRS tax form. The forms were destroyed and the 100,000 of them that were distributed to schools had to be recalled. The cost of the mistake, according to the head of SFA: $720,000. Perhaps most disturbing is the fact that SFA officials never noticed the flaws in the aid form they created and printed. It was an eagle-eyed university financial aid administrator who spotted the errors and brought them to attention. A $5 Million Technology Lesson ED invested several million dollars on a pet project of the Vice President's that was abandoned after just one year. At the urging of the Vice President's National Performance Review (NPR) team, ED initiated a project called ""Access America"" that was to eventually involve distributing to college students ATM-style ""smart cards"" to be used to access federal student aid and, eventually, other types of federal benefits. House Education Committee members, as well as most banks and colleges, objected that the project was unnecessary and required too much federal involvement. But ED initiated a pilot project soon after an NPR official transitioned into a high-level post in SFA. The pilot involved eight colleges, and the plan was to do a nationwide rollout within two years. In June 2000, however, the project was quietly terminated after its first year due to a lack of interest from colleges. ED had already spent $5.4 million on the initiative.  Crossroads 2000 20   Federal Frequent Fliers During fiscal year 1999, ED spent $13.5 million on travel expenses for agency employees. That translates into $2,882 per FTE (full-time equivalent employee). The office with the highest travel budget is SFA -- more than 100 SFA employees traveled to Disney World Headquarters in Orlando, Florida during 2000 to attend management-training seminars at the Disney Institute. The 192-Step Discretionary Grants Approval Process The Crossroads report described how the Vice-President's National Performance Review found in 1993 that the discretionary grant approval process lasted 26 weeks and took 487 steps from start to finish. In 1996 ED implemented a plan to begin ""streamlining"" the grant review process to 20 weeks and 216 steps. The Subcommittee submitted a letter to the Department in July 1998 to find out if the redesigned discretionary grant approval process had been successfully implemented, and whether it could verify that applications were being processed more quickly and efficiently. While it reported meeting many of its goals, ED did not provide any substantive documentation to prove that the implementation was successful in making the process more efficient. Of course, enhanced efficiency was the only legitimate goal of the streamlining effort. Therefore, Chairman Hoekstra requested GAO to look into the Department's management of discretionary grants to determine whether the approval process had in fact become more efficient. GAO also looked at how grants were awarded, the peer review process, characteristics of grant recipients, and the costs of applying for a grant. In response to the GAO audit, Acting Deputy Secretary Mike Smith established a task force to address GAO recommendations.69 GAO recommended that the Department ensure that peer reviewers not have personal, professional or financial conflicts of interests, and the Department has since taken steps to ensure that peer reviewers provide sufficient documentation to prove that they have no such conflicts of interest. Another GAO recommendation addressed scoring variations among peer reviewers. Not every peer reviewer scores similar applications in the same manner, which can result in qualified applicants not receiving funds. The Department is beginning to implement some of GAO's recommendations to ensure that scoring is less likely to be perceived as unfair or subject to politics.70 GAO found that process. However, only able to verify the numbe had previously indicated 69 70  the Department had streamlined many aspects of its grant application immediately before the GAO report went to print was the Department r of steps it currently takes to approve an application.

Crossroads 2000 21   finally calculated that the process was reduced to a total of 192 steps. Due to the last minute nature of this finding, GAO was not able to verify the number. Without the oversight efforts of the Subcommittee, it is likely that important steps to improve the fairness and efficiency of the grants approval process would not have been put in place. It was only when GAO began to look into this process that the Department began to look at whether the redesigned grants process had been effective, and whether any additional steps should be taken to ensure that grants are fairly awarded to the highest quality applicants. It Keeps Growing.... and Growing...and Growing ""NPR recommends reducing the number of programs the department administers. ED runs 230 education programs, many of which overlap or have achieved the purpose for which they were created, or are better addressed by non-federal resources.""  The Report of the National Performance Review, Office of the Vice President, September 1993  While there have been some program eliminations in the past decade, each year since 1997 the number of funded programs at the Department of Education has actually grown. There are still at least 230 authorized programs at the Department. For FY 2001 alone the President proposed 20 new education programs. In addition, the number of employees at ED has grown each year since 1997, when it stood at 4,470. The FY 2001 budget request called for 4,749 employees. Furthermore, the Department's annual budget has increased from $23 billion in 1996 to $38 billion in FY 2000. A significant portion of the funding and staffing increases have been for the ED's Direct Lending program. Reinventing Education Statistics ""Honest, efficient governance is absolutely essential if governments are to build on the public trust that makes democracy possible... Ensuring the integrity and efficiency of government will strengthen our democracies and help us accelerate, instead of suffocate, the entrepreneurial initiative that is the surest path to progress and prosperity in the 21st century.""-Vice-President Gore, Release,  December 21, 1998.71  On February 10, 1999 it was Vice President Al Gore, not the Commissioner for Education Statistics, Dr. Pascal Forgione, who released the 1998 NAEP reading results to the public at a press conference. This was the first time that any official higher than the Secretary of Education has taken part in a NAEP release and constituted a violation of the longstanding NAGB policy designed to insulate the release of education results from political ""spin."" The Vice President did not merely report the results, according to the Los Angeles Times: ""In his eagerness to put a positive spin on the statistics, Gore glossed over the fact that long-term 71  National Performance Review, ""Vice President Gore To Chair Global Forum On Reinventing Government,"" Release, Monday, December 21, 1998. http://www.npr.gov/cgi-bin/print_hit_bold.pl/library/news/122198.html  Crossroads 2000 22   progress has been modest at best.""72 Test scores from 1992 were left out the Vice President's presentation, giving the appearance that scores had increased since 1994, although those scores were only returning to 1992 levels. Moreover, according to Mark Musick, the Chairman of NAGB, ""the format, tone, and substance of that event was not consistent with the principle of an independent, nonpartisan release of ... data."" E-mail messages exchanged between Education Department officials and an education adviser to the Vice President indicated, according to Education Week, that ""the Feb. 10 event was designed to give positive press coverage to Mr. Gore, who is running for president.""73 Because of concerns about the manner in which the 1998 NAEP reading test results were released, and the apparent violation of NAGB policy, the Subcommittee investigated the matter and held a hearing on May 27, 1999. During the hearing, Mr. Schaffer (R-CO) specifically questioned Dr. Forgione about the Vice-President's characterization of the results in his presentation: Mr. Schaffer. The Vice President used the time frame from 1994 to 1998. So is it fair for me to say that the President told the truth? Mr. Forgione. They certainly presented half of the truth. Mr. Schaffer. But he didn't tell the truth, right? Mr. Forgione. Not the whole truth...I prefer to say the Vice President presented part of the data and the Commissioner later presented all parts of the data. I would say that is not trivial and that is why we want the Commissioner to go first, because America has to believe the data. What he did was not inappropriate, if in fact all of the information had gotten out. When the Vice President leaves, a lot of the press leaves with him. Dr. Forgione himself was critical of the Vice-President's involvement in the release of the NAEP scores, stating in press accounts that campaign style government ""can cloud the confidence people might have in the independence of the data.""74 In April 1999, Dr. Forgione found out that the White House would not re-nominate him to be Commissioner, despite the Secretary's attempts to intervene. In the words of the Chairman of the NCES advisory board, ""There's no question that his departure is a great loss to the agency...[h]e's been an effective and popular spokesperson for education statistics.""75 At the May Subcommittee hearing, Dr. Forgione asked Congress to insulate NCES from any potential political infringements:  72 73 74 75  Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, ""Gore Scolded on Test Scores Meeting,"" Los Angeles Times, March 23, 1999.

Crossroads 2000 23   I would ask you and the Chairman to consider as you are looking at the reauthorization of my agency presently, to think about putting protections that would institutionalize this relationship so that the boundaries are very clear and it will not lead to these awkward solutions. Education statistics must be trustworthy in order to be of any value. The nation needs accurate information about student performance, not political spin. If NAGB and NCES policies are so easily set aside to advance the interests of the Administration, what assurances do the American people and Congress have that such incursions do not affect the trustworthiness of all research and statistics released by the Department? Regardless of which party is in power, statistics gathering should remain separate and independent from political interests. CONCLUSION It is clear that the Department of Education has not been successfully transformed into a high performance organization during the 1990s. Federal programs are not carried out effectively, and agency mismanagement wastes federal dollars that should be reaching schools and classrooms. The federal role in education continues to place a burden on states and school districts. We must protect the Nation's education resources and spend them wisely. During the 106th Congress, the Subcommittee has had the opportunity to continue to look beyond the crossroads  toward states, districts, and schools that have emerged over the last two decades as shining examples of excellence, fighting against bureaucratization of education at the in order to produce results. How have they achieved excellence? By implementing policies based on putting student performance first. We will now look at examples what the Subcommittee found at the state, district and school level down the ""road to excellence"", and we examine how the federal government can assist in those efforts.  Crossroads 2000 24   PART II: HOW DO WE REACH EXCELLENCE FROM HERE? ""DE-MANDATING"" SCHOOLS, SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND STATES The federal role in education needs to be reoriented to put student performance first. Over the last two years the Subcommittee has looked into how schools, school districts and states are being freed from mandates and requirements that get in the way of putting students first, holding six field hearings in 1999 and 2000 around the country, as well as several in Washington, D.C. Charter schools, school choice, state accountability programs, and federal flexibility legislation have all played an important role in making education more performance based at the school, school district and state level. FLEXIBILITY FOR SCHOOLS: Charter Schools Grant Flexibility To Put Children First In 1991, Minnesota's Governor Arne Carlson (R) enacted the first charter school law in the nation was enacted under. What started as just a trickle is now a tidal wave, with more than 1,484 charter schools in 36 states, including Washington, D.C.76 For almost a decade, the idea of granting freedom from process requirements and regulations in exchange for accountability for producing results has swept many parts of the country and has inspired numerous education reforms at the state and federal level. Charter schools have not only significantly changed the landscape of education in America, they have served as a model for lifting mandates on school districts and states: innovations like charter districts and Gov. Jeb Bush's A+ Education Plan in Florida, and federal legislation such as the Straight A's Act (H.R. 2300), Ed-Flex Partnership Act (P.L. 106-25), as well as other flexibility provisions. Flexibility with Accountability Leads to $61,000 Surplus in First Year of Charter School In March of 2000 the Subcommittee visited Temple Terrace, Florida, just outside of Tampa. The Terrace Community School (TCS), a charter junior high school, hosted the hearing. The Terrace Community School has excelled by expecting its students to meet high standards, and by using its resources creatively to address the needs of its students. Each day students focus on four core academic courses: math, English, science and history. In addition, they study Latin and Spanish, and are required to reserve two hours a day for homework. The head of the school, David Lourie, told the Subcommittee that the school's achievements were a direct result of the freedom and accountability that come with being a charter school. These freedoms have led to important innovations, which have contributed to the success of the students in the school. Terrace Community School operates all expenses, including textbooks, supplies, and utilities, transportation and payroll. Yet with a $61,000 surplus! How did the school 76  with less than $4,000 per child. This must pay for equipment, lease payments, building maintenance despite those severe constraints, they ended the year accomplish this?

Crossroads 2000 25   processes that constrain non-charter schools, Mr. Lourie could decide how to run the school and seek out the most cost effective means available to them. The school, among other things,     purchased used and refurbished textbooks, saving thousands of dollars; solicited donations from members of the community to avoid spending large amounts on desks, tables, chairs, and bookshelves; was painted by parents, teachers, and students on weekends; enlisted the expertise of parents for many professional and technical services, including computer set-up and repair.  As a result of these efforts, in one summer, and for only $3,000, the school was able to set up a computer lab consisting of 22 networked computers, all connected to the Internet. Mr. Lourie said they were able to accomplish so much with so little because, ""we enjoy the fiscal freedom to spend our funds on only those goods and services that will benefit the students and teachers."" "" We promised to deliver a product in our charter application and our survival depends upon our delivering that promise. If we don't, we should be closed."" 77 - David Lourie, Terrace Community School Accountability also comes in the form of trouble attracting students to its program, nor applications for the 1999-2000 school year, and their first year.

Eric Mahmoud, Harvest Preparatory School Accountability to parents for results led one Minneapolis charter school to seek out the most effective curriculum available in order to best help its students. Harvest Preparatory School is a Minneapolis charter school that has seen tremendous achievement gains over the last few years. It serves 350 children from kindergarten through 6th grade, and 200 children are on the waiting list. Ninety-nine percent of the students are African-American, 63 percent are low income, and 65 percent come from single-parent families. The Subcommittee heard from Eric Mahmoud, head of the Harvest Preparatory School in Minneapolis, Minnesota, at a hearing on June 6, 2000. Testimony of David Lourie, Hearing on ""Putting Performance First: Academic Accountability and School Choice in Florida,"" Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Temple Terrace, Florida, March 27, 2000. 77  Crossroads 2000 26   In 1994, Mr. Mahmoud began to look around the country for models of successful schools, and found Wesley Elementary in Houston, Texas, which was also highlighted in the first Education at a Crossroads.78 Wesley Elementary uses a research based curriculum model known as Direct Instruction (DI), and despite the poverty of most of the children in the school, the students were performing at two and three grade levels above their actual grade. Based on these results, Mr. Mahmoud decided to implement DI at his school, which has been in place for five years. Mr. Mahmoud described for the Subcommittee the stunning results of this curriculum in his school: Since 1995 we've used Direct Instruction in our school, and we've had tremendous success. Our first year after using Direct Instruction our [kindergartners] went from 53 percent in reading on the reading comprehension tests for the California Achievement Test to 85 percent. Our second graders went from 49 percent to 71 percent. Just last year we took the Minnesota basic skills test. Our third and fifth graders, 93 percent of our third and fifth graders scored at or above grade level in reading, so we've had tremendous success using this instructional approach. Harvest Prep is also successfully using the Core Knowledge curriculum to teach geography and history.79 The school ranks in the top five percent of public elementary schools in the Minneapolis area. Its second grade African American students were outscoring white students in Minneapolis after the first year of using Direct Instruction. By putting the unique needs of its students first, this Minneapolis charter school has seen children that others would not expect to excel make achievement gains. Their flexibility and direct accountability to parents helped to bring this about. Building on Success: How to Empower and Expand Charter Schools Because charter schools are experiencing such tremendous growth and success around the country, it is important that all levels of government do as much as possible to empower them. In order to examine this issue more closely, on March 3, 2000, the Subcommittee held a hearing in Washington on the successes of charter schools and the challenges facing them today. The hearing highlighted several areas where charters will need assistance in the near future in order to expand. Present as witnesses were:   Irasema Salcido, principal of the Cesar Chavez Public Policy High School in Washington, D.C. and charter school advocate; Irene Sumida, Director of Instruction at Fenton Charter School in Lake View Terrace, California. The Subcommittee had heard from this school's principal, Mr. Lucente, at the hearing in Los Angeles on January 30, 1997;  78 79  See: Education at a Crossroads, p. 50. Ibid, p. 48.  Crossroads 2000 27      Kathryn Knox, Headmaster of Liberty Common Charter School, Ft. Collins, Colorado; and Jon Schroeder, Executive Director of the Charter Friends National Network, which is a network of organizations that provide assistance to charter schools around the nation.  In this hearing, as well as others where similar issues were addressed, the following were raised as being among the most significant issues facing charter schools today:  Start-up Funding: Each witness underscored the importance of continuing to increase the annual appropriation for charter schools as the number of charter schools grows, as Congress has done thus far. Increases in funding have allowed for more grants, and for the average-size grant to be larger. Since the 1998 reauthorization, larger grants will go to states with stronger charter laws, since stronger laws produce more schools.  Federal Role: The federal government needs to exercise caution and not tie strings to charter schools. As Mr. Schroeder testified to the Subcommittee, ""don't impose uniform, prescriptive national solutions on charters that discourage or impede their efforts to address these goals through a performance-based contract between each school and its sponsor.""80  Learn from schools, and should learn in all public according to Charters: It is important to document the growth and impact of charter their impact on students and districts. In addition, the federal government how charters can serve as an ""R&D program for changes and improvements schools in areas like special education, accountability and facilities funding,"" Mr. Schroeder.81   Facilities funding: The issue of facilities is a significant issue for charter schools, many of which start from scratch without a building or any capital to acquire one. Federal start-up funds are not intended to pay for facilities, and the per-pupil funding schools receive for operating expenses are not usually sufficient to make mortgage or rent payments. Consequently, charter schools are required to ""take money out of the classroom to put a roof over their heads.""82 Ms. Salcido described her situation to the Subcommittee: I don't think it is any longer appropriate to hear stories of schools opening in abandoned buildings, or in basements. Our school was forced to start in a basement, and I think that is not acceptable. We are public schools and we should be able to have the ability to have a building for our schools.

Alice Seagren cautioned the Subcommittee not to allow the federal government to get entangled in what is and should be an issue for states and school districts: ...I would be cautious of the federal government getting into programs for facilities, whether it's for charter schools or any public school. I think the states are the best ones to handle that situation....At the federal level I would stick to looking at start-up support for charter schools with the ability for the federal government to play a role in disseminating information, and helping other states examine the best charter school system. I would be a little bit cautious about going into a lot of federal programs for actual capital facilities for charters at this point. You could look at low-interest loans if you have a state that doesn't have a good bond rate.83 There is much that states can do to enable charter schools to need. States can learn from each other as they try different avenues issue. Colorado, for example, has been out in front on this, creating schools acquire buildings by creating designated entities with the ex exempt bonds on behalf of charter schools.84 acquire the facilities they of helping charters with this options to help their charter plicit authority to issue tax-   Charters Need Timely and Flexible Federal Dollars: In order to operate as flexibly as possible, charter schools would greatly benefit from relief from federal categorical program constraints. In addition, charters need to be treated fairly, and receive their fair share of federal grant dollars in a timely manner. According to Mr. Schroeder, There are... practical issues here involving getting a fair share of money on a per-pupil basis to individual school sites, especially from the federal level. It is a struggle at the state level as well. Perhaps some piloting there of the concept of a block grant that would cut through all of that red tape, take away the time that is needed for all of the preparation of grant proposals, and the administration of these individual categorical programs is something that could be tested in the charter environment with the extra accountability that exists there. Then, challenge States to do the same thing. Ms. Sumida expressed similar ideas in her testimony. Flexible federal dollars would provide relief for charter school operators and ultimately be better for the children:  Minnesota State Rep. Alice Seagren, responding to questions from Mr. Schaffer (R-CO), Field Hearing on ""School Choice and Parental Empowerment in Minnesota,"" Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Bloomington, Minnesota, June 6, 2000. 84 See testimony of Dr. Randy Everett, Liberty Common Charter School, Field Hearing on ""The Impact Of Federal Policies On State And Local Efforts To Reform Education,"" Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Lakewood, Colorado, January 25, 2000.  83  Crossroads 2000 29   The federal Government also could be of assistance with a block grant federal categorical funding model... Funding could still be distributed based on need, but this mechanism would relieve charter schools of the cumbersome and time-consuming documentation that is currently required of many of these programs. A block grant would free up more time to work on our primary objective, which is also the primary objective of all federal programs, to improve student achievement.  Opposition to Charter Schools: The opening of a charter school in a school district is not always celebrated on all fronts. Charter schools represent change, and could require the entire education system to change as a result. Too many adults have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo at the expense of the needs of children. Consequently, on top of the difficulties that come with opening a new school, charter schools are often required to fight political battles and divert resources from developing their school. Ms. Sumida and the Fenton Charter School had to fight their own battle with the local teachers union. Ultimately, the staff in her school chose to withdraw from the union and the school district, after paying dues for five years without receiving benefits. Ms. Sumida described in general for the Subcommittee the opposition that charters sometimes face: Finally, a challenge that many charter school developers must overcome is the sometimes hostile or uncooperative reaction of school districts, school boards and labor organizations, and institutions of the status quo, regarding the development of charters within their sphere of influence. Although there is little that can be done on the federal level, it should be noted that strong federal support of charter schools and the continued bipartisan support from the President on down, will continue to gradually change the attitude of those who may currently impede the development of charter schools. Congress can best help charters in conquering opposition by maintaining its strong support for charter schools through federal start-up funds and by protecting these schools from federal entanglement and bureaucracy.  Monitoring and Accountability: Many school districts and states around struggling to determine how to best monitor charter schools without interf success  how to trust, but verify, their results. Ms. Salcido underscored of not creating a local charter school bureaucracy that interferes with their the country are ering with their the importance success.  ...my hope is that as we grow and become permanent parts of the educational system, we are not going to be adding agencies and places to report and write reports just for the sake of reporting. I think it is very important that we keep in mind that we don't want to build any more bureaucracy. Crossroads 2000 30   How To Ensure Charters Will Fail At the Subcommittee's hearing in Florida, charter school principal Mr. Lourie eloquently described what would ultimately cause a charter school to fail: I believe that charter schools will fail for one of three reasons: (1) they are compelled to act like traditional public schools through local district pressure and regulation; (2) they do not deliver on their educational promises, or (3) they forget their responsibility to the public system as a whole. It is our duty to make other schools better, be that through sharing innovative programs or competing for students. If a local school principal looks at our program, sees value in what we offer, and borrows an idea or two, that is great. If a local school official looks at our school and feels threatened, that is great, too...both of those scenarios will make their schools better, and that is all that matters. If everyone involved in education at the local level puts students and their achievement first, charter schools can help bring about a higher quality education for all children, no matter where they attend school. And doing that, not ensuring process compliance, is true equity in education.  Crossroads 2000 31   Towards a More Perfect Union: How One School Resigned from Their Union and School District Chairman Hoekstra: Why did your teachers and the administrators have to leave the union in the L.A. school district? Ms. Sumida. ...[T]he teachers union had negotiated within the union contract that we in the charter school would take a leave of absence for 5 years. When the charter was up for renewal at the end of 5 years, we had to make a choice whether to resign from the school district or leave the charter school. The charter school leave could not be extended. It was something that the union and the school district had negotiated without charter schools. Our teachers were very involved in this process when they heard they actually had to resign. When they read it in the union contract, I don't think that they believed that it would really happen. When the 5 years came up, they attended union meetings, because we had been paying dues and everyone was paying dues. Even those teachers who were hired as just Fenton employees, and were not employees of Los Angeles unified school district, and who were not members of the teachers union per se, had to pay agency fees. As soon as we hired them, money was taken and it had to be sent to the teachers union. So there was a group that was not a member of the teachers union paying dues and not represented at all, and then another group that were members of the union and on leave from the school district. When our 5 years was up, they negotiated and the union told us that we could get a one-year extension and leave our charter as is, but there were things that [they] wanted to clean up. After 5 years we had learned a great deal and we unacceptable. It was a good time for us as well, becaus and staff member (and there were 170) had to decide if to take that chance. I had over 25 years of seniority with district. Should I take that chance and leave and bet on back to the school district? All but a handful resigned. felt that was e every teacher they were going the school Fenton or go  --Hearing on Charter Schools: Successes and Challenges, March 3, 2000.  Crossroads 2000 32   FLEXIBILITY  FOR SCHOOL  DISTRICTS  Building on the principle underlying charter schools, granting flexibility in exchange for a higher level of accountability has been implemented at the school district level in several states, including Chicago and Florida, and is also inspiring new ideas that address how to improve school districts and expand choice and competition. Mandate Relief Yields Results in Chicago Public School District ""By raising expectations, increasing flexibility and accountability, and shaking things up, they are improving the public schools - and, in so doing, improving the lives of Chicago's children. We should learn from the progress being made here, and we should replicate the common-sense reforms that have been undertaken. I believed, and once said, that Chicago's public schools were `the worst in the nation.' Happily for the people of Chicago, this is no longer the case."" 85-Dr. William Bennett, former Secretary of Education The Chicago Public Schools district (CPS) was one of the first districts to establish a ""charter-type"" relationship with the state educational agency. The city has recently seen tremendous results under a regime of increased accountability for results and freedom from certain state mandates and regulations. On April 19, 1999 the Subcommittee visited Chicago with former Secretary of Education William Bennett, in order to highlight the progress Chicago has made since Dr. Bennett visited the city as Secretary ten years ago. Chicago was also where the first Education at a Crossroads hearing was held in 1995. Flexibility in state funding has enabled Chicago Public Schools to balance its budget for the last four years and to negotiate two four-year contracts with their teachers. It has allowed them to create after-school and summer school programs for students needing extra help in reading and math, to expand preschool programs, and to create new opportunities for gifted students. All these changes have benefited their students, but especially students from lowincome families, underachieving students, students with limited English proficiency, and students with disabilities. On January 28, 1999, Gery Chico, the President of the Chicago School Reform Board of Trustees, testified before the Committee and described the freedom the Board was granted and the standards it had to meet: The Mayor gave us a clear mandate: improve student performan everyone in the system accountable for the results. He gave us a change curriculum, set new academic and disciplinary standards, disciplinary codes, and adjust virtually everything about the experience, from the length of the school day to the uniforms students ce and hold free hand to revise staff educational wear.86  Testimony of Dr. William Bennett, Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Chicago, Illinois, April 19, 1999.

Attendance has improved, and enrollment continues to rise as people once more choose the public schools over other options. But according to Chicago Public Schools Superintendent Paul Vallas, there is still more to be done: ""With the federal government as a partner, not a puppet master pulling strings, the Chicago Public Schools can do even more."" 87 Superintendent Vallas also expressed his desire for increased flexibility in federal funding: Simply put, what we want is greater flexibility in the use of federal funds coupled with greater accountability for achieving the desired results. We in Chicago, for example, would be delighted to enter into a contract with the Department of Education, specifying what we would achieve with our students, and with selected groups of students. And we would work diligently to fulfill  and exceed  the terms of such a contract. We would be held accountable for the result.88 Gery Chico expressed similar ideas in his testimony before the Committee: Mayor Daley and I believe that what works for one school system may not necessarily work for others. While many school systems share similar problems, the solutions need to be carefully tailored to match the specific needs and capabilities of each community. With that in mind, I strongly urge the federal government to be as flexible as possible with existing as well as new funds. Let local governments decide how best to spend the money and then hold us accountable for results.89 % of Students at or Above National Norms  Testimony of Paul Vallas, Superintendent of Chicago Public Schools, Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Committee on Education and the Workforce, Chicago, Illinois, April 19, 1999. 88 Ibid. 89 Mr. Chico testimony, January 28, 1999.  87  Crossroads 2000 34   The testimony of Superintendent Vallas and Mr. Chico demonstrates the need not only for the federal government to grant flexibility, but also for States to grant flexibility as well, so that school districts can tailor their programs as closely as possible to the needs of their students. Narrowing Achievement Gaps in Texas with Flexibility and Accountability In addition to Illinois granting Chicago a certain amount of flexibility to produce better results, several other states have taken steps to provide flexibility to local school districts. Texas has used its status as an ""Ed-Flex"" state to enhance its statewide accountability system: rather than requiring each individual district to separately apply for common-sense flexibility, it waived certain federal requirements for all districts in the state. Over the last decade, Texas has Texas Students Outpace U.S. demonstrated how increased flexibility in Math Achivement Gains within the context of increased accountability for performance can NAEP 8th Grade Math Test produce achievement gains for 229 disadvantaged students. Based on test 230 scores over the last few years, Texas has accelerated the rate of learning for 225 222 disadvantaged students more than any 218 21 8 220 other state in the country. Houston and Fort Worth top the nation in their 215 success in narrowing achievement 90 gaps. The state ensures that no 210 students are left behind by requiring U.S . TX that all children meet high standards. Under the Texas accountability system, 1992 1996 schools are evaluated based on how well all groups of children are performing, not just on a school's average. Students are tested every year in every grade. This helps ensure that children do not fall through the cracks of the education system and that sufficient attention is devoted to ensuring that all children succeed. In exchange, the state grants school districts the freedom to pick the reforms they believe best suit their needs, and either rewards or sanctions them based on their performance. As one of the first additional flexibility tool. Title I funds to schools on Federal waivers for the states to become an ""Ed-Flex"" state, Texas has had at its disposal an It has effectively given its school districts the flexibility to allocate the basis of need.

For U.S. Texas the period 1996-1998, Texas achieved this goal for all students and for all groups of students, including African American, Hispanic, and economically disadvantaged students. Greater flexibility at the school level appears to be producing real results, both on the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).92 It is significant that these gains show up in both assessments, further validating Texas' progress as real and not just the result of students learning to take the TAAS test over time. A recent RAND Corporation study has also confirmed the reality of Texas' achievement gains, especially in math. In a cross-state comparison of achievement by students from similar families Texas led the nation in academic gains. The study found that ""although the two states are close demographic cousins, Texas students, on average, scored 11 percentile points higher on NAEP math and reading tests than their California counterparts. In fact, the Texans performed well with respect to most states.""93 Achievement Gains  Texas finished in the top ten, along with states such as Maine, North Dakota, and Wisconsin, in the 1996 NAEP fourth-grade math assessment. Whites and African Americans in Texas had the highest scores in the nation, and Latinos in Texas had the second highest scores in the nation.  Between 1992 and 1996, the percentage of Texas fourth-graders achieving at or above the NAEP's ""proficient"" level in math rose from 15 to 25 percent far outstripping Testimony of Madeleine Draeger Manigold, Coordinator of State and Federal Waivers, Texas Education Agency, Hearing on ""Putting Performance First: Hearing on ""Ed-Flex"" and its Role in Improving Student Performance and Reducing Bureaucracy,"" Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth and Families on February 25, 1999. 92 Jay Greene, ""The Texas School Miracle is for Real,"" City Journal, Summer 2000. 93 David Grissmer, Ann Flanagan, Jennifer Kawata, Stephanie Williamson, Improving Student Achievement: What State NAEP Scores Tell Us, RAND, July 2000, http://www.rand.org/centers/education/pubsnav.html. 91  Percentile Increase  Crossroads 2000 36   improvements nationwide. The share of Texas children scoring below the ""basic"" level in math fell from 44 to 31 percent during the same period.  From 1992-1996, African-American fourth graders in Texas made the largest gains in math in the nation. Fourth grade Latinos made the second largest gains in the nation.  In reading, the percentage of Texas fourth-graders achieving ""at or above proficient"" on the NAEP test increased from 28 to 31 percent from 1992 to 1998. The percent of students scoring below basic dropped from 43 to 37 percent.  The percentage of Texas 3rd graders passing the state reading test increased by 13 percent in two years. For low-income third graders, the passing rate improved by nearly 20 percent.  Texas students passing all parts of the state skills test (TAAS) has increased by 51 percent from 1994 to 2000. The number of both minority students and economically disadvantaged students passing TAAS increased by 89 percent. Texas has demonstrated that by shining light on how all categories of students perform, and not just the average student, schools monitor more closely the education of poor and minority students. Ensuring that the public knows how well a school is performing has been a successful accountability measure in Texas. The state can grant flexibility to local districts because it knows that they will be held accountable for the results. On the Cutting Edge of Accountability in Florida In addition to Texas efforts to dramatically increase accountability for student performance down to the school level, Florida has also implemented cutting edge reforms. Florida is the first state to offer state-paid tuition scholarships to children in failing public schools so that they may attend a better-performing public, private, or religious school of choice. It has also enacted a ""charter district"" pilot program to specifically grant mandate relief to school districts that agree to meet a higher level of accountability. These initiatives were enacted as part of Governor Jeb Bush and Lt. Gov. Brogan's ""A+ Plan,"" approved by the Florida legislature on April 28, 1999. The plan challenges the status quo by requiring everyone in the public school system to do better. The Subcommittee heard about Florida's efforts to improve education achievement from Commissioner of Education Tom Gallagher at the March 27, 2000 hearing in Temple Terrace, Florida. Central to Florida's accountability system are school ""report cards."" Based on standardized test scores (the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test), schools are assigned a grade between A and F based on how well they meet state standards for reading, math and writing. Schools receiving A's have to demonstrate that their student absences, suspensions, and dropout rates fell below state averages. Schools that improve scores are rewarded with up to $100 per pupil. Crossroads 2000 37   Freeing Disadvantaged Students from Failing Schools Students attending schools receiving a grade of F for two consecutive years are able to transfer either to a higher-scoring public school, or to a private or parochial school, by using an opportunity scholarship worth up to $4,000 a year. Students in two schools were eligible for scholarships in the fall of 1999, the only schools to receive Fs two years in a row. Both of these schools are elementary schools in Pensacola, Florida. Parents of the 900 students attending A.A. Dixon and Bibbs Elementary schools had a decision to make: whether to exercise their option to receive an opportunity scholarship to a private school, transfer to a higher performing public school, or stay put. Ultimately, out of nearly 900 students, the parents of 53 students opted to send their children to private schools and the parents of 85 students chose to send their children to ""C"" or better public schools. Contrary to charges that these schools would be abandoned under the A+ Plan, ""D"" and ""F"" schools receive significant additional resources to help turn the schools around. Each school receiving an ""F"" received $25,000 for reading enhancement programs, in addition to top priority for all other federal and state grants distributed. In the two failing schools, there are now Saturday remedial courses and a school year that is 30 days longer. States and the district must take a second look at how resources are allocated to these schools in order to ensure they are better served. Commissioner Gallagher told the subcommittee that in order to help, ""funding from the federal government must come with as few restrictions as possible. Send the states money and hold them accountable, which is the same philosophy we are applying to the districts from the state level.""94 The NAACP, ACLU, Florida teachers unions, the American Jewish Congress, and People for the American Way filed a lawsuit against the scholarship plan claiming that the program violates both Florida's constitution and the U.S. Constitution. As a result of their suit, on March 14, 2000 Circuit Judge L. Ralph Smith Jr. ruled that Florida's school voucher law is unconstitutional because it violates a provision in the Florida Constitution that requires the state to provide students with a ""uniform...and high-quality system of free public schools."" The judge issued this ruling, even though the two Pensacola elementary schools were not providing a ""uniform and high quality education"" consistent with this standard. The 53 children attending private schools in Pensacola were able to finish the school year. However, the state can take no other action to implement the law, according to the ruling. Florida has filed an appeal in what will likely be a long and drawn out fight to offer school choice to students in Florida. In the meantime, private citizens have committed to covering the tuition of the children in private schools. One of the recipients of the Florida scholarships testified at the Subcommittee's hearing in Florida. Tracey Richardson told the Committee that she ""felt like she won the lottery"" when her daughter was chosen to participate in the scholarship program. Her daughter Kahlilah was  Testimony of Commissioner Gallagher, Field Hearing on ""Putting Performance First: Academic Accountability and School Choice in Florida,"" Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Temple Terrace, Florida, March 27, 2000.  94  Crossroads 2000 38   able to transfer out of her failing public school and attend a local Montessori school with the scholarship. Ms. Richardson told the Subcommittee, in the six months that she's been there, the greatest single improvement in my daughter's education is her spirit: instead of frustration and despair, I see hope and excitement in her eyes...This has been so good for my daughter that she now looks forward to school in the mornings. This is a complete change from her attitude when she went to a public school... [she] recently joined the chess club and the Girl Scouts. Now instead of having to deal with a failing school I am faced with a new problem: Khalilah wants to be involved with every program.95 Not only is Khalilah doing better in school, her mother is also free to decide where to send her to school. Freeing disadvantaged students from failing schools empowers parents, no longer restricting their choices in order to protect the ""system"" and enforce arbitrary district boundaries. Failing Schools Successful in Improving Scores Contrary to the claims of those who charged that the A+ Plan would hurt the ability of failing schools to improve, all of the schools that had earned failing grades in 1999 raised their marks by at least one grade. By raising their grades, the schools were no longer in the ""failing"" category and their students would not be eligible to transfer out of the school to other public or private schools. According to state education officials, 20 percent of elementary schools moved up at least two grade levels, while 30 percent moved up one grade level. Despite these improvements, however, four schools received failing grades for the first time and two of the original 78 failing schools have since closed.96 In addition, parents who were looking forward to being able to provide their children with an improved educational setting will not have that option. The success of Florida's choice program illustrates the importance of putting student performance first. As Ms. Carrin from the Florida Department of Education was quoted in Education Week, ""the bottom line was to increase student performance, not to have a voucher program.""97 Thus far, Florida's efforts are promising. ""Getting out of the Way"" of Success: Charter Districts in Florida Republican Governor Jeb Bush has also enacted a pilot program to test the concept of ""charter districts."" The first districts to receive this status submitted their applications last fall to the State Board of Education. The purpose of this pilot program is to give public school districts the flexibility to improve student achievement and school management without the usual constraints placed upon them by the state. A charter school district in Florida is a school district that has submitted a charter proposal, which exchanges statutory and rule exemption for an Testimony of Tracy Richardson, Field Hearing on ""Putting Performance First: Academic Accountability and School Choice in Florida,"" Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Temple Terrace, Florida, March 27, 2000. 96 Jessica L. Sandham, ""Vouchers Stall as Florida Schools Up Their Scores,"" Education Week, July 12, 2000. 97 Ibid. 95  Crossroads 2000 39   agreement to meet performance goals in the proposal. The charter school district can be chartered for 3 years, at the end of which their performance will be evaluated. At the March 27, 2000 hearing in Temple Terrace, Florida, Dr. Lennard, Superintendent of Sarasota Public Schools in Florida described for the Subcommittee how the charter district proposal works: Basically, our plan asks for relief from more than 800 pages of state statutes, with the exception of those dealing with health, safety and equity issues. With this new freedom, our district and, in turn, our schools will have the opportunity to create innovative programs to meet the needs of their specific student population...The changes to the way our school system will operate as a charter district will significantly benefit our children's achievement because decisions affecting their education will be made by those closest to the students--their teachers and parents. Our charter district proposal creates a redesigned governance system that places schools, not the district, as the focal point for educational improvement....Just as the charter district legislation envisions Tallahassee ""getting out of the way"" of charter districts, Sarasota envisions using this legislation to ""get out of the way"" of creative, successful schools. Tallahassee will continue to monitor the progress of our charter district and hold us to exacting outcomes and standards. Likewise, the School Board will monitor the progress of all schools and will hold them to similar exacting standards of performance.98 Their proposal allows schools to choose whether they'll receive their funding in block grants and be held to higher standards, or stick with the current system that allocates their funding in categorical grants. Successful schools receive financial rewards that have few strings attached; schools in need of improvement receive additional funds that require district approval for how they are spent. The charter district concept in Sarasota County also gives employees in the central support services departments the ability to vote on becoming an enterprise service unit. With that status they can market their services to organizations outside the school district and thus compete in the open market and possibly bring in additional revenue. What remains to be seen about ""charter districts"" is whether they will produce any change at the school level in how they are governed, staffed, financed and operated. In addition, charter districts could be used as a means of slowing charter school growth, without providing the same level of flexibility and accountability at the school level that traditional charters provide for individual schools. While charter districts in Florida may result in streamlined bureaucracy at the district level, and may be an effective way of making government more performance oriented, they are not the same concept as charter schools, despite the fact that these districts are described as ""charter"" districts. In order to protect charter schools, it important to keep the lines 98  Testimony of Dr. Lennard, Field Hearing, Temple Terrace, Florida, March 27, 2000  Crossroads 2000 40   that separate them from traditional schools distinct so that they can maintain their unique characteristics and freedoms that have made them so successful. Charter Districts: School Districts of the Future? Other groups representing mainstream education are looking to the charter model to improve school districts. In November 1999, the Denver-based, non-partisan Education Commission of the States (ECS) released a major report outlining two approaches to school governance that States could use to turn around underachieving schools and districts. Much like charter schools, both approaches outlined in the Governing America's Schools initiative decentralize authority to the school level, give more options to parents, and allow taxpayer dollars to follow students to the publicly funded schools of their choice. The Subcommittee heard about this report from Tom Jandris, a representative of ECS, at a hearing held in Lakewood, Colorado in January of 2000. As the success of charter schools has demonstrated, school governance is an important issue when it comes to accountability for results. Mr. Jandris described its importance in this way: Governance arrangements establish the rules of the game. They determine, through statutes, collective bargaining and other legal agreements, regulations and court rulings, who is responsible and accountable for what within a system.... Without good governance, good schools are the exception, not the rule.99 The first governance approach developed by the National Commission on Governing America's Schools accelerates the promising changes already under way, moving from the traditional one-size-fits-all ""school system to a more dynamic, diversified and high-performing system of schools.""100 It involves strong state and district-level standards, school choice, and decentralized budgeting. Districts would continue to hire superintendents and principals, bargain with unions, and hold schools accountable for results, but individual schools would write their own budgets based on per-pupil funding, hire and fire teachers, and allocate their own resources.101 The second approach goes further, significantly redefining the roles, responsibilities and interrelationship of states, districts, schools, communities, and public and private organizations. It describes a ""charter district"" that functions as a contractor, and where schools are run by independent entities. Teachers, principals, parents and others would have considerable freedom to design, create and operate schools, limited only by state and federal laws and the terms of their contract with the district. Schools would negotiate salaries and benefits with teachers and principals, set standards, write curricula, and borrow and spend public funds at their own discretion. Districts would distribute money, recruit staff members, and provide the public with Testimony of Tom Jandris, Field Hearing on ""The Impact of Federal Policies on State and Local Efforts to Reform Education,"" Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations Lakewood, Colorado, January 25, 2000. 100 Ibid. 101 Jessica Sandham, ""ECS Report Tackles K-12 Governance,"" Education Week, November 10, 1999. 99  Crossroads 2000 41   information about the schools. School boards would oversee the schools, and would be empowered to shut down schools not meeting the terms of their charters. This option would have the potential to significantly enhance the power of local school boards, since they would be freed to hire contractors and implement their own policies.102 The group that produced the Governing America's Schools study included current and former state and local school board members, current and former state and local superintendents, current and former teachers, for-profit education and charter school representatives, governors, business leaders, education, social services and public-sector reformers, a state legislator, and a teachers' union leader. It is significant that such a broad range of views could come to an agreement that school districts and schools should be given more freedom in order to produce better results for children, and perhaps is an indication that such reforms are not as far away as one might think.  102  Ibid.  Crossroads 2000 42   FLEXIBILITY  FOR STATES:  STREAM  LINING  FEDERA  L REQUIREMENTS  During the 106th Congress, the House took several steps to reduce the burden of federal requirements on States and school districts, and to put student performance first. On April 27, 1999, President Clinton signed into law the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999, P.L. 106-25. The House took flexibility even farther by passing H.R. 2300, the Academic Achievement for All Act on October 21, 1999. Ed-Flex: Useful, But Not Sufficient to Address the Flexibility Needs of the States ""...the ""Ed Flex"" legislation that recently passed conference committee is a welcome start at lightening the regulatory burden, but we need to keep pushing. In fact, we need to push a lot further."" 103--former Secretary of Education William Bennett  The House passed H.R. 800, the Education Flexibility Partnership Act, which was signed into law on April 27, 1999. This bill removed the 12 state limit on participants in the ""Ed-Flex"" program, and strengthened accountability. Ed-Flex allows states to waive certain federal program requirements for local school districts. Previously school districts could only apply to the U.S. Secretary of Education for such waivers. Ed-Flex is designed to make federal categorical programs work better by allowing school districts to tailor them in certain ways so they more effectively meet the unique needs of students. The waivers can accomplish this by removing certain program requirements that are barriers to reform at the local level. It does not allow districts to change the purpose of federal programs, shift funds or consolidate programs. The expansion of Ed-Flex is an important step towards increasing flexibility at the local level. For some States, Ed-Flex is adequate for their flexibility needs. Other States, however, are ready for additional flexibility and accountability. According to a U.S. General Accounting Office report on Ed-Flex, Ed-Flex's narrowly structured waivers generally do not address many school districts' major concerns. GAO found that, in general, school districts' concerns did not [F]ocus on any single program or requirements; instead, they extended across several broad areas...Ed-Flex...waivers do not address these areas of concern because waivers are limited to a specific set of programs and requirements, and because districts' major concerns often lie outside the scope of the waiver authority.104 A separate GAO report found that Ed-Flex is limited because it does not ""reduce districts' financial obligations nor provide additional federal dollars""; and, because the flexibility is limited to specific programs, the districts' ""ability to reduce administrative effort and streamline procedures is also limited.""105 Additionally, GAO stated in testimony submitted to the Subcommittee, 103 104  Testimony of Dr. William Bennett, Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, April 19, 1999. U.S. General Accounting Office, Elementary and Secondary Education: Ed-Flex States Vary in Implementation of Waiver Process, HEHS-99-17, November 1998, p 14. 105 U.S. General Accounting Office, Elementary and Secondary Education: Flexibility Initiatives Do Not Address Districts' Key Concerns About Federal Requirements, HEHS-98-232, November 1998, p.8.   rather than simplifying the necessary information on federal requirements, these flexibility initiatives actually expand the amount of information school district officials need...because these initiatives are program-specific, and each applies to a different set of programs, district officials need detailed information on each provision  information that is often difficult to find.106 In order to put student performance first, those states and school districts on the cutting edge of reform, and with a proven track record of improving student achievement, should be granted the greatest possible flexibility to educate their students. If a state has demonstrated that it is effectively improving student achievement, the federal government should empower those efforts and not require the implementation of federal one-size-fits all programs. In Texas, for example, the statewide accountability system has led to significant achievement gains. Texas, and other states that are producing results, should not be required to implement a federal program that is in many ways an imperfect attempt to reproduce their state's own effective education policy: they should be freed from constraining federal requirements and evaluated by the public in terms of the success of their students. More Freedom, More Accountability: The Academic Achievement for All Act The Academic Achievement for All Act (Straight A's) is also similar to the concept of charter schools: grant freedom from regulations and process requirements in exchange for accountability for producing results. Under Straight A's, Washington assumes the role of shareholder, not CEO, of the nation's education enterprise. Rather than micromanaging the dayto-day uses of federal money, it lets States manage their schools and dollars as they see fit in return for an agreed upon return on the federal investment. This has been demonstrated to be effective in charter schools, in states like Texas, and in cities like Chicago, where flexibility to innovate combined with high standards of achievement has produced significant gains in achievement. The purpose of Straight A's is to untie the hands of those States that have their accountability systems in place, in exchange for required results. It goes beyond Ed-Flex to more effectively address the flexibility needs of the States. States have the option of participating in Straight A's or staying with the current arrangement of separate categorical funding streams. Unlike many recent attempts by Congress to place accountability requirements into federal programs such as Title I, accountability in Straight A's is been coupled with fiscal and legal autonomy and flexibility, which allows reforms to be implemented quickly and efficiently at the state and local level. Providing states with flexibility to innovate is an important way to learn what works best in education. According to a recent study by the RAND Corporation, ""[h]aving 50 states take  106  U.S. General Accounting Office, Testimony submitted to the Committee on Education and the Workforce, Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Elementary and Secondary Education: Flexibility Initiatives Do Not Address Districts' Key Concerns About Federal Requirements, T-HEHES-00-51, January 25, 2000, p.9.  Crossroads 2000 44   different approaches to education can provide a powerful advantage in the long run if research and evaluation can identify what works and what does not.""107 Granting States and localities the flexibility to consolidate federal funding streams is not without precedent in federal law. Several programs and agencies have recognized the value of accountability based on performance, not compliance. Some examples:  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) allows States to enter into performance contracts, where States agree to meet certain environmental targets in exchange for receiving their grant money in the form of a consolidated grant. Territories and insular areas are allowed under current law to receive their federal grants from multiple agencies in one grant to be used for purposes determined by the insular area. Schoolwide projects under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 allow schools to combine all of their federal dollars for the purpose of improving the quality of the entire school and increasing student performance. Performance Partnership Grants are used in grants for substance abuse prevention and treatment services administered by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SMHSA).108 In recent years Congress has allowed States to submit one consolidated application for most federal education funds, and to consolidate administrative set-asides for those programs at the state and local level.          GAO has even recommended that the U.S. Department of Education consider ""Performance Partnership Grants"" (PPG) as a way giving states more control over the use of federal dollars, ""while encouraging them to accept greater accountability for results.""109 States and School Districts Support Straight A's The Committee has heard testimony from several individuals representing these states and cities who have asked Congress to grant them the freedom to have a more performancebased relationship with the U.S. Department of Education: Brett Shundler, the Mayor of Jersey City, NJ, testified before the Committee on May 20, 1999: 107  David Grissmer, Ann Flanagan, Jennifer Kawata, Stephanie Williamson, Improving Student Achievement: What State NAEP Scores Tell Us, RAND, July 2000, p. xxxvi. 108 See GAO, Substance Abuse and Mental Health: Reauthorization Issues Facing the Substance Abuse and mental Health Services Administration, GAO/T-HEHS-97-135, May 22, 1997. 109 GAO, Federal Education Funding: Multiple Programs and Lack of Data Raise Efficiency and Effectiveness Concerns, GAO/T-HEHS-98-46, November 1997.  Crossroads 2000 45   The sixty programs comprising the Elementary and Secondary Education Act are well intentioned. However, many of them have little to do with the reality of urban classrooms. I would...strongly recommend that you give the option of the Straight A's Act flexibility to large school districts in any States which do not choose to participate [in Straight A's]. The problems and needs of a large urban district can be quite different and are even at odds with those of the surrounding state. Governor Jeb Bush of Florida voiced his support of Straight A's in a House Budget Committee hearing on September 23, 1999: Without legislation like the Straight A's Act, Florida will not be able to use federal funds to fully support our reform efforts. But with the Straight A's Act, Florida's school districts could use federal funds to support their accountability-driven efforts in the manner they believe best to address their local solutions, whether those solutions are more technology, smaller class sizes, a longer school year, or individual tutoring...I have come here to offer you more accountability from Florida, in exchange for more flexibility. We can increase the impact that federal dollars will have on student learning in our state, if we are provided with more freedom and less one-size-fits-all regulations from the federal government. In her testimony before the Budget Committee's Education Task Force, Ms. Scalfani of the Houston School District recommended that more federal dollars be allocated to school districts with the flexibility that they have under the Innovative Education Program Strategies (Title VI) block grant, which is similar in the flexibility Straight A's offers to States and school districts: The Title VI program stands in contrast to the Title I program. Title 6 makes a significant difference in the lives of over 212,000 students in Houston ISD and over 13,000 students in surrounding nonprofit private schools and neglected and delinquent facilities. The program provides on-going professional development to 15,000 teachers. Title VI provides services to ten local district reform programs and projects, as well as fifty-four nonprofit private schools and facilities within the Houston Independent School District's boundaries... Title 6 funds have provided a mechanism to influence and provide opportunities for advancement in nationally identified areas such as technology, readiness skills, parental involvement, curriculum, school improvement, higher order thinking skills, combating illiteracy, and increased professional development for teachers and parents. All Title 6 funded programs have been designed specifically to improve overall student achievement. ...As one compares the Title 1 and Title VI programs, it becomes clear that Title 6 is effective in raising student achievement without all of the compliance Crossroads 2000 46   requirements of Title 1. One can deduce from that that the time spent complying with Title 1 requirements could be better spent focusing on improving student achievement. Ms. Sclafani observed that if the federal government put student performance first, they would focus their efforts where students are not succeeding: If a particular district cannot demonstrate improved student achievement, the state would be required to audit the programs serving the specific students and place the district under a technical assistance requirement until results improve. Otherwise the district would be able to apply the funds to programs and not to staff completing forms to demonstrate compliance. If this option were in place, fewer dollars would need to be allocated to state departments of education and central offices, and more would go directly to student services. Straight A's has the potential of serving as the catalyst for significantly improving the federal investment in education by encouraging reform-minded States to continue their successes. Federal funds should be focused on helping children and their schools, not on preserving separate funding streams and maintaining separate categorical federal programs. If Straight A's is signed into law, all students, especially the disadvantaged students who were the focus of federal legislation in 1965, may finally receive effective instruction and be held to high standards.  Crossroads 2000 47   FLEXIBILITY  F OR  PARENTS  Putting performance first means empowering parents to make the best decisions about their child's education. The Subcommittee has continued to examine policies that accomplish this goal, which include education tax credits and deductions, as well as school choice. Using the Tax Code to Expand Choice in Education Many people believe using the tax code is the most direct way to empower parents because benefits are not filtered through government agencies and programs before reaching parents and students. Moreover, parents control where the money is spent, not the government. On June 6, 2000, the Subcommittee visited Minnesota to find out more about education tax credits and school choice initiatives in that state. Minnesota has led the nation in school choice by enacting the first charter school law, and significantly expanding a longstanding education tax credit: Since 1955 Minnesota has had an income tax deduction for education expenses: until it was expanded in 1997, taxpayers could deduct $1,000 for students in grades 7 to 12, and $650 for students in kindergarten through sixth grade. In 1983 Minnesota taxpayers challenged the constitutionality of the education expense deduction in Mueller v. Allen. The taxpayers claimed that the deduction violated the First Amendment because it amounted to an establishment of religion, since nearly all of the taxpayers using the deduction had children in parochial schools. In a five-to-four decision, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Minnesota statute giving tax deductions to parents for tuition and other costs incurred in educating their children at public and private schools. The court found that the deduction met all three parts of the Lemon test set forth in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 492 U.S. 602 (1971), since the deduction was one of many deductions available to Minnesota taxpayers.110 In addition, it met the requirements of the Lemon test because:    The deduction was available to parents of both public and nonpublic school children. Public funds became available only as a result of ""numerous, private choices of individual parents."" The financial benefits to parochial schools were minor.  In 1997, due to the efforts of former Governor Arne Carlson (R), the state legislature increased the deduction to $2,500 and $1,625. The legislation expanded the list of deductible expenses to include academic summer school and camps, tutoring, personal computer hardware, and educational software. It also gave families with annual incomes of $33,500 or less a refundable education tax credit of $1,000 per child, with a maximum of $2,000 per family. The tax credit applies to all items that qualify for the deduction except tuition. The legislation also expanded the Working Family Tax Credit, which provides an average tax credit increase of $200 to $350 for families making $29,000 or less. ""Income Tax Deductions and Credits for Public and Nonpublic Education in Minnesota,"" House Research Information Brief, Minnesota House of Representatives, November 1999. 110  Crossroads 2000 48   In 1999, the legislature further expanded the state's education tax credit by raising the household income limit for eligibility from $33,500 to $37,500, thus adding over 30,000 middleclass families to the program. This expansion included a gradual ""phase-out"" of the tax credit so that families would no longer be penalized for modest increases in their earnings. The 1999 legislation also ensured that all custodial parents are eligible for the tax credit and/or deduction. The state Department of Revenue reported that 38,500 low-income families claimed an education tax credit in 1998 (the first year it was available) and estimated that an additional 150,000 families benefited from the tax deduction. With most of the 1999 state income tax forms processed, the Department of Revenue reported that almost 55,000 families claimed the state's education tax credit during the second year that it was available, a 40 percent increase from 1998.111 What does this mean for the average taxpayer in Minnesota? The greatest tax bill reduction possible for the maximum $2,500 deduction is $200, which goes to taxpayers that itemize deductions and tend to have higher incomes. The estimated average benefit to families claiming the education tax credit is $369, thus providing larger benefits to those with the lowest incomes. The tax credit is only available to families with incomes under $33,500, and gradually phased out for incomes between $33,500 and $37,500.112 The Subcommittee heard from Morgan Brown from the Partnership for Choice in Education (PCE), an organization dedicated to informing parents of their education options. PCE has been instrumental in educating parents in Minnesota about the tax credits and deductions. During the hearing, Mr. Brown described in particular how low-income families were helped by this particular choice option, despite accusations that tax benefits such as this are really designed for the ""wealthy"": The bottom line is that every child in the state stands to benefit from the incentives the 1997 law provides for parents to become more involved in their children's education. Our organization has focused on helping low-income families use the tax credit and has already seen evidence that it is giving parents a greater sense of financial empowerment. Not only are many parents now exploring enrichment opportunities for their kids, but they are also reexamining their basic options and assumptions about where their children attend school on a daily basis. PCE believes that this, in turn, is fostering greater accountability and positive competition within the education system. The initial results for the education credit have been promising. In 1998, the first year the credit was available, almost 40,000 low-income families (one out of every five eligible) claimed a total of more than $14 million. The average amount claimed by these families was about $400 -- double what had been estimated  111  Rees and Garrett, School Choice 2000: What's Happening in the States, The Heritage Foundation, July 2000 update, http://www.heritage.org/schools/minnesota.html#6. 112 Op Cit, p.3.  Crossroads 2000 49   originally by the Department of Revenue. Moreover, families in all of Minnesota's 87 counties used the credit, demonstrating its statewide appeal. The early data for 1999 are even more encouraging [showing a 40 percent increase in the number of parents claiming the credit]... these figures clearly show that low-income parents are eager to make choices that meet their children's educational needs. Opponents of the tax credit, who claimed originally that economically disadvantaged families either wouldn't utilize additional choices or wouldn't be able to come up with money for education expenses, are being proven wrong.113 Despite these achievements, there are still improvements that need to be made to ensure that the neediest families receive as much assistance as possible. PCE supports taking steps to: (1) make the credit more user-friendly for low-income parents, (2) increase the income limit to make the credit more accessible to moderate-income families, and (3) allow eligible parents to claim the credit for non-public school tuition. Because of the need for political compromise to enact the tax deduction legislation, there is a discrepancy between the credit and deduction regarding private school tuition: low-income parents cannot receive a tax credit for tuition expenses. Consequently, low-income parents, for whom the deduction is of little or no use, cannot defray at least some tuition costs through the credit, while middle- and upper-income parents can do so through the deduction. Mr. Brown urged Congress to pass legislation similar to Minnesota's but without its inherent inequity regarding private school tuition expenses. I would strongly encourage you and other members of the Committee to pursue the passage of a federal education tax credit based on the Minnesota model. I also ask you to make sure it allows parents to spend the dollars returned to them on the widest possible range of educational opportunities.  Using Tax Credits to Create Opportunities for Low-Income Families in A Minnesota Public School District The Subcommittee heard from Superintendent Keith Dixon, of the Fairbault School District in Minnesota. Fairbualt created the ""Kinderlinks"" program, where students spend onehalf of their day with the kindergarten teacher, and the other half with a Kinderlinks teacher. His testimony provides an example of how low-income parents take advantage of the tax credit, and how school districts can help these parents to use the credit to benefit their children as much as possible. He also responds to concerns Mr. Kind (D-WI) raised earlier in the hearing about the  Testimony of Morgan Brown, Field Hearing on School Choice and Parental Empowerment in Minnesota, Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Bloomington, Minnesota, June 6, 2000.  113  Crossroads 2000 50   how practicality of a tax deduction or tax credit program for low-income families when many of them aren't going to benefit from it,.  In our state we fund a half-day-every-day program. And so what we did was say to parents ""We're going to offer an all-day option for you; We had about 60 percent of our families take advantage of that choice system... [w]e have certified staff in that program, so that a child is wit all day long and in essence attends all-day kindergarten in this program.  in essence a choice."" within our h a teacher  Now, the one thing I want to focus on, that I think Mr. Kind [(D-WI)] brought out, is what our biggest challenge was. This was to provide this opportunity for lowincome families, and I want to address that specifically. The way it's set up in Minnesota, in order to receive the tax credit you have to buy the service first. Most low-income families cannot pay the $1,000 to even be eligible to get the $1,000 back. So we worked it out with one of our local banks to lend the families the $1,000 at 6 percent simple interest. If they paid it back at the end of the year when their tax return was processed, the interest would be reduced to zero as a motivation to pay off the loan early. That's the way we set up the program. ...[T]he way [the tax credit is] set up, the money goes directly back to the family. Then the family goes in and pays off the loan. I can tell you, working with banks, that when they first looked at this proposal, they asked, ""Why should we do this? It sounds as if we make no money and the risk is very high."" And that is the truth in the way it's set up. It would have been much easier for banks if the families signed something that said, ""Once you fill out your tax return, the money goes directly back to pay off the loan."" But the way we made it work, and in some way in answer to your question, Mr. Kind, is the relationship we have with families. I think we overlook that in schools. ...Frankly, most of these families see all of our bureaucratic s don't care if it's school systems or social services or what it is. to do is work directly with those families. We process the them; they don't go to the bank. We made it very simple. We we help them fill out a set of worksheets to fill out their tax make sure they get them in. We do all the work with families. ystems as foreign. I What this allows us loan application for work with the bank; returns so that they  ...I think the key is how we as the institutions work with families themselves. I think that's been our focus. We've been very successful getting our money back. I think we've loaned out over the years we've participated probably $34,000. I believe in two years we've had one family that was a challenge to get the money back from, and frankly the bank decided to split the risk.114  114  Testimony of Superintendent Dixon, Field Hearing, Bloomington, Minnesota, June 6, 2000.  Crossroads 2000 51   One of the results of this program has been that for the first time families are establishing financial credit for the first time by taking out then paying them off. They are also setting up accounts with the banks Even though the financial incentives were not apparent to the banks customers as a result of their willingness to participate. The Larger Strategy: Provide Many Opportunities for Choice  many of the low income small, $1,000 loans and involved in the program. at first, they have new  Former Governor Carlson also testified before the Subcommittee, and urged the Congress to consider tax deductions and credits for education as part of a larger strategy of expanding educational choices for parents in order to improve student achievement. The real question that is before this committee and before Congress is what will it take to significantly improve educational outcomes. I would contend that education should consist of a variety of options designed for a variety of different needs. I strongly support a boutique approach. This would include charter schools which I signed into law during my first year in office, public school choice which was a favorite of my predecessor, post secondary options, as well as using the tax system to encourage and help parents achieve better educational results for their children including private school choice. The strength of the approach we took in Minnesota is the fact that all children have the opportunity to benefit. The assistance via the tax code goes not just toward private school tuition but also toward a variety of educational needs that will occur in either the private or public school system. Further, the tax approach utilizes a constitutionally safe method as opposed to the more legally doubtful voucher program. In summary, America has a real opportunity to reform its approach to education. If we focus entirely on the well-being of children and look toward satisfying outcomes, we will succeed. In Minnesota, educational choice has changed our whole discussion about education. The focus has shifted from inputs to outcomes. An increasing number of school superintendents and school boards want their systems to compete effectively. Virtually every day there is a news story on test scores or graduation standards. Increasingly, people are engaged. There is a far greater willingness to experiment in order to produce better outcomes. Many choice programs and proposals offer school choice as an option for those children in failing schools. Governor Carlson, however, urged Congress to not restrict choice to failing schools in order to prevent failure in the first place, instead of waiting for it to happen. It would be my hope that all of us would try to provide a system designed to enhance benefits and opportunities for all children. This move toward allowing school choice only after a school has become a demonstrated failure is folly. It may sound like good politics but it is poor policy. Imagine if medicine were to take the same approach. The result would be that the benefits of modern medicine Crossroads 2000 52   would only be available to those near death. I would much prefer a system where choice and competition are at play thereby maximizing opportunities for the success of everybody and preventing negative outcomes.115  115  Testimony of Gov. Arne Carlson, Field Hearing, Bloomington, Minnesota, June 6, 2000.  Crossroads 2000 53   TAX OPTIONS IN OTHER STATES ARIZONA Arizona offers parents two tax credits for education:  $500 for contributions to 501(c)(3) nonprofit scholarship or tuition grant programs that pay for non-governmental school tuition. Parents may not designate the donation to benefit their own children, and nonprofit organizations may not designate the funds to benefit students of only one school. $200 tax credit for extracurricular public school fees, such as equipment, uniforms and materials that students must have in order to participate in school-sponsored activities and for which a fee is charged.    Both credits were adopted in 1997 by the Arizona Legislature. Immediately, state taxpayers and education groups, including the Arizona Education Association, filed a lawsuit in the Arizona Supreme Court to gain an expedited ruling on whether the credit for private school tuition violates federal and state constitutional prohibitions against government aid to religion. The Court, however, voted 3-2 to allow the tax credit. ILLINOIS In June 1999 Illinois enacted legislation that provides taxpayers with a nonrefundable credit of up to $500 per family for qualified educational expenses for tuition, books, and lab fees. The credit equals 25 percent of qualified educational expenses above $250, up to the maximum of $500; a family must spend at least $2,250 to qualify for the full $500 credit. IOWA In 1987 the Iowa legislature first enacted legislation establishing tuition and textbook deductions or credits on personal income tax returns. The deduction was challenged in court, but found to be Constitutional since it was similar to the Minnesota tax deduction upheld by the Supreme Court in Mueller v. Allen. The tax credit for tuition is equal to 25 percent of the first $1,000 the taxpayer pays to others for tuition, nonreligious textbooks, and extracurricular activities for each child in kindergarten through grade 12. Under a 1998 modification, there is no income limit on eligibility for the credit.  Crossroads 2000 54   Choice and Performance Incentives in Michigan Education policy initiatives in Michigan have put results first by empowering parents with school options and performance incentives for students. In recent years Michigan has seen an increase in the number of charter schools: in the spring of 2000 there were 173 charter schools in Michigan, and enrollment is expected to rise 15 percent this fall to more than 57,000. Because of this strong demand and swelling waiting lists, existing charter schools are adding classes; almost every school that is eligible to add a grade has requested permission to do so. Michigan has an open enrollment policy, which empowers parents to send their children to public schools of their choosing, when space is available. In the last decade Michigan students' test scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) math test have increased at twice the national average, following right behind the nationally acclaimed progress of Texas and North Carolina.116 Students have also made gains in reading as well. The Subcommittee held a hearing in hear Michigan's perspective on how improve education. The Secretary of the Treasury, Michigan's recent policy success in the area o Battle Creek, Michigan on September 8, 1999, to student achievement and reform the federal role in Mark Murray, described for the Subcommittee f choice:  Governor Engler's leadership in the 1990s has made a big difference in education in the state. We've done financial reform, where we reduced the property taxes and found a new financing mechanism, and for the long term began to narrow the gap between the high and the low spending districts. Schools of choice and charter schools have given more opportunity to parents to select educational options for their children. These have set more consequences in place for both good and bad performance. The demand for choice is strong in Michigan. Through the leadership of Amway President and former Michigan Board of Education member Richard DeVos, school choice activists and business leaders have formed Kids First! Yes! to rally around an effort to amend the Michigan state constitution to give parents whose children attend ""at risk"" school districts a publicly funded voucher to attend a school of choice. The Kids First! Yes! school choice proposal earned a place on the Michigan ballot in early May 2000. The amendment would repeal a 1972 amendment passed by voters that outlaws public aid to religious schools: it would remove the ban on vouchers and tuition tax credits, while maintaining the prohibition on providing direct aid to private schools. This proposal would establish a higher statewide per-pupil funding allowance, as well as require that every public school teacher in Michigan undergo regular academic testing in his or her subject area. It would also provide equal education opportunities for all Michigan students currently attending failing school districts, which are defined as school districts that do not graduate at least two-thirds of their students. Parents could use the $3,100 scholarships to pay for tuition at a non-public school.  116  David Grissmer, Improving Student Achievement: What State NAEP Scores Tell Us, RAND, July 2000.  Crossroads 2000 55   Treasury Secretary Murray also described the Governor's newly enacted Michigan Merit Scholarship plan, which provides incentives for students to focus on individual achievement as well as to pursue post-secondary education. Academic achievement is measured using the Michigan Educational Assessment Program (MEAP). It is unique in the flexibility it provides students: the scholarship can be used to cover college (private or public) or vocational training expenses, and it also provides flexibility in the type of expenses the scholarship can cover. The $2,500 Michigan Merit Award Scholarship is first available to the graduating Class of 2000. Beginning with the graduating Class of 2005, there will be an additional award of up to $500 available. The Michigan Merit Scholarship program serves as another example of a state putting student performance first. As Secretary Murray said to the Subcommittee, With this program, we continue our commitment to and focus on student achievement and school performance. The Michigan Merit Award is a meaningful promise we can make to our students: ""Study hard and achieve, and your state will stand behind you."" I can't think of a better graduation gift to our high school seniors, or a better investment in our state's future. Education Freedom Linked to Higher Achievement School choice appears to be making a significant difference in the lives of disadvantaged students, especially African-American students. Researchers from Harvard, Georgetown, and the University of Wisconsin, released a study in August 2000 showing that African American students that received privately funded scholarships moved ahead of their peers who applied for scholarships, but did not receive them. Since the scholarships were awarded by lottery, it allowed researchers to set up an experiment that followed the progress of students that received the scholarship, and those that did not. The use of randomized field trials in this study is unusual for an education study, but is standard practice in medical and other fields of research. The study compares the students' reading and math scores on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills over the first two years of the voucher program. Those moving to private schools scored six percentile points higher than those who stayed in public schools in New York City, Dayton, Ohio, and the Washington, D.C. The effect was largest in the District, where students with vouchers worth up to $1,700 moved nine percentile points ahead of public school peers.117 The effect of vouchers over two years was twice as large as the effect of class size reduction among black students in the widely cited Tennessee class size reduction experiment.118 A similar study was also conducted by the Manhattan Institute of private voucher recipients in Charlotte, North Carolina. The study found that in one year, students using  117 118  Jay Matthews, ""Scores Improve for D.C. Students With Vouchers,"" The Washington Post, August 28, 2000, p.A1.

Crossroads 2000 56   vouchers gained six points in math and seven points in reading when compared to the students who remained in the public schools.119 Another recent study found that education freedom is linked to higher student achievement. The study found that even after controlling for income, population demographics, income, education spending and class size, the amount of education freedom in a state is a significant predictor of student achievement. Texas and South Carolina, for example, are similar in characteristics that are commonly thought to influence student achievement, but Texas test scores are significantly higher. Texas offers more freedom, ranking 6th among states. South Carolina received a score that placed them 43rd.120 Despite the Administration's opposition to experimenting with school choice, public support for choice and vouchers remains strong, according to recent polls:  A Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies poll found in 1999 that 53 percent of the general population and 60 percent of African Americans support vouchers.121  Public Agenda found in its 1999 study On Thin Ice that even though more than half of Americans are uninformed about vouchers, 57 percent of the general public favor the idea of parents being given a voucher and 70 percent would seriously consider or definitely use a voucher to send their child to a private school. 68 percent of African-Americans favor the vouchers to pay for al or part of tuition.122  In August 2000 a Hunter College survey of New York City residents found vouchers favored by 87 percent of Hispanics, 83 percent of African-Americans, and 86 percent of Asians.123 In addition to public opinion being on the side of testing vouchers, a 1999 study commissioned by the U.S. Department of Education called for a ""large and ambitious"" ten-year, multi-district voucher experiment. The report was written by the National Research Council's (NRC) committee on education finance, a group of 18 experts in education. According to the report, a large-scale voucher study would help determine whether giving public school students vouchers to pay for tuition at private schools can improve achievement, especially for students in poor, urban areas: ""Both theory and empirical evidence suggest that, among choice options, charter schools and vouchers, rather than inter-district and intra-district choice programs, [are] the approaches most worthy of further exploration as vehicles for improving poor-performing schools.""124 Darcia Bowman, ""Privately Financed Vouchers Help Black Students, Two Studies Find,"" Education Week, September 6, 2000. 120 Jay P.

ES-18-19. 119  Crossroads 2000 57   The Administration has not acted on the recommendations of the NRC report, and appears unswayed by public opinion on this issue. On July 5, 2000 at the National Education Association's national convention in Chicago, Vice-President Gore stated, ""I will never, ever support private school vouchers.... It's as clear as ABC. You cannot save the public schools of America by destroying public schools in America."" Instead of promising never to support initiatives involving vouchers, based on these results the Administration should be willing to experiment to see if these achievement gains could be replicated, and as the findings indicate, put the interests of students first by freeing them to attend schools that better address their needs.  Crossroads 2000 58   CONCLUSION: PUT CHILDREN FIRST SO THAT NO CHILD IS LEFT BEHIND Over the last two years the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations has collected research, oversight and hearing data that continue to make the case that changes need to be made at all levels of government to ensure that children are truly put first in education. The lack of progress in improving achievement and narrowing achievement gaps, as well as the continued inequities in access to high quality education are unacceptable. Years of mismanagement, fraud and waste at the Department have also hurt children by reflecting poorly on the federal government's commitment to education. Simply put, the interests of children and parents are second to too many other interests. Too often education policy debates are not honest because of a fear of change and of any new policy that disrupts the status quo. Americans are not satisfied with the status quo  especially Americans with children trapped in low-performing schools. Congress should act swiftly during the next Congress to enact legislation that is right for children and their parents. Empower Parents  Expand, empower and protect charter schools.  Enact education tax deductions.  Encourage school choice. Expand Flexibility and Accountability for Results  Empower school districts to improve teacher quality or reduce class size according to their needs.  Put performance and accountability first and enact the Straight A's Act.  Empower schools to pay teachers according to their performance  Focus the federal role in education on a few important goals and consolidate and eliminate duplicative and ineffective education programs. Work to Ensure that ALL Have Access to a High Quality Education  Place a priority on raising the achievement of all students, even the lowest performing students.  Free children from failing schools.  Fight illiteracy among disadvantaged students. Ensure that Federal Dollars are Spent With Integrity at the Department of Education  Conduct oversight to ensure that the Department meets its goal of receiving a clean, independent audit.  Institute institutional checks and balances to ensure that education research, statistics and evaluations are conducted and presented in a rigorous and unbiased manner. Crossroads 2000 59    Work to improve overall management and quality of the Department's management of its finances and internal operations in order to reduce waste, fraud and abuse. Make the Federal Role in Education Less Burdensome  Eliminate and consolidate duplicative and ineffective programs.  Improve evaluation and oversight of federal programs to ensure that federal dollars produce results.  Reform the Department's Office of Education Research and Improvement (OERI) so that it serves the needs of teachers and students, not researchers, so that we know what really works in the classroom.  Ensure that federal research and program evaluation activities employ rigorous research methods in order to produce credible, useful results. There is too much at stake to allow the federal education system to dictate how children are educated in the United States. There is too much at stake to waste scarce resources on mismanagement and failed programs. Congress should work to make the difficult policy decisions that need to be made at the federal level, and empower states and parents to ensure that student performance is put first, not the status quo.

Only a fraction of this money goes to schools. Some will go to state agencies, some to colleges or other institutes of higher learning. Out of all of the money spent on education, $26.4 billion went to local education agencies to be used for elementary and secondary education.

Duke Albanese, Commissioner         Date:    March 17, 2000         Subject:    Legislative Updates                      It’s St. Patrick’s Day and true to form March weather has given many of our students extra cause for celebration - a day off from school.    I suspect that many of you could use some respite as well.            This time of year is clearly a “busy” season for those of us who serve public education.     Here in Augusta, the combination of school in session and the Legislature working to wind up its work translates into another version of “March Madness”.    To help you keep a scorecard on this hectic session, the following information is provided.         SUPPLEMENTAL BUDGET, FY 2000 - 2001                                 The Legislature and the Governor are moving closer to a resolution of the budget, a process which will need to accelerate if the Legislature is to adjourn on April 7 th , their target date.    Be apprised of the following regarding the Supplemental Budget:        ·      General Purpose Aid (GPA)  - At this writing, both the Governor’s proposed budget and the Education Committee’s recommendation to the Appropriations Committee honor the major targets set forth in statute as part of the long range plan to address equity in the school funding formula.    The Per-pupil Guarantee target for FY2001 of $4,307, up from $4,020 in this fiscal year, is included in both proposals.    The same is true for the Program Costs target which lowers the subsidy reduction percentage to 9.97%, as compared to 15.88% this year, FY2000.               The recommended level of appropriation in the Governor’s proposal is $655.9 million (5% over this year’s $622.7 million); the Education Committee has recommended $685.6 million (10% increase).    Though there is a proposed $2 million cushion in the Governor’s proposal for units experiencing adverse trends, the Education Committee has not yet discussed the specifics of a cushion.    The debate over additional General Purpose Aid continues to focus on “one-time” versus “on-going” appropriations.    Governor King and some legislators are cautious about the level of increase in GPA given the uncertainty of future revenues.    Other legislators support higher increases in GPA, believing that the strength of the economy will absorb increased subsidies.           ·      Professional Development  - Both the Administration and the Education Committee are supporting an additional $1 million in on-going commitment to professional development to support Maine’s  Learning Results , bringing the total commitment to $2 million per year as promised in the original  Learning Results  legislation.        ·      School Construction  - Both the Administration and the Legislature indicate continuing support for investments in school facilities.    The Governor’s budget proposal calls for $20 million in appropriation toward the Revolving Renovation Fund; the Education Committee has recommended $27 million.    The Governor’s proposal would allow funding to reach about 160 renovation projects since the inception of the renovation program.    Regarding major capital construction projects, the Administration and the State Board have recommended increasing the debt service limit from $74 million to $84 million, an amount that would allow approximately $200 million in new projects to go forward over the next two years, up from $100 million allowable under current law.    Final review and recommendations will be forthcoming from the Education Committee as early as next week.        ·      Education Technology  - The Governor has recommended a major initiative centering on Education Technology.    Financing this proposal would be a $50 million appropriation for an endowment fund (a one-time appropriation) and $1 million annually in continuing teacher professional development focused on instructional applications using technology.        ·      Adult Education  - The Governor and the Education Committee are supporting a 5% increase in subsidy for Adult Education.    In addition, the Governor’s budget proposes a one-time $2 million investment in Adult Education programs to offer contemporary workforce skills to up to 15,000 Maine citizens.    If successful, this one-time appropriation could elevate the future annual subsidy for Adult Education, recognizing the strong role that this program can play in raising the education attainment level of Maine citizens.        ·      Teacher Recruitment  - Both the Administration and the Education Committee are supporting $120,000 to assist with recruitment strategies and a study regarding the shortage, recruitment, and retention of public educators.    The Maine Leadership Consortium is working with the Department to address our growing concerns in this area.        ·      Fingerprinting  - The Governor’s proposal calls for a one-time appropriation of $2.3 million to cover existing employees (but not new hires) over the next 5 years, with renewal costs after 5 years left to the employee.    The Education Committee proposes to cover current employees, as well as new hires at an estimated cost of $1.5 million for just the current biennium.           ·         Distance Learning (ATM)  - The Administration’s budget proposal and the Education Committee are backing a $512,000 expenditure to provide network support and maintenance of the statewide advanced distance learning system (ATM), which will be in over 50 high schools by the end of next year.              UPDATE ON FINGERPRINTING                    Currently the Education Committee is recommending amendments to current law that will assist implementation in three ways:    1.) the state will pay for fingerprinting for all personnel who must be printed for their paid work in public or approved private schools, and will rebate districts and individuals who have already paid for this; 2.) Title 20-A will be amended to include language about grounds and process for denial or non-renewal, taken from Department of Education rules as well as from Title 5; and 3.) the fingerprinting requirement will be phased in as follows: a.) phase in over 5 years all persons currently employed in schools who require approval to continue in their positions; b.) fingerprint all current substitutes by January 1, 2001; c.) postpone the requirement for all contracted service providers until July 1, 2002; d.) postpone persons certified or authorized, but not paid to work in a school in any capacity, until they begin work in a school; and e.) require that all new hires in the future must meet the fingerprinting requirement prior to their 20th day of work (to allow short-term substitutes and last-minute hires some time to meet the requirement).                    Some districts have experienced high absentee rates at fingerprinting sessions.    Be advised that while there will be some regional fingerprinting sites scheduled during the summer, these sessions will likely not be as convenient as current scheduled sessions and may not be able to accommodate large numbers of current employees.     Individuals who make the decision to postpone fingerprinting until this summer may have lengthy travel or long waits at regional sessions.    Please encourage all personnel to be fingerprinted at your scheduled site to prevent this from happening.         There continues to be extensive debate about whether educators should be    fingerprinted in Maine, as they already are in a majority of other states.    My position remains firm - this is important public policy that adds one more protection for our children.              PROPOSED MAINE EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY ENDOWMENT         Throughout Maine, debate continues on the merits of this proposed endowment which would provide portable technology to all Maine students commencing in middle school , and to all teachers (1/2 the cost), K-12 -  forever .    While this idea has its critics and has suffered from poor timing due to a changing revenue picture, it deserves careful consideration.            The endowment is intended to establish a vehicle that would underwrite technology that is portable in nature and contemporary in design to serve all of our students and every teacher in Maine.    The income from the endowment fund would be used to provide portable computers to all incoming 7 th  graders starting in 2002, reaching all 7 -12 graders after 5 years.    The fund would also provide half the cost of computers for all classroom teachers with continual upgrades every 4 years for teachers.    The perpetual income from the endowment would enable the program to keep up with changing technologies -    forever .    While certain aspects of the proposal are being both criticized and applauded, there is ample opportunity to refine many of the elements of the program (i.e., 7 th  grade vs. 8 th  or 9 th , school sign-outs and control vs. individual use, etc.) if people support the concept.         Attached is a summary description of the program, one that you may wish to share with staff and community groups.              ******************************************************************                      Hopefully, you find the information above to be a useful update as we enter the final weeks of the 119 th  Legislature.              MAINE’S EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY ENDOWMENT         What It Will Do         Using a one-time appropriation of $50 million matched with $15 million from private and federal sources, an Education Technology Endowment totaling $65 million will be established. The interest income from the Endowment will be used to buy portable computers for all incoming 7 th  grade students and all teachers, K-12. The proposal also provides $1 million per year to pay for ongoing training for teachers to use the technology effectively in teaching.          The State will pay the full cost of computers for students.    About 17,000 seventh grade students would receive new computers at the start of each school year and will be able to use the computers as they advance to the higher grades.    After the first five years of the program, all students above the 7 th  grade would be equipped with a portable computer. The State would pay half the cost of computers for all teachers.    Teachers would have their computers replaced or upgraded on a four-year replacement cycle.         Only the interest income - about $7 million a year - would be used to purchase the computers, with an additional $1 million per year used to provide training for the teachers. The $65 million principal in the Endowment will remain intact.         Why We Should Do It         ü    Taking Our Students to Higher Levels of Achievement:    This technology provides a tool to take our students to higher levels of achievement as described in Maine’s Learning Results. The potential for teachers and students is enormous: no more outdated textbooks; instant access to the latest information; the ability to take “virtual” field trips via computer; lab experiments online; students collaborating on projects via e-mail.    This initiative is not about learning to use computers; it’s about using computers to learn.    Students will use a powerful, engaging tool to achieve the knowledge and skills we already expect.    In order for teachers to integrate technology into learning, every student must have access.         ü    Crossing the Digital Divide:    While many students have access to technology at home, there are a significant percentage of students whose families cannot access computer ownership.    Through the program, Maine would ensure that all children have equal access to the best learning tools.         ü    A Wise Investment in Good Times:    In this time of budget surpluses and economic growth, it is only practical that we set aside funds that will continue to produce returns far into the future.    And these returns will be used to keep pace with ever-changing technology, so that our schools will not be stuck with outdated and worthless equipment.         ü    Changing Maine’s Image to the World:    A commitment of this scope signals to the world that Maine is serious about investing in our young people.    These children are the workforce of tomorrow, and we will be equipping them better than any other place in the world.    The Endowment will change dramatically the way that people think about Maine and our potential employees.         ü    Efficiency:    By bulk purchasing upwards of 20,000 laptop computers per year, the State will be able to secure the machines for far less cost than individual schools.         ü    Ensuring Maine’s Prosperity:    Maine ranks 37 th  in the country in personal income levels.    Maine’s tax rates are also high because our average wage is low.    We need to grow better jobs that pay higher wages.    Making Maine a leader in understanding and using technology will attract the high-paying jobs of the future, and leapfrog ahead of other states in increasing the incomes of Maine people.    By increasing our average wage through better jobs associated with technology, we should also be able to reduce tax rates.         When It Will Start         Students would begin receiving their first computers at the start of the 2002 school year.    This timeline is a key strategy in the proposal for the following reasons:         ·      The first two years would be used to implement teacher training so that when the computers do appear, educators will be ready to implement them into the curriculum.    ·      The endowment will have the chance to grow in those two years to a level where we are able to fund the program  forever .    ·      Over the next two years, prices for portable computers are expected to decline to about $450 each - a level that makes this program possible.         How It Will Work         ü    Oversight:  The program will have strong oversight by both the Executive and Legislative branches of government. The oversight responsibilities include:         ·      The development of request for proposals (RFPs) for the actual computers.    ·      Oversight of the financial management of the endowment    ·      Fundraising activities    ·      Communications with local school districts         ü    Investment:    The Maine State Retirement System (MSRS) will manage the funds.    The MSRS has an excellent track record and enables the State to maintain control of the principal amount invested.         ü    Maintenance and Repair:  These machines will be custom-built to be durable and reliable, and the contract will include strong warranties for repair and replacement.    If machines break outside of the warranty period, the State can also utilize correctional inmates at the South Windham facility who are trained in computer repair and have already refurbished more than 1,000 computers for school use.    The National Guard currently handles distribution of Maine’s refurbished computer program, and is prepared to assist in this distribution effort as well.         ü    Using the Internet:  Maine already has the most sophisticated telecommunications infrastructure in the nation, and integrating the network with this initiative will be easy. Schools access the Internet through the Maine School and Library Network (MSLN). Teachers can currently access the Internet from their homes directly through the MSLN. In the future, that same direct access could be provided to students at low or no cost. The possibility of partnering with local Internet Service Providers for Internet access also exists.         ü    Protecting our Students:  The MSLN system currently has filters installed that prevent students from gaining access to improper sites. Additional filters can also be a requirement for any laptop purchased from vendors.
GX256-42-9203452	Archived Information  M  AGNET SCHOOLS  ASS  ISTANCE  PROG  RAM  Goal: To assist in the desegregation of schools served by local educational agencies. Relationship of Program to Volume 1, Department-wide Objectives: The Magnet Schools Assistance Program supports Objectives 1.1 (states develop challenging standards and assessments for all students in the core academic subjects), 1.6 (greater public school choice will be available to students and families), and 3.1 (secondary school students get the information, skills, and support they need to prepare successfully for postsecondary education) of the Department's Strategic Plan. The program provides financial assistance for high-quality public school choice options that are accessible to all children. The objectives are concerned with how well the program is serving the children enrolled in magnet schools and the extent to which the program is enabling public school districts to reduce racial isolation among and within schools. The program contributes to state and local systemic reforms, the provision of high-quality teaching and learning experiences, and the improvement of student achievement.  FY 2000--$110,000,000 FY 2001--$110,000,000 (Requested budget) OBJECTIVE 1: FEDERALLY FUNDED MAGNET PROGRAMS ELIMINATE, REDUCE, OR PREVENT THE INCIDENCE AND THE DEGREE OF MINORITY STUDENT ISOLATION IN TARGETED SCHOOLS. Indicator 1.1 Minority group isolation: Increasing numbers of targeted schools will eliminate, reduce, or prevent minority group isolation according to their individual objective. Targets and Performance Data Assessment of Progress Sources and Data Quality Number of targeted schools meeting their objective Year Actual Performance Performance Targets 1998: Data not yet available 1999: Data not yet available No specific target set 2000: Continuing increase of schools that meet their objective 2001: Continuing increase Status: Unable to judge. Explanation: For 1998 grantees, it is not possible to determine the number of targeted schools meeting their desegregation objective until enrollment data are available from the 1998-99 school year--the first year of this grant cycle. This data was reported in the year 1 performance reports (summer 1999). However, because these data are self-reported and not standardized, they must be compared to the enrollment data in the National Center for Education Statistics Common Core of Data (CCD). Data for the 1998-99 school year from the CCD are lagged and will not be available until the fall of 2000. Specific objectives of FY 1998-funded schools: 11 percent of schools--prevent minority group isolation (MGI); 13 percent of schools-- eliminate MGI; 57 percent of schools--reduce MGI; 3 percent of schools--prevent, reduce, or eliminate MGI in feeder school; 16 percent of schools--other. Source: Magnet Schools Assistance Program annual performance reports; Magnet Schools Assistance Program Evaluation. Frequency: Annually. Next Update: 2000. Validation Procedure: Not applicable. Limitation of Data and Planned Improvements: Student recruitment activities (the primary tool to meet desegregation objectives) generally occur in the spring. Since the first year grant award was made in the summer of 1998, it was too late to be used for initial recruitment. Impact of the grant on recruitment will not be seen until the second year of the grant (as reported in the year 2 performance report, summer 2000). Enrollment data from grantee performance reports have several limitations: (a) enrollment figures are self-reported; (b) grantees do not all use the same month (e.g., October) to collect enrollment data; and (c) grantees sometimes report enrollment figures at different times each year (e.g., October for the first year, May for the next).

Indicator 2.1 Improved student achievement: Students will show achievement gains in core subjects, as well as in applied learning skills, that meet or exceed the gains for students in the district as a whole. Targets and Performance Data Assessment of Progress Sources and Data Quality Number of targeted schools meeting their objective Year Actual Performance 1998: Data not yet available 1999: Data not yet available 2000: 2001: Status: Unable to judge. Performance Targets No specific target set Continuing increase Continuing increase Explanation: Performance data are not yet available for the 1998-99 or 1999-00 school years. Virtually none of the 1998 applications provided 1997-98 baseline data because scores had not been released at the time the application was submitted. Similarly, when the first year performance reports were submitted in 1999, year 1 results were unavailable; having no year 1 scores for comparison, most grantees did not report baseline data (1997-98) either.

KEY STRATEGIES Strategies Continued from 1999 Provide technical assistance to grantees on the integration and use of the performance indicators in applications and reports. Disseminate information on best practices and strategies for achieving program objectives through conferences and meetings.  c c c c c c c c c c c c  New or Strengthened Strategies To improve performance where magnet project reports indicate real or potential problems in reaching planned objectives, staff from the Magnet Schools Assistance Program will follow up with grantees regarding their plans. Identify and disseminate new and promising strategies for the recruitment and selection of students that minimize or eliminate the need to use race as a criterion in student selection processes for magnet schools. In order to have a more structured information management system, the Magnet School Assistance Program office will continue to use the data base created for the current evaluation to track grantee performance data.  HOW THIS PROGRAM COORDINATES WITH OTHER FEDERAL ACTIVITIES To ensure that school districts receive timely and consistent information about magnet school strategies, technical assistance is provided by the Magnet Schools Assistance Program in collaboration with the Equity Assistance Centers. In order to further the goal of increasing public school choice, both the Magnet Schools Assistance Program and the Public Charter Schools Program are administered from the same organizational unit.  CHALLENGES TO ACHIEVING PROGRAM GOAL Many school districts are continuing to experience disproportionate growth in minority group student enrollment, making it more difficult to reduce, eliminate, or prevent minority group isolation within the school districts. There are few incentives and many barriers (political, social, and financial) to regional or interdistrict approaches to reducing, eliminating, or preventing minority group isolation. Changing legal standards constrict school districts' ability to use race as a criterion in selecting students to attend magnet programs. More teachers are needed with the skills to effectively teach in classrooms with children from diverse ethnic, economic, and educational backgrounds. The Magnet Schools Assistance Program does not have an information management system that can aggregate grantee performance rep orts or provide data on the program as a whole.  MAGNET SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS  PAGE D-21   INDICATOR CHANGES From FY 1999 Annual Plan (two years old) Adjusted Indicator 1.1 (minority group isolation) was adjusted. The second part of the indicator (magnet programs will not have a significant adverse impact on the racial composition of feeder schools) was dropped so that in the FY 2000 plan, only the first part of the indicator (targeted schools will eliminate, reduce, or prevent minority group isolation according to their objective) remained. Dropped Objective 3 (Federally funded magnet programs feature innovative educational methods) was dropped. Indicators 3.1 (innovative themes), 3.2 (innovative educational methods and practices), and 4.2 (vocational skills) were also dropped. From FY 2000 Annual Plan (last year's) Adjusted--None. Dropped Objectives 2 (systemic reform and aligning standards) and 4 (innovative programs assist in desegregation) have been dropped. Indicator 1.2 (minority/nonminority distribution) is being dropped because there is no direct correlation between it and the statutory purposes of the program. Indicator 2.2 (national, state, and local reforms) is being dropped because the evidence provided by grantees in the progress reports regarding this indicator is descriptive in nature and varies widely. Performance data are therefore weak because they are self-reported and not quantifiable. Indicator 2.3 (state content and performance standards) is being dropped for the same reason as Indicator 2.2 above. Indicator 4.1 (assist in desegregation) is being dropped for several reasons: (a) this part of the MSAP program only receives 5 percent of MSAP funding and is therefore not a key indicator of the program; (b) the data necessary to inform this indicator are not quantifiable; (c) data on innovative programs would best be described in an evaluation; however, no evaluations of this part of the MSAP have been conducted and there are no future plans to do so. Indicator 4.2 (parental and community involvement) is being dropped for the same reason as Indicator 4.1 above. New--None.  c c c c c c c c c c  PAGE D-22  MAGNET SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS

GIFTED AND TALENTED EDUCATION PROGRAM        Since 1987, state law has required that all Texas school districts have educational programs to serve the needs of gifted and talented students and that programs be available in all districts and at all grades. Gifted and talented students are characterized as having high levels of achievement, intellectual and academic ability, creativity, leadership skills and talent in the visual and performing arts.     Districts are required to have a systematic process for identifying gifted and talented students. The Texas Education Agency (TEA) issues guidelines for the identification of gifted and talented students in an effort to ensure that all of these students receive a quality education. The process must include quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation tools and instruments. Funding for the identification of gifted and talented students and programs is available through the Texas Foundation School Program. This program is intended to provide gifted and talented programs for students from various cultural, linguistic and socioeconomic backgrounds.     BISD's gifted education program is a four-pronged program focusing on creative, intellectual, academic and leadership skills and serves students who are performing, or have the potential to perform, at very high levels relative to their peers. The program is designed to develop complex thinking processes that include problem-solving, decision-making, critical thinking and creative thinking. Students are provided the opportunity to work independently, in homogeneous groups and heterogeneous groups.     BISD expenditures for the gifted and talented program are described in       Exhibit 2-68 . Total funding for gifted and talented programs increased by 83 percent and per student funding increased by three percent since 1995-96. The number of students in the program increased 77 percent over the same period.

In each BISD school serving K-4 students, a certified G/T teacher or teachers serve identified gifted and talented students through a pull-out program (students leave the regular classroom to go to the gifted teacher's classroom) two to three days per week for two to four hours. All elementary schools follow a common curriculum skill sequence. The curriculum includes content specific instruction, which incorporates creative, intellectual and leadership skills.     Students at Bastrop Middle and Intermediate Schools are enrolled in a G/T class with a certified G/T teacher providing instruction in the four core areas through a thematic approach. Leadership and creativity are also major components of this program. High school Algebra I is offered to eighth grade students. Pre AP courses will also be available at the middle school next school year.     Advanced placement (AP) and pre-advanced placement (Pre-AP) courses at the high school level provide students with differentiated instruction. High school students may choose from an array of Pre-AP and AP classes in the four core areas and in art and foreign language. ( Exhibit 2-70 ).

Note: Totals may not add due to rounding.      BISD attempts to increase the representation of minorities in the gifted and talented education program by including a nonverbal ability test, Matrix Analogies Test, an interview or portfolio and a teacher checklist as part of the identification criteria.     In grades K-2 those students who were close to, but did not qualify for the Gifted and Talented program are placed in an accelerated program called APEX. These students meet with the G/T teacher for one to two hours once per week. The APEX program was initiated 5 years ago to increase the probability of identifying additional economically disadvantaged and minority students. An evaluation of the program in 1999-2000 indicates the program is not successful.     Several districts use other alternative instruments to identify minority students. Galveston ISD uses Aprenda (for Spanish-speaking students in grades K-5), which is the Spanish equivalent of the Stanford Achievement Test. Alief ISD uses the Woodcock Munos, the Spanish version of the Woodcock Johnson verbal IQ test and is amending procedures to use only one totally nonverbal unified test, Naglieri.         Recommendation 11:            Amend the district's gifted and talented identification procedures.           IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE                1.            The executive director of Academic Programs contacts TEA's Division of Gifted/Talented Education for assistance in redesigning a program to increase minority participation.             September 2000                  2.            The executive director of Academic Programs forms a committee of G/T teachers to research procedures used by model districts and amends the identification criteria for G/T.             September 2000                  3.            The executive director of Academic Programs recommends the proposed changes to the assistant superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction.             October 2000                  4.            The assistant superintendent approves the plan and recommends it to the superintendent for approval.             October 2000                  5.            The superintendent approves the plan and recommends it to the Board of Trustees for approval.             November 2000                  6.            The board approves the plan and implementation of the plan begins when goals are set for the coming school year.             December 2001                 FISCAL IMPACT       The cost associated with this recommendation would be purchasing additional assessment instruments for each school. The cost of such a test is approximately $215. The fiscal impact would be a one-time cost of $215 x 7 schools = $1,505. The additional instruments would be substituted for currently used instruments and would not result in additional administration costs.

Analysis of Program Performance A. Goals and Objectives The Magnet Schools Assistance Program assists in the desegregation of schools by providing support for (1) the elimination, reduction, or prevention of minority group isolation in elementary and secondary schools with substantial proportions of minority students; (2) the development and implementation of magnet schools that will assist in achieving systemic reforms and providing all students the opportunity to meet challenging state content and performance standards; (3) the development and design of innovative educational methods and practices; and (4) courses of instruction within magnet schools that will substantially strengthen students' knowledge of academic subjects and their grasp of tangible and marketable vocational skills. B. Strategies to Achieve the Goals Services Supported The Magnet Schools Assistance Program (MSAP) provides three-year competitive grants to school districts operating under an approved desegregation plan to support the development or expansion of magnet school programs. Magnet schools provide special curricular programs designed to attract students of different racial backgrounds. The number of magnet schools nationally has more than doubled over the past decade, from about 1,000 in 1981-82 (V.2) to 2,400 in 199192 (V.1). The grants support more than 400 magnet schools each year, about 16 percent of the nation's magnet schools. A national study of magnet schools (Steele and Levine, 1994) found that, in 199192, 39 percent of districts receiving MSAP funding used that funding to start new magnet school programs, and an additional 39 percent used it to add new magnet schools to their existing programs. Other districts used their MSAP grants for program enhancement and improvement. Magnet school programs were more extensive in districts that received federal funding, with 30 percent of schools in funded districts being   Chapter 127-2 magnets, compared with 21 percent of schools in nonfunded districts. Most MSAP grantees (87 percent) continued to maintain their magnet school programs, although with some reductions in teachers and supplies, after their federal funding ended (V.1). Steele and Levine also found that MSAP-supported magnet schools offered a wide range of distinctive programs, including programs emphasizing academic subjects such as math, science, aerospace technology, language immersion, or humanities (38 percent); instructional approaches such as basic skills, open classrooms, individualized instruction, Montessori, or enriched curricula (25 percent); career/vocational education (15 percent); gifted and talented programs (11 percent); and the arts (10 percent). MSAP-funded magnets were more likely than other magnets to offer subject-matter-oriented or career-vocational programs and less likely to provide programs focused on the arts, gifted and talented students, or a particular instructional approach (V.1). School districts may use MSAP funds for (1) planning and promoting activities directly related to the expansion, continuation, or enhancement of academic programs and services offered at magnet schools; (2) purchasing books, materials, and equipment (including computers) that are necessary for the conduct of the magnet programs and are directly related to improving students' knowledge of math, science, history, English, foreign languages, art, or music, or improving vocational skills; and (3) paying the salaries of licensed or certified elementary and secondary school teachers in magnet schools. Steele and Levine found that recipients of MSAP funds most frequently reported using them for purchase of special equipment (100 percent of grantees) and special materials (97 percent), staff development (95 percent), hiring of teachers (93 percent), outreach (85 percent), and planning (73 percent) (V.1). MSAP funds are targeted primarily to large urban school districts with high proportions of minority and low-income students. In 199192, large urban school districts enrolled 25 percent of the nation's students, but they received 82 percent of all MSAP funds. Predominantly minority districts (those in which more than 50 percent of students are minority) enrolled 30 percent of all students but received 76 percent of MSAP funds. High-poverty school districts (where more than 50 percent of students receive free or reduced-price lunches) enrolled 19 percent of all students but received 53 percent of MSAP funds. Districts receiving MSAP funds were also more likely to be large urban, predominantly minority, and high-poverty districts than were magnet districts generally (V.1). MSAP-supported magnet schools were more likely to be whole-school dedicated magnets, where every student in the school has applied to participate in the magnet program (37 percent) than were nonfunded magnets (25 percent); MSAP-funded magnet programs were less likely to be programs within schools (37 percent) than were other magnets (51 percent) (V.1). Critics have charged that some programs within schools may segregate students of different social, economic, ethnic, and racial backgrounds by keeping students in the magnet program separate from other students in the school; whole-school approaches may be more likely to maximize contact among all groups of students in the school. MSAP-funded districts had more extensive outreach efforts designed to encourage and facilitate student participation in magnet programs than other magnet districts. MSAP-funded districts were   Chapter 127-3 more likely to make group presentations, mail information to all parents in the district, and provide transportation to enable prospective students to tour the magnet schools (V.1). Strategic Initiatives When the MSAP was reauthorized in 1994, the purpose of the program was expanded to ensure that school districts included their magnet schools in plans for systemic reform and plans to provide all students with the opportunity to meet challenging content and performance standards. Furthermore, program information requirements were amended to specifically require applicants to address the manner and extent to which their magnet projects would increase student achievement in the instructional area(s) offered by a magnet school. In reauthorization, the program also took steps to ensure that magnet programs do not focus on elite groups of students, by giving priority to programs that select students by methods such as lotteries, rather than through academic examinations. C. Program Performance--Indicators of Impact and Effectiveness Information on grantee performance is provided through annual performance reports. The Department is revising this performance reporting system to improve the quality, comparability, and usefulness of the performance information. In past years, the information available through this system was often incomplete and inconsistent across grantees. For example, Steel and Eaton found that program records for FY 1989 and FY 1991 grantees did not provide sufficient information to identify desegregation objectives consistent with the statutory goals of reducing, eliminating, or preventing minority isolation for 42 percent of the schools targeted for desegregation impact. Information was lacking either because grantee performance reports were missing or because grantees described desegregation objectives other than those in the statute (V.3). The Department is working, through revised guidance and technical assistance, to help grantees prepare more clear and comprehensive performance reports, based on a performance indicators framework. Available information on each of the four statutory objectives of MSAP are summarized below: Objective 1: Eliminate, reduce, or prevent minority group isolation in elementary and secondary schools with substantial proportions of minority students. An evaluation of MSAP's impact on desegregation, based on data for FY 1989 and FY 1991 grantees, found that MSAP funds typically are used to promote desegregation within a very challenging context, that is, in schools that have high concentrations of minority students and are located in districts that are experiencing increases in minority enrollments. Fewer than half (47 percent) of the schools targeted by MSAP grantees for improvements in minority isolation were able to meet their desegregation objectives within the two-year period covered by MSAP grants at that time. However, an additional 17 percent of the targeted schools were able to demonstrate some progress toward their desegregation objectives. The study found that success in meeting the objectives of reducing, eliminating, or preventing minority isolation was strongly influenced by the demographic conditions surrounding the targeted school (V.3). Objective 2: Support the development and design of innovative educational methods and practices.   Chapter 127-4 In FY 1996 the Department awarded eight grants (totaling $3 million) to support the development and design of innovative educational methods and practices. Objective 3: Support development and implementation of magnet schools that will assist in achieving systemic reforms and providing all students the opportunity to meet challenging state content and performance standards. Data not available. Objective 4: Support courses of instruction within magnet schools that will substantially strengthen students' knowledge of academic subjects and their grasp of tangible and marketable vocational skills. Although research has not examined the specific impact of MSAP funding on student achievement, several studies of magnet schools in general (including magnets that may not have a desegregation purpose) have found positive although small impacts on student achievement: ! An analysis of data from the National Educational Longitudinal Survey (Gamoran, 1996) found that magnet schools are more effective than comprehensive public high schools at raising the proficiency of students in science, reading, and social studies; Catholic schools have a positive impact on math skills; and secular private schools offer no advantage, after controlling for preexisting differences among students (V.4). ! A study of New York City's career magnet high schools found modest gains in educational outcomes for average and low-achieving students. Students with average reading performance were less likely to drop out in the transition between middle school and high school and earned larger gains in reading scores and more credits toward graduation. Below-average readers also were less likely to drop out and more likely to pass the advanced mathematics test required for New York State Regents diploma, but they also showed greater absenteeism than students attending comprehensive schools and showed no improvement in either reading scores or graduation credits earned (V.5).  IV. Planned Studies The Department of Education has proposed to conduct an evaluation, beginning in FY 1998, to track the effects of federally supported magnet programs on desegregation, school quality, and student achievement. The study will draw heavily from the performance indicator system being developed for the program, supplemented by in-depth analysis of student performance.   Chapter 127-5  V.

The state special education law (H.B. 474) enacted in 1973, authorized the State Board of Education to establish standards for state aid for special programs for gifted students.    The following sections of state law pertain to gifted education programs eligible for state assistance:            Section 162.675. RSMo , defines gifted children as ""those children who exhibit precocious development of mental capacity and learning potential as determined by competent professional evaluation to the extent that continued educational growth and stimulation could best be served by an academic environment beyond that offered through a standard grade level curriculum.""            Section 162.720, RSMo , states that school districts may establish programs for gifted children ""where a sufficient number of children are determined to be gifted and their development requires programs or services beyond the level of those ordinarily provided in regular public school programs . . ."" and states that the State Board of Education ""shall determine standards for such programs.    Approval of such programs shall be made by the State Department of Education based upon project applications submitted each year.""                Section 162.975, RSMo , authorizes reimbursement of ""approved programs for gifted children; state aid not to exceed three-fourths of the cost of instructional personnel and special materials listed and approved on the project application shall be apportioned.""                Further information on the Administrative Rule for State-Assisted Gifted Programs can be found in  Appendix E   of this Manual.                                 Sc ope of Program         In accordance with the definition of giftedness which is set forth in the law, the state-assisted programs for the gifted will be in the general academic areas and/or in the fine arts.    It is recognized that gifted students are capable of outstanding performance in one or more academic areas and may also display outstanding ability in one or more of the fine arts.    It is further recognized that outstanding intellectual, creative thinking, and reasoning abilities contribute singly and in various combinations to such performance.    Consequently, school districts will need to assess a variety of student abilities and to design appropriate programs that will challenge and develop these abilities.    This responsibility is addressed within the standards of the Missouri School Improvement Program, which state, ""each district identifies gifted and talented students at all levels and provides them differentiated instruction suitable for their levels of intellectual, physical, and social maturity.""         Research in the field of education suggests that only 2 to 3 percent of the school-aged population is gifted to the extent that its development requires special educational services.    Because of the variance among the populations served by Missouri school districts, it is recognized that the percentage of gifted students identified in some school districts may be greater than that suggested by research.    In order to accommodate these differences, districts may identify and place up to 5 percent of the enrollment in the grade level(s) served in academic gifted programs.    Gifted programs in the fine arts areas may place up to 2 percent of the enrollments in grade levels served.             It is important to note that differentiated educational programs for gifted students are not designed for the typical superior student who is frequently an excellent scholar, can earn “A” grades, and achieve academic honors.    The educational needs of these students should be met by existing school programs.                Gifted programs are reserved for the 2-3 percent of students who are as far from the superior student in potential as the superior is from the average student.    The task is to identify this small percentage of students with truly exceptional needs and to provide educational opportunities that will challenge and develop their abilities.    State-assisted gifted programs should serve only those students properly selected for the program, not simply the top 5% of the student population.                       GUIDELINES for State-Assisted Programs:                State aid for gifted programs is available for districts which provide  eligible students with an educational environment beyond that offered in the regular school program for superior students and which is designed to meet the identified needs of gifted students.    The educational needs of gifted students which are not met by the regular school program for superior students will require (1) a differentiated instructional program which accommodates higher cognitive processes and concepts, (2) teaching methods appropriate for their advanced abilities and individual styles of learning, and (3) flexible administrative arrangements needed to implement the program.    See    Appendix A , Considerations for Non-supplant of Regular Program.            State-assisted funding may be used to fund   salaries and district-paid benefits for teachers   (must hold certification in gifted education), and for approved   materials/supplies or equipment  needed to implement the gifted program curriculum. The maximum amount that will be approved for special materials and equipment is $50 times the number of students served in the gifted program.      State aid may not exceed three-fourths (75%) of the total approved amount for the program,  the maximum allowed by law. The actual reimbursement rate may vary from year to year.            All teacher positions funded through state gifted education monies are designed to serve those students identified through the approved selection process as needing an academic environment beyond that offered by the standard grade level curriculum available to superior students.    The following guidelines apply:            In order to be approved for state aid, instructional personnel must:   1.     Serve in an instructional position described in    Appendix D  and provide instructional services to gifted students selected for the program according to criteria described in the application; and           2.     Provide instructional services to such gifted students during the time for which reimbursement is sought; and           3.     Increase the school's cost beyond the cost of the regular instructional program; and           4.     Hold a valid Missouri teaching certificate with endorsement in gifted education .    Provisional endorsement in gifted education will be acceptable to meet this requirement.   New provisions allow a teacher to apply for a Temporary Authorization Certificate that will allow him or her to teach for one year while taking coursework.  Contact the Certification Section at DESE for application procedures.   See  Appendix B  for certification guidelines.       NOTE:  State funding is NOT to be used for any time a teacher spends in testing students for program placement.   Testing (including the cost of testing materials) is a district responsibility.           All   materials, supplies and equipment (Capital Outlay) funded through state gifted education monies are to be materials and supplies beyond those ordinarily provided in regular school programs, and required for the achievement of gifted program goals and learner objectives.            Special materials may include special instructional texts, workbooks, other printed materials, audiovisual software, educational kits, registration fees for student competitions (only if instructional materials are provided), and other consumable materials.           Capital Outlay -- items that have a useful life of at least one year (such as electrical or mechanical items or furniture,) and cost more than  $1,000 per unit.    Items that cost less than $1,000 per unit are considered materials or supplies.             The following  will not be considered special materials  and are not approvable for state aid under the gifted program:            1.     Small consumable supplies ordinarily furnished teachers and students in the regular   school program, such as markers, stapler, paper clips, etc.;           2.     General reference works and basal texts used in the regular program;           3.     Rental charges, service fees, site license fees, admission fees, video-delivered coursework, correspondence courses, phone bills, and internet access fees;           4.     Tuition reimbursement and conference/workshop registration fees for teachers or students;           5.     Transportation costs (including transportation to and from program site, field trips, and/or competitions);           6.     Assessment materials, such as tests;           7.     Equipment not used in direct instruction of students and ordinarily provided by the district such as overhead projectors and copy machines;           8.     Costs to supply and maintain classroom space, teacher or student desks, tables or chairs, file cabinets, bookcases, etc;           9.     Registration fees for student competitions (unless special instructional materials are provided with the registration);        10. Contracted services (honoraria or other costs for guest speakers, testers, consultants, etc.        Districts must encumber funds for special instructional materials before March 31 of the program year .                              Types of services provided to Identified Gifted Students             Services provided to gifted students will vary depending upon the age and grade level of the students, the size of the school district, school schedules, and community preferences.    State-assisted gifted programs must provide a minimum of 150 minutes per week of contact time during which the teacher of gifted works exclusively with the identified gifted students.               At the elementary level, the most common service model is a pull-out program in which students leave the regular classroom and spend time in a resource room.    The pull-out program may either be one in which  the teacher of gifted spends 100% of his/her time in the resource classroom ( RRT  model,) or may be an    ERT   model in which the teacher spends most of his/her time (at least 80%) in the resource room and some time (a maximum of 20%) as a resource teacher in the regular classrooms.            NOTE:    For Kindergarten students ONLY, districts shall be eligible for reimbursement of in-class activities for the purposes of identification first semester and direct instruction second semester.            Middle school/junior high and high school programs may be pull-out programs (either  RRT  or  ERT ,) but often consist of a special class that is part of a student’s daily schedule ( SCT  model.)    Special classes are often interdisciplinary in nature, but may focus on a specific subject area.           At grades 9 through 12, gifted students may participate in a special class or pull-out, but these options often create conflicts with other classes that students want to take. The Gifted Resource Teacher ( GRT )  model avoids many of these conflicts.  In the  GRT  model, the teacher of gifted works with students and teachers in a resource capacity on a highly flexible schedule.             In some rare instances, a district may identify a few exceptionally gifted students who need full-time specialized instruction to meet their needs.    The  PEGS  (Program for Exceptionally Gifted Students) model is an option for those students.    Further explanation of    service models and teacher position descriptions can be found in  Appendix D  of this manual.                A school district may serve different groups of students in various ways, with varying amounts of contact time.   On the Automated Gifted Program Application, you will need to list different delivery systems or grade levels with different amounts of instructional time separately.   (See  Appendix D  in this Manual for descriptions of teacher positions and delivery systems, and  Appendix I  for instructions on completing the Automated Application.)                                            GUIDELINES for   Student Selection (Screening and Evaluation Instruments and Procedures)           The student selection process must consist of at least the following two stages:      (A) screening and   (B) individual evaluation and placement.            See  Appendix C  for a flow chart on the student selection process.    Evaluation and placement of   students should be completed prior to the beginning date of instructional services.                Schools must develop a system to identify children in need of the gifted education services that the district provides.    Screening criteria should be as inclusive as possible.    Identification criteria and test instruments should be chosen that will maximize the students’ strength and limit the effects of any possible biases (limited English proficiency, culturally diverse background, etc.).    Districts should consider their demographics when creating a menu of comparable test instruments that will be acceptable for screening and placement.            A.     Screening             All available data on the total school population should be considered during the screening stage.    Any information contained in permanent records should be used, including nationally-normed achievement test scores, group intelligence test scores, MAP scores, previous grades, anecdotal records demonstrating creative problem-solving and general creativity, and recommendations from teachers, parents, peers, and other personnel.    Districts should also consider what methods will be effective in selecting hard-to-identify and traditionally underrepresented students.    Districts should establish their own criteria so as to allow for approximately 10 to 20% of the population to be considered for further evaluation.    Approximately 10% of the enrollment will be evaluated individually.            B.     Individual Evaluation and Placement             Following screening and referral,  schools must use at least three of the following four identification criteria  to evaluate and place students in the gifted program.    The school may determine criteria which would be appropriate for the academic or fine arts program area(s) addressed, the grade levels to be served, and the background and needs of students in the district.    It is expected that the use of tests and scales may differ within districts as well as between districts. For example, different procedures or instruments may be used with students of different ages or for parts of the program with specific curriculum focus, such as a Fine Arts or Math and Science focus.  Alternate selection criteria and methods may also be used for special populations or students with special needs (ie. LEP, LD, ADD.)    From among the students who meet at least three of the four criteria, the district shall place those most in need of services in the state-assisted program.         1.     G eneral Mental Ability         Full-scale scores on an individual intelligence test at or above the 95th percentile :    Although they are more time-consuming, individually administered intelligence tests provide more accurate indicators for final placement purposes than do group tests.    However, as an alternative,  full-scale  scores from two different group intelligence tests,  both  at or above the 95th percentile, may be used in lieu of the individual intelligence test score.    It is important to note that 5% or more of the total population may be at or above the 95th percentile, and further evaluations may be needed to select the students most in need of these services.      The   district may use various IQ tests, administered according to their appropriateness in reference to program areas and student needs.    Full scale I.Q. scores  must  be used unless special circumstances are evident and prior permission is granted.    On the program application, list all I.Q. tests used by the district, and the minimum required test score.       Click here for a list of frequently-used I.Q. tests.         2.     Academic Ability            If achievement test scores are used for formal evaluation and placement, they must be derived from a norm-referenced test and the cut-off score must be set at the 95th percentile or higher.    MAP content area test scores may be used for screening,   but not for placement.  Only the Terra Nova portion of the MAP may be used for placement purposes. For interdisciplinary programs, tests must be used that sample all core subject areas.             On the program application, list all achievement tests used by the district and the minimum required test score.   The student must meet the 95th percentile on the composite score, or on a majority of subtests. While composite scores shall be used for most multi-disciplinary academic programs, it may be appropriate to use subtest scores   if an academic program is focused on a specific subject area.    The scores must be in the subject area(s) or in the subtest area(s) most related to the design of the gifted program.    Click here  for a list of frequently-used achievement tests.         3.     Creativity, Reasoning, and Problem-solving Ability   Results of valid tests or other assessments indicating outstanding ability  in one of the following areas:    (1) creative and productive thinking, (2) advanced insight, (3) outstanding imagination, (4) innovative or creative reasoning ability, (5) advanced perception of cause and effect relationships, (6) problem solving, or (7) abstract concepts.    These areas of ability must be related to the design of the gifted program. A minimum criteria for identification must be established by the district and listed on the application.       Click here  for a list of frequently-used creativity/problem-solving assessments.         4.     Other         Documented evidence of exceptional performance in a general academic area, a fine arts area, or another area related to the design of the gifted program:    Such evidence may take the form of portfolios of student work, checklists of characteristics of gifted students, formal classroom observations by persons knowledgeable about characteristics of gifted students, auditions, product demonstrations, etc.    Districts must establish a minimum criteria for placement and list it on the application.       Click here for a list of frequently-used items.         Limitations of a single test of cognitive ability should be recognized.    “If the identification criteria for a program for the gifted is based primarily on a single test, the population of gifted students identified will vary greatly depending upon which test is used."" (Wood and Carri, 1991)    No single test or method of identification will identify all children’s abilities.                Identification procedures typically include individual intelligence test scores, norm-referenced achievement test scores, previously demonstrated accomplishments, teacher observation and nomination, and scores on tests of creativity.                    Alternate Identification Plans     The task of identifying gifted children is a complex one, especially the task of finding children who are gifted and also have other exceptionalities.  Passow and Frazier identified the following groups as being under-identified and under-served, and in need of alternate assessment strategies.             1.  Children who are characterized by racial/ethnic cultural group membership (e.g., African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans);          2.  Children with language differences or limitations (e.g., mother tongue other than English or limited English speaking);          3.  Children from families of low socioeconomic status (e.g., qualifying for poverty-level subsistence or free or reduced price meals);          4.  Children of varied geographic locations  (rural or inner city areas, barrios, or reservations)        Passow and Frasier  indicate the need for "" new models or paradigms"" that "" respond to these [issues] by focusing on gifted behaviors in a cultural context, designing dynamic approaches to assessing gifted behaviors within the students’ socio-cultural context, and integrating identification processes with learning opportunities."" (Passow and Frasier, 1996)           Other children who may need to be identified by alternate means include children with learning disabilities, visual or hearing impairments, physical challenges, or behavioral difficulties.  The various, and possibly negative, manifestations of giftedness can make it difficult to recognize a child’s high abilities in a regular academic setting, causing some gifted children to remain unidentified and un-served.            A school district may propose an alternative student selection plan when the proposed alternative will provide  improved  individual evaluation and selection of students in need of the services provided.    The proposal must clearly set forth in writing the process of screening and individual evaluation of students.    The plan must include:    (a) established criteria for selection,  (b)  objective measures , and (c)  competent professional evaluation.    The plan must clearly state the criteria that a student must meet in order to be eligible for the state-assisted gifted program.    The alternative student selection plan must be submitted prior to  June 1  in order to facilitate its review and approval prior to the subsequent review of the gifted program application.    Examples of alternate selection include         1.  Using alternate tests, (such as non-verbal IQ or achievement tests for children with language differences or alternate types of tests for fine arts programs or subject-specific classes;)         2.  Alternate test administration (such as removing time limitations for children with learning disabilities or physical challenges;)        3.  Using interpreters or adaptive technology;        4.  Any adaptation that is part of a child's IEP.        Other adaptations may also be appropriate.  The examples listed above do not include all possibilities.  We strongly encourage districts to consult with Department personnel regarding appropriate alternative identification procedures.                            Exemption to 5% limit            Districts may request an exemption to the 5% limit on the number of students enrolled in academic programs.    Districts may feel that such an exemption is warranted because of the unusual demographic characteristics of the district or unforeseen circumstances beyond the district's control.           The request for an exemption must be submitted in writing to the Gifted Education Programs Section of the Department by June 1 in order to facilitate its review and approval prior to review of the gifted program application .    The request must include the reason for the exemption, an explanation as to why the district's regular curriculum will not address the students' needs, and the following assurances from the local board of education or its designee:            1.     The district's criteria for selection exceed the state's minimum requirements in both categories of intelligence and achievement and have not been lowered from the preceding year.           2.     The board desires to exceed the 5% limit.           3.     The board states its understanding that the exemption is in effect only for the period of time covered by the program application.            Exemptions will be granted at the discretion of the Department.    Exemptions must be applied for and granted each school year.    When an exemption is granted, it will not result in additional state gifted funds for instructional staff or materials above that allowed to serve 5% of the target grade spans.   On the Automated  Application, the Schools Screened page should show accurate numbers of identified gifted students to be served, and the exemption box should be checked. The Program Description page (which determines funding) should only include caseloads that reflect 5% of the target grade span enrollments, and the Budget page should only reflect material and supply funds for 5% of enrollments.   Transfer Student P olicy            Students who transfer to a school with a state-assisted gifted program shall be placed in the receiving district's program if  all  of the following conditions are met:           1.     The student must previously have been placed in a state-assisted gifted program in a Missouri school.           2.     The areas addressed by the two programs must be similar:    i.e., both are general academic programs; both are fine arts   programs; or both are specific academic programs.           3.     The student meets or exceeds the selection criteria established by the receiving school for   placement in its gifted program.           4.     The student and parents agree to such placement            Transfer students placed on this basis will not be counted in the district's 5% limit  for the school year during which the transfer takes place.                                    GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES FOR STATE-ASSISTED GIFTED PROGRAMS         District Procedures             1.     Applications for gifted programs  are to be submitted electronically  to the Department's Gifted Education Programs Section.    Paper applications will no longer be accepted.    The automated   application will be open during June, July, and August of each year for districts to submit applications.    (Instructions for submitting an automated application may be found in    Appendix I )           2.     The window for submitting automated applications is June 1 through August 31.    Any applicants who wish to submit an application after August 31 will have to contact the Gifted Education Section to initiate the application process.    For districts that have existing programs, authorization to expend funds for materials and supplies will be granted as of July 1, so that materials and supplies can be ordered and arrive for the beginning of school.     Districts who are planning new programs are strongly encouraged to contact the Gifted Section office before June 1  to receive technical assistance on planning their program and submitting their application.             3.    In order to receive funding for gifted education programs, a district must employ instructional personnel who have a valid Missouri teaching certificate with an endorsement in gifted education.  (Provisional endorsement in gifted education will be acceptable to meet this requirement.)    See  Appendix B  for certification guidelines. For specific questions regarding certification, call the Certification Section at (573) 751-4369.            4.     Occasionally, unforeseen circumstances may arise which would alter the approved budget and make it necessary to request a budget revision.    Applications may be amended up to four times during a year.  However, all amendments must be made within two ""windows.""  The first amendment window will be  October 1 through November 30,  and the second amendment window will be  February 1 through March 31.    Any of the following occurrences may require an amendment.                                                                                   a.     A change in staff, staff salaries, and/or approvable benefits;           b.     A change in instructional staff positions approved for the project (number of positions or instructional schedule);           c.     A change in student numbers as reflected in the Core Data System (resulting in an increase or decrease in approved amounts for Materials/Supplies and Capital Outlay.)            5.     Instructional staff positions and assignments must be documented by names of staff members and course assignments reported to the Department on the Core Data Collection System.    Program code ""08"" is to be used in reporting state-assisted positions and assignments.    Further instructions for entering Core Data can be found in the Core Data Manual ( Appendix H  in this Manual.)              6.     The district must file a final expenditure report  after the end of the program year.    The Final Expenditure Report Form is part of the Automated Application, and must be filed by May 15 each year.                      7.     An evaluation report shall be completed on or before June 30  of the program year and shall be filed in the  district office .    The evaluation procedures should be designed to determine the extent to which students have met the program objectives.    The report should include a description of the evaluation procedures, a list of the people involved in the evaluation process, and an explanation of how their input is used to revise the program.            8.     The district must maintain auditable financial records of approved program expenditures as required by the Missouri Public School Records Manual published by the Secretary of State.       Department Procedu res           1.     The Department will make copies of the  Administrative Manual and Guidelines: State-Assisted   Program for Gifted Students   available to all local school districts.    The manual is available on the DESE web site at    www.dese.mo.gov/divimprove/gifted .    The automated application also is accessed on the DESE web site.                2.     Individuals can subscribe to an electronic mailing list. Subscribers to the  listserv  receive updates on State Gifted Programs by e-mail, and we urge all school districts with state-assisted gifted programs to subscribe.            3.     The director and supervisor of Gifted Education Programs are available for consultation with district personnel by telephone, (573) 751-2453,  e-mail , or by appointment in the Jefferson City office.          4.    The Department shall review and will approve or disapprove each application submitted.   An automated e-mail message will inform districts when their application is approved or disapproved.  Applications that are disapproved may be amended and re-submitted.    A ""DESE Comment"" on the Budget page of an application will explain what changes need to be made before the application is re-submitted.    District personnel can check the approval status of an application by logging onto the website and looking at the Select Budget/Year screen (See instructions in  Appendix I  )            5.     The state aid for the gifted program will be sent as part of the district's regular state aid payment.    Although the law allows for reimbursement of up to 75% of the approved amounts, the actual percentage may vary from month to month and/or year to year.         6.     The Department will compare information entered on screens 18 and 20 of the Core Data Collection System with information in program applications for selected districts each year.    Core data will also be used to verify proper certification of all teachers for whom reimbursement is requested.     Districts will be notified of inconsistencies, and will have to adjust their budgets during the February/March amendment cycle.            7.     The Department will visit selected projects to monitor program operation, instructional personnel, and special materials approved in the state-assisted gifted program.            8.     The Department will review the final expenditure report submitted by each district for its state-assisted gifted program.    This review will compare reported expenditures with state aid paid for instructional personnel and special materials approved in the project application.    Districts will receive a financial report, and will have to refund o verpayments of state funds by sending a check to the  State Treasury.                                APPENDICES                             A -- Considerations for Non-supplant       of Regular Program                       B -- Certification for Teachers of       Gifted                             C -- Gifted Student Selection Process                       D -- Instructional Position Codes and       Descriptions                                         D-1 Reimbursement Chart - 150-239       Weekly Minutes                                         D-2 Reimbursement Chart - 240-299       Weekly Minutes                                         D-3 Reimbursement Chart - 300+       Weekly Minutes                                         D-4 Reimbursement Chart - Grades       9-12 GRT                             E -- State Administrative Rule                             F -- Definitions of Terms                             G -- Important Dates                             H -- Core Data Reporting Guidelines                                     I -- Instructions for       Submitting Automated Applications                     Revised:  June 03, 2003                                                                          Site Index:              Programs and Services A-Z       News       School Directory       School Home Pages       Guide to DESE                   Calendar                   State Home Page       School Improvement/MSIP                   Student Assessment/MAP                   School Finance                   Educator Certification                   Vocational & Adult Ed                   Special Education       Teacher Quality/Prof. Dev.

GX255-42-5747217	The Division of      Advanced Academic Services                                                                                      Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students                                           Quality              of G/T Services Program Review              Application 2002-2003                             Introduction                                                          Recognized           and Exemplary Gifted/Talented Programs                                                                          This                document is designed to supplement  The                Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students.                   It describes the process to be used by districts/K-12                vertical teams in attaining a designation of having recognized                or exemplary levels of services for gifted/talented students.                The document includes the application that a district or K-12 vertical                team will use to make application to the Texas Education Agency                for such designation. The flowchart is designed to provide an overview                of the entire process for attaining a recognized or exemplary designation                of services for gifted/talented students.                 An           entire district  or  one or more K-12 vertical teams within the           district may make application for recognized or exemplary designation.              For this purpose, a K-12 vertical team is defined as a K-12           combination of schools serving the G/T students in an articulated           continuum of services.    It           does not have to be the entire feeder pattern of elementary to middle           schools and middle schools to high schools, but must have at least one           elementary, one middle school, and one high school that are in the           feeder pattern.    A           district that does not have students in K-12 must work with another           district that receives its students in order to form a K-12 vertical           team and be able to show an articulated program for students through           grade 12.                                     The           application consists of a cover page, a statement of assurances, a           self-assessment, and a narrative review.              The purposes of the  Self-Assessment           Guide  are threefold:    (1)           to provide a comprehensive framework for districts and/or campuses to           use in self-assessing the quality of their gifted/talented programs           and services, (2) to offer suggested sources of documentation that           would verify the implementation of quality assessment and services for           gifted/talented students in an articulated K-12 program, and (3) to           determine whether the district or K-12 vertical team is prepared to           apply for advanced level status as a recognized or exemplary           gifted/talented program.                                     The            Self-Assessment Guide  provides           suggestions for documenting the implementation of a K-12 quality           gifted/talented program in accordance with the indicated standards for           recognized and exemplary designation.              Reflecting the five sections of the state plan, this document           reviews the areas of  Student           Assessment, Program Design, Curriculum and Instruction, Professional           Development, and Family/Community Involvement  along a continuum of           performance standards.    Full           adherence to acceptable indicators provides the foundation for           movement to recognized indicators, which in turn are built upon in           moving toward an exemplary program status.              Designation as recognized or exemplary assumes the presence of  all            indicators at each progressive standard at a high level of quality           evidenced by student participation and production.              Should there be a           specific indicator that has not been met, but an alternative measure           has allowed the district to meet the overarching standard of a           particular strand, it should be noted in the  Self-Assessment           Guide  under other in the column entitled Possible Sources of           Evidence.    This allowance is for indicators in recognized and           exemplary only.                                     The           standards set forth in the state plan are reflected in the  Self-Assessment Guide .    The           specific indicators for acceptable, recognized, and exemplary status           in each section of the plan are included in a column titled           Determine That.    The           guide further includes a column titled Possible Sources of           Evidence where examples to verify the implementation of each           indicator are suggested.    It           is important to note that while a  Quality           of G/T Services Program Review  will expect all indictors in the           Determine That column to be present, the Possible Sources of           Evidence are for reference only.              Some evidence or documentation must be available upon request,           but it is not necessary to have all of the sources of evidence that           are listed .    In           addition, on-site team reviewers, in the final application phase, will           seek to review the evidence of student performance/production           validating the overall  quality  of the program.                                     The           use of the  Self-Assessment Guide            is actually the first step a district/K-12 vertical team should           take in determining the readiness for applying for the designation.              It is recommended that a committee of educators representing           all campuses involved work through the self-assessment to determine           first whether or not all of the acceptable indicators are being           implemented in the campuses involved.              If the group finds that all of those requirements are in place,           they would move on to examine the indicators found in the recognized           column and then the exemplary column.              The committee may realize that all indicators are not present           and then the assessment guide becomes a tool for program planning,           evaluation, and development.    Should           the committee determine that all indicators are present, they may           decide to move forward with the complete application process.                                     While           the  Self-Assessment Guide            assists campuses and districts in determining the presence of           recognized and exemplary indicators, it does not necessarily address           quality implementation of the indicators.              The  Narrative Review  is a component of the application that provides           probing questions that challenge a district/K-12 vertical team to           examine the  quality  of services present.              It is particularly important to analyze the impact of the           services on student achievement, performance, and production.              A careful analysis of program services will provide a           self-study of the successful implementation of K-12 services for           gifted/talented students.    It           is critically important that responses to the  Narrative           Review  reveal the impact of the program services on achievement of           gifted/talented students at all grade levels.                                     The           final application to be submitted to the Texas Education Agency           consists of the cover page, the Statement of Assurances, and the           completed  Self-Assessment Guide  and  Narrative           Review.    Questions           concerning the  Quality of G/T           Services Program Review  may be addressed to the Division of           Advanced Academic Services by calling 512/463-9455, or through an           e-mail service to:    gted@tea.state.tx.us .                                                                                          Previous            Section           Table            of Contents           Next            Section                Texas Education Agency (TEA)    Advanced Academic Services  Phone:(512) 463-9455     Send comments or suggestions to:     gted@tea.state.tx.us
