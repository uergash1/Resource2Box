                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State. Currently, one of the greatest threats to fishing              opportunities on our forests is the spread of               whirling disease .

                  On the PSICC, we offer the angler many opportunities to experience              the fine fishing we have available. Our forests and grasslands offer              both warm and cold water fishing across an incredibly diverse              landscape.                             The PSICC manages over 2.3 million acres of public lands              southeastern Colorado and Kansas, from high-plains short-grass              prairies in the east to the towering 14,000 ft peaks of the              Collegiate and Mosquito ranges in the west. We are responsible for              over 4,000 miles of perennial rivers and streams, as well as              hundreds of high mountain lakes.                             We are also the home of the rare               Greenback Cutthroat trout  (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), the              Colorado State fish, which is listed as threatened both Federally              and by the State.
