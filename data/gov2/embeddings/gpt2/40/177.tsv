GX001-16-13544482	Introduction  For nearly a decade, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has led the quest for in-depth knowledge and understanding of the cosmos.    Since its launch in April 1990, the HST has provided scientific data and images of unprecedented resolution from which many new and exciting discoveries have been made. Even when reduced to raw numbers, the accomplishments of the 12.5-ton orbiting observatory are impressive:     Hubble has taken over 259,000 exposures.  Hubble has observed nearly 13,000 astronomical targets.  Astronomers using Hubble data have published over 2.400 scientific papers.  Circling Earth every 90 minutes, Hubble has traveled more than 1.425 billion miles, which is nearly the distance from Earth to Uranus.       This unique observatory operates around the clock above the Earth's atmosphere gathering information for teams of scientists who study virtually all the constituents of the universe. The Telescope is an invaluable tool for examining planets, stars, star-forming regions of the Milky Way, distant galaxies and quasars, and the tenuous hydrogen gas lying between the galaxies.     The Telescope's purpose is to spend 20 years probing the farthest and faintest reaches of the cosmos. Crucial to fulfilling this objective is a series of on-orbit manned servicing missions. To date, there have been three servicing missions; the first in December 1993, then February 1997, and December 1999. The next servicing mission is planned for Fall 2001.     During these missions, astronauts perform planned repairs and maintenance activities to restore and upgrade the observatory's capabilities.  Items such as solar arrays, gyros, fine guidance sensors, and the main flight computer, have been replaced. The complement of scientific instruments has also been modified over the years to improve the HST's ability to search the cosmos.      Flight Software Branch Involvement  Beginning in the late 1970's, Lockheed (the lead contractor for NASA's great observatory) developed the Telescope and its many components. The software for the flight computer and the instrument computers was developed in Sunnyvale.     In the mid-1990's the  HST Flight Project Office  at the  Goddard Space Flight Center  created several Product Development Teams (PDTs) to reach its Vision 2000 goals. Two Flight Software PDTs were formed; the Support Systems Module (SSM) PDT and the Payload PDT. Both teams support the daily operations of the Telescope, including anomaly investigation, FSW upgrades, and new development.     The SSM Product Development Team worked to develop software for the new flight computer that was to replace the original 1970's technology computer that controlled commanding, telemetry, and attitude control.  As the Telescope ages, it is expected that the software will need to be flexible and support changing power requirements (due to aging batteries, new solar arrays, new instruments) and help to compensate for failing hardware.     The Payload Product Development Team develops new software for the scientific instruments onboard the Hubble. Instruments such as the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), have replaced older technology, and improved observing capabilities. The Payload PDT is also responsible for the NASA Standard Spacecraft Computer - 1 (NSSC-1), which controls all the payload instruments.     Currently, the Payload PDT is developing flight software for the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), which is scheduled to be installed during the upcoming Servicing Mission in the Fall 2001. Additionally, the team is developing flight software for the   Wide Field Planetary Camera - 3  (WFC3) and the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS),  scheduled to be installed on the last Servicing Mission in 2003.     While development proceeds within both the SSM PDT and the Payload PDT, incredible new  scientific discoveries  continue.

The installation of new instruments                extended Hubble's wavelength range into the near infrared for imaging                and spectroscopy, allowing us to probe the most distant reaches                of the universe. The replacement of failed or degraded spacecraft                components increased efficiency and performance.                    SM2 Images               Three categories of items made up the mission payload:                               Science instruments to enhance science productivity                 Primary spacecraft maintenance items                 Secondary spacecraft maintenance items                                                                                                                                                                                                            New Science Instruments                                                  The Space                    Telescope Imaging Spectrograph  (STIS)  provides                     Hubble with  unique and powerful spectroscopic capabilities .                    A spectrograph separates the light gathered by the telescope                    into its spectral components so that the composition, temperature,                    motion, and other chemical and physical properties can be analyzed.                                    STIS's two-dimensional detectors have allowed the instrument                    to gather 30 times more spectral data and 500 times more spatial                    data than the previous spectrographs on Hubble. These were capable                    of only looking at one place at a time.                   One of the greatest advantages to using STIS is in the  study                    of supermassive black holes . STIS searches for massive black                    holes by studying the star and gas dynamics around galactic                    centers. It measures the distribution of matter in the universe                    by studying quasar absorption lines. It also uses its high sensitivity                    and spatial resolution to study star formation in distant galaxies                    and perform spectroscopic mapping of solar system objects.                                                    The                    Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer  (NICMOS)                      has let us gain valuable new information on the dusty centers                    of galaxies and the formation of stars and planets. NICMOS consists                    of three cameras. It is capable of both infrared imaging and                    spectroscopic observations of astronomical targets.                   NICMOS                    gave astronomers their  first clear view of the universe at                    near-infrared wavelengths  between 0.8 and 2.5 micrometers                    - longer wavelengths than the human eye can see. (The expansion                    of the universe shifts the light from very distant objects toward                    longer red and infrared wavelengths.)                   NICMOS's near infrared capabilities have provided  views                    of objects too distant for research by previous Hubble optical                    and ultraviolet instruments . NICMOS's detectors also perform                    more efficiently than previous infrared detectors. With its                    cryogenics depleted, NICMOS is now dormant and awaiting the                    installation of a new cooling system in SM3B.                                                             Primary Spacecraft Hardware replacements included the following:                                                                Refurbished Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS)                    Hubble uses this optical sensor provide pointing information                    for the spacecraft and as a scientific instrument for astrometric                    science. The modification to this FGS spare added the capability                    for ground-controlled alignment corrections.                                                                                The addition of an Optical Control Electronics Enhancement                    Kit (OCE-EK)                    The OCE-EK provided the electronic pathway for commanding the                    alignment mechanisms.                                                    The Solid State Recorder (SSR)                     This recorder replaced one of Hubble's three Engineering                    Science Tape Recorders (ESTR). The SSR provides much more flexibility                    than an ESTR, which is a reel-to-reel recorder and can store                    ten times more data. One of the other ESTRs was also replaced,                    but with a spare ESTR unit. During SM3A mission the reel-to-reel                    units were replaced with solid state recorders.                                                    Reaction Wheel Assemblies (RWA)                    One of Hubble's four RWA's was replaced by a refurbished spare.                    The RWA is part of Hubble's Pointing Control System. Spin momentum                    in the wheels moves the telescope to a target and maintains                    it in a stable position.                                                                      Secondary Spacecraft Hardware                    Four Data Interface Units (DIU) on Hubble provide command and                    data interfaces between the spacecraft's data management system                    and the other HST subsystems. DIU-2 was replaced with a spare                    unit that has been modified and upgraded to correct for failures                    that occurred in the original unit.                                                    The Solar Array Drive Electronics (SADE)                     This controls the positioning of the solar arrays. Hubble                    has two SADE's of which one was replaced during the first servicing                    mission. The unit that was returned from orbit has been refurbished                    to correct for problems that resulted in transistor failures                    has been will be used to replace the second unit, SADE-2. The                    SADEs are provided by the European Space Agency, NASA's partner                    in the Hubble program.                   The crew has taken more than 150 other crew aids and tools                    on this mission. They range from a simple bag for carrying some                    of the smaller tools to sophisticated, battery-operated power                    tools.                                             Doing the Job               A seven-member crew took part in this mission. Four astronauts                conducted the planned spacewalks: Mark Lee, Gregory Harbaugh, Steven                Smith and Joseph Tanner were part of the extravehicular activity                crew. Kenneth Bowersox was the commander, Scott Horowitz was the                pilot, and Steven Hawley was the Remote Manipulator System Operator.

GX010-84-2130055	"Hubble Facts     National Aeronautics and Space Administration    Goddard Space Flight Center    Greenbelt, Maryland 20771      FS-1999-06-017-GSFC    Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Mission 3A   --   Service Call to Hubble      The Hubble Space Telescope Third Servicing Mission, originally scheduled for June 2000, has been divided into two missions. The first part, called SM3A, will be this fall, and the second part, SM3B, is tentatively scheduled for late 2000. This is in response to recent problems with several of Hubble’s gyro-scopes, which are required to accurately point the telescope at its scientific targets around the sky. During SM3A, astronauts will replace the gyroscopes, upgrade other telescope subsystems and perform scheduled preventative maintenance. In late 2000 a crew of astronauts will complete the remaining upgrades planned for Servicing Mission 3, including the insertion of a new, technologically advanced camera.        Hubble’s Mission      The Hubble Space Telescope’s mission is to spend 20 years probing the farthest and faintest reaches of the cosmos. This unique observatory operates around the clock, above the Earth’s atmosphere, to gather information for teams of scientists who study virtually all the components of our universe, including planets, star-forming regions of the Milky Way galaxy, distant galaxies and quasars.     Crucial to fulfilling this mission is a series of scheduled, on-orbit manned servicing missions. During these servicing missions, astronauts perform a number of planned repairs and maintenance activities to upgrade the observatory’s capabilities. The First Servicing Mission took place in December 1993, the Second Servicing Mission in February 1997. Servicing Mission 3Ais scheduled for the fall of 1999 and 3B is scheduled for 2001. The Fourth and final Servicing Mission is currently planned for 2003.      Mission Overview      The nine-day mission, STS-103 is scheduled for the fall of 1999. Members of the STS-103 flight crew are: Commander, Curtis L. Brown; Pilot, Scott J. Kelly; Payload Commander, Steven L. Smith; and Mission Specialists C. Michael Foale, John M. Grunsfeld, Claude Nicollier (European Space Agency), and Jean-Francois Clervoy, Mission Specialist (European Space Agency).     Working in pairs on alternating days, the four Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Crew-members will replace all six of the Telescope’s gyroscopes, a guidance sensor and Hubble’s main computer. They also will fit Hubble with a new transmitter and solid state data recorder, and they will attach voltage/temperature improvement kits to Hubble’s six batteries. The EVAcrew also will add new thermal coverings to Hubble’s exterior. Astronauts will complete these tasks in four scheduled EVAdays.     This service call will leave Hubble renewed and refurbished to continue its 20-year science mission..    What’s Being Replaced     Rate Sensor Units:  The Rate Sensor Units allow the Telescope to point at stars, planets and other celestial targets. Three are aboard Hubble, and each unit contains two gyroscopes. Hubble needs three of these six gyroscopes to meet its very precise pointing requirements, and the other three are spares. Gyroscopes have limited lifetimes, and currently only three of the six are working proper-ly the minimum number needed to continue science operations. Astronauts will replace all three units, leaving Hubble with six fresh gyroscopes.    Fine Guidance Sensor:  This is the second in a ""round-robin"" series of changeouts and refurbishments of the three fine guidance sensors, which allow fine pointing and keep Hubble stable. The SM3A refurbished Fine Guidance Sensor is the same unit that was returned from Servicing Mission 2. The Fine Guidance Sensor returned from this mission will be refurbished and upgraded for re-use on Hubble’s fourth Servicing Mission.      New Spacecraft Computer:  The radiation-rugged computer will replace Hubble’s original, outdated main computer. The new computer will dramatically increase operational capabilities, reduce the burden of flight software maintenance, and significantly lower operational costs.      Voltage/Temperature Improvement Kits:  As Hubble’s batteries age, they become more susceptible to overheating if overcharged. The Voltage/Temperature Improvement Kit compensates for this by lowering the battery’s charge termination voltage. Astronauts will install one kit for each of Hubble’s six batteries.      Spare S-Band Single Access Transmitter:  The transmitter replaces an aged and failed unit. That unit will be removed, returned to Earth and refurbished for a later flight.      Spare Solid State Recorder:  The digital data recorder will serve as a high capacity backup to the Solid State Recorder that replaced a mechanical tape recorder in 1997. It is essential for efficiently handling the high volumes of data from Hubble’s newest instruments and for maintaining high science productivity.      New Outer Blanket Layer:  Stainless steel sheets will be installed in various locations on the Telescope to help control Hubble’s internal tem-perature. Covered with a protective thermal coat-ing, these sheets will fit over existing insulation that has degraded.     The following tasks will be performed on SM3A, time permitting. If there is insufficient time, these tasks will be completed on SM3B:      Shell/Shield Replacement Fabric:  Flexible aluminized Teflon sheets will be added to the exterior surfaces of Hubble’s forward shell and light shield. This protective covering provides additional insulation against the harsh space environment.      Aft Shroud Latch Repair Kit:  Astronauts will replace latches on Hubble’s bay door. During Servicing Mission - 2, Astronauts observed galling on these latches. The galling was caused by high torque.      Handrail Covers:  Fiberglass cloth, called beta cloth, will be fitted like sleeves around the handrails above the Fine Guidance Sensors bay to prevent contamination to the Aft Shroud area. Flaking paint was observed on these handrails during Servicing Mission - 2."

Here are a few factors that cool            the planet:                                                                                                   A                  huge cloud of volcanic ash                  and gas rises above Mount                  Pinatubo, Phillippines, in                  June of 1991. Ash from volcanic                  eruptions can reflect sunlight,                  lowering surface temperatures.                                        Reflected sunlight. Aerosols              are very small particles or droplets,              and they arise from both natural              (soil, sea spray) and human-made              (sulfur dioxide, emitted during              coal and oil combustion) sources.              In the atmosphere, aerosols reflect              the sun away from the earth, thereby              cooling it. Ice (such as sheets              in Antarctica) also reflects sunlight.                                        Modified clouds. Aerosols in              the troposphere (the lowest layer              of the Earth’s atmosphere)              modify clouds, decreasing the              size of droplets of water vapor              and making the cloud “whiter,”              and more reflective of the sun.              They can also change the persistence              of clouds.                                        Volcanic eruptions. Large volcanic              eruptions, such as Mount Pinatubo              in the Philippines in 1991, blast              aerosols into the stratosphere              (the next layer of the atmosphere),              where they can reflect the sun              and depress mean global surface              temperatures for up to three or              four years.                                        Stratospheric ozone depletion.              Stratospheric ozone depletion              acts to slightly cool the Earth’s              surface by reducing the absorption              of energy in the lower stratosphere.              (Stratospheric ozone is not to              be confused with ground-level              ozone, or “smog,”              which can be harmful to human              health at elevated levels.)                                        Variable sun and changes in              the earth’s orbit. Some              studies suggest that the sun’s              radiant energy output may vary              naturally, possibly contributing              to some warming early in this              century. (Satellite observations              since 1979 show no increase in              such solar radiation.) The Earth’s              orbit around the sun and tilt              on its axis also play into the              amount of solar radiation absorbed              at the ground surface.                                  |  Search   |  Index   |  Ask MPCA     |  Home  |       This document was    last updated March 17, 2003    If you have suggestions on how we can improve  our service to you, please drop us a  note.

The          new camera was installed on Hubble by astronauts during a shuttle mission          last March, the fourth Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission. During          five of the most challenging spacewalks ever attempted, the crew successfully          upgraded the orbiting telescope with the new camera, a new power unit,          new solar arrays and an experimental cooling unit for an infrared camera.          Hubble managers say the orbiting telescope has been operating superbly          since the servicing mission.         ""Today          marks the beginning of a new era of exploration with Hubble,"" said          Dr. Ed Weiler, Associate Administrator for Space Science at NASA Headquarters,          Washington. ""Our team of scientists and engineers on the ground and          the astronauts in space once again did the impossible. After 12 years          in space, Hubble not only was given a major overhaul, its new camera has          already shown us that, even after 12 years of great science and astounding          images, we haven't seen anything yet.""         Among          the suite of four ""suitable-for-framing"" Advanced Camera for          Surveys (ACS) science-demonstration pictures released today is a stunning          view of a colliding galaxy, dubbed the ""Tadpole,"" located 420          million light-years away. Unlike textbook images of stately galaxies,          the ""Tadpole"" -- with a long tail of stars -- captures the essence          of a dynamic, restless and violent universe, looking like a runaway pinwheel          firework.         ""The          ACS is opening a wide new window onto the universe. These are among the          best images of the distant universe humans have ever seen,"" said          astronomer Holland Ford of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, lead          scientist in the camera's seven-year development.         The          camera's tenfold increase in efficiency will open up much anticipated          new capability for discovery. ""ACS will allow us to push back the          frontier of the early universe. We will be able to enter the 'twilight          zone' period when galaxies were just beginning to form out of the blackness          following the cooling of the universe from the big bang,"" said Ford.         The          ACS is a camera of superlatives. It is expected to surpass the sensitivity          of the largest ground-based telescope to eventually see the very faintest          objects ever recorded. The camera delivers a panoramic crispness comparable          to that of a wide-screen movie, containing 16 million picture elements          (megapixels) per image. By comparison, digital photos from typical consumer          cameras are 2 to 4 megapixels.         The          ACS image of the Tadpole illustrates the dramatic gains over the Wide          Field Planetary Camera 2 resulting from doubling the area and resolution,          and demonstrates a five-fold improvement in sensitivity. An unexpected          bonus is the enormous number of galaxies in the new Hubble image beyond          the Tadpole galaxy, giving it an appearance like the galaxy-filled Hubble          Deep Field (HDF) image, taken in 1995. However, the ACS picture was taken          in one-twelfth the time it took for the original HDF. Like the Hubble          Deep Field, the ACS galaxies contain myriad shapes that are snapshots          of galaxies throughout the universe's 13 billion-year evolution. The ACS          images are so sharp astronomers can identify ""building blocks""          of galaxies, colliding galaxies and extremely distant galaxies in the          field -- an exquisite sampler of galaxies.         ""The          ACS will let us obtain the deepest image of the universe for the foreseeable          future,"" added astronomer Garth Illingworth of the University of          California, Lick Observatory, Santa Cruz, the deputy leader for the camera          team.         The          other pictures include a stunning collision between two spiral galaxies,          dubbed ""the Mice,"" that presage what might happen to our own          Milky Way several billion years in the future when it collides with the          neighboring galaxy in the constellation Andromeda. Computer simulations          show that we are seeing the collision of the Mice approximately 160 million          years after their closest encounter. Running the simulations forward in          time shows that the two galaxies will eventually merge. A similar fate          may await the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy.         Looking          closer to home, ACS imaged the ""Cone Nebula,"" a craggy-looking          mountaintop of cold gas and dust that is a cousin to Hubble's iconic ""pillars          of creation"" in the Eagle Nebula, photographed in 1995.         Peering          into a celestial maternity ward called the M17 Swan Nebula, the ACS revealed          a watercolor fantasy-world tapestry of vivid colors and glowing ridges          of gas. Embedded in this crucible of star creation are embryonic planetary          systems. In addition to the ACS, spacewalking astronauts installed a new          high-tech mechanical ""refrigerator"" on Hubble during the servicing          mission. This ""cryocooler"" has successfully pumped most of the          heat out of the interior of the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object          Spectrometer (NICMOS), achieving and maintaining to within a few hundredths          of one degree the target temperature for neon gas passing through the          instrument of 70 degrees Kelvin (minus 203 degrees Centigrade or minus          333 degrees Fahrenheit).         Engineers          are now in the process of checking out the operation of the resuscitated          NICMOS instrument. By early June, scientists expect to release the first          astronomical images taken with the NICMOS since 1998, when it was still          being cooled by a rapidly depleting block of solid nitrogen ice.         The          new rigid solar arrays, working with the new Power Control Unit, are generating          27 percent more electrical power than the previous arrays. This doubles          the electrical power that can be allocated to the scientific instruments          on Hubble. The new reaction wheel is operating normally. Nearly a month          ago, the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and the Wide Field and Planetary          Camera 2 resumed science observations.         ""This          servicing mission has turned out to be an extraordinary success,""          said Preston Burch, Hubble Project Manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight          Center in Greenbelt, Md. ""It was the most difficult and complicated          Hubble servicing mission attempted to date and our observatory came through          it with flying colors.""

GX006-12-9554989	Nancy Neal       Nancy.G.Neal.1@gsfc.nasa.gov      (Phone: 301-286-0039)       April 20, 1999          RELEASE NO: 99-48      STATUS REPORT: HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE AILING GYROSOPE FAILS    An ailing gyroscope on NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope that engineers had anticipated would fail since it first started behaving erratically in January 1999, stopped functioning today. The powerful telescope continues to operate normally on its three good gyroscopes.    At approximately 9 a.m. EDT today, gyroscope No. 3 failed. The telescope’s operators detected the failure when the gyroscope’s motor current dropped instantaneously to zero.     Gyroscope 3 is inoperable. Gyroscopes 1, 2 and 5 are the three working gyroscopes remaining aboard Hubble and are functioning normally. The ailing gyroscope has not been used for pointing purposes since it began acting erratically. Because it was not active in the guiding loop, there is no impact to the science program.     Hubble requires three of its normal complement of six gyros to point accurately the telescope for science observations. The failure of gyroscope 3 means there are no available spares. Any further gyroscope failure will cause the observatory to go into a protective safe mode that gives ground controllers complete control of the telescope, but prevents its use for taking observations of the sky.     Hubble will be visited by a Space Shuttle crew in October during Servicing Mission 3A. Astronauts will replace all the gyroscopes, a fine guidance sensor, a transmitter, a spare solid state recorder and a high voltage/temperature kit for protecting batteries from overheating. Plus, the crew will install an advanced computer.    Servicing Mission 3B, to be conducted in year 2000, will install a new scientific instrument, the Advance Camera for Surveys, as well as new solar arrays and a new cooling system. Both missions will patch over telescope skin that has degraded over the years.

Comparison of the new ""cryocooler""                       to the original solid ice cooling method for NICMOS is essentially                       the same as the comparison of a modern refrigerator to the                       icebox of one hundred years ago. The Cryocooler has two main                       pieces---the cooler itself which was installed and plugged                       into NICMOS inside Hubble, and a radiator that is strapped                       on the outside. Neon gas, shown in green, begins circulating                       between the cooler and the NICMOS drawing heat away from NICMOS.                       A second loop of neon, shown in blue, draws heat out of the                       first loop. Ammonia, shown in red, is the third loop, which                       draws heat out of the second loop and transfers the heat into                       the radiator, shown on the outside of Hubble.

After                       more than three years of inactivity, and thanks                       to a new cryogenic refrigerator, the Hubble Space                       Telescope's Near Infrared Camera and Multi Object                       Spectrometer (NICMOS) today debuts various breathtaking                       views of galaxies in several stages of development.                      The                       first NICMOS test images demonstrate its powerful new                       capability for making remarkable discoveries unique to                       space-based near-infrared astronomy. The NICMOS' penetrating                                             vision sliced through the edge-on dusty disk of a galaxy,                                             NGC 4013, to peer all the way into the galaxy's core.                       Astronomers were surprised to see what appears to be an                       edge-on ring of stars, 720 light-years across, encircling                                             the nucleus. Though such star-rings are not uncommon in                       barred-spiral galaxies, only NICMOS has the resolution to                                             see the ring buried deep inside an edge-on galaxy.

Shifting                       its infrared vision to our stellar backyard, NICMOS                       peeled back the outer layers of the Cone nebula (also                       photographed by Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys in                       April) to see the underlying dusty ""bedrock"" in                       this stellar                       ""pillar of creation.""                      ""It                       is fantastic that we have restored Hubble's infrared                       eyesight. NICMOS has taken us to the very fringes of the                       Universe and to a time when the first galaxies were formed.                                             We can't wait to get back out there,"" said Dr. Rodger                                             Thompson, NICMOS Principle Investigator, University of                       Arizona, Tucson.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Image                             3                                                                                                                                                                      Installed                       on Hubble in February 1997, NICMOS used infrared vision to                       probe dark, dusty, never-before-seen regions of                       space with the optical clarity that only Hubble can provide.                                             Its infrared detectors operated at a very cold temperature                                             (minus 351 degrees Fahrenheit, which is minus 213 degrees                                             Celsius or 60 degrees Kelvin).                       To                       keep the detectors cold, NICMOS was encased in a thermos-                      like container filled with solid nitrogen ice. It was                       expected that the solid nitrogen ice would last                       approximately four years. However, the ice evaporated about                                             twice as fast as planned and was depleted after only 23                       months of NICMOS science operations. In 1999 -- with its                       supply of ice exhausted -- NICMOS became dormant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Image                             4                                                                                                   Click                           on pic for animation.                                                                  Determined                       not to be defeated, NASA scientists and engineers                       devised a plan to restore NICMOS to life. They turned to a                                             new mechanical cooling technology, jointly developed by NASA                                             and the U.S. Air Force. The NICMOS Cooling System (NCS) was                                             built by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.,                                             and the Creare Corporation, Hanover, N.H.                       The                       mechanical cooler operates on principles similar to a                       modern home refrigerator. It pumps ultra-cold neon gas                       through the internal plumbing of the instrument. At its core                                             are three miniature, high-tech turbines that spin at rates                                             up to about 430,000 rpm. Since the speed of the turbines can                                             be adjusted at will, the NICMOS light sensors can be                       operated at a more optimal temperature than was possible                       before, about 77 degrees Kelvin (minus 321 degrees                       Fahrenheit).                       The                       NICMOS cooling system is virtually vibration-free, an                       important aspect for Hubble since vibrations can affect                       image quality in much the same way that a shaky camera                       produces blurred pictures.                       ""The                       Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Mission 3B is now                       demonstrated to be a complete success. We had 100 percent                                             servicing mission success, and now we have 100 percent                       performance success for the newly installed NICMOS Cooling                                             System,"" said Dr. Ed Cheng, HST Development Project                       Scientist from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.                      Astronauts                       installed the NCS inside Hubble during the fifth                       and final spacewalk of Servicing Mission 3B on March 8,                       2002. On March 18, the NCS was turned on via commands sent                                             from the Space Telescope Operations Control Center at                       Goddard. It has continued to operate flawlessly ever since.                                             The deep interior of the NICMOS reached the target                       temperature of 70 degrees Kelvin (minus 333 degrees                       Fahrenheit) on April 11. Most of the internal heat had been                                             removed from the instrument, and the NCS stabilized itself                                             at this temperature. On April 19, NICMOS was brought up to                       a                       fully operational state and testing of its internal                       condition began. Since then, fine adjustments have been made                                             to the settings of the NCS to optimize the instrument for                                             best performance.

INTRODUCTION  Volcanoes are found on every continent of the Earth and undersea. According to Simkin and Siebert,1 more than 1,500 volcanoes have been active in the past 10,000 yr, accounting for 8,000 known eruptions. About 400 volcanoes erupted during the 20th century. Some two-thirds of the volcanoes are located in the Northern Hemisphere and, similarly, some two-thirds are found to lie around the Pacific Ocean margin, reflecting a predilection of the occurrence of volcanic eruptions to tectonic plate movements. Episodes of temporary cooling have long been suspected of being related to the occurrences of large volcanic eruptions. For example, Franklin2 suggested that perhaps the eruption of an Icelandic volcano was responsible for the unusual weather of 17831784 in Europe, and Lamb3 described many of the unusual meteorological effects that followed particular large volcanic eruptions. These effects, lasting for months to years, include strange sunsets and reduction of the direct measurement of normal-incidence solar radiation by 10 percent or more, in addition to temporary cooling.411 Furthermore, large volcanic eruptions have been linked to enhanced sulfate concentrations in ice cores1214 and to changes in tree ring densities.1517 According to Robock,11 large volcanic eruptions influence climate by injecting large amounts of chemically and microphysically active gases and solid aerosol particles directly into the stratosphere.1821 These gases and aerosol particles have an e-folding residence time of 1 yr. They affect the Earth's radiation balance and disturb the chemical equilibrium of the stratosphere, leading to cooling at the Earth's surface (0.10.2 C) and heating in the stratosphere, with these effects often lasting 23 yr or more. Following the eruption, the cloud of sulfate gases and aerosol particles spread outward from the eruption site, encircling the globe and expanding toward both poles in a matter of weeks. The actual degree of spreading depends upon the particular distribution of winds at the time of the eruption and the latitude of the volcano. The sulfur species (mainly sulfur dioxide) react with the hydroxy group (OH) and water to form sulfuric acid. It is the resulting sulfuric acid aerosols that produce the dominant radiative effects. Recently, Hyde and Crowley22 noted that a number of climate model predictions indicate that the average global temperature should rise about 0.10.3 C over the next 1015 yr. Furthermore, they suggested that the occurrences of large volcanic eruptions might mask the global warming effects of carbon dioxide. Specifically, on the basis of a 600-yr chronology of Northern Hemispheric eruptions inferred from ice cores, they determined probability density functions that allowed for the estimate of the probable occurrence within the next 10 yr of one or two climatically significant volcanic eruptions. They found that the probability of a radiative perturbation of 1 W m2 or larger occurring in the next 10 yr is about 3540 percent, the 1   probability of two such eruptions is 15 percent, and the probability of three such eruptions is 5 percent. (They found the probability of no such eruptions to be 44 percent.) Also, they deduced that the probability of a Pinatubo-scale eruption (volcanic explosivity index (VEI) = 6) in the next decade is 20 percent, and the probability for an El Chichn-scale eruption (VEI = 5) in the next decade is 25 percent. Hyde and Crowley conclude ""that there is a reasonable chance of a volcanic eruption influencing the evolution of the anthropogenic signal over the next 10 years."" In this study, the number of known cataclysmic volcanic eruptions per decade over the past 250 yr (between 17501993), based on the compilation of Simkin and Siebert,1 is determined. A cataclysmic volcanic eruption is one having a VEI 4, and it is these that are believed most likely to influence climate. (Strictly speaking, it is the sulfur richness of the eruption that determines whether or not it will have a significant effect on global climate.) A simple two-point moving average is applied upon the resultant time series to ascertain the expected number of cataclysmic volcanic eruptions during the present decade (2000 2009). Then by means of Poisson statistics, various probabilities of occurrence are estimated. Thus this study provides an alternate way of determining the likelihood that a climatically significant volcanic eruption will occur within the next 10 yr, as compared to that of Hyde and Crowley.22  2   2. RESULTS  Figure 1 plots the number of cataclysmic volcanic eruptions per decade, known to have occurred between 1750 and 1993, taken directly from Simkin and Siebert.1 The eruptions are divided by hemispheric subgroupings: Panel (a) is the extra-tropical Southern Hemisphere (N(ETSH)), panel (b) is the tropics (N(T)), panel (c) is the extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere (N(ETNH)), and panel (d) is the combined data set (N(Combined)) which ignores the hemispheric location of the eruption. The number of events, mean, and standard deviation are given for each subgrouping. Additionally, for the combined grouping, a twopoint moving average is displayed (the heavy line), showing that prior to about 1860, the number of cataclysmic eruptions per decade appears fewer than thereafter--an indication, perhaps, that the record might be less reliable before the mid-1800's. Across the top are filled triangles, denoting the occurrences of volcanic events with a VEI 5. These particular events are identified for convenience in table 1. Such events are routinely identified as being among the largest of stratospheric-aerosol-producing volcanic eruptions.7,11,13,15 Using the combined data set, one finds that since 1750, there have been at least 123 cataclysmic volcanic eruptions. Slightly more than half occurred in the tropics and only 4 percent occurred in the extra-tropical Southern Hemisphere. The largest value yet observed for the two-point moving averages is found to have occurred in the 1910's, having a value of 8.00 (being associated with the peak number of actual events for the entire sample which measures 11.00). Since then, the two-point moving averages have remained relatively flat, varying between 5.00 and 6.00, at least, until the 1980's when it suddenly jumped to 6.50. (The trend of the two-point moving averages since the 1930's appears to be directed upward.) Figure 2 displays the variation of the first differences (fd's) of the two-point moving averages. The first difference is computed as the next two-point moving average minus the present two-point moving average. For 16 of 23 decades (70 percent), the observed fd has been within one unit of the last available value of the two-point moving average. Hence, one approximates the next two-point moving average as being equal to the last available two-point moving average plus/minus one unit. Thus the decade of the 1990's should have a two-point moving average of 6.50  1.00, providing it is not a statistical outlier, implying that the actual rate of cataclysmic volcanic eruptions for the present decade (20002009) should be 7  4. Table 2 gives the observed decadal rate (r) of cataclysmic volcanic eruptions and the associated Poisson probability distribution for each of the groupings shown in figure 1. The Poisson distribution is quite useful for measuring the probability of occurrence in positively (rightward) skewed discrete distributions, where knowledge of the mean number of random events that occur within a given time interval is plainly known.23 One finds that at least two events per decade have been seen since 1750, using the combined data set. The probability of having no cataclysmic volcanic eruptions during the decade of 20002009 is computed to be only 0.7 percent, implying that the probability of having at least one event is >99 percent.  3   (a) Numbers  5 4 3 2 1  N(ETSH)  5, m = 0.20, sd = 0.41  (b) 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Numbers  N(T)  63, m = 2.52, sd = 2.00  (c) Numbers  5 4 3 2 1  N(ETNH)  55, m = 2.20, sd = 1.32  (d) 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Numbers  N(Combined)  123, m = 4.92, sd = 2.36  1750's  1800's  1850's 1900's Decades  1950's  2000's  Figure 1.

From table 2, one finds that the actual observed range of cataclysmic eruptions per decade is 211. Presuming that the decadal rate (r) will be 7  4 for the decade of 20002009, from the Poisson probability distribution one computes the probability for such a rate to be 87 percent. Hence, one infers a very strong likelihood that several cataclysmic eruptions will be seen during this decade. Table 3 gives the observed decadal rate (r) of VEI events 5 and the associated Poisson probability distribution for the combined data set. The probability of occurrence of one of these largest of events within the next decade, with the associated large stratospheric-aerosol injections, is 49 percent. The probability of at least two such events is 15 percent, while the probability is 4 percent that at least three such events will occur. Although not shown, the probability of at least one VEI event 6 occurring within the next 10 yr is 18 percent and the probability of at least two such events occurring is 2 percent. It is only 0.1 percent for three or more such events occurring. 5   Table 2.

DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY  Since the 1880's, a prominent feature of long-term temperature studies has been the appearance of warming.2430 This warming is directly attributable to both natural climate variability and the increasing effects of human activity on climate.3134 Differentiating the relative proportion of each has been and continues to be both scientifically and politically important.35 Recently, Karl et al.36 have reported that during the interval of May 1997 to September 1998, each month broke the previous monthly all-time-record high temperature. In fact, researchers have found that the inferred average temperature in the 20th century is probably the warmest of the past five centuries.37 As previously noted, Hyde and Crowley22 have recently examined the statistical properties of a proxy record of climatically significant volcanic eruptions to determine the likelihood of future eruptions within the next 1015 yr. Furthermore, they noted that the occurrence of one or more major volcanic eruptions likely would confuse the debate regarding temperature trends and the effects of human activity on climate. Their results indicated that there is indeed a reasonably good chance that a major volcanic eruption will occur within the next 10 yr, one that might influence the evolution of the anthropogenic signal. Specifically, they determined that there is a 20-percent probability for a Pinatubo-scale eruption (VEI = 6) and a 25-percent chance for an El Chichn-scale eruption (VEI = 5), both archetypes known to have temporarily cooled the Earth's surface air temperatures.7,11,38 This complementary study, using actual counts of cataclysmic volcanic eruptions (i.e., those of VEI 4) over the past 250 yr, taken from Simkin and Siebert,1 and Poisson statistics, determined the probability distribution for such events. Over the past 25 decades, each has seen at least two cataclysmic volcanic eruptions, usually located in the tropics or extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere. On average, nearly five such eruptions per decade were seen, with the largest number having occurred in the 1910's (11 events). Many of these cataclysmic events are known to have produced short-term global cooling, as evinced from surface air temperature records and proxies (i.e., ice cores and tree rings). The actual proportion of cataclysmic events that have known associations with short-term global cooling arguably is 0.1 to nearly 1, depending upon the size, location, and time of year of the eruption. For the largest of events (VEI 5), there appears to be an 49 percent chance that at least one will occur within the next 10 yr and an 15 percent chance that at least two will occur. The usual behavior of the first difference of the two-point moving averages of the number of cataclysmic volcanic eruptions suggests that one should expect 7  4 during the present decade, having a probability of occurrence of 87 percent. The probability of at least one El Chichn-scale event (VEI = 5) is computed to be 47 percent (slightly higher than that found by Hyde and Crowley22), while it is 14 percent that at least two will occur and 3 percent that at least three will occur. The probability of at least one Pinatubo-scale event (VEI = 6) is computed to be 15 percent (slightly less than that found by Hyde and Crowley22), while there is an 1 percent chance that at least two will occur, and <0.1 percent that at least three will occur. The probability of at least one event where VEI is 6 is 18 percent. Therefore, as previously recognized by Hyde and Crowley22 on the basis of proxy volcanic data (sulfate measurements in the ice core record), it seems quite reasonable to expect at least one climatically significant volcanic eruption within the next 10 yr. 7   REFERENCES  1.

ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words)  Since 1750, the number of cataclysmic volcanic eruptions (volcanic explosivity index (VEI) 4) per decade spans 211, with 96 percent located in the tropics and extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere. A two-point moving average of the volcanic time series has higher values since the 1860's than before, being 8.00 in the 1910's (the highest value) and 6.50 in the 1980's, the highest since the 1910's peak. Because of the usual behavior of the first difference of the twopoint moving averages, one infers that its value for the 1990's will measure 6.50  1, implying that 7  4 cataclysmic volcanic eruptions should be expected during the present decade (20002009). Because cataclysmic volcanic eruptions (especially those having VEI 5) nearly always have been associated with short-term episodes of global cooling, the occurrence of even one might confuse our ability to assess the effects of global warming. Poisson probability distributions reveal that the probability of one or more events with a VEI 4 within the next 10 yr is >99 percent. It is 49 percent for an event with a VEI 5, and 18 percent for an event with a VEI 6. Hence, the likelihood that a climatically significant volcanic eruption will occur within the next 10 yr appears reasonably high. 14. SUBJECT TERMS 15.

Even though initially impaired by a flaw in its main mirror (it was expertly made but to the wrong ""prescription,"" causing its images to be blurred), Hubble's position above the distortion of Earth's atmosphere enabled it to begin making major discoveries even before astronauts repaired it in 1993. When corrective optics were installed during that dramatic first servicing mission, the Universe suddenly snapped into sharp focus, and there followed a flood of spectacular images and discoveries which have forever changed how we view the cosmos.    ""Hubble's rate of discovery is simply unprecedented for any single observatory,"" said Dr. Ed Weiler, Associate Administrator for Space Science, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC, who has been associated with the Hubble program since 1978. ""But what may be even more important in the long term is what Hubble has given to just about everyone on Earth. Hubble's spectacular images and discoveries of black holes, colliding galaxies and bizarre objects at the edge of the Universe have been brought into millions of homes by newspapers, television and the Internet.""    In its first ten years, the 12.5-ton Earth-orbiting Hubble has studied 13,670 objects, has made 271,000 individual observations, and has returned 3.5 terabytes of data, which have been archived as a scientific treasure trove for future generations of astronomers. Its rapid-fire scientific achievements have resulted in over 2,651 scientific papers.    ""Not since Galileo aimed a small 30-power telescope into the night sky in 1609 has humanity's vision of the Universe been so revolutionized in such a short time span by a single instrument,"" said Dr. David Leckrone, Hubble Project Scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD. ""The Hubble Space Telescope has seen further and more clearly than any visible-light telescope before it, and has revolutionized the science of astronomy. It already has earned a place as one of the wonders of the modern world.""      Hubble's photographic hall of fame includes the deepest view ever of the Universe in visible light; a peek into the environs of supermassive galactic black holes; the majestic birth of stars in monstrous stellar clouds; planetary systems forming around other stars; extraordinary arcs, shells, and ribbons of glowing gas sculpted by the deaths of ordinary stars; mega-megaton blasts produced by the impact of a comet into the cloud tops of Jupiter; the surface of mysterious Pluto; and galaxies at the edge of space and time.    Hubble was conceived to tackle scientific goals that could be accomplished only by an observatory in space. Its mission is to spend 20 years probing the farthest and faintest reaches of the cosmos. Crucial to fulfilling this objective is a series of on- orbit servicing missions by Space Shuttle astronauts. The First Servicing Mission took place in December 1993 and Second Servicing Mission was flown in February 1997. Last December, Servicing Mission 3A was performed. These missions extended Hubble's scientific power with new instruments; modernized its systems with new technology; and performed critical maintenance and repairs of its optics, solar arrays, gyros and other components. As a result of these improvements, Hubble is a far more capable observatory than when it was launched. Future servicing missions to Hubble are planned for 2001 and 2003.    The telescope is named after U.S. astronomer Edwin P. Hubble who, early in this century, discovered galaxies beyond our Milky Way and made the first rough measurements of the expansion rate of space. Now, after 70 years of debate and speculation, astronomy has come full circle: scientists using the Hubble Telescope have detected galaxies out to the visible horizon of the Universe, and have accurately pinned down the size, expansion rate and age of the Universe.    Hubble will be decommissioned in 2010, and replaced by the Next Generation Space Telescope. Having a much larger mirror, the NGST will pick up where Hubble left off by searching for the faint glimmer of light from the first stars ever born in the Universe. Beyond NGST, ever larger and more advanced telescopes will search for Earth-like extrasolar planets and evidence for life beyond our solar system.    The Hubble Space Telescope is managed and operated by Goddard for the Office of Space Science at NASA Headquarters. The Space Telescope Science Institute manages the Hubble Telescope's science observing program under contract to NASA. The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and the European Space Agency.

The new computer is 20 times faster and has six times as much                       memory as the one it replaced. Commercially-developed, commonly-available                       equipment was used to build a new computer at a                       fraction of the price it would have cost to build a computer                       designed specifically for the spaceflight environment.                                             The greater capabilities of the new computer are increasing                       Hubble's productivity. The computer software also uses a modern                       programming language, which decreases software maintenance                       costs.                                                                                                                        Data Storage Capability                                             With the addition of a second Solid State Recorder (SSR) on                       SM3A, Hubble's data storage capability dramatically increased.                       The science data archiving rate is now more than ten times                       greater than 1993 rates.                                             Prior to SM2, Hubble used three reel-to-reel tape recorders                       designed in the 1970's. In February 1997, astronauts replaced                       one of the mechanical recorders with a digital SSR. In 1999,                       SM3A astronauts removed a second mechanical recorder and installed                       another digital SSR.                                             Unlike the reel-to-reel recorders they replace, the SSRs have                       no reels, no tape, and no moving parts that can wear out and                       limit lifetime. Data is stored digitally in computer-like                       memory chips until Hubble's operators command its playback.                       Although an SSR is about the same size and shape as the reel-to-reel                       recorder, it can store ten times as much data: 12 gigabits                       of data instead of only 1.2 gigabits. This greater storage                       capacity allows the second generation of Hubble's advanced-technology                       scientific instruments to be fully productive.                                                                                                                        Detector Technology                                             Hubble's state-of-the-art detector technology allows the telescope                       to capture and process faint amounts of light from the far                       reaches of space.                                             Charge-coupled device (CCD) detectors are commonly referred                       to as the ""film"" of digital cameras, but that description                       hardly does justice to this incredibly useful technology.                                             Modern CCD detectors match the resolution of film, but they                       surpass film in several key performance areas. For example,                       they are capable of operating over a much wider wavelength                       range: a single CCD detector can record data from the infrared                       to the x-ray energy band, making this technology extremely                       adaptable. Their sensitivity to light is far superior to film                       over these large wavelength ranges.                                             In addition, images can be read-out of a CCD in seconds, much                       faster than film can be developed. Most importantly, CCD's                       record images digitally, allowing the information to be stored                       and manipulated by a computer. These versatile qualities have                       lead to the rapid transfer of CCD technology into industrial,                       medical, and consumer applications. The CCD is now the ""detector                       of choice"" in products ranging from automotive quality                       control monitors to breast biopsy systems to video cameras.                                             The accelerated progress in CCD development over the past                       two decades is due in large measure to the efforts of the                       Hubble Project, which has continuously driven the leading                       edge of this technology. Hubble scientists realized early                       on that the broad wavelength sensitivity, coupled with the                       ease of digital data analysis, made CCD detectors ideal for                       astronomy. CCD's were aboard the Hubble Space Telescope when                       it launched in 1990. Successive generations of science instruments                       pioneered CCD technology enhancements. These efforts have                       led to the production of larger format, more sensitive, and                       more reliable detectors, which enable Hubble to deliver its                       outstanding science.                                             The following new Hubble Instruments are taking advantage                       of the latest advances in CCD technology:                                                                                                  Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS)                           The  Advanced                           Camera for Surveys , to be launched on Servicing Mission                           3B, employs two state-of-the-art, 8-million pixel CCD's                           with an advanced performance-enhancing coatings. These                           coatings allow the detectors to absorb up to 85% of the                           photons that strike it. The combination of large field                           of view and superior sensitivity will improve Hubble's                           scientific discoveries by a factor of ten. The ACS                           CCD program also targets specific process enhancements,                           which reduces image artifacts and improves manufacturing                           yield.                                                                        Wide                           Field Camera 3 (WFC3)                            Wide                           Field Camera 3  is an instrument planned for launch                           on Servicing Mission 4. This dual-channel instrument will                           provide an unprecedented, wide-spectral range view of                           the universe. Its two-detector system spans the near ultraviolet                           to the near infrared. The Hubble Program is focusing its                           efforts on developing a CCD with high sensitivity over                           both the visible and ultraviolet spectrum. This would                           provide a new capability in the near-ultraviolet for both                           astronomical and earthbound uses. Building upon the advances                           made by ACS, these detectors would provide higher sensitivity                           and lower noise than ever achieved in detectors of this                           size. For the long wavelength (infrared) channel, the                           technological advance is in operating the detector using                           thermoelectric cooling exclusively. This reduces cost                           and complexity when compared with the traditional implementations,                           which use cryogens or other cryogenic cooling systems.                                                                        Cosmic                           Origins Spectrograph (COS)                           In 2003, astronauts will begin a new era in ultraviolet                           spectroscopy when they install the  Cosmic                           Origins Spectrograph  (COS) instrument into Hubble.                           One of its major goals is to measure the distribution                           of matter in the almost empty space between galaxies.                           This is a major puzzle as we complete our census of where                           all the matter in the universe resides. Because most of                           this matter is in the form of hydrogen gas, measurements                           in the ultraviolet are key because this gas has unique                           signatures in this wavelength region. This innovative                           instrument uses a simple and elegant optical design, coupled                           with advanced ultraviolet detectors, to achieve a factor                           of 10 improvement in sensitivity levels compared with                           previous instruments. Using this new capability, Hubble                           scientists hope to better understand the characteristics                           of the matter between and within stars and galaxies.                                                                                                                                                                    Cryogenic Cooler                                             Astronauts installed the  Near                       Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer  (NICMOS)                       on Hubble in 1997. Its infrared vision allowed scientists                       to probe dark, dusty, never-before-seen regions of space.                       NICMOS used solid nitrogen ice to keep cool and so that it                       could conduct infrared science. In 1999, with its supply of                       ice exhausted, NICMOS became dormant. On SM3B, astronauts                       will retrofit NICMOS with a new cooling system that will return                       it to active duty. The heart of this system is the NICMOS                       Cryogenic Cooler (NCC).                                            The NCC is a state-of-the-art, mechanical cryocooler that                      will potentially increase NICMOS's life span from 1.8 years                      to more than 5 years. It uses rapidly rotating microturbines,                      the fastest of which spins at over 200,000 revolutions per                      minute (over 50 times the operating speed of a typical car                      engine). It will cool the infrared detectors to below -315                      ° F (-193 ° C or 80 K). The NCC operates with virtually                      no mechanical vibration. Such vibration would cause Hubble                      to shake and affect image quality, much as a shaky camera                      affects picture quality.                                             The Hubble Project successfully demonstrated this new technology                       aboard STS-95 in 1998. This was the first in-orbit test of                       a high performance, high efficiency, mechanical cryocooler.                       The test took place less than 20 months after cryocooler development                       began - an extremely short time for bringing a new technology                       into the space applications portfolio.                                            Installing a new cryocooler will triple the lifetime of the                      instrument, ensuring a greater scientific return on the original                      investment. This revolutionary technology paves the way for                      exciting advances in infrared astronomy on both Hubble and                      the Next Generation Space Telescope.                                                                                                                        Solar Arrays                                             The addition of new, rigid solar arrays on SM3B will provide                       Hubble with increased electrical power-generating capability.                       This will enhance science productivity by allowing up to four                       science instruments to operate simultaneously. Advancements                       in solar cell technology make it possible for these new arrays                       to produce 30 percent more power than the current set, which                       was installed on Hubble in 1993 during SM1 ( see                       schematic of solar array ).                                             The rigid arrays are one-third smaller than the set they replace.                       The smaller size decreases in-orbit drag and slows Hubble's                       rate of orbital decay. These smaller, stiffer arrays also                       are easier for the astronauts to work around during servicing                       missions ( see                       diagram of solar array dimensions ).                                              The panel supports on the arrays are made of lithium-aluminum,                       which is stronger, lighter and tougher than the type of aluminum                       commonly used in spacecraft construction. These supports are                       much less sensitive to the extreme temperature changes of                       Hubble's orbit. (Within each 97-minute orbit, the temperature                       outside Hubble spans about 299 degrees Celsius (600 degrees                       Fahrenheit).                             The Hubble Program bought solar panels from the production                       line of a commercial system of communications satellites.                       By purchasing off-the-shelf panels, the program saved considerable                       time and expense.                                                                                                                        The Super Lightweight Interchangeable Carrier                       (SLIC)                      Click                       here for PDF file of the SLIC                       The Super Lightweight Interchangeable Carrier (SLIC) is a                       state-of-the-art cradle that will ride on the Space Shuttle                       and carry new equipment to Hubble in Servicing Mission 4.                       Lighter and stronger than its predecessors, SLIC will be built                       of composite material and will incorporate a more structurally                       efficient design. The weight saved by SLIC's innovative design                       can be used to carry extra science equipment or fuel. With                       modular construction and a removable top deck, SLIC can be                       customized for different types of missions, including in-orbit                       satellite retrieval and repair, and supply and science missions                       to the International Space Station.                                                                                                                        The HST Lubricant Applicator                             During the first and second servicing missions, the astronauts                       discovered that a number of the bolts that keep the large                       Aft Shroud doors closed, exhibited high running torques during                       operation. In an effort to solve this problem, the Hubble                       Program developed a tool to apply a thin film of lubricant                       to the threads of these door bolts. While a simple task here                       on Earth, applying a viscous fluid in the vacuum of space                       had never been performed before. Care had to be taken to avoid                       getting the grease on the astronaut's gloves or the rest of                       the highly sensitive spacecraft. In response to this challenge,                       the innovative Hubble team developed the HST Lubricant Applicator.                       With this new tool, the astronauts were able to apply a small                       amount of grease on the threads at each location without contaminating                       themselves or the spacecraft. Although the tip of the tool                       was designed specifically for applying grease to the Hubble's                       door bolts, it can easily be modified to fit almost any feature                       of any other space structure.                                                                                                                        Lithium Ion Battery                             A prototype lithium ion (Li-Ion) battery pack for NASA's                       Power Ratchet Tool (PRT) was flown in support of SM3A. The                       PRT is a power tool developed at the  Goddard Space Flight Center                       and was used previously by the astronauts in space to service                       Hubble.                             NASA teamed with the Air Force Research Labs, Wright-Patterson                       AFB, and SAFT America Inc., to develop and certify this new                       cutting-edge battery technology for human space flight. The                       Li-Ion battery chemistry as compared to nickel cadmium (NiCad)                       provides superior energy density, over 50% higher voltage,                       excellent charge retention and high cycle life. This 10-cell                       battery pack could fit in a small portable 12-volt commercial                       power drill, yet supplies over 40 volts. While 24-volt power                       drills are currently available, their battery packs are bulky                       and heavy, making them hard to hold for long periods of time                       and difficult to operate when working in tight spaces.                                             The Li-Ion battery will reduce overall logistics and maintenance                       costs for NASA, compared to the current PRT silver zinc batteries.                       Those batteries require special handling and must be discarded                       after each flight. Unlike silver zinc batteries, the Li-Ion                       is a sealed cell design, ready for use. It can be reused over                       and over again, and NASA plans to make it rechargeable on                       orbit.                             Both the USAF and NASA are looking at a wide variety of applications                       for this type of battery chemistry including backup power                       systems for F-16 and F-22 Fighters, the Space Shuttle, and                       for new high power, compact tools to help build the International                       Space Station (ISS).                                                                                                                        Diamond-Hard Carbon Coating                             A revolutionary, diamond-hard coating will cover tiny parts                       on a cryogenic cooler scheduled to fly on Hubble Space Telescope                       in 2001. Called UltraC DiamondTM, this film-like, patent-pending                       coating is tough, slippery and approximately 1/100th the thickness                       of a human hair. Experts foresee widespread applications and                       enormous benefits for NASA and private industry.                             During normal operation, the cryocooler's tiny circulator                       shaft will spin at a speed of 90,000 rpm. To minimize friction                       and wear, the circulator shaft and bearings need a very thin,                       hard, slippery coating. The Hubble team looked at various                       other coatings, and UltraC DiamondTM met their rigorous requirements.                             Unlike other coatings, UltraC DiamondTM can be deposited                       on a wide range of materials, including titanium, ceramics                       and polymers.

In the 1960s, the desire to monitor the Earth's environment was linked with new technology that enabled us to observe our planet from space - giving humans our first global view of Earth.  The technology used on a satellite varies, depending on its mission. Computers aboard a satellite can receive, store and transmit information in the form of radio signals sent to and from stations on Earth. For Earth  What are satellites?  Before 1957, the word satellite meant one thing -- a small body that revolved around a larger astronomical body. Today we call these ""natural satellites."" In 1957, the Soviets launched the first ""artificial satellite,"" Sputnik 1. Today there are hundreds of artificial satellites in orbit around the Earth. These satellites are used for many purposes, such as communications, weather forecasting, and navigation, as well as observing the Earth. Satellites used to observe the Earth carry a variety of instruments to study the land, ocean, air and life, as well as their interactions. Scientists at NASA's Langley Research Center use several satellites now in orbit to measure some very specific It was not until scientists made satellite measurements that they realized the true extent of global biomass burning. Biomass burning proved to be 100 times greater than was originally thought. The above annual data shows the number of fires which burned in Africa during 1995. Individual fires areas are shown as black dots.   2 scientists, the receipt of the data begins a long process of determining what the data means. By incorporating the data into computer models (which use mathematical formulas called algorithms) researchers can simulate, or model, Earth's processes -- how the atmosphere, oceans and land surfaces interact as a system. Scientists hope that incorporating global satellite data into their computer models will help them better understand the interactive roles of Earth's systems, and help them predict how the Earth's environment will change over time.  Most satellites are lifted into orbit by multistage rockets. Satellites, powered by solar cells and auxiliary batteries, orbit more than 100 miles above the Earth's surface. The satellite's orbit, and the instruments it carries, are dependent on its mission. Communication satellites orbit more than 22,000 miles above the Earth relaying radio and TV signals, while most Earth-observing satellites orbit several hundred miles about the surface measuring the atmosphere, oceans and surface.   MAPS  THE MEASUREMENT OF AIR POLLUTION FROM SATELLITES (MAPS) instrument produced the first global measurements of atmospheric carbon monoxide (CO) in 1981 when it flew aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-2). MAPS' most important finding was that air pollution is a worldwide phenomenon, not just a problem in industrialized countries. In 1981, and in subsequent shuttle flights in October 1984 and 1994, MAPS measured high values of CO pollution in the tropics caused by seasonal biomass burning. In 1997, MAPS will be mounted to the Russian space station Mir to monitor global CO levels during a year of seasonal changes.  NASA Langley researchers use many satellites to study atmospheric variables and their effects  Some Ongoing NASA Satellite Missions  global warming is occurring. ERBE technology also measures the effects of clouds on the exchange of energy between the sun, Earth and space. The ERBE sensors measure energy from the sun in various wavelengths: reflected shortwave solar radiation (light that does not reach the Earth but is reflected off clouds) and longwave emitted energy (the   ERBE  THE EARTH RADIATION BUDGET EXPERIMENT (ERBE) is made up of three satellites launched in the mid-1980s.

Numbers are percentages.   3 SAGE I measured sunlight coming through the atmosphere to determine how much sunlight was absorbed. The amount of absorption indicates the amount of various sunlight absorbing gases, like ozone, or aerosols, that are present. Solar occultation occurs as the satellite experiences sunrises and sunsets, when the light is not too bright to obscure readings. SAGE I produced the first global atmospheric data of this type. SAGE II began operation in 1984 with the launch of the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite. SAGE II, which is still operating, provides global measurements of the vertical structure of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, water vapor and stratospheric aerosols. The SAGE II data helped scientists understand the causes and effects of the Antarctic ozone hole, and has made invaluable contributions to understanding the decline of stratospheric ozone over the Earth's mid-latitudes.  HALOE  THE HALOGEN OCCULTATION EXPERIMENT (HALOE), launched in 1991 aboard the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS), measures ozone and other atmospheric gases. Like SAGE I and II, HALOE uses the solar occultation technique; however, it measures visible infrared light and uses a filter which separates the gases according to their individual light ""signatures."" Analysis of the HALOE data proved conclusively that the Antarctic ozone hole was caused by humanproduced chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).

ERBE has provided the most accurate data ever obtained on shortand longwave radiant energy, helping us better understand how clouds reflect and absorb sunlight, and the heat emitted by the Earth into space. NASA scientists have used this data to make important contributions to climate prediction by improving how clouds are represented in atmospheric models.  CERES  THE CLOUDS AND THE EARTH'S RADIANT ENERGY SYSTEM (CERES) instrument is a follow-on to ERBE. CERES will be able to better identify cloud properties as well as help scientists better understand the Earth's energy budget.

These gases trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere. Increases in global temperatures over time could change precipitation patterns and growing seasons in many parts of the world. While isolated data sets gathered from several locations on Earth indicated global warming was occurring, it was not until satellite data found a worldwide change that scientists began to see the correlation between the factors contributing to this warming, the rate at which it might occur, and the role of human activities.  Ozone Depletion  Ozone is a gas in the upper atmosphere (stratosphere) that absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun, protecting life on Earth. Ozone depletion occurs when ozone reacts with chlorine and other compounds in the presence of sunlight. NASA satellite studies have found that the main source of chlorine in the stratosphere is human-produced chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are used in refrigeration, air conditioners, and industrial solvents and cleaners. When CFCs are released, they drift up into the stratosphere and can destroy ozone. The destruction of ozone has been documented through satellite observations since the 1980s. Because of this evidence, nations throughout the world signed the 1987 Montreal Protocol to phase out production and use of CFCs by the year 2000.  Deforestation  Human impacts on the Earth's system are most visible in changes to the land. As human population grows, we alter the landscape for agriculture, to harvest timber, and to build citiess. Deforestation and changes to land cover reduce the Earth's ability to absorb carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas. Land cover change also influences local weather and climate, and reduces biodiversity. Through satellite studies, NASA scientists study global vegetation and other land processes to better understand their role in regulating the Earth's climate.  Global Biomass Burning  Biomass burning is the burning of the world's living and dead vegetation for land clearing, land use change and domestic use. Approximately 90 percent of global burning is human initiated; a small percent is the result of lightning. Biomass burning has increased considerably over the last century. Biomass burning is a significant global source of carbon dioxide and methane, the leading greenhouse gases. Burning also produces gases which lead to the production of ozone in the lower atmosphere where it is harmful to living things. Smoke from the burning produces methyl bromide which leads to the depletion of ozone in the stratosphere, and the carbon particles become atmospheric aerosols which can block sunlight..  Natural Changes  Not every change is human-made. Although relatively small in comparison to human factors, natural occurrences also play a role in global change. For example, volcanic eruptions, such as the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, can inject large quantities of dust, gases and particles (aerosols) into the atmosphere that produce short-term effects similar to climate change. Aerosols from the eruption of Mount Pinatubo cooled global temperatures through 1993. Because eruptions are natural variations in the climate record, studying volcanoes provides valuable information to global climate change researchers.  interdependent systems.

Volcanoes and Global Climate Change Volcanoes and Global Cooling Figure 1 illustrates that as volcanoes erupt, they blast huge clouds into the atmosphere. These clouds are made up of particles and gases, including sulfur dioxide. Millions of tons of sulfur dioxide gas can reach the stratosphere from a major eruption.

These sulfate particles reflect energy coming from sun, thereby decreasing the amount of sunlight reaching and heating the Earth's surface. Short term global cooling often has been linked with some major volcanic eruptions. The year 1816 has been referred to as ""the year without a summer."" It was a time of significant weather-related disruption in New England and in Western Europe with killing summer frosts in the United States and Canada. These strange phenomena were attributed to a major eruption of the Tambora volcano in 1815 in Indonesia. The volcano threw sulfur dioxide gas into the stratosphere, and the aerosol layer that formed led to brilliant sunsets seen around the world for several years. But, not all volcanic eruptions, not even all lar ge volcanic eruptions, produce global-scale cooling. Mount Agung in 1963 apparently caused a considerable decrease in temperatures around much of the world, whereas El Chichn in 1982 seemed to have little effect, perhaps because of its different location or because of the El Nio that occurred the same year. (See NASA Facts NF-211.) El Nio is a Pacific Ocean phenomenon, but it causes worldwide weather variations that may have acted to cancel out the effect of the El Chichn eruption. Volcanoes and Ozone Depletion Another possible effect of a volcanic eruption is the destruction of stratospheric ozone. Researchers now are suggesting that aerosol particles containing sulfuric acid from volcanic emissions may contribute to ozone loss. When chlorine compounds resulting from the breakup of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in the stratosphere are present, the sulfate particles may serve to convert them into more-active  Figure 2. Images from NIMBUS-7: TOMS--June 17 (Top) and 19 (Bottom), 1991, showing the spread of sulfur dioxide from the Mt. Pinatubo eruption.

(See NASA Facts NF-198.) Monitoring the Effects of Volcanoes Space-based instruments are the only practical way to observe large and transitory volcanic eruption clouds. NASA's Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) instruments have contributed significantly to our knowledge of the total amount of sulfur dioxide emitted into the atmosphere in the course of major volcanic eruptions. Figure 2 shows TOMS images of sulfur dioxide spreading across the Indian Ocean region following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo. Several weeks later the sulfur dioxide had spread around the world as observed by the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument on NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) (see Figure 3). In addition to detecting the sulfur dioxide from Mount Pinatubo, TOMS has made similar observations of more than 100 volcanic events, including a major eruption from the Cerro Hudson volcano in Chile in 1991. TOMS instruments were launched on a Nimbus-7 spacecraft in 1978; a Russian Meteor-3 spacecraft in 1991; and on the Earth Probe and the Japanese Advanced Earth Observing System (ADEOS) platforms in 1996. A TOMS  instrument is also scheduled to fly on a Russian-3M satellite in 2000. Data from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE II) instrument on NASA's Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) have shown that during the first five months after the Mount Pinatubo eruption, the optical depth of the stratospheric aerosol increased up to 100 times in certain locations. Optical depth is a general measure of the capacity of a region of the atmosphere to prevent the passage of visible light through it. Greater optical depths mean greater blockage of the light. In this case, the increased optical depth means that considerably less of the sun's energy can get through the cloud to warm the Earth's surface. An advanced SAGE III instrument, which will make similar observations, is scheduled to be launched on a Russian Meteor-3M spacecraft in the second half of 1998. A few years after an eruption most of the aerosol clouds will have decayed so that their effects on radiation will become negligible. Observations of the effects of Mt. Pinatubo aerosols on global climate have been used to validate scientists' understanding of climate change and our ability to predict future climate. Researchers at NASA's Goddard  Figure 3.

They have reported success in correctly predicting many of the effects of the sulfate aerosols from Mount Pinatubo's eruption on lowering global temperatures. NASA Missions to Study Volcanoes Some of NASA's past and present missions that contribute to the study of volcanoes are listed in the accompanying table. Included in the table is the Earth Observing System (EOS), the key element of NASA's Earth Science Enterprise. The first launch in the series of EOS satellites is scheduled to take place in 1998. The High Resolution Infrared Radiometer (HRIR), first flown on NASA's Nimbus-1 satellite in 1964, has been used to observe both active and dormant volcanoes. On Nimbus-2, HRIR recorded energy changes from the volcanic activity on Surtsey, Iceland in 1966. The  Multispectral Scanner (MSS) and Thematic Mapper (TM) instruments on the Landsat satellites have provided a long series of images of volcanic activity, such as venting, volcanic ash falls, and lava flows. The EOS program will incorporate a series of satellites that will carry advanced instruments to provide a highly-accurate, self-consistent, and long-term data base of many aspects of Earth's atmosphere, land, and ocean characteristics. The information gained from this major effort to study Earth phenomena will expand our knowledge of the interactions of volcanoes with Earth's climate.

While          Hubble continues to show off the wonders of the cosmos,          the 2.4-meter (94.5-inch) diameter back-up mirror goes on          permanent display, starting tomorrow, as part of the ""Explore          The Universe"" exhibit in the Smithsonian Institution's          National Air and Space Museum in Washington.         Large          concave mirrors are the heart of large astronomical          telescopes. These mirrors gather the faint light from distant          objects, and specially built cameras and other instruments          can be used to study those objects in different ways. The          larger the mirror, the more powerful the telescope. On Earth,          the largest and most powerful telescopes are located on          mountaintops where the thin air causes fewer distortions such          as the ""twinkling"" of stars caused by air turbulence.         The          largest telescopes on Earth have mirrors measuring 10          meters (33 feet) in diameter, far larger than Hubble's          reflector. However, Hubble has a major advantage: it is in          space where there is no air to distort the images, giving it          a sharper view of the universe than any telescope ever built.         When          NASA began building Hubble in the late 1970s, the space          agency decided that the building of the primary mirror was so          challenging and so crucial to the science program that it was          a good idea to build a back-up copy.          Hubble's          primary mirror was built by what was then called          Perkin-Elmer Corporation, in Danbury, Conn. The company is          now Hughes Danbury Optical Systems Inc. The back-up was built          by the Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, N.Y. Kodak, which          used a more traditional method of grinding the mirror,          completed the back-up mirror in 1980, before Perkin-Elmer          completed the primary mirror.          Because          Kodak used different equipment for monitoring and          testing the mirror during fabrication, that mirror did not          have the optical flaw that was unknowingly built into the          Perkin-Elmer mirror.         As          the space telescope was constructed and launched, the          Kodak back-up mirror sat in its shipping crate in Danbury,          Conn. It was eventually impounded along with other materials          relating to the investigation of the mirror flaw on Hubble.          The          Kodak mirror, a ""near-twin"" of the flawed Perkin-Elmer          mirror, proved invaluable as It was used in tests to find out          exactly what went wrong with the fabrication of the primary          mirror aboard Hubble. Ultimately the problem was traced to          miscalibrated equipment.         There          was no practical way NASA could swap out the good          mirror for the flawed mirror in space, but it turned out that          the best solution was to build corrective optics that fixed          the flaw much the same way a pair of glasses correct the          vision of a near-sighted person.          The          corrective optics and new instruments were built and          installed on Hubble by spacewalking astronauts during a          shuttle mission in 1993, and the telescope has been at the          forefront of astronomy ever since.         The          back-up mirror, its job done, was returned to storage and          relative obscurity while its high-flying sister advanced the          frontiers of science and grabbed the headlines. Starting          tomorrow, however, that may change as Earthlings have their          first opportunity to get acquainted with the twin of Hubble's          huge glass heart.

It answered key questions about space, but it also created many new  questions to ask and gave us new frontiers to explore. The space  shuttle will revisit HST on the 2nd part of this servicing mission,  where astronauts will make spacewalks to refurbish the observatory,  upgrade it's technology, and perform maintenance. Why was this  mission split into 2 parts?  One reason was the urgency to replace  the failing gyroscopes in late 1999. The revised launch date meant  some hardware would not be flight ready and the number of tasks to be  performed would have been too great.           TAPE CONTENTS:        ITEM (1):        The New And  Upgraded Space Telescope    - The Hubble Space Telescope (HST)  was designed to be modular so it could be recovered in space,  replaced with new or improved instruments, have maintenance  performed, and then released.   Hubble will get a brand new look with  its new and third set of solar wings.  One-third less solar cell area  than the first two pairs, they will produce 20% more power.  Radiation and space debris take their toll on sensitive electronics,  but the new set should ensure uninterrupted service for the remainder  of the mission.  Presently, four large flexible panels have provided  power for over 8 years to the observatory.      Courtesy: NASA            ITEM (2):         Greater Science  With The ACS Animation  - A new science instrument called the  Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) will be installed.  This instrument  will study and look at the inner regions of galaxies, and study the  weather on planets.  The ACS will have 10 times more discovery power  in the same amount of time as the current camera.  This animation  begins with a ground-based view of the nebula 30 Doradus.  It then  zooms into the nebula, where it stops to see a simulated WFPC2  field-of-view.  To note the difference, a simulated view of the new  ACS field-of-view fades in that has twice the area and roughly 6  times as many pixels.  The animation then zooms out to reveal one of  ACS' other superior features - its data rate.     Courtesy: NASA/STScI             ITEM (3):         The Cryocooler  A  Refrigerator In Space  - The existing, but dormant, instrument  called the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer  (NICMOS) will get a new and experimental cooling system.  This  super-quiet cooler, called a cryocooler, uses ultrahigh speed  micro-turbines designed to spin at about 7,000 revolutions per  second.  NICMOS was placed on HST in 1997, but became inactive 2  years later after its block of solid nitrogen evaporated.  The goal  is to restore the detectors to their operating temperature of -203  degrees C (334 degrees F or 70 Kelvin).  The cryocooler was  previously tested aboard the STS-95 mission in 1998.   The animation begins with the installation of the NICMOS Cryocooler.  The Cryocooler has two main pieces---the cooler itself which was  installed and plugged into NICMOS inside telescope, and a radiator  that is strapped on the outside of HST.   Neon gas, shown in green,  begins circulating between the cooler and the NICMOS drawing heat  away from NICMOS.  A second loop of neon, shown in blue, draws heat  out of the first loop.  Ammonia, shown in red, is the third loop,  which draws heat out of the second loop and transfers the heat into  the radiator, shown on the outside of HST.  As the telescope begins  to move away, an exaggerated red glow is shown around the radiator,  indicating that the heat is being dispersed into space.    Courtesy:  NASA/Skyworks Digital           ITEM (4):        HST's Evolution  Animation   - The Hubble Space Telescope was troubled soon  after launch with the discovery that its primary mirror was flawed.  In addition, there were instability problems as the solar panels  flexed when the spacecraft passed from the Earth's shadow into  sunlight.  Luckily, making changes to the observatory, performing  maintenance, and updating technologies were always in the grand plan  for HST.  New instruments were added to enable scientists to study  space in the visible and invisible light.  Each servicing mission has  improved HST's performance in space, making it the greatest  astronomical observation platform in the history of mankind.

Highlights of  Hubble's scientific achievements to date are:  a. The Release of HST into Orbit (STS-61) - Launched on April  24, 1990, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope was designed to be the most  powerful astronomical observatory ever built. The keys to Hubble's  power are its location in space, far above the interference of the  Earth's atmosphere, and to the unique instruments it carries as it  orbits the planet. In addition, HST was the first observatory  designed for extensive on-orbit maintenance and  refurbishment.  b. HST First Servicing Mission (STS-61) - In June 1990,  scientists and engineers discovered that the HST's primary mirror was  flawed. In December 1993, astronauts successfully installed a new  camera called the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC-2), which  had its corrective optics built right in, and a special instrument  called the COSTAR (Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial  Replacement) that would properly refocus light from the flawed main  mirror to the other instruments.   c. HST Second Servicing Mission (STS-82) - Every few years, the  telescope is visited by a Space Shuttle to allow astronauts to switch  old instruments for new. In February 1997, during HST's second  servicing mission, astronauts removed the Goddard High Resolution  Spectrometer and the Faint Object Spectrograph and installed the  Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near Infrared  Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS).   d. HST Third Servicing Mission 3A (STS-103) - On December 19,  2000, the Space Shuttle Discovery and its seven astronauts blasted  off on the last human space flight of the 20th century to refurbish  the Hubble Space Telescope. Astronauts installed six new gyroscopes,  six Voltage/Temperature Improvement Kits, a new and more efficient  computer, and a refurbished Fine Guidance Sensor.

GX052-97-13345388	"Live from the Hubble Space Telescope    UPDATE  # 10      PART 1: Heidi's results from the Jupiter occultation   PART 2: Getting ready for new Pluto data   PART 3: Processing data and a chance to go to Arizona   PART 4: A day in the life of a Contact Scientist   PART 5: Hubble reveals surface of Pluto for first time        HEIDI'S  RESULTS FROM JUPITER OCCULTATION     Heidi Hammel  6 March 1996 - 2:37AM Hawaii   We are exactly one hour from the occultation event.  The day crew did a fabulous job and got the dome cleared of snow and ice.  The NSFCAM is dead, but the MIT Camera is working perfectly.  We spent the last seven hours making calibration measurements, doing set-up work, tests, and simulations, and just generally getting prepared. Slowly throughout the evening, the winds have been getting stronger and stronger.  We just hit the shut-down limit: sustained winds of 45 mph.  The gusts have been hit 70 mph.  All we can do during this last hour is wait, and hope the winds die down enough so that we can open the dome up again.  We are as ready as we can be...    6 March 1996 - 12:40PM Hawaii   Last night, the winds continued to get higher and higher.  The telescope operator waited until the last possible moment, and then opened the dome for us.  We went immediately to Jupiter, which was just rising.  Our plan was to take a picture, then center our camera on the part of the planet where the star was supposed to pop out from behind the planet. When we took our picture, all of us groaned in disappointment.  Instead of a nice clear picture of Jupiter, all we saw was a big fat fuzzy blur. The general atmospheric conditions were just poor, probably due to turbulence created by the the very high winds.   We set up on the planet anyway, and started our instrument running. It was supposed to focus on a small part of the planet where the star would be, and read out data very very fast.  We were supposed  to use the edge of Jupiter to guide the telescope, but because of the bad seeing, all we could see was blurry fuzziness. We took data anyway, because you have to take data. When the scheduled time of the event had passed (and we saw nothing more than blurry  patches of light), we stopped the experiment and took a regular picture.  We could see the star - it had popped out right on time. But because we could see the limb of Jupiter, the telescope had drifted, and we probably did not get useful data.  We were all pretty depressed.  But we went ahead and took all our calibration  data anyway, since we may be able to salvage something when we get back to MIT and can take a closer look.   We finally shut down at 4:45 am, and then spent an hour and half taking our camera off the telescope and packing it back into the crates.  Lots of sighs.   We loaded up the truck and drove down the mountain, talking about how we might have done things differently, and trying to learn from this unsuccessful experience what we need to do for future events.  We all went to sleep for a few hours, and now we are about to head down the mountain, to the airport, to begin the long trip back to MIT.   In astronomy, you do everything you can to prepare for your observations, but you can't do anything about the weather except hope for the best.  Sometimes you win, and the mysteries of the heavens are yours to savor.  Other times, the skies hold their secrets close, and all you can do is imagine what might have been.        GETTING READY FOR NEW PLUTO DATA     Marc Buie February, 1996   Now that the new Pluto observations are moving along toward execution on  HST, I must now turn my attention to some preparatory work.  Dr. Alan  Stern and I have been working on our previous pictures of Pluto.  We  first started to work on these images last January, January 1995, that  is.  That month we had time to spend on trying to understand the  pictures and how to get the best information from them. Our work at that time lead us to understand that getting good maps of  Pluto would not be easy.  The size of Pluto makes our job very  difficult.  Unlike Jupiter, or even Neptune, Pluto is very small and is  just barely resolved by HST.  Any finite size telescope has a  fundamental limit on how small an object it can make out.  From the  ground most modern telescope are limited at the same level by the  atmosphere.  In space, the resolution is completely determined by the  size of the mirror in the telescope.  When you work at the limit of a  telescope you must understand everything about what it does in the  process of focusing the light to make an image.   So, to get a map of Pluto we found that we would have to remove some  blurring effects HST has on the image we see.  This blurring comes from  the point-spread function (PSF) and is present at some level in all  optical systems, whether it's HST or your hand-held 35mm camera.  When  HST first launched, it's PSF was very, very bad due to a misshapen  mirror.  After HST was repaired, the PSF was improved but not removed. When we realized this work needed to be done we found ourselves out of  time to work on this project.  Alan and I both had other projects that  were demanding our attentions.   Alan had a rocket flight experiment to  prepare and I had other ground-based observations to conduct.  All of  these activities distracted us until late in 1995 when we were able to  return to our analyses.   All right, so what's the point here?  The time-table for the Live from  Hubble Space Telescope program set a very deadline for our work.  After  all, if we haven't figured out what is in the older data, what will we  be able to do with new data?  So, I've spent the better part of January  and February trying to finish our analysis of the old Pluto images  before we get the new data.   All of this work is leading up to a press release and a TV broadcast on  our results.  Thursday, March 7, Alan and I will be in Washington DC for  a presentation of results which will be just one week prior to the  unveiling of the new Pluto images as part of the Live From HST project. Because of the press release, I can't show you the results (yet) of our  work but I can let you in on a few of the steps leading up to the  release.   Our project consisted of images taken at four times such that Pluto had  rotated by about 90 degrees between each time.  The images clearly show  regions of light and dark on the surface but need to have the effects of  the PSF removed.  I constructed a computer model, or description, of  Pluto as it must look and then created steps in the computer that would  apply all the effects caused by the PSF.  From this I can then make a  guess as to what Pluto looks like, blur the image, and then compare to  the actual pictures.  The Pluto image I want is a grid of pixels that I  can relate to the brightness of it's surface.  For this model I divided  up the visible disk of Pluto into an 8x8 grid of pixels.  Then I used my  program to vary the brightness of each pixel until the collection of  pixels most closely matched the image.  The approach works well because  we know how big Pluto is in the image.  If we didn't know the size this  trick wouldn't work.   Each image gives us a set of pixels that covers a part of the surface of  Pluto.  If we take all of these partial sets, we can add them up to get  a complete map of the surface.  I don't know if this sounds simple or  not but to me this is pretty routine stuff.  It certainly didn't sound  like 2 months of work to me.  But let's look at this a little closer.  I  was able to pretty quickly write a computer program to find the best set  of pixels for each image.  But, the program takes about 3-4 hours to run  for each image on the fastest computer we have here at Lowell  Observatory.  We have 20 images in all so running all the images through  the computer takes about 2 days before I get an answer.  That's a pretty  long time.   Have you ever written computer programs?  When I was first learning to  write programs, my teachers said that it was impossible to write a  program that was correct on the first try.  I thought at the time that  this was silly.  If you were really careful, certainly it must be  possible to write a good program.  Well, I've been doing this for nearly  20 years now and I have to say that those teachers were right.  Somehow,  a detail here or there will slip through and there will be something  wrong with the program.  Sometimes the problems are easy to spot, like  all the pixels coming out completely black.  Usually, the problems are  very, very difficult to notice.  How do know the answer is right?  After  all, I can't just pick up an atlas off my shelf and check to see what  Pluto must look like.  This is the first time this has ever been done  and I have to use other means to see if the map I get out is correct. You're probably already guessing that I had a few problems along the way  and you'd be right.  I found a bad file name (foc410.fit instead of  foc410n.fit).  I found missing statements that were needed to rotate the  images properly.  There were others too, and each time I found a mistake  that meant another 2 days before I could check the answer.  Two months  can go by real fast this way.  In the meantime, everyone is yelling for  final maps and images to get ready for this upcoming press release.  At  the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), they had to redo the  press images and video animation sequences several times because of  errors I found.  Do I have the right answer yet?  If you were asking  yourself that question already, good for you.  I don't know.  All I can  do is check answers and compare images and do my best to eliminate  mistakes.  I'm pretty sure I've got a pretty good map pulled out from  the data but in the process there are some things that might work even  better than my current computer program.  Unfortunately for this press  release, it will take much too long to try my new ideas so we'll just  have to settle for what I've been able to do so far.  Next year, maybe  I'll have an even better map.   This is a pretty good indication of what it means to do original  scientific research.  You take an idea, some data, a bag of computer or  mathematical tricks, and try to make sense of it.  Along the way you  learn new tricks, get new data, or get a new idea and before you know  it, last year's work has been made obsolete.  As you proceed, you never  stop checking and re-checking your results.  When you finally get the  right answer you'll know because the answer is the same no matter how  you get there.  These new observations we'll be getting on Pluto will  become useful checks of the work I've done on the data from two years  ago.  If nothing looks the same we'll probably have to take another hard  look at Pluto to see if we can understand what we're seeing.  Anytime I  can get new data on Pluto, it helps me to understand Pluto a little bit  better and also helps me to believe in my previous results.  It also  seems that for all the work, you never quite finish (at least until a  spacecraft flies by Pluto and then we'll really know what it looks like). As soon as the results have been made public on March 7, I will be  posting information on the maps and images we have.  Stay tuned, it's  only going to get more interesting from here!        PROCESSING  DATA AND A CHANCE TO GO TO ARIZONA    Trisha Borgman   March 4, 1996   Hello again! It's been a long week for me--midterms are coming up fast, and it's difficult to balance my time between work and school. But, here I am!   I have exciting news!  I will be going on an observing run in March!  The GSPC-II team (do you remember what that stands for? Guide Star Photometric Catalog II...the ""phone book"" of the stars) has an observing run at the Kitt Peak telescope (near  Tucson, Arizona) in late March, and I will be going along! There will be two of us on the run: the chief observer and myself.  I'm really excited about it!!  I've never been on a run before, so this will be an amazing opportunity!  I will be sure to tell you all about it!!    Last time I wrote, I talked about how I have to run the data which comes back from the telescope through many steps of data reduction in order to remove the ""signature"" of the telescope itself.  That is all done now.  But my role in preparing the data for the actual catalog isn't nearly finished!  After the data has been cleaned up, I have to run it through a whole sequence of photometry reductions.  Photometry is essentially measuring the amount and color of the light which comes from a star.  This is what we're interested in (that's why our catalog is called the Guide Star PHOTOMETRIC Catalog).   So what do I do?  Well, once again it involves many computer  programs.  In fact, an entire software system was developed by my boss in order to make this process run more smoothly. I am not much of a programmer myself, but I have learned how to use all of these programs.  There are many steps involved, but as I said, the end result is to measure how much light is coming from the stars we're measuring, and what color the light is.  The color tells us so much about how the star really works:  how much energy the star generates, how old the star is, and how far away it is.  All the stars we are studying are from our own Milky Way Galaxy; in fact, when you look up at the night sky, all of the stars you can see are within the Milky Way.   One of the most important steps I am responsible for is actually identifying the stars we want to catalog.  The first version of the GSPC catalog was released in 1988 (I was in 8th grade then!), and I use the star charts from that version in order to identify the correct stars for the new version.  This was very difficult to get used to at first.  When I look at a CCD frame, I know pointed, but I still have to identify which star is which! So, I look very carefully at the star chart and compare the patterns in the chart to the patterns in my image.  From  there I can usually identify which star is needed.  At first, I had to ask my boss for a lot of help with this part of my work--especially when there were hundreds of stars in a  single image, it was so hard for my eyes to get used to locating a single star!  Now that I have more experience, though, it's pretty easy--it just took time, patience, and practice!   In my biography statement, I said that I also tutor an inner-city elementary school child.  I met her for the first time about a  week ago--she's a 6 year-old girl named Latarsha, and we're having a lot of fun together.  It's an amazing challenge to try to teach someone how to read, or how to understand addition.  I see her twice a week, on Mondays and Wednesdays, for about 2 hours each time.  It's a great study break, and I really enjoy doing something to help people.     Look at the time!!  Well, it's time for me to meet Latarsha! Have a great week, everybody!!   :)  Trisha        A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CONTACT SCIENTIST   Howard H. Lanning   February 26, 1996   As a Contact Scientist for Cycle 6, there is a lot to do.  We are tasked with the responsibility of providing the scientific interface and assistance to the Principal Investigator, an astronomer who has successfully proposed to do science with the HST and is preparing his/her proposal for submission and final detailed formatting prior to execution.  This involves advising the astronomer on the proper or most efficient use of the instrument(s) requested, identifying structural problems which might affect the overall scientific program, and generally acting as an advocate for the astronomer throughout the process of proposal preparation, scheduling, execution, and with the logistics of data analysis. Added to that are various Instrument Scientist duties, in my case acting as Data Quality Assessment Coordinator for the GHRS.  All days are busy. There is always a great deal to do.  Occasionally we can even manage to get some of our research done.  Following is just a sample of one day in the life of this Contact Scientist...   Mondays start off like just about any other day, but often times more chaotic than most, and today is a classic example.  I arrived this morning to the usual 60+ email messages including various reports, notices, and problems. It often takes the entire day just to get through the messages because of the diversions and problems one has to deal with from the start.  And right off the bat today is email from a PI who has identified a problem with his proposal and needs some help.  The first step is to forward the mail to the appropriate individual within the Institute to try and resolve the issue.  While waiting for a response, I sketch out a short list of the items that must be done today. While doing so, a call comes in requesting me to attend a meeting tomorrow for a discussion on software related issues to consider for long term improvements, mainly with an effort to provide more input from the scientific side of the fence.  Ok, will do.  That's two meetings tomorrow already on the schedule.   I continue working my way through the email and come across another proposal problem.  This case is a possible duplication of science being done by two different astronomers.  Such is not unprecedented since this type of check can't accurately be done until all proposals are received for a given cycle,  and as the programs are being worked by the Program Coordinators (PC), or changes occur to certain programs, these things keep popping up.  I do some double checking with the target list and formatted list of the affected proposals, then respond to the email providing my comments.  Often, in the case of true duplications, we must recommend data to be obtained by one of the scientists be embargoed, i.e. not be allowed to release for publication, until the other executes and is no longer proprietary.  This means some science can be on hold for up to a year.  Well, that's chewed up a good part of the morning and I still haven't made it all the way through the mail and reports.   Just after finishing the investigation and sending out my comments, I get another call from one of the Instrument Scientists (IS).  Turns out we have another proposal which needs to have a more accurate centering sequence put in to prevent the program from failing.  After discussing the situation at length with the IS, and getting all my notes together, I talk to the PC, informing her what we need to do.  I then call the astronomer who is 2 time zones away to discuss the details and suggest he send in a statement of the problem and scientific justification which I'll append to my summary of the change to be requested.  Basically, the centering maneuver will take so much time, that we must ask for an additional orbit to assure success and prevent taking time  away from the science exposures. Once the astronomer sends in the memo, I can put everything together and send it out to the rest of the committee which will vote on the change request and then send a recommendation to the Directors Office for consideration.     Well, now I've got 15 minutes to complete my monthly research status report. Done.  Now on to reviewing submitted Cycle 6 proposals.  I have a stack of Phase II drafts of proposals to review which had been placed on the chair by a PC.  These are the detailed submissions including the targets, and all  activities including acquisitions, peakups, exposures, calibrations, etc. that the astronomer wants to do.  It is the CSs task to verify that the current format of the proposal is acceptable with respect to the science to be obtained, i.e. will the astronomer get what he/she wants, and is the proposal structured to provide an efficient use of the spacecraft?  I manage to get through four proposals, talking to the PC on one them, before finally getting to take a short break for a bit to eat.  I usually end up eating at my desk through my lunch hour because there's so much to do.  But while taking a stroll down the hallway to pick up my mail, I get cornered an asked to attend yet another  meeting tomorrow.  That's three!  Back to the office to put it on my calendar and to send a notice of approval to my PC about the proposals I just finished reviewing.     To get documentation for the latest meeting, the head of the committee  indicates I need additional system configuration privileges set up.  So email is sent to the system managers. There always seems to be some little thing that hasn't been setup, or is a new feature I need.  So, just as with proposal problems, these things pop up from time to time.    Next, I need to determine the status of the GHRS Calibration Plan in order to provide a report to the Data Quality Committee later this week.  Off to an impromptu meeting with the calibration Instrument Scientist.  From there, I take a short diversion to discuss some Data Quality issues with one of our Data Analysts, since we're trying to put together more details for procedures and products to be delivered to the astronomers.    Upon returning to my office and jotting down my notes, more email to read. It never stops.  All day long we get mail coming in.  The latest is the change request from the astronomer I talked to earlier in the day.  I put together the summary and all details and send it out to the committee for review.  It's  now 5:30, but I still have 3 more hours to go.  Twice a week, while my wife is in class at Johns Hopkins University, I was late putting in about 10-11 hours.  I begin the review of the remaining two proposals left by my PC, and a quick review of the material to be discussed at two of our meetings tomorrow. Even though it is late, another Institute Scientist comes in around 7pm to ask questions about another instrument.  This time I can't help, but  often, I can.  Since I used to work in the Planning and Scheduling System as the Lead Operations Astronomer for Proposal Preparation, I had to know something about all the instruments being used.  It's training and expertise that often comes in handy.     Around 8:30 I finally finish for the day, and believe it or not, I actually have completed most of the items on the short list of things to do despite all the diversions throughout the day.  A rare treat.  Still got a couple that  won't get done for another two or three days because of the meetings tomorrow, but then, I'll just put them on the next short list for another day.        HUBBLE REVEALS SURFACE OF PLUTO FOR FIRST TIME    NASA PRESS RELEASE:  96-43     March 7, 1996   For the first time since Pluto's discovery 66 years ago,  astronomers have at last directly seen details on the surface  of the solar system's farthest known planet from pictures sent  back by the European Space Agency's Faint Object Camera aboard  NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.   Hubble's snapshots of nearly the entire surface of  Pluto, taken as the planet rotated through a 6.4-day period,  show that Pluto is a complex object, with more large-scale  contrast than any planet, except Earth.    The images also reveal almost a dozen distinctive albedo  features, or provinces, none of which have ever been seen  before.  They include a ""ragged"" northern polar cap bisected by  a dark strip, a bright spot seen rotating with the planet, a  cluster of dark spots, and a bright linear marking that is  intriguing the scientific team analyzing the images.  The  images confirm the presence of icy-bright polar cap features,  which had been inferred from indirect evidence for surface  markings in the 1980s.    This historic new look at Pluto helps pave the way for a  proposed Pluto flyby mission early in the next century.  Pluto  is the only solar system planet not yet visited by a spacecraft.   ""Hubble is providing the first, tantalizing glimpse of  what Pluto will be like when we get there,"" said Dr. Alan Stern  of Southwest Research Institute's Boulder, CO, research office.   Stern led the team who used Hubble to obtain the most detailed  view yet of Pluto.  The Pluto imaging team also includes Dr.  Marc Buie of Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff, AZ, and  Dr. Laurence Trafton of the University of Texas, Austin. This  team of planetary scientists used the Faint Object Camera  aboard the Hubble to obtain over a dozen high-quality visible  and ultraviolet images of Pluto in mid-1994.  These images have  now been carefully reduced and analyzed.   ""These results and the maps we constructed from them are  much better than I ever hoped for,"" said Buie. ""It's fantastic.   Hubble has brought Pluto from a fuzzy, distant dot of light, to  a world which we can begin to map, and watch for surface  changes.  Hubble's view of the tiny, distant Pluto is  reminiscent of looking at Mars through a small telescope,"" said Stern.   Some of the sharp variations across Pluto's surface  detected in the Hubble images may potentially be caused by such  topographic features as basins, and fresh impact craters (as  found on Earth's Moon).  However, most of the surface features  unveiled by Hubble are likely produced by the complex  distribution of frosts that migrate across Pluto's surface with  its orbital and seasonal cycles.  Pluto is so far from the Sun  that even nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane gases  partially freeze onto its surface during the long period (about  100 years) when it is farthest from the Sun.    The Hubble images reveal much more surface variety on  Pluto than on other icy objects in the outer solar system,  including Pluto's often-cited twin, Neptune's large moon  Triton.  According to Trafton, ""The HST images are confirming  Pluto's individuality.  It isn't a twin of Triton after all.""   During the short, warm season around Pluto's closest  approach to the Sun, these ices sublimate (go directly back to  a gas), thickening Pluto's atmosphere.  ""The light areas are as  bright as fresh Colorado snow, and the darker areas are more  reminiscent of the brightness of a dirty snow,"" said Stern.   The darkest regions likely result from hydrocarbon ""residues""  Pluto's complex chemical melange of surface ices.    Pluto is two-thirds the size of Earth's Moon, and 1,200  times farther away. Pluto's apparent size in the sky is so  small (0.1 arcseconds, which equals 1/36,000th of a degree),  that 18,000 Plutos would need to be lined up to match the  diameter of the full Moon.  This puts Pluto's surface below the  resolution limit of the largest ground-based telescopes; as a  result it has been impossible to directly see any significant  detail on Pluto before these Hubble observations.   Viewing such a remote and small body has been so  difficult that Pluto's moon Charon wasn't detected until 1978,  despite the fact that Pluto itself was discovered by Clyde  Tombaugh in 1930.    Shortly after its launch in 1990, the Hubble Space  Telescope first peered at Pluto and clearly distinguished the  planet and its satellite (which is only 1/3000-th of a degree away) as two separate objects.  However, a detailed look at Pluto's surface had to wait until Hubble's optics were improved during the 1993 servicing mission.    The Advanced Camera, planned to be installed on Hubble  in 1999, will yield slightly better images of Pluto.  This will  be the best view of the distant planet until space probes  eventually make the long trek across the solar system."
GX011-97-5644608	"February 15, 2002   PINATUBO VOLCANO RESEARCH BOOSTS CASE FOR HUMAN-CAUSED GLOBAL WARMING    Research into the worldwide climatic impact of the 1991 Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption during the 10 years since the eruption has strengthened the case for human causes of global warming, a Rutgers scientist reports in a paper published in the February 14 issue of the international journal, Science.   The Pinatubo research also has improved scientists' ability to forecast the impact of future volcanoes on weather and climate, says the paper's author, Alan Robock of the university's Center for Environmental Prediction in the Department of Environmental Sciences, Cook College.   According to Robock, the eruption on Luzon Island in the Philippines on June 15, 1991 produced the largest volcanic cloud of the 20th century and caused changes in worldwide climate and weather that were felt for years.   The changes wrought by Pinatubo's sulfuric acid cloud, which blocked a large percentage of sunlight from reaching the earth, initially included cooler summers and warmer winters, an overall net cooling at the earth's surface and altered winds and weather patterns, Robock said.   In certain areas such as the Middle East, it produced a rare snowstorm in Jerusalem and led to the death of coral at the bottom of the Red Sea, he noted.   The cloud also caused depletion of the ozone layer over Temperate Zone regions of the Northern Hemisphere where much of the world's population resides, in addition to the regular ozone ""hole"" which appears in October over Antarctica, the researcher said.   Most significant, the scientist said, Pinatubo helped validate computer-generated climate models that demonstrate human-caused global warming.   Using computer modeling, said Robock, scientists have been able to account for natural warming and cooling, as found in Arctic and Antarctic ice core samples and tree rings covering hundreds of years up to the last century.   ""If you plug in volcanic eruptions, El Nios, solar variations and other natural causes and try to simulate past climate changes, you can do a pretty good job of modeling climate change until the end of the 19th Century,"" the researcher said.   After that period, he said, natural causes alone don't account for the amount of warming, about 0.6 degrees Celsius (1.1 degrees Fahrenheit), that has taken place in the last century.   ""But when you factor in Pinatubo and other eruptions along with anthropogenic (human-caused) emissions,"" said the scientist, ""it accounts for the observed record of climate change for the past century, including the overall warming and episodic cooling, and validates the climate models.""   In addition to improving understanding of global warming, scientists will be able to develop better seasonal forecasts after the next major eruption occurs, he noted. ""Although overall the planet cools after volcanic eruptions, over Northern Hemisphere continents it actually gets warmer in the winter. This is because the wind patterns change in response to heating of the stratosphere by the volcanic aerosols.""   The ozone layer, which protects against the sun's life-damaging ultraviolet radiation, developed a hole over the South Pole during the last century due to human activity -- chlorofluorocarbons (freons) from refrigeration, air conditioning, and industrial processes, noted the researcher.   Because the Antarctic region is so cold, clouds are able to form in the stratosphere, Robock said. The cloud particles serve as surfaces to allow sunlight to catalyze chemical reactions involving chlorine and bromine pollutants that destroy ozone, he noted.   The Mount Pinatubo cloud provided a similar surface on sulfuric acid particles for pollutants to react with sunlight and destroy ozone over Temperate Zone regions of the globe, not just over the Antarctic region. ""So you get ozone depletion not just over Antarctica but over where we live,"" noted the researcher.   Ozone depletion by volcanic eruption is a recent phenomenon, said Robock. ""Elevated levels of chlorine in the stratosphere only started appearing within the last couple of decades due to human activity,"" he said.   The scientist added that as the use of chlorofluorocarbons and other human emissions are regulated by International agreement, ozone depletion should disappear in a few decades.   ""Researchers are already documenting that the amount of ozone-destroying compounds in the atmosphere has stopped rising, "" said Robock.   ##  Contacts:   Michele Hujber  732-932-9000 x555  HUJBER@AESOP.RUTGERS.EDU    Recommend this Article to a Friend    Back to:   News                              Subscribe to the Earth Observatory   About the Earth Observatory   Please send comments or questions to:  eobmail@eodomo.gsfc.nasa.gov    Responsible NASA official: Yoram Kaufman  NASA/GSFC Security and Privacy Statement"

The past year gave us excitement and challenges as well as tremendous achievements. We celebrated our Center's 40 th  Anniversary; we worked very hard and received our ISO 9001 Certification; we successfully launched Landsat 7, QuikSCAT, and FUSE; we managed the HST 3A and the ""Flagship"" of the Earth Observing System, Terra. We also faced some disappointments, with the unsuccessful launch of the WIRE mission. We will learn from all of these efforts and apply those lessons to future projects. We have also been selected to do some very important missions in the future: the NPP ""bridge mission,"" SWIFT and ST5.     A year ago, I declared five areas of concentration: safety, ISO Certification, meeting our commitments, scientific and technological leadership, plus the pursuit of Project Goddard. I'll give us an A+ for staying focused on our themes. I'm very proud of the Center not only for our projects, but also for the enthusiasm to change processes that will improve how we accomplish our work in the future.    Several special qualities of Goddard's environment have not changed over the years. One constant is the dedicated, competent team of civil servant and contractors with a can-do attitude that makes Goddard a crown jewel of NASA. Together, we do make a difference. Let's keep that spirit. As the Anniversary slogan reminds us: ""We are proud of the past, and prepared for the future.""    At this time of year, with family and friends we can tell stories about 1999 at GSFC with well-deserved pride. We also have so much to be thankful for, from the support of colleagues to new horizons in science and technology. I am very grateful to all of you for your contributions and very hard work, sometimes under great stress. Everyone's professional attitude causes a positive ripple effect that touches far beyond our gates.    I look forward to the challenges in the new decade. As we look at our priorities, though, let's remember important issues such as safety at work and at home, and maintaining a balance between work and family. Bill, Mary, Milt, and I wish you a most joyous holiday and a happy and safe New Year.    Back to top                 TERRA Update   Activation of the Terra spacecraft is continuing, with the mission going     extremely well.  Terra began a new generation of Earth science - one that studies the     Earth's land, oceans, air, ice and life as a total global system, when it launched from     Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., on Dec. 18, 1999, at 1:57 p.m. EST.        A number of spacecraft components have been powered-on over the past two days, and the     performance has been nominal.                   The high gain antenna, which communicates with the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) system, has been placed back in the normal program track mode. In this mode, the antenna tracks one of four of the on-orbit TDRS spacecraft which are used by Terra. Stored commands from the spacecraft's flight computer direct the high gain antenna to point to the proper TDRS satellite. The anomaly which occurred on Sunday evening, where the high gain antenna program track mode stopped, is now believed to have been a transient event. The motion of the antenna today eliminated the potential for any mechanical interference type issue.    During the period in which high gain antenna pointing was not occurring, the flight operations team took the opportunity to flow 16 kbps data from the spacecraft's omni to the TDRS system. This mode, which was not an operational requirement, will be a significant asset for the flight operations team during future non-nominal Terra operations.      Initial instrument activation activities also are proceeding. The MISR instrument will be powered-up shortly to unlatch 3 launch latches contained in the instrument. Immediately after that, both of the CERES instruments will be powered-up and placed in a standby mode while outgassing continues.                      ""The spacecraft has been operating quite     well,"" said Kevin Grady, Terra project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center,     Greenbelt, Md. ""All data indicate we have a very healthy spacecraft.""

Astronauts Steve Smith     and John Grunsfeld installed six new gyroscopes and six Voltage/Temperature Improvement     Kits in the telescope during their 8 hour, 15 minute spacewalk.            Working deliberately, Smith and Grunsfeld replaced three Rate Sensor Units, each     containing two gyroscopes. Four of Hubble’s gyroscopes had failed, making the     telescope unable to point itself precisely enough to do science since Nov. 13. At least     three operable gyroscopes are needed to point the telescope with the accuracy required to     track its astronomical targets.                The spacewalkers also installed Voltage/Temperature Improvement Kits on wiring from Hubble’s solar arrays to each of its six batteries. The kits are designed to improve control of the charging of the space telescope’s 10-year-old batteries.    With Hubble latched upright in the payload bay, Smith and Grunsfeld completed all major tasks scheduled for the first of three spacewalks on three consecutive days. A few minor objectives, including applying lubricant to the door of one of the telescope’s bays and taking close-up photos of the Voltage/Temperature Improvement Kits, were left undone. Flight and telescope controllers decided to cancel the photography job and schedule the 10-minute lubrication job for Thursday’s space walk. The duration of the spac ewalk was second only to the 8 hour, 29 minute space walk from Endeavour on STS-49 in May 1992.                    A few minor problems helped account for the length of the space walk. One     of the old gyroscope-containing Rate Sensor Units was a tight fit in the box designed to     protect it on its return to Earth, though eventually it was placed inside and the lid     closed. Another involved opening valves and removing caps on the Near Infrared Camera and     Multi-Object Spectrometer, in preparation for restoring it to operation during the next     Hubble Servicing mission. That task too eventually was completed.            All in all flight and telescope controllers were delighted with the accomplishments of the     day.                 Major tasks on Thursday's space walk by Michael Foale and Claude Nicollier include replacement of Hubble’s outmoded DF-224 computer with a more modern unit 20 times faster and with six times the memory. They also will replace one of Hubble’s three fine guidance sensors, used to precisely point the telescope and gather scientific data. The astronauts also may perform “get-ahead tasks,” some first scheduled for a fourth space walk. That space walk was cancelled because of delays in Discovery’s launch.    Discovery remains in excellent condition, in an orbit with a high point of 380 statute miles and a low point of 369 miles.

GX236-15-2842799	"MODIS  MODERATE RESOLUTION IMAGING SPECTRORADIOMETER  NASA's Earth Observing System N ATIONAL  A  ERONAUTICS AND  S  PACE  A  DMINISTRATION   W  ith the inception of the U.S. Global Change Research Program, NASA, along with several other scientific institutions, has been charged with the task of developing a detailed understanding of the Earth and the dynamics of global climate change. Subsequently,  IS THE EARTH IN TROUBLE? This is a widely asked question; unfortunately, too few data exist today to provide an adequate answer. Science reveals there have been many natural changes in the Earth's climate throughout history. Now there are strong indications that natural changes are being accelerated by human intervention, and that we are contributing to such hazards as global warming, rising sea level, deforestation, ozone depletion, acid rain, and reduction of biodiversity. Through observations and measurements, scientists have learned that atmospheric constituents-- such as clouds, gases, and aerosol particles--profoundly affect the Earth's land and oceans; and as changes occur on the land and in the oceans, they in turn profoundly affect the atmosphere. Scientists conclude that the relationship between land, oceans, and atmosphere is cyclical and tightly interwoven. So, in order to better understand natural global climate change, as well as mankind's role in accelerating these changes, scientists must study the Earth as a whole interacting ecosystem. The goal is to construct models of Earth's global dynamics--atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial--and predict changes before they occur. Before scientists can begin to understand and accurately model global dynamics, they need information in the form of data. In order to differentiate short-term from long-term trends, as well as distinguish regional from global phenomena, these data must be collected every day for a long  MODIS  work is underway to develop a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)--the flagship in a fleet of instruments that will monitor our planet from space.

Additionally, these data should be collected across a wide spectrum of energy, ranging from ultraviolet, through visible and infrared, to microwave radiation. Now NASA is developing new instruments--satellite sensors--to collect these data.  store incoming data, as well as make them available to the research community. The first EOS component, a space-based observing system, will consist of a series of polar-orbiting and mid-inclination satellites. Launches begin in 1998, with EOS AM-1, and extend over a period of at least 15 years. ""AM"" means the satellite will fly in a sunsynchronous polar orbit, descending southward across the equator in the morning; in the year 2000, EOS PM-1 will be launched into a sun-synchronous polar orbit ascending northward across the equator in the afternoon. Four years after that, EOS AM-2 will be launched, followed by EOS PM-2, and so on.  NASA's Earth Observing System Satellite sensors serve as an effective means for collecting global data on a daily basis. NASA is working with the national and international scientific community to design, develop, and launch advanced satellite sensors with which scientists can observe and measure global dynamics. In the early 1980s, NASA began planning the Earth Observing System (EOS), the primary initiative in its Mission to Planet Earth. EOS consists of three components: a spacebased observing system, a scientific research program, and a Data and Information System (EOSDIS). EOSDIS will process and  EOS AM spacecraft  2   ments.""

However, it should be noted that MODIS' development pushes state-of-the-art optical engineering--its performance will meet or exceed the capabilities of all of its heritage instruments.

In short, MODIS will be the primary tool on the EOS satellites for conducting global change research.  Our Changing Land Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer The key instrument being developed to fly on each of the EOS AM and PM satellites is MODIS. MODIS' objective is to provide a comprehensive series of global observations of the Earth's land, oceans, and atmosphere in the visible and infrared regions of the spectrum in such a way as to view the entire surface of the Earth every two days. Here, the word ""comprehensive"" refers to the wide spectral range and spatial coverage, as well as the continuous coverage MODIS will provide over time. Additionally, MODIS is ""comprehensive"" in that it will continue to take measurements in spectral regions that have been and are currently being measured by other satellite sensors, or ""heritage instruCurrently, there are not adequate data to fully understand the effects of such critical issues as resource depletion and region-wide pollution. For example, we need more data to fully understand the effects of acid rain on the boreal forests of Europe and North America. In South America, the rain forest is rapidly being burned away to make croplands. Scientists will use MODIS to detect the rate of deforestation, which has become a major issue. Also of considerable interest are long-term data on the rate and extent of desertification at the margins of the world's deserts and arid regions. We need better global data on surface climate variables, such as temperature and humidity, as well as more accurate measurements of snow and ice cover. With the launch of MODIS, scientists will have better and more comprehensive data for improved monitoring of these often rapidly varying land surface features.  3   Using MODIS data, scientists will be able to construct improved global vegetation maps to provide up-to-date estimates of the distribution of the Earth's major vegetation formations. They will use MODIS to ascertain whether the vegetation is healthy or under stress. By globally monitoring subtle vegetation responses to stress in the biosphere--such as ozone--scientists can learn about both the nature and severity of the stress. They may, for example, derive information on the extent of freeze or drought damage to cropland. Timely global information on the overall status of agricultural crops throughout the growing season is vital for monitoring the world's food resources, yet this information is currently available for only a few areas. No one knows with certainty whether the amount of snow and sea ice in the world is growing or BURNING OF TROPICAL RAIN FORESTS by humans contributes significantly to the release of CO2, particulates, and trace gases into the atmosphere, affecting global climate.  diminishing as a result of global warming. We do know that snow and sea ice have major impacts on the Earth's ""hydrologic"" (water) cycle and albedo, or reflected sunlight. MODIS will measure the snow and sea ice cover and help calculate its effect on global albedo. These measurements (photo by Y.J. Kaufman)  will help scientists better understand what happens to incoming solar radiation--how much is absorbed versus how much is reflected back into space. MODIS will also help scientists model increases in runoff (Landsat, U.S. Geological Survey)  and river discharge dynamics as a result of melting snow and ice, which will hopefully lead to better flood warning and irrigation management methods.

The largest iceberg shown has a length of 32 kilometers.  MODIS will take daily measurements of surface climate and atmospheric conditions, such as temper(Images provided by S. W. Running and R.

These data will be used for computer simulations of important biogeochemical processes in order to interpret changes in surface features. Additionally, surface climate data will be used to calculate the status and growth rates of crops, stress events, nitrogen and sulfur fluxes, and carbon dioxide exchange. Carbon dioxide is especially important in that scientists have identified it as a contributor to the recent global warming trend; however, our understanding of the global carbon cycle is limited. The MODIS Team is working to develop a vegetation leaf area index (LAI) that will be used to calculate mass and energy exchange from vegetated surfaces. Today, global estimates of carbon storage in terrestrial plants vary by as much as an order of magnitude. Better estimates are needed for scientists to construct accurate models of the Earth's carbon cycle. Global estimates of LAI derived from MODIS data will allow scientists to much more accurately calculate the carbon stored on land, as well as the rate of exchange between plants and the atmosphere. PHYTOPLANKTON IN THE OCEAN.  plankton--that have life cycles of days. Land soil is a large reservoir of carbon and has a turnover time of many centuries; whereas dissolved organic material suspended in the ocean is similar in amount and turnover time to soil carbon, the carbon cycle of marine bottom sediments has a turnover time of millions of years. Scientists have observed that over the last century, with the dramatic increase of biomass burning and fossil fuel burning, there has been a corresponding increase in CO2 released into the atmosphere. Much of this CO2 eventually enters the oceans and is used by phytoplankton for photosynthesis. The amount of CO2 consumed by the phytoplankton depends heavily on (Photos by D.W. Coats)  ocean circulation which supplies nutrients to the upper layers where sunlight is abundant. Some fraction of particulate carbon produced by the phytoplankton sinks to the ocean floor--a long-term sink for atmospheric CO2. The fraction is not well known, and is a  source of a large uncertainty in the global carbon budget. Unravelling this complex system--called the ""biological pump""--is difficult. Scientists wish to understand the coupling of physical and biological aspects of the carbon system in the ocean in order to estimate how changes in the oceans will affect the global CO2 system as well as the population of phytoplankton, which is an essential link in the Earth's food chain. Hopefully, MODIS will help scientists answer important questions, such as: is productivity in the ocean changing, and how do the changes relate to increases in atmospheric CO 2? Would decreases in productivity accelerate CO 2  Our Changing Ocean Scientists estimate that roughly the same amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) is used by plants in the ocean for photosynthesis as is used by plants on the land. However, there are large differences in the turnover rates and reservoirs of carbon on land and in the ocean. Land ecosystems have large amounts of structural plant material with life cycles ranging from one year to centuries. The oceans, on the other hand, are dominated by unicellular plants--phyto-  5   Images by G.C. Feldman  EARTH'S BIOSPHERE (top).

From space, MODIS will observe the global distribution of phytoplankton over time to help determine how it affects and is affected by fluctuations in the ocean environment. Yet, there are other dynamics equally important in oceanic carbon cycling, such as solar radiation, temperature, and current patterns which dramatically influence phytoplankton productivity and heat transport. Scientists have observed that sea surface temperature (SST) directly influences and is influenced by atmospheric processes. There is a dynamic interrelationship between the ocean and the atmosphere, which in turn impacts the ocean's carbon and heat reservoirs. Storms or upwelling currents may bring up deeper, nutrient-rich waters which serve as ""fertilizer"" to enhance biological productivity. However, sometimes the ocean's productivity drops dramatically. For instance, Pacific coast fishermen noticed that every three to five years, around December and January, their catch is significantly smaller than average. They named this phenomenon El Nio. Scientists have observed that winds typically push the warmer waters near the surface of the Pacific toward the west, allowing the colder, nutrient-rich water from deeper layers to upwell to the surface where they support a lush phytoplankton population. Oceanic plants and animals depend upon these nutrients. Yet, when the easterly winds die during an El Nio, the upwelling ceases, nutrients are much less abundant, and proCIRRUS CLOUDS over the Western United States.  ductivity drops. MODIS will help scientists predict the effects of El Nio on the food chain. Models of El Nio will help Pacific commercial and sport fisheries to better adapt their trade.  Our Changing Atmosphere Two important Atmospheric phenomena that MODIS will monitor are clouds and aerosols (liquid or solid particles suspended in the air). Both play a major role in climate; both affect and are affected by the previously discussed land and ocean dynamics. For instance, heavy cloud cover during the day has a cooling effect on the Earth's surface in that clouds reflect and absorb incoming sunlight. Conversely, at night clouds reduce the amount of outgoing radiation, thereby having a warming effect on climate. (Philippine Institute of Volcanology & Seismology)  Most clouds do not precipitate; they simply evaporate, leaving any solid or liquid particles they contained suspended in the atmosphere as aerosols. Aerosols affect climate in two  ERUPTION OF MT. PINATUBO (June 15, 1991).  ways. First, the particles alter the radiative properties of the  atmosphere by absorbing or scattering radiation. Second, aerosols play a critical role in the cloud formation process, serving as a sort of ""seed"" for attracting condensation. Before evaporating, clouds serve as reaction vessels that convert pollution gases such as SO2 into aerosol particles. Currently, we have, at best, a poor understanding of the impact of  7   MEAN CLOUD AMOUNT FOR JULY 1983. Purple and blue are low, and yellow and red are high.  CLOUD COVER FOR OCTOBER 1, 1983  aerosols on climate. Scientists have inadequate data on the global composition and distribution of aerosols. MODIS will monitor the types, areal extent, and loading of aerosols over the Earth. It will also measure their effects on cloud properties and solar radiation. This information will help scientists calculate the effect of aerosols on climate. Climate models cannot yet accurately quantify the effect of aerosols and clouds on climate. However, their prediction of the impact of certain human activities on climate are very sensitive to the cloud properties used in the models. For example, a global 20 percent increase in the amount of low cloud cover can counteract the expected warming due to the resulting doubling of CO2 concentration. Alternatively, if aerosol pollution can cause a 20 percent decrease in cloud drop size, this also can counteract this global warming. Improvements in climate models require detailed information on cloud properties, such as area of coverage, cloud-droplet size, cloud-top altitude, cloud-top temperature, and liquid water content. Using MODIS data, scientists will measure these properties and more. Together with data from other sensors on the PM spacecraft, scientists will monitor rainfall over land and oceans to gain a better understanding of the interrelation-  ships among sea surface temperature, soil moisture, and vegetation growth with cloudiness and rainfall. Scientists have shown that clouds play an important role in the transport, transformation, and removal of chemicals in the atmosphere. They estimate that cloud precipitation removes 80 to 90 percent of the particles from the lower atmosphere--such as sulfates and nitrates from anthropogenic emissions, which contribute to acid rain; radioactive particles; and soot particles produced by biomass and fossil fuel burning. Violent volcanic eruptions can spew aerosols high into the atmosphere where they can remain for months or years above the cloud precipitation processes occurring in the lower atmosphere. Periodically slowing or offsetting the current warming trend, volcanic eruptions may contribute to global cooling. When a volcano erupts with enough force, it sends dust, ash, and sulfur dioxide into the upper atmosphere. The sulfuric acid particles that subsequently form in the stratosphere absorb and scatter incoming solar radiation so that less sunlight reaches the Earth's surface, causing it to cool down. Volcanic particles may also contribute to destruction of ozone--a process that should be closely moni-  (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project)  8   tored. MODIS will contain an alarm that will alert scientists where and when a volcano has erupted, enabling them to observe and measure volcanic activity as it is ongoing. The same spectral information will also provide information on the distribution and characteristics of forest fires, which can help scientists estimate the associated emissions of gases and particulates from burning biomass. There is, for example, widespread biomass burning at the southern edge of the Amazon rain forest of South America, as well as in Africa and tropical Asia.  MODIS will have a viewing swath width of 2,330 km and will view the entire surface of the Earth in 36 spectral bands sampling the electromagnetic spectrum from 0.4 to 14 m with a spatial resolution ranging from 250 to 1,000 meters. It will acquire data at an average rate of 6.1 megabits per second. MODIS data will be processed in high-speed computers, using theoretically and empirically derived algorithms, to yield approximately 40 global data products needed to analyze global change. Each MODIS instrument will have a design life of five years (although they are expected to last longer), and four are expected to be launched between 1998 and 2006 to help develop a 15-year data set for comprehensive global change research. MODIS data will also play a significant role in the interpretation of measurements made by other EOS instruments. MODIS data, along with data from the other EOS instruments, will be available to the scientific community worldwide. EOS will encourage and facilitate wide use of the data to promote Earth science and interdisciplinary interaction.  MODIS Science Team To derive the processes, or algorithms, by which MODIS data will be used to conduct the science discussed throughout this brochure, MODIS employs an international team of scientists consisting of 24 members from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and France. The MODIS Science Team is divided into four discipline groups: Atmosphere, Land, Oceans, and Calibration. The Calibration Group will characterize and monitor the performance of the MODIS instrument to determine the accuracy and validity of its measurements.

As stated previously in this brochure, the goal is to construct models of Earth's global dynamics--atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial--and predict changes before they occur.

Annual frequency of observing days: 18181860. Schwabe's yearly counts are plotted as the heavy solid line, Wolf 's reconstructed yearly counts are plotted as the dashed line, and Pastorff 's yearly counts are plotted as the thin solid line. The birth-death years for each of the observers is identified beside their names. Several Dips, numbered 17, appear in the annual frequency of observing days. .......................................................................................... Comparison of annual frequency of observing days (bottom panel) with annual variation of equivalent mean temperature at Armagh Observatory (middle panel) and with occurrences of near moderate to very strong El Ni/o events and of major volcanic eruptions. Dips numbered 17 are shown in the bottom panel. The ""lost record years"" of 18251833 are indicated (as missing data) in the middle panel. Strong El Ni/o events are those identified by filled triangles, above the temperature data. Bars connecting triangles mean that the event spanned 2 consecutive years. The frequency of known volcanic eruptions, having a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) 3 is plotted above the El Ni/o event timeline. Individual large, cataclysmic (VEI 4) volcanic eruptions are identified, with their corresponding VEI in parentheses. Those of VEI 5, including Tambora (7), Galunggung (5), Cosiguina (5), Chikurachki (5?), and Sheveluch (5), are highlighted. ............................................................... Equivalent annual mean temperature versus annual frequency of observing days, based on Schwabe's data (left panel) and Wolf 's reconstruction (right panel). Surprisingly, a statistically significant association is found to exist between temperature and Schwabe's number of observing days, but not between temperature and Wolf 's reconstruction.

INTRODUCTION  Although sunspots have been observed on occasion with the naked eye for thousands of years and routinely using the telescope since the early 17th century,13 it was not until the mid 19th century that the quasi-periodic variation of the spottedness of the Sun was truly recognized.4, 5 Today, we call this cyclic variation of the number of spots on the Sun with time, simply, the ""sunspot cycle."" The person who first suggested the existence of the sunspot cycle was Samuel Heinrich Schwabe, a German apothecary and amateur astronomer,6 who diligently and meticulously observed the Sun for more than four decades (18261868)3 from Dessau, Germany, in the mid 19th century. His observations of the annual number of ""clusters of spots"" and annual number of ""days when no spots were observed"" showed clearly that the spottedness of the Sun varied from a minimum in number (when the count of clusters was least and the count of days without spots was greatest) to a maximum in number (when the relative counts were reversed) and then again to another minimum over an interval, or period, of about 10 yr, with the rising portion (minimum to maximum) being shorter in duration than the declining portion (maximum to minimum).2, 79 (While Schwabe is credited with being the first to publicly acknowledge the existence of the sunspot cycle, Hoyt and Schatten3 have noted that the basis for a sunspot cycle of decadal length was clearly evident in the observations of monthly mean number of sunspot groups that were recorded by Christian Horrebow and his colleagues in 17611777.) Following this discovery, Rudolf Wolf, a Swiss astronomer from Z rich, Switzerland set out to establish whether or not the cyclic appearance of sunspots, as deduced by Schwabe, was a real and continuing effect (also, he wanted to show a causal connection between terrestrial and solar events, like aurora and sunspots).5, 9, 10 In order to accomplish this task, in 1848 Wolf introduced his now famous ""relative sunspot number"" (i.e., r = k(f + 10g), where f is the number of individual spots counted on a specific day, g is the number of sunspot groups counted on the same day, and k is a factor that is dependent upon the qualities of the observer, the observing site, and the telescope) and used it to reconstruct the historical record of sunspot variation (from various sources) as far back in time as he could go. From his efforts, he was able to confirm the existence of the cyclic nature of sunspots, as purported by Schwabe, deducing the average period to be closer to about 11 yr in length, rather than 10 yr. More importantly, his efforts to initiate a means whereby one would have a coherent, continuous record of numbers of sunspots resulted in the successful establishment of an international collaboration involving many countries from around the world that continues even today to faithfully monitor and report the daily number of spots on the Sun, so that the record is now complete (without gaps) from 1849.  1   While Wolf 's record of sunspot number is only complete since 1849, the reconstructed portion prior to 1849 (based on many observers from many sites) is found to vary, from nearly complete coverage during some portions of a year to nearly devoid coverage during other portions of the year, back to 1818, Wolf 's first entry for monthly mean sunspot number based on daily values (e.g., see the daily listings as given in Waldmeier10). Interestingly, Schwabe's record (based on an individual observer from a single site--Dessau, Germany) also is found to vary in similar fashion, but because he followed his own unique way of carefully observing the Sun, the variation in daily coverage is found to continue beyond 1848, certainly up until 1858, the last available entry for this study. Thus, for an interval of at least 40 yr (18181858), one has a daily record of observing sunspots that is found to sometimes vary considerably (regarding its completeness) from one year to the next. A dedicated observer, as Schwabe undoubtedly was,11 will always follow his passion--to observe. Therefore, his lack of observations (also noticed in Wolf 's reconstructed record) may well bespeak of something that must have influenced his (and also those who contributed to Wolf 's quest) ability to observe. Whatever caused this paucity of observations, certainly must have been pervasive, affecting much of Europe, and apparently, was quite persistent as well. Indeed, close examination of Schwabe's and Wolf 's records shows that the paucity/profusion of annual sunspot observing days occurred, not haphazardly, but rather in an orderly progression (pattern), described here as an abrupt decrease in number of observing days per year that is followed by a gradual increase (to levels that existed before the decrease began), with each episode lasting typically 13 yr (or more). So, while Waldmeier10 has suggested that the gaps in the early sunspot record arise from ""bad weather conditions,"" their persistence and coupled behavior strongly suggest an association with some sort of short-term climatic fluctuation, perhaps due to either large, cataclysmic volcanic eruptions (known to globally perturb climate1214) or, less likely, to the occurrences of near moderate to very strong El Ni/o events,15, 16 which somehow may have affected Europe. The purpose of this investigation, then, is to examine the annual and monthly counts of sunspot observing days from the historical records of Schwabe and Wolf for the interval of 18181858, comparing these records with estimates of annual mean temperatures (i.e., equivalents of mean temperature, based upon spot measurements of temperature), as recorded at Armagh Observatory17 and with the occurrences of large, cataclysmic volcanic eruptions18 and of near moderate to very strong El Ni/o events.19 The result of this statistical study is that, indeed, large, cataclysmic volcanic eruptions appear to account for the paucity of sunspot observing days during the early years of sunspot observation (18181858) and that colder annual mean temperatures, likewise, are associated with them. In particular, the effects of Tambora (1815), Galunggung (1822), Cosguina (1835), and, perhaps, Hekla (1845) are found to be quite dramatic.  2   2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 2.1. Annual Numbers of Sunspot Observing Days (18181858) Schwabe7 reports annual numbers of observing days (i.e., cumulative counts, along with annual numbers of clusters of spots and of days when no spots were seen) when he actually observed sunspots from Dessau, Germany, during the interval of 18261843. Each year subsequent to this, Schwabe2034 routinely reported monthly numbers of observing days (along with monthly numbers of clusters of spots and of days when no spots were observed) for the interval of 18441858. Because Schwabe died in 1875, it may be that published reports for additional observing years might exist beyond 1858. Unfortunately, appropriate issues of Astronomiche Nachrichten, which is the journal containing his yearly summaries, were not readily available for these intervening years (at Redstone Scientific Information Center, Huntsville, Alabama). Consequently, this preliminary study is limited to those years prior to 1859. (As previously noted, according to Hoyt and Schatten,3 Schwabe continued to make and report his observations until 1868; so, eventually his final 10 yr of monthly reports may be recovered.) Wolf 's reconstructed record can be found in Waldmeier10 and McKinnon,35 which easily allows for a determination of the number of sunspot observing days (per month and/or per year) for the interval of 18181848. Recall that the record is complete after 1848, so no gaps in coverage exist after this date. Figure 1 displays the number of observing days per year for the interval of 18181860, spanning the decline of cycle 6 through the maximum of cycle 10. Schwabe's numbers are shown as the heavy line, while Wolf 's numbers are shown as the dashed line. Also displayed as the thin line is the number of observing days per year when J.W. Passtorff (Drossen, Germany) observed the Sun between 18191833, taken from Hoyt and Schatten.11 Across the top are marked the occurrences of the minima (unfilled triangles) and maxima (filled triangles) for cycles 710, where the placement of maximum for cycle 7 is found to differ, dependent upon whose annual data are being used (i.e., Schwabe's, denoted S, maximum number of clusters of spots, as compared to Wolf 's, denoted W, maximum relative sunspot number). Also identified in Figure 1 is the occurrence of the ""Dalton minimum"" (also called the ""Little Maunder minimum"" by Eddy36), a brief interval of inferred reduced solar activity between about 1795 and 1823. Quite noticeable in Figure 1 are several dips (listed sequentially from 1 through 7), or decreases, in the annual number of observing days. Dip number 1, unique to Wolf 's reconstructed record, refers to the broader timeframe before 1822, when the number of observing days per year was rising, rather than specifically to the local dip in 1820. Dip number 2, also unique to Wolf 's reconstructed data set, occurs during the rise of cycle 7, while Dip number 3, which is found in all three records, occurs near sunspot maximum for cycle 7. Dip number 4, noted in both Wolf 's reconstructed record and Schwabe's actual observational record, is quite large (about a 4050 percent decrease in annual number of observing days) and long-lasting (several consecutive years of reduced annual number of observing days) and occurs during the rising portion and maximum phase of cycle 8. Dip number 5, also noted in both Wolf 's reconstructed record and Schwabe's actual observational record, occurs during the rising portion and maximum phase of cycle 9. Finally, two very small 1-yr dips (of questionable significance) occur about 1853 and 1855, during the declining portion of cycle 9. 3   Number of Observing Days  4 Cycle 7 Cycle 8 Cycle 9 Wolf (1816  1893) Cycle 10**  Cycle 6  350  S  W    Schwabe (1789  1875)           300  250  200  **Cycle 10 is the Beginning of the Modern Era of Sunspot Cycles  150 Pastorff (1767  1838)  Dalton Minimum* (1795  1823)  100 *Also called ""Little Maunder Minimum"" (Eddy [1980])  50 Introduction of Wolf''s Relative Sunspot Number  1820  1830  1840  1850  1860  Year  Figure 1. Annual frequency of observing days: 18181860. Schwabe's yearly counts are plotted as the heavy solid line, Wolf 's reconstructed yearly counts are plotted as the dashed line, and Pastorff 's yearly counts are plotted as the thin solid line. The birth-death years for each of the observers is identified beside their names. Several Dips, numbered 17, appear in the annual frequency of observing days.   Simple runs testing37 shows that both of the annual number of observing days as reconstructed by Wolf for the interval of 18181848 and as reported by Schwabe for the interval of 1826 1858 are found to vary nonrandomly; hence, the dips are probably not due to chance. For example, based on Wolf 's reconstructed record, a median of 268 observing days per year is found, with 16 yr having a value larger than or equal to the median and with 15 yr having a value less than the median, occurring in seven runs. Such a distribution strongly suggests that the variation in Wolf 's annual number of observing days is nonrandom (at <5 percent level of statistical significance, equivalent to >95-percent level of confidence). Similarly, based on Schwabe's actual observational record, a median of 282 observing days per year is found, with 17 yr having a value greater than or equal to the median and with 16 yr having a value less than the median, occurring in six runs. This distribution, likewise, strongly favors a nonrandom variation for Schwabe's annual number of observing days (at <5 percent level of statistical significance). So, it seems highly probable that the variation in observing days per year, whether one subscribes to Wolf 's reconstructed record or to Schwabe's actual observational record, is not due to chance (random noise). Because many of the dips are found in both records (with one occurring in three records), the occurrences of the dips suggest that they are real and symptomatic of some sort of regional (global?) short-term climatic perturbation that affected, at least, much of Europe during the premodern era years of sunspot observations. 2.2. Comparison of Annual Numbers of Sunspot Observing Days to the Annual Variation of Equivalent Mean Temperature at Armagh Observatory and to the Occurrences of ~ Near Moderate to Very Strong El Nino and of Large, Cataclysmic Volcanic Eruptions Figure 2 replots the annual number of observing days from Wolf 's reconstructed record and Schwabe's actual observational record (following the same format as shown in Fig. 1), identifying the dips (numbers 17) with shading, and plots the equivalent mean temperature (C) at Armagh Observatory, both as a yearly mean (taken from Butler and Johnston17) and as a 4-yr moving average (also called the 5-yr running mean, shown as the heavier line; the 4-yr moving average ignores single year decreases), with the shading corresponding to the occurrences of the intervals containing the dips in annual number of observing days. The Armagh Observatory is located at 54 21.2' N (latitude) and 6 38.9' W (longitude) at an altitude of about 64 m above sea level near the city of Armagh, Northern Ireland. Daily air temperature measurements have been made at Armagh from 1795 to the present day and are complete, except for a brief 9-yr period from 18251833 when no data have yet to be found (hence, this period will be called the ""lost record years""). Prior to 1833, the record is based on daily measurements obtained three times each day (8 a.m., noon, and 8 p.m.), while it is based on twice daily readings (10 a.m. and 10 p.m.) from 1833. Butler38 and Butler and Johnston17, 39 have discussed the relevance of the Armagh temperature records, in particular, as related to the subject of climatic change, two chief reasons being its extraordinary length (over 200 yr) and its strong correlation with the northern hemispheric mean temperature record (18801985), as given by Hansen and Lebedeff.40 (The provisional annual mean temperature data set, called Series I, actually extends to 1882, thereafter, being discontinued in lieu of another provisional annual mean temperature data set, called Series II, that began in 1843 and continues through today, being based on the use of maximum and minimum thermometers. The provisional records are presently being reexamined by Butler and his colleagues to see whether or not any additional corrections are necessary--cf. Wilson.41) Identified above the temperatures are the occurrences of near moderate to very strong El Ni/o events (where unfilled triangles refer to the occurrences of moderate events and filled triangles refer to the occurrences of strong events), the annual frequency of known volcanic eruptions (having a Volcanic  5   Large Volcanic Eruptions (VEI  4): Mayon (4) Colima (4) SuwanoseJima (4) Awu (4?)

Comparison of annual frequency of observing days (bottom panel) with annual variation of equivalent mean temperature at Armagh Observatory (middle panel) and with occurrences of near moderate to very strong El Ni/o events and of major volcanic eruptions. Dips numbered 17 are shown in the bottom panel. The ""lost record years"" of 18251833 are indicated (as missing data) in the middle panel. Strong El Ni/o events are those identified by filled triangles, above the temperature data. Bars connecting triangles mean that the event spanned 2 consecutive years. The frequency of known volcanic eruptions, having a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI), 3 is plotted above the El Ni/o event timeline. Individual large, cataclysmic (VEI 4) volcanic eruptions are identified, with their corresponding VEI in parentheses. Those of VEI 5, including Tambora (7), Galunggung (5), Cosiguina (5), Chikurachki (5?), and Sheveluch (5), are highlighted. 6   Explosivity Index (VEI) 3), and the occurrences (by name and VEI) of the larger, cataclysmic volcanic eruptions (i.e., those having a VEI 4). The listing of near moderate to very strong El Ni/o events is taken from Quinn et al.,19 while the annual frequency of known volcanic eruptions and the listing of large, cataclysmic volcanic eruptions are taken from Simkin and Siebert.18 The historical El Ni/o activity (from the early 1500's to 1987), as determined by Quinn et al.,19 was deduced by them primarily on evidence obtained from the west coast region of northern South America and its adjacent Pacific Ocean waters, and emphasizes stronger events (i.e., weaker events were not included in their listings). The evidence was initially limited to descriptions from published writings, involving five languages (Spanish, English, German, French, and Dutch), although with the passage of time, meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic data became increasingly available and were used by them to augment their findings. While, strictly speaking, these historical El Ni/o events were determined on the basis of their regional characteristics, it is now apparent that they are better perceived as being manifestations of a larger, oceanic-atmospheric phenomenon, known as the El Ni/o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event (which has been linked to unusual weather episodes on the global scale4249). It is also noteworthy that Quinn et al.19 have emphasized that the period of 18121832, of which this study is concerned, in part, was unusually active, with some eight events of near moderate to very strong intensity occurring in the brief span of just 20 yr (inferring a frequency of one event per 2.5 yr, as compared to one event per 3.8 yr, on average). The chronology of volcanic eruptions, as determined by Simkin and Siebert,18 provides an exhaustive record of all volcanism known to have taken place in each year (from before 8000 B.C. to the end of 1993). Following Robock and Mao,12 it has become clear in the last decade that the effect of a volcano on climate is most directly related to the sulfur content of emissions that reach into the stratosphere and not directly to the explosivity of the eruption, although the two are highly correlated.50, 51 The sulfur gases (e.g., SO2) eventually convert to a global layer of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) aerosols and sulfate particles, which persist for several years (typically, 12 yr or more) in the stratosphere and efficiently scatter incoming sunlight, thereby, reducing the direct and total solar radiation reaching the ground. Furthermore, the volcanic dust veil (or pall; see Lamb52) and aerosols (see Carroll14) absorb long-wave and short-wave radiation, thereby, heating the stratosphere and producing anomalous stratospheric circulation when there is a gradient in the heating. Because less explosive volcanic eruptions (i.e., those having a VEI 2) are considered unlikely candidates of stratospheric injection of sulfur gases,53 in figure 2 only the yearly occurrences of eruptions having a VEI 3 are shown (as previously noted, taken from Simkin and Siebert18). (It may be of interest to note that during this span of time, no extra-tropical southern hemispheric volcanic eruptions of VEI 4 are known to have occurred; all 21 events identified at the top of figure 2 are either tropical events or events that occurred in the extra-tropical northern hemisphere. Lamb52 and Legrand and Delmas54 have noted that extra-tropical volcanic eruptions seem only to affect the hemisphere in which they are located, while tropical eruptions can have a direct influence on both hemispheres. Hence, any induced short-term climatic perturbation that might result from a volcanic eruption seems to be of concern to Europe only when it occurs either in the tropics or in the extra-tropical northern hemisphere.) Simple statistical testing (based on Bernoulli trials and the binomial formula)37 shows that there is a close statistical association between the dips in number of observing days per year and periods of colder temperature as measured at Armagh Observatory. For example, discarding Dip number 3 (owing to a lack of mean temperature data because of the ""lost record years""), one finds that each of the remaining six dips 7   (shaded portions) is found to contain at least one major yearly temperature decline as well. The probability of this occurring by chance is easily computed to be 1.6 percent. So, it may be that this inferred statistical association between decreases in number of observing days per year and declines in mean temperature is indicative of real, consequential behavior (which, in turn, may be the result of the episodic appearance of persistent bad weather--overcast conditions involving much, if not all, of Europe; i.e., short-term climatic fluctuation). Support for this conjecture is also found from the behavior of the 4-yr moving average of equivalent mean temperature when it is compared to the occurrences of the dips in number of observing days per year, which shows that each dip starts when a decline in temperature first begins to appear and ends when the temperature is nearly fully recovered. (Similar dips appear in the June mean temperature records for New Haven, Connecticut, as recorded by former presidents of Yale;55 thus, the dips in temperature appear to be pervasive, spanning both sides of the Atlantic Ocean in the northern hemisphere.) Figure 3 plots yearly equivalent mean temperature at Armagh against the yearly number of observing days, separately for Schwabe (left panel) and Wolf (right panel). Surprisingly, when the comparison is between temperature and Schwabe's number of observing days, a preferential association between the parameters is strongly suggested, whereas none is suggested when the comparison is between temperature and Wolf 's reconstructed (or blended) number of observing days. For the former comparison (i.e., between temperature and Schwabe's number of observing days; left panel), on the basis of Fisher 's exact test56 one computes the probability of obtaining the observed 22 contingency table (i.e., the one formed by the medians, shown as the thin vertical and horizontal lines, parallel to the x and y axes), or one more suggestive of a departure from independence (chance), to be 1.3 percent, while it is 50 percent for the latter comparison (i.e., between temperature and Wolf 's number of observing days; right panel). For Schwabe's data, at least, this suggests that when the number of observing days was 304 (the median), the yearly equivalent mean temperature at Armagh was usually 8.9 C (the median), while when the number of observing days was <304, the yearly equivalent mean temperature was usually <8.9 C (and vice versa). On the basis of linear regression analysis between temperature and Schwabe's number of observing days, one infers that a loose (r = 0.5), yet statistically significant (at >98 percent level of confidence), positive correlation ^ ^ seems to exist between them (shown in Figure 3 as the diagonals, y and x , for the two cases of using Schwabe's data or temperature as the independent variable, respectively). Thus, from Schwabe's observational record, because of the observed decrease--Dip number 3 (with the decrease beginning after 1828 and ending by 1834)--to 217 observing days in 1830, one infers that a corresponding dip in yearly equivalent mean temperature, quite possibly, occurred, as well (i.e., during the ""lost record years""). The inferred temperature in 1830 is estimated from the regression to have been about 8.6 C, while it is estimated to have been about 9.0 C in 1828. (The lack of a statistically significant association between yearly equivalent mean temperatures at Armagh and Wolf 's reconstructed record of observing days suggests that the blending of data, that Wolf needed to have to reveal the workings of the sunspot cycle, unfortunately, destroyed whatever temperature-observing day relationship for Switzerland that might have been found to exist, had he chosen not to blend his data with those from others.) Returning to Figure 2, one can compare separately first differences in yearly temperatures and/or number of observing days against the yearly occurrences of El Ni/o years and large, cataclysmic volcanic eruptions to determine which event, El Ni/o or volcano (if either), might potentially be the causal agent for the inferred, induced short-term climatic fluctuation. Figure 4 displays the results of this analysis. All the top panels in Figure 4 show the resultant 22 contingency tables, comparing first differences (in particular, answering the question, yes or no, that the value of the first difference is 0) of equivalent 8   1834  1858 (n=25)  10.0 4 P = 1.3% 4 5 P = 50.0% 7 6 8 2 11  ^ x  1818  1824, 1834  1848 (n=22)  9.5  ^ y  9.0  8.5  8.0  Equivalent Mean Temperature (C) at Armagh Observatory, T  7.5  ^ y = 7.30192 + 0.00585 x r = 0.498, r2 = 0.248 se = 0.490, t = 2.791 ^ x = 94.19851 + 42.33153 y r = 0.498, r2 = 0.248 se = 42.278, t = 2.750 cl > 98.0% cl > 98.0%  7.0 200 250 300 350 150 200 250 300 350  150  Number of Observing Days (Schwabe), Ns  Number of Observing Days (Wolf), Nw  9  Figure 3.

The results of Fisher 's exact test for the observed 22 contingency table (based on Schwabe's data), or one more suggestive of a departure from independence, is given, inferring that a preferential relationship is indicated between the two parameters at the 2-percent level of significance (P = 1.3 percent). For Schwabe's data, linear regression analysis yields a correlation coefficient r = 0.5, a coefficient of determination r = 0.25, a standard error of estimate (using Schwabe's data as the independent variable) se = 0.5, a Student t value (from hypothesis testing of the inferred slope of the regression in comparison to the null slope) t = 2.79, the inferred confidence level for the regression cl >98 percent, and the regression equation y = a + bx, where a is the y-axis intercept and b is the slope.

Recall that the first difference of a parameter is simply the numeric difference between next year 's value with this year 's value. Thus, the first difference provides an additional means whereby one can easily determine whether or not a preferential association might exist between the observed parametric behavior (higher or lower value in the next year, corresponding to either the yes or no response, respectively) and a suspected causal agent (here, either the year marking the occurrence of an El Ni/o event or of a large, cataclysmic volcanic eruption). Concerning the behavior of the first difference in equivalent mean temperature (left panels), one finds that there appears to be no preferential association between it and whether or not an El Ni/o event occurred during any given year. The probability of obtaining the observed result (i.e., the 22 contingency table, 8:5:13:15), or one more suggestive of a departure from independence, is computed to be (from Fisher 's exact test) 44.7 percent, inferring that chance alone can easily account for the observed result. In contrast, a preferential association (of marginal statistical significance) is indicated between the first difference in equivalent mean temperature and whether or not a large, cataclysmic volcanic eruption occurred during any given year. The probability of obtaining the observed result (5:9:9:18), or one more suggestive of a departure from independence, is computed to be 5.9 percent. Thus, when a year is described as being (or not being) an El Ni/o year, this alone is insufficient to estimate the direction of the trend in temperature at Armagh (i.e., warmer or colder in the next year), while when a year is described as being (or not being) a large, cataclysmic volcanic eruption year, the probable trend may be reckoned (i.e., colder in the next year when the answer is yes and warmer in the next year when the answer is no). Concerning the behaviors of the first difference in Schwabe's (middle panels) and Wolf 's (right panels) yearly number of observing days in comparison to whether or not an El Ni/o event or a large cataclysmic volcanic eruption occurred, one finds that the resultant 22 contingency tables, similarly (a la the first difference in equivalent mean temperature), do not support the contention that a preferential association exists between the first difference in yearly numbers of observing days and the occurrence of an El Ni/o year, while they do favor the existence of a preferential association, at least, for Schwabe's case, between the first difference in yearly number of observing days and the occurrence of a large cataclysmic volcanic eruption year (statistically speaking, the inferred preferential association is only of marginal statistical significance--8.5 percent). Thus, when a year is described as being (or not being) an El Ni/o year, this alone is insufficient to determine the direction of the trend in yearly number of observing days (whether one uses Schwabe's record or Wolf 's reconstructed record), while when a year is described as being (or not being) a large cataclysmic volcanic eruption year, the probable trend may be reckoned (i.e., a reduction in the yearly number of observing days in the next year when the answer is yes and an increase in the yearly number of observing days in the next year when the answer is no). To summarize this subsection, statistically speaking, there appears to be evidence suggesting a preferential association between dips in yearly numbers of observing days in Europe (i.e., a paucity of observing days) and episodes of colder clime as recorded at Armagh Observatory (Northern Ireland), with both, possibly, being the consequence of large cataclysmic (VEI 4) volcanic eruptions that occurred either in the tropics or in the extra-tropical northern hemisphere.

For El Ni/o events and large, cataclysmic volcanic eruptions, a yes response means that such an occurrence was seen for that year, while a no response means that such an occurrence was not seen for that year. Similarly, a yes response for the first difference means that the first difference is 0, inferring that temperature is either the same or warmer and number of observing days is either the same or more in the following year, while a no response means that the first difference is <0, inferring that temperature is cooler and number of observing days is fewer in the next year. The 22 tables suggest that El Ni/o events do not appear to be the causal agent for changes in temperature at Armagh or changes in number of observing days, while they support (marginally) the contention that large, cataclysmic volcanic eruptions may induce the observed changes in temperature and number of observing days.  11   examination of the larger specific dips, numbers 1, 2, 4, and 5, will be accomplished, using appropriate monthly counts of observing days relative to the month of occurrence for particular large, cataclysmic volcanic eruptions, the ones suspected as being the causal agents. 2.3 Specific Examples Prior to the examination of these dips, because one now will be using monthly data, it is essential that any seasonal effects, should they be found to exist, be removed. Figure 5 plots the monthly averages of number of observing days based, separately, on Schwabe's observed record (the solid line) and Wolf 's reconstructed record (the dashed line). Clearly, a seasonal effect, indeed, is found in both, with the number of observing days per month, on average, being lowest for November through February and highest for May through August, and with the months in between showing transition (i.e., increasing in number of observing days in MarchApril and decreasing in number of observing days in SeptemberOctober). The question now is, after correcting for this seasonal effect in the data, do the number of observing days still vary in any preferential way? One anticipates that if a real preferential association truly exists between the behavior of number of observing days and the occurrence of a large, cataclysmic volcanic eruption, then evidence for a persistent behavioral pattern should remain. In particular, one expects either that many, if not most, of the months following a large, cataclysmic volcanic eruption (either as an immediate response or, possibly, as a delayed response, dependent upon the time of year of the eruption and its location52, 57) to, generally, be below average in number of observing days as compared to times when an eruption either did not occur or has not occurred for sometime--or that certain seasons might contribute more strongly to the paucity of observing days, as compared to others. Figures 6 (Wolf 's data) and 7 (Schwabe's data) plot the number of observing months per year when below average, seasonally adjusted number of observing days occurred and shows the occurrences of specific large, cataclysmic volcanic eruptions. For Wolf 's data (18181848), a fairly strong, seemingly preferential, response is found for the eruptions of Tambora (1815), Galunggung (1822), Cosiguina (1835), and Hekla (1845), corresponding to Dips numbered 1, 2, 4, and 5, respectively, with a possible (but obviously weaker) response found for Kliuchevskoi (1829), corresponding to Dip number 3. For Schwabe's data (18441858; recall that his earlier data, 18261843, have only been published in terms of yearly counts), because they are available in monthly format only from 1844, a fairly strong, seemingly preferential, response is found only for Hekla (1845), corresponding to Dip number 5. It is noteworthy that the eruptions of Tambora and Cosiguina have been identified as the source regions (i.e., causal agents) for specific signatures in the Greenlandic/Antarctic ice core deposits,54, 5864 thereby, indicating that these events were truly globally effective. 2.3.1. Tambora (1815): The Interval of 1818 1821 (Dip Number 1) Figure 8 displays the monthly residual determined from Wolf 's data (defined here as NW  S(NW), where NW is the number of observing days per month and S(NW) is the appropriate interval monthly average; i.e., the seasonal adjustment term), where negative values indicate a loss of observing days and positive values indicate an excess of observing days for each month as compared to the average frequency, for the interval of 18181821, which corresponds to Dip number 1, and is plotted in relation (elapsed time) to the eruption of Tambora (VEI = 7), located on Sumbawa Island, Indonesia (8.25S, 118.00E), in April 1815. The Tambora event is the largest (and deadliest), cataclysmic volcanic eruption that is known to have 12   30  25 Schwabe (1844 1858) S(Ns)  Number of Observing Days  20  15  Wolf (1818 1848) S(Nw)  10  5  J  F  M  A  M  J  J  A  S  O  N  D  Calendar Month Figure 5.

The heavier line is the 4-mo moving average (which ignores single-month variations) and the shaded portions correspond to the winter seasons (DecemberFebruary). Two smaller eruptions (in 1817 and 1818) are also identified that may be related to a restrengthening of the decrease after 1819. It is unfortunate that the record of monthly observations begins in 1818 rather than some earlier time before 1815. Had the observing record begun at a slightly earlier date, one would have been able to see the full ramification of the suspected, induced climatic perturbation (that surely must have accompanied it) of this truly spectacular event, instead of just speculating about it, especially, with regards to the loss in observing days (perhaps, to a number of observing days substantially smaller than was seen in 1818). Figure 8 shows that, while the number of observing days, as reconstructed by Wolf, was slowly increasing between 1818 and 1819 (typically, the net loss was worst in the winter seasons of 18171818 and 1818 1819), throughout all of 1818 it was negative in value (i.e., below average in number), and it continued so until the spring of 1819 when recovery appears to be finished. From this, one infers that the effects of the Tambora event lasted approximately 4 yr (in agreement with Stother 's optical depth curve).65 Following recovery, another dip (of smaller size) is suggested which may be related (as noted above) to the smaller eruptions of Raung (VEI = 4?) on the island of Java (Indonesia) in January 1817 and/or Colima Volc. Complex (VEI = 4) in Mexico in February 1818. The smaller, gentler dip that seems to begin in 1819 and ends in early 1821 has its greatest monthly losses in July 1819 and July 1820, as well as the winter season of 18201821. The initial behavior of increasing number of observing days from 1818 through 1819 is taken as evidence for improving atmospheric conditions following the Tambora event. Recall, that the estimated stratospheric loading of sulfur (based on ice core records; e.g., Delmas et al.61) that has been attributed to the Tambora event of 1815, the event marking the end of a 3-yr period of continuous volcanic activity of Mt. Tambora (18121815), is the largest loading that has been found in the ice core records over the past five centuries. It measures about twice that of a suspected, yet unidentified, volcanic eruption that is believed to have occurred in the tropics around 180957, 61, 64 and measures several times larger than that attributed to the eruptions of Krakatau (VEI = 6) in 1883 or Agung (VEI = 4) in 1963,61 both of these events also being located in Indonesia. According to Landsberg and Albert,66 Stothers,65 and Simkin and Siebert,18 the devastating Tambora event of 1815 reduced the height of Mt. Tambora from 4 km to about 2.85 km; it took the lives of about 92,000 people; it was audible from at least 2,600 km away; it generated a tsunami of 14 m in height that spread outward at least 1,200 km; it caused pitch darkness, lasting up to 2 days, over a distance of 600 km; it created unusual twilight and atmospheric conditions in North America and Europe that persisted from months to years; and it appears to have evoked (or, at least, contributed to) a global cooling in surface temperature that did not recover until the end of the second decade of the 1800's, a cooling that, very well, is of similar or greater magnitude than that which was seen following the more recent eruptions of Krakatau (VEI = 6) in 1883, Santa Maria (VEI = 6) in 1902, Katmai (VEI = 6) in 1912, Agung (VEI = 4) in 1963, El Chichn (VEI = 5) in 1982, and Pinatubo (VEI = 6) in 1991.12, 13 The inferred cooling, and subsequent warming, is quite apparent in the Armagh record of equivalent mean temperature (see Figure 2; also, it is very apparent in the June mean temperature records for New Haven, Connecticut55), and the increasing number of observing days per month (from Europe), following the event, certainly hints that some sort of recovery process was taking place between 1818 and 1819. Furthermore, it seems noteworthy that the 16   years (and individual seasons) following the Tambora event rank near the top in several categories of anomalous behaviors as gleaned from tree ring studies. For example, Lough and Fritts67 have found the summer and fall seasons of 1815 and the winter and spring seasons of 1816 to be among the most anomalous of periods, based on tree ring chronologies from North America. Also, Briffa et al.68, 69 have found the reconstruction of surface temperature, based upon ""maximum latewood densities,"" to suggest that, beginning about 1812, a sharp lowering of temperature in Europe and North America occurred which persisted until about 1820, with the years 1812, 1814, and 1816 being extremely cool, especially the summers (see also, Jones et al.70). 2.3.2. Galunggung (1822): The Interval of 18221825 (Dip Number 2) Figure 9 displays Wolf 's residual for the years of 18211828, which spans the interval of 18221825, corresponding to Dip number 2. Galunggung (VEI = 5), located on the island of Java, Indonesia (7.25S, 108.05E) erupted in October 1822. Prior to the eruption and continuing a few months after the eruption, the residual is found to be well in excess of the average monthly frequency, indicating very good weather (and warmer clime) in Europe. Following the first winter season, however, the number of observing days falls precipitously from an excess of more than 13 days above average in January 1823 to a loss of about 18 observing days below average for February 1824, with the winter of 18231824 being extremely harsh, as adjudged by the number of lost observing days. Thereafter, in a series of ups and downs, spanning the spring and summer seasons of 1824, the number of observing days increases and returns to prevent levels (indicative of better weather and warmer clime; see Figure 2). According to Simkin and Siebert,18 about 4,000 people perished in this event, the fourth largest number of deaths attributed to the largest volcanic eruptions of the 19th and 20th centuries (the top three are Tambora1815, 92,000; Krakatau 1883, >36,000; and Santa Maria1902, >5,000). Although mention of this event is lacking in the chronology of Cole-Dai et al.,64 it is interesting to note that their Figure 6 (p. 16, 768) seems to show the presence (i.e., a spike) of an elevated SO42concentration of nearly the size of the inferred unknown event of 1809 at about the appropriate place for the Galunggung event of 1822. Perhaps, researchers can reexamine their data in the vicinity of this eruption to yield more information about its inferred stratospheric loading. Certainly, the behavior of the residual for this event is most striking and, when coupled with the apparent plunge in equivalent mean temperature at Armagh Observatory (see Figure 2), strongly suggests that this event induced a real, short-term, globally effective, climatic perturbation. 2.3.3. Cosiguina (1835): The Interval of 18341843 (Dip Number 4) Figure 10 shows Wolf 's residual for the years of 18341840, corresponding to the bulk of the interval associated with Dip number 4 (being the longest--at least 7 yr in duration and being one of the two deepest, the other being Dip number 2--at least, 4050 percent reduction in number of observing days per year--of the dips that are known from start to finish; see figs. 1 or 2). The residual is drawn in relation to the eruption of Cosiguina (VEI = 5), located in Nicaragua (12.98N, 87.57W), in January 1835. Following the eruption, the residual is observed to precipitously decline from an excess of more than 4 observing days per month (above average) in January 1835 to a loss exceeding 22 observing days per month (below average) in August 1835, with recovery extending beyond 1840. The 4-mo moving average is found to slowly decline through 1836 and into 1837 before trending upward. 17   Raung 8.13 S, 114.04 E January 16, 1817 (VEI=4 ?) +30 Tambora 8.25 S, 118.00 E April 10, 1815 (VEI=7)  Colima Volc.

Supporting evidence for the global effectiveness of this event is the short-term climatic fluctuation that is seen in the equivalent mean temperature record at Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland (see Fig. 2; also, see the decrease in June mean temperature for New Haven, Connecticut, in 1836 as described by Stommel and Stommel55), and the findings of Briffa et al.68 that the summers over Europe in the 1830's were cooler than usual, especially in the north (Scandinavia), based upon the reconstruction of temperature from maximum latewood densities of conifers. In another study, Briffa et al.69 note that the summers in the Mackenzie Valley of Canada in the 1830's were also cool, with the summer of 1836 being notably cold (true also for the regions of Quebec and Labrador), likewise, based upon the reconstruction of temperature from maximum latewood densities of conifers, and they suggested that the eruption of Cosiguina in 1835 was the causal agent for the inferred cooler clime in central North America (see also Jones et al.70). 2.3.4. Hekla (1845): The Interval of 18451850 (Dip Number 5) Figure 11 displays the monthly residual using Schwabe's data (i.e., NS  S(NS), where NS is the number of observing days per month, according to Schwabe, and S(NS ) is the appropriate interval monthly average; i.e., the seasonal adjustment term), plotted in relation to the eruption of Hekla (VEI = 4), located in Iceland (63.98N, 19.70W), in September 1845. While the largest eruption occurred in September 1845, Simkin and Siebert18 have noted that Hekla continued to be active well into 1846. From figure 11, one finds that the residual clearly was positive in value, indicating an excess of observing days above normal, from late 1845 through about September 1846, when the residual precipitously decreased to negative values, having the lowest values in the winter of 18461847, indicating a loss of about 11 days below normal. In terms of the 4-mo moving average, one finds that it stayed negative in value until about mid to late 1849, when recovery appears to be over. Because of its high northern latitude (64N), one expects that the Hekla eruption should not have a discernible signature in the ice core record of Antarctica and, indeed, none has been found; however, it probably should appear in the ice core record of Greenland, especially if the eruption truly is considered large and cataclysmic in nature (thereby, causing the inferred short-term climatic fluctuation).

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The June 1991 eruption of Pinatubo (VEI = 6) in the Philippines (15N) produced the largest sulfur dioxide cloud detected by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer aboard the Nimbus-7 satellite during its operational life.71 The SO2 cloud (and other byproducts of the explosion) was observed to encircle the Earth within about 3 wk, straddling the equator 2030 in latitude, and, over time, to migrate poleward (towards both poles), thereby, essentially blanketing the entire Earth.72 McCormick et al.73 have noted that the volcanic plume associated with the eruption of Pinatubo exceeded 30 km in height and injected into the stratosphere an aerosol mass loading of about 30 Tg, the largest aerosol perturbation believed to have occurred this century, although smaller than that estimated from the eruptions of Tambora in 1815 (>100 Tg) and Krakatau in 1883 (~50 Tg). The aerosol loading has been associated with an induced global cooling of the Earth's surface temperature, which only recently has returned to the pre-Pinatubo level,13, 74 inferring that the Pinatubo blast was globally effective for about 4 yr. While the Pinatubo blast is a remarkable event, affecting the entire Earth, historically, it is by no means unique. Another keen example of a large, cataclysmic volcanic eruption that affected world climate is the August 1883 blast of Krakatau (VEI = 6).75 One August 27, 1883, the island of Krakatau, Indonesia (6.10S, 105.42E) blew up, injecting a considerable amount of volcanic gases and debris to more than 30 km into the atmosphere, which quickly spread over the face of the Earth, causing colorful displays at twilight (including a blue, purple, and green Sun and moon). In late November 1883, the drifting pall arrived over Europe, and researchers at Montpellier Observatory in the south of France noticed a most peculiar and unexpected happening. They observed the amount of solar energy received from the Sun (i.e., the insolation) to dramatically decrease from 30 percent above normal to 20 percent below normal, and to remain 10 percent below normal for the next 3 yr. Obviously, the eruption on Krakatau was globally effective for at least 3 yr. Robock and Mao12 have examined the 15 largest stratospheric-aerosol-producing volcanoes since 1866 and have concluded that the volcanic timescale is about 2 yr. Also, they have noted that surface cooling of about 0.10.2 C generally follows an eruption, with the timing of the cooling being dependent upon the location (high latitude versus low latitude) of the blast and the season when it occurred. Furthermore, Delmas et al.61 and Cole-Dai et al.64 have listed a number of large, cataclysmic volcanic eruptions whose signatures are found in the ice core records of Antarctica, and Zielinski et al.57 have listed those whose signatures appear in the ice core records of Greenland. Additionally, Delmas et al.61 have noted that the deposition in the ice cores in Antarctica suggest durations of, typically, 14 yr (averaging about 23 yr in length) and Stuiver et al.76 have found that volcanic aerosols depress central Greenland annual temperature and annual 18O/16O for about 4 yr after each major eruptive event. From this, one can infer that a large, cataclysmic volcanic eruption is capable of producing a globally distributed aerosol (presuming the eruption to occur in the tropics), having a residence time of up to several years, that can induce a short-term climatic fluctuation (especially, as related to insolation or surface air temperature).  23   In this investigation, evidence has been presented that suggests that large, cataclysmic (VEI 4) volcanic eruptions in the tropics and extra-tropical northern hemisphere induced short-term climatic changes in Europe during the early premodern era years of sunspot observations (18181858). The effect is clearly seen in the annual mean temperature record of the Armagh Observatory (Northern Ireland), as a temporary cooling, and in the actual observing record of Samuel Heinrich Schwabe (in Dessau, Germany) and the blended (reconstructed) record of Rudolf Wolf, as a temporary reduction in the number of observing days available for viewing the Sun. In particular, the eruptions of Tambora (VEI = 7; Indonesia) in 1815, Galunggung (VEI = 5; Indonesia) in 1822, Cosiguina (VEI = 5; Nicaragua) in 1835, and, perhaps, Hekla (VEI = 4; Iceland) in 1845 show the effect most dramatically--a decline in temperature of up to several tenths of a degree Celsius or more, with a corresponding reduction in the number of observing days, in some cases, extremely large reductions. Additionally, this novel finding, linking volcanic eruption, temperature change, and paucity in number of observing days, suggests that during ""the lost record years"" of the Armagh Observatory (18251833), a brief cooling occurred in Europe that might be related to the eruption of Kliuchevskoi (VEI = 4; Kamchatka, Russia) in 1829. Wolf 's attempt to generate a continuous (no gaps) record of relative sunspot numbers from an international cadre of observers, while very useful from the sunspot cycle perspective, is seen to have unwittingly undermined the potential gains of using number of observing days as an instrument for monitoring short-term climatic change at a particular locale.  24   REFERENCES  1. 2. 3.

ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words)  During the interval of 18181858, several curious decreases in the number of sunspot observing days per year are noted in the observing record of Samuel Heinrich Schwabe, the discoverer of the sunspot cycle, and in the reconstructed record of Rudolf Wolf, the founder of the now familiar relative sunspot number. These decreases appear to be nonrandom in nature and often extended for 13 yr (or more). Comparison of these decreases with equivalent annual mean temperature (both annual means and 4-yr moving averages), as recorded at Armagh Observatory (Northern Ireland), indicates that the temperature during the years of decreased number of observing days trended downward near the start of each decrease and upward (suggesting some sort of recovery) just before the end of each decrease. The drop in equivalent annual mean temperature associated with each decrease, as determined from the moving averages, measured about 0.10.7C. The decreases in number of observing days are found to be closely related to the occurrences of large, cataclysmic volcanic eruptions in the tropics or northern hemisphere. In particular, the interval of increasing number of observing days at the beginning of the record (i.e., 18181819) may be related to the improving atmospheric conditions in Europe following the 1815 eruption of Tambora (Indonesia; 8S), which previously has been linked to ""the year without a summer"" (in 1816) and which is the strongest eruption in recent history, while the decreases associated with the years of 1824, 1837, and 1847 may be linked, respectively, to the large, cataclysmic volcanic eruptions of Galunggung (Indonesia; 7S) in 1822, Cosiguina (Nicaragua) in 1835, and, perhaps, Hekla (Iceland; 64N) in 1845. Surprisingly, the number of observing days per year, as recorded specifically by Schwabe (from Dessau, Germany), is found to be linearly correlated against the yearly mean temperature at Armagh Observatory (r = 0.5 at the 2 percent level of significance); thus, years of fewer sunspot observing days in the historical record seem to indicate years of probable cooler clime, while years of many sunspot observing days seem to indicate years of probable warmer clime (and vice versa). Presuming this relationship to be real, one infers that the observed decrease in the number of observing days near 1830 (i.e., during ""the lost record years"" of 1825 to 1833) provides a strong indication that temperatures at Armagh (and, perhaps, most of Europe, as well) were correspondingly cooler. If true, then, the inferred cooling may have resulted from the eruption of Kliuchevskoi (Russia; 56N) in 1829. 14. SUBJECT TERMS 15.

GX051-12-8884455	Hubble Space Telescope            Hubble Space Telescope  Credits - NASA     The Hubble Space Telescope (HST), named after American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, is the most sophisticated telescope ever orbited. It has contributed more to changing our understanding of the Universe than any other scientific instrument. HST is a joint project of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the European Space Agency (ESA) and operates for the benefit of scientists  worldwide . Every day, Hubble archives 3 to 5 gigabytes of data and delivers between 10 and 15 gigabytes to astronomers all over the world.  The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland, is responsible for conducting and coordinating the science operations of telescope.         The idea for such an observatory first surfaced in the 1940s; it was authorized by the U.S. Congress in 1977, and designed and built in the 1970s and 1980s. L aunched on April 25, 1990, from the Space Shuttle  Discovery,  it orbits 375 miles   (600 kilometers) above Earth.. Its  science instruments include three cameras, two spectrographs, and fine guidance sensors. Its primary mirror has a diameter of  94.5 inches (240 centimeters).  The telescope is able to produce high-resolution images of astronomical objects of great clarity, brightness, and detail because it is located above the Earth's atmosphere, which limits and distorts observations made by ground-based telescopes with comparable optics.          The telescope was designed for long-term use, made possible by regular servicing missions that repair or replace worn out or malfunctioning parts and upgrade equipment to the latest state of the art. It is the first scientific mission of any kind designed for routine servicing by spacewalking astronauts. Its   modular design allows the astronauts to take it apart, replace worn out equipment, and upgrade instruments. Each time a science instrument in Hubble is replaced, it increases Hubble scientific power by a factor of 10 or greater.         Although it was discovered soon after launch that the primary mirror on the telescope had been manufactured with a  spherical aberration , resulting in fuzzy images, the first servicing mission in December 1993 corrected the condition and it has returned top-quality images ever since. As of March 2002, there have been four visits to the telescope.                               Home   |   About Us   |   Calendar   |   Wright Brothers History   |   History of Flight   |   Sights & Sounds   |   Licensed Products   |   Education   |   Links  |   Sitemap
GX006-59-1912899	How Good is the Amazing  Hubble Space Telescope?           If you could see as well as the Wide Field and Planetary Camera on the Hubble Space Telescope, you would be able to read the fine print on a newspaper one mile away!      You may have seen some of the awesome pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope.  These pictures were actually taken by the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) that flies aboard the Hubble.      In this 1993 picture, NASA Space Shuttle astronauts install the WFPC2 camera on the Hubble Space Telescope.  Besides taking pictures, the camera acts like eyeglasses to correct a flaw in the telescope's mirror.  This camera is very sensitive to the faintest light, and it can focus on objects very far away.     Instead of trying to read newspapers, WFPC2 focuses on the faintest and most far away objects in the universe. They include other galaxies, cloudy bubbles of gas from dying stars, and gassy regions that are the nurseries where stars are born.  See some of these breath-taking objects as captured by WFPC2.

GX006-60-7147359	The  Hubble Space Telescope                             Guess what?          The  Hubble Space   Telescope  was named after            Edwin Hubble , an            astronomer  whose contributions to astronomy include a classification          system for   galaxies  and the Hubble Constant.  The Hubble Constant          defines the relationship between a galaxy's distance from the Earth and          the speed with which the galaxy is moving away from the Earth.                       Sing me a song about HST!   ( Words )                Long before man ventured into space,    astronomers  longed for the ability to put a telescope in space far above  Earth's obscuring   atmosphere .  In 1962, a National Academy of Sciences  committee recommended the development of just such a telescope.  In 1968 and  1972,   satellites  for observing the stars were launched.  These satellites  provided the basis on which a larger, more powerful space-based telescope could  be built.  With the development of the Space Shuttle came the capability for  the delivery and servicing of a space telescope.  In 1973,   NASA  selected a team  of scientists to determine the basic design of the telescope while Congress  authorized the funding for the telescope in 1977.  Construction and assembly of  the telescope was completed in 1985. The  Hubble Space Telescope  was  originally due to be launched in 1986, but the explosion of the Space Shuttle   Challenger  delayed the launch until April 24, 1990.  Once in   orbit , a  defect in the optical mirrors of the telescope prevented the clarity that  scientists had hoped for when viewing images provided by the telescope.  On  December 2, 1993, a crew from the Space Shuttle  Endeavor  installed  corrective devices which brought  the images  into clear focus .                                                            HST  at Kennedy prior to launch                                                                                       Servicing the  Hubble Space Telescope                            The  Hubble  has a variety of scientific instruments on-board.  Among  the instrumentation are two cameras, two   spectrographs , and guidance sensors.    Hubble  is controlled by scientists here on Earth who use    gyroscopes  to measure the rate at which  Hubble  is moving.  When   Hubble  is being re-aimed from one object to another, it moves very, very  slowly.  Other gyroscopes help keep the telescope pointed steadily at its  target.  Scientists communicate with  Hubble  by   radio   signals.   Hubble , in turn, sends images and data it has gathered to  Earth by radio signals.  Data from  Hubble  are relayed to the  Tracking  and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS)  that is in a    geosynchronous orbit  above Earth.  This satellite relays the data to a  terminal in White Sands, New Mexico.  This terminal then sends the information  up to another satellite which then sends it down to NASA at Goddard Space  Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.  Any communication to  Hubble  has  to travel back along the same path.            Hubble  has two solar panels which are each 2.3 meters by 11.9 meters  in size.  These panels convert sunlight directly into electricity which   Hubble  then uses to power its instrumentation.  It takes 96 minutes for   Hubble  to complete one orbit of Earth.  The  Hubble  was designed  to work in orbit for fifteen years.  The Space Shuttle and its astronauts are  to perform servicing missions throughout  Hubble 's lifetime.  In addition  to keeping  Hubble  running smoothly, astronauts will attach new  instrumentation to further increase  Hubble 's capabilities.  Just such a  mission occurred in February of 1997 when the astronauts not only installed new instruments, but made repairs to the insulation which protects Hubble from the extreme temperatures in space.

GX229-36-2314339	"February 1999  The Earth Observing System Terra Series These ar ticles focus on the overarching science priorities of the EOS Terra mission  Aerosols What Are Aerosols? Aerosols are tiny particles suspended in the air. Most occur naturally, originating from volcanoes, dust storms, forest and grassland fires, living vegetation, and sea spray (Figure 1). Human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and the alteration of natural surface cover, also generate aerosols. Averaged over the globe, aerosols made by human activities currently account for about 10 percent of the total amount of aerosols in our atmosphere. Most of that 10 percent is concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere, especially downwind of industrial sites, slash-and-burn agricultural regions, and overgrazed grasslands. Scientists have much to learn about the way aerosols affect regional and global climate. We have yet to accurately quantify the impacts of natural aerosols on climate, relative to impacts of aerosols made by humans. Moreover, we do not know whether the total amount of atmospheric aerosol is roughly constant, is diminishing, or is increasing. Overall, we do not even know whether aerosols are warming or cooling our planet.  Figure 1. Aerosol particles larger than about 1 micrometer in size are produced by processes such as windblown dust and sea salt from sea spray and bursting bubbles. Aerosols smaller than 1 micrometer are mostly formed by condensation processes such as conversion of sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas (released from volcanic eruptions) to sulfate particles and by formation of soot and smoke during burning processes. After formation, the aerosols are mixed and transported by atmospheric motions and are primarily removed by cloud and precipitation processes.    2  Why do we care about aerosols? Aerosols tend to cause cooling of the Earth's surface immediately below them. Because most aerosols reflect sunlight back into space, they have a ""direct"" cooling effect by reducing the amount of solar radiation that reaches the surface. The magnitude of this cooling effect depends on the size and composition of the aerosol particles, as well as the reflective properties of the underlying surface. It is thought that aerosol cooling may partially offset expected global warming that is attributed to increases in the amount of carbon dioxide from human activity. Aerosols are also believed to have an ""indirect"" effect on climate by changing the properties of clouds (Figures 2a and 2b). Indeed, if there were no aerosols in the atmosphere, there would be no clouds. It is very difficult to form cloud droplets without small aerosol particles acting as ""seeds"" to start the formation of cloud droplets. As aerosol concentration increases within a cloud, the water in the cloud gets spread over many more particles, each of which is correspondingly smaller. Smaller particles fall more slowly in the atmosphere and decrease the amount of rainfall. In this way, changing aerosols in the atmosphere can change the frequency of cloud occurrence, cloud thickness, and rainfall amounts. Adding aerosols to a cloudy area may create smaller cloud droplets. This could produce brighter clouds (reflecting more sunlight), and ones that last longer, since smaller cloud droplets are less likely to fall out of the atmosphere as rain. Very little is known about the scale of these indirect effects and the circumstances under which they operate. We need frequent global observations of cloud and aerosol properties to help us gain a better understanding of how they interact with one another. Aerosol particles may be solid or liquid; they range in size from 0.01 microns (or micrometers) to several tens of microns. For example, cigarette smoke particles are in the middle of this size range and typical cloud drops are 10 or more microns in diameter. Under normal circumstances, the majority of aerosols form a thin haze in the lower atmosphere (troposphere), where they are washed out of the air by rain within about a week. Aerosols are also found in the atmosphere just above the troposphere  Figure 2a. The high aerosol concentrations in these clouds provide the nucleation points necessary for the formation of many small liquid water droplets. Up to 90% of visible radiation (light) is reflected from these clouds.  Figure 2b. Clouds with low aerosol concentrations and a few large droplets do not scatter light well, and transmit roughly half of the Sun's light.   3  (called the ""stratosphere""). A severe volcanic eruption, such as Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991, can put large amounts of aerosol into the stratosphere. Since it does not rain in the stratosphere, these aerosols can remain there for many months, producing beautiful sunsets around the globe, and possibly causing summer temperatures to be cooler than normal. Scientists estimate that Mount Pinatubo injected about 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, cooling average global temperatures over the following year by about half a degree (Figure 3). During the last 30 years, scientist have identified several major aerosol types and they have developed general ideas about the amount of aerosol to be found in different seasons and locations. Still, key details about the amount and properties of aerosols are needed to calculate even their current effect on surface temperatures and so far it has not been possible to make these measurements on a global scale. New Measurement Capabilities Currently, satellite instruments provide our best hope of making, at a reasonable cost, continuous, global observations of aerosols to help scientists measure how these particles influence climate. Two instruments onboard NASA's Terra spacecraft will work together to measure atmospheric aerosols. The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument has nine separate cameras that will collect global imagery on the daylit side of the Earth. These cameras will look at the Earth in nine different directions and at four separate wavelengths. MISR will produce a multi-angle, multi-spectral data set unlike any ever before obtained by satellite instruments. The new information will make it possible to accurately estimate average particle size and composition, as well as aerosol amount, measured over ocean.  MISR data will also measure aerosol properties in the atmosphere over land and over dense, dark vegetation. With MISR data, scientists will be able to distinguish air masses containing different aerosol types on a routine basis around the globe. Experimenters with instruments on the ground and in aircraft will work with the MISR team to characterize the particles in these air masses. MISR's global aerosol monitoring program will contribute to studies of the Earth's energy balance, (see Earth's Energy Balance, NASA Facts FS-1999-*****) and will provide inputs to computer models of regional and global trends in Earth's climate. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) will study the atmosphere, land, and ocean in a wide range of ""colors""--spectral bands in the visible and infrared regions of the spectrum. The daily multispectral measurements from MODIS will be used to measure global aerosol amounts, and to distinguish between relatively large desert dust particles and small  Figure 3. As volcanoes erupt, they blast huge clouds into the atmosphere. These clouds are made up of particles and gases, including sulfur dioxide (SO2). Millions of tons of sulfur dioxide gas from a major volcanic eruption can reach the stratosphere. There, with the help of water vapor (H2O), the sulfur dioxide converts to tiny persistent sulfuric acid (H2SO4) aerosols. These aerosols reflect energy coming from the sun, thereby preventing the sun's rays from heating the Earth. Volcanic eruptions are thought to be responsible for the global cooling that has been observed for a few years after a major eruption. The amount and global extent of the cooling depend on the force of the eruption and, possibly, on its latitude.    4  particles in smoke and industrial/urban pollution. The instrument contains an alarm that will alert scientists when a volcano erupts, enabling them to observe and measure the volcanic plume. MODIS will also provide information about the distribution and characteristics of forest fires and help scientists estimate their emissions (e.g., gases and smoke particles) released from burning biomass. Moreover, MODIS will measure the properties of clouds--such as droplet size--and will determine how aerosols may impact clouds' abilities to reflect sunlight back into space. Detailed measurements of aerosol properties from 100 ground-based automated instruments distributed around the world will complement the aerosol data obtained by MISR and MODIS. This network of robotic aerosol observing stations, called AERONET, looks upward from the ground, providing information about aerosol amount, particle properties, and their effect on solar radiation. Each AERONET station contains a computer that operates the instrument automatically, collects and organizes the data, and sends the results via satellite to NASA. Using MISR, MODIS, and AERONET data, along with field and aircraft measurements by teams of scientists from many countries, researchers will determine with greater accuracy than ever before the role aerosols play in reflecting and absorbing sunlight, and the indirect effect aerosols have on the properties of clouds.  The Terra Spacecraft Terra is the flagship of the Earth Observing System (EOS), a series of spacecraft to observe the Earth from the unique vantage point of space. Focused on key measurements identified by a consensus of U.S. and international scientists, EOS will enable research on the complex interactions of Earth's land, ocean, air, ice and life systems. Terra will circle the Earth in an orbit that descends perpendicularly across the equator each day at 10:30 a.m. local time, when cloud cover is at a minimum and the space-based view of the surface is least obstructed. Each individual swath of measurements can be compiled into global images as frequently as every two days. Over a month or more, in combination with measurements from other polar orbiting satellites, Terra measurements will provide accurate monthly-mean climate assessments that can be compared with computer model simulations and predictions. The Earth Observing System has three major components: the EOS spacecraft, an advanced ground-based computer network for processing, storing, and distributing the resulting data (the EOS Data and Information System); and teams of scientists and applications specialists who will study the data and help users in industry, universities and the public apply it to issues ranging from agriculture to urban planning.

GX072-52-4205538	"February 15, 2002   PINATUBO VOLCANO RESEARCH BOOSTS CASE FOR HUMAN-CAUSED GLOBAL WARMING    Research into the worldwide climatic impact of the 1991 Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption during the 10 years since the eruption has strengthened the case for human causes of global warming, a Rutgers scientist reports in a paper published in the February 14 issue of the international journal, Science.   The Pinatubo research also has improved scientists' ability to forecast the impact of future volcanoes on weather and climate, says the paper's author, Alan Robock of the university's Center for Environmental Prediction in the Department of Environmental Sciences, Cook College.   According to Robock, the eruption on Luzon Island in the Philippines on June 15, 1991 produced the largest volcanic cloud of the 20th century and caused changes in worldwide climate and weather that were felt for years.   The changes wrought by Pinatubo's sulfuric acid cloud, which blocked a large percentage of sunlight from reaching the earth, initially included cooler summers and warmer winters, an overall net cooling at the earth's surface and altered winds and weather patterns, Robock said.   In certain areas such as the Middle East, it produced a rare snowstorm in Jerusalem and led to the death of coral at the bottom of the Red Sea, he noted.   The cloud also caused depletion of the ozone layer over Temperate Zone regions of the Northern Hemisphere where much of the world's population resides, in addition to the regular ozone ""hole"" which appears in October over Antarctica, the researcher said.   Most significant, the scientist said, Pinatubo helped validate computer-generated climate models that demonstrate human-caused global warming.   Using computer modeling, said Robock, scientists have been able to account for natural warming and cooling, as found in Arctic and Antarctic ice core samples and tree rings covering hundreds of years up to the last century.   ""If you plug in volcanic eruptions, El Nios, solar variations and other natural causes and try to simulate past climate changes, you can do a pretty good job of modeling climate change until the end of the 19th Century,"" the researcher said.   After that period, he said, natural causes alone don't account for the amount of warming, about 0.6 degrees Celsius (1.1 degrees Fahrenheit), that has taken place in the last century.   ""But when you factor in Pinatubo and other eruptions along with anthropogenic (human-caused) emissions,"" said the scientist, ""it accounts for the observed record of climate change for the past century, including the overall warming and episodic cooling, and validates the climate models.""   In addition to improving understanding of global warming, scientists will be able to develop better seasonal forecasts after the next major eruption occurs, he noted. ""Although overall the planet cools after volcanic eruptions, over Northern Hemisphere continents it actually gets warmer in the winter. This is because the wind patterns change in response to heating of the stratosphere by the volcanic aerosols.""   The ozone layer, which protects against the sun's life-damaging ultraviolet radiation, developed a hole over the South Pole during the last century due to human activity -- chlorofluorocarbons (freons) from refrigeration, air conditioning, and industrial processes, noted the researcher.   Because the Antarctic region is so cold, clouds are able to form in the stratosphere, Robock said. The cloud particles serve as surfaces to allow sunlight to catalyze chemical reactions involving chlorine and bromine pollutants that destroy ozone, he noted.   The Mount Pinatubo cloud provided a similar surface on sulfuric acid particles for pollutants to react with sunlight and destroy ozone over Temperate Zone regions of the globe, not just over the Antarctic region. ""So you get ozone depletion not just over Antarctica but over where we live,"" noted the researcher.   Ozone depletion by volcanic eruption is a recent phenomenon, said Robock. ""Elevated levels of chlorine in the stratosphere only started appearing within the last couple of decades due to human activity,"" he said.   The scientist added that as the use of chlorofluorocarbons and other human emissions are regulated by International agreement, ozone depletion should disappear in a few decades.   ""Researchers are already documenting that the amount of ozone-destroying compounds in the atmosphere has stopped rising, "" said Robock.   ##  Contacts:   Michele Hujber  732-932-9000 x555  HUJBER@AESOP.RUTGERS.EDU    Recommend this Article to a Friend    Back to:   News                              Subscribe to the Earth Observatory   About the Earth Observatory   Please send comments or questions to:  eobmail@eodomo.gsfc.nasa.gov    Responsible NASA official: Yoram Kaufman  NASA/GSFC Security and Privacy Statement"
GX072-50-14081930	"November 27, 2001   RESEARCHERS DISCOVER THAT VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS MASKED GLOBAL WARMING DURING THE PAST 20 YEARS    Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, who examined temperature data from 1979 to 1999, have discovered that large volcanic eruptions cooled the lower troposphere (the layer of atmosphere from the Earth?s surface to roughly 8 km above it) more than the surface, and likely masked the actual warming of the troposphere.    This research helps explain the apparent difference in warming rates at the Earth?s surface and in the lower troposphere. While the surface has warmed markedly over the past 20 years, temperatures in the lower troposphere have shown little or no increase. This discrepancy has been the focus of considerable scientific and political attention.    The research is presented in ""Accounting for the Effects of Volcanoes and ENSO in Comparisons of Modeled and Observed Temperature Trends,"" in the November edition of the Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres. LLNL researchers Benjamin Santer, Charles Doutriaux, James Boyle, Sailes Sengupta and Karl Taylor teamed with scientists from the National Center for Atmosphere Research, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space Studies, the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom, and the Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology in Germany.   The paper attempts to quantify volcanic influences on surface and tropospheric temperatures. Volcano ""signals"" are themselves masked by the temperature changes caused by El Nio events. The eruption of El Chichn in Mexico in 1982 coincided with a large El Nio event during the winter of 1982-83, while the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 occurred at the same time as El Nio of 1991-92. To study volcanic effects on temperature, El Nio influences must first be removed.   The atmospheric scientists used a statistical procedure to separate El Nio and volcanic effects in observed temperature records. They found that aerosol particles from El Chichn and Pinatubo cooled the lower troposphere and probably masked the actual warming of the troposphere. Volcanoes therefore supply at least part of the explanation for the different temperature trends at the Earth?s surface and in the troposphere.   This research undercuts claims by greenhouse skeptics that no warming has occurred during the last two decades. These claims are based on satellite measurements of temperatures in the lower troposphere, which show little or no warming since the beginning of the satellite record in 1979.   ""Our recent work shows that some of the differences between warming rates at the Earth's surface and in the lower troposphere are due to the effects of volcanic eruptions and stratospheric ozone depletion,"" said Santer, who works in LLNL?s Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison and is lead author of the JGR-A paper. ""Both of these factors probably cooled the lower troposphere by more than the surface, for physical reasons that are well-understood. Without ozone depletion and the recent eruptions of El Chichon and Pinatubo, it is highly likely that the lower troposphere would have warmed over the last two decades.""   Results from numerical models of the climate system reinforce these conclusions. Computer model experiments examined by the LLNL scientists suggest that it is important to include the effects of volcanoes and stratospheric ozone depletion (in addition to changes in other greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane). Doing so brings simulated surface and tropospheric temperature changes into better agreement with the observations.    ##   Contact:  Anne Stark  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory  925-422-9799  stark8@llnl.gov    Recommend this Article to a Friend    Back to:   News                              Subscribe to the Earth Observatory   About the Earth Observatory   Please send comments or questions to:  eobmail@eodomo.gsfc.nasa.gov    Responsible NASA official: Yoram Kaufman  NASA/GSFC Security and Privacy Statement"

Pinatubo, one of the most destructive volcanic eruptions of                   the last century. Found on the Bataan Peninsula on the island                   of Luzon in the Philippines, the volcano had been dormant for                   500 years when clouds of sulfur dioxide and tons of ash spewed                   from the crater. Ultimately over 600 lives were lost in the                   explosion and its aftermath.                     In addition to the devastation                   on the ground, however, the eruption had far reaching effects                   on our global atmosphere. Spreading sulfur dioxide and dust                   into the stratosphere affected both global temperature and                   Earth?s protective layer of ozone.

Streams                   of mud, called lahars, (resulting from ash from the eruption                   mixing with water- seen as the lighter sediment) continue to                   flow down the sides of the mountains, as well as channels of                   water (darker streams). However, as vegetation grows back, the                   ash becomes more stabilized and less likely to form the                   destructive lahars.

Pinatubo                   blasted a huge cloud of sulfur dioxide, shown in red, into the                   stratosphere. This data taken from NASA's Total Ozone Mapping                   Spectrometer (TOMS) instrument shows that initial burst of                   sulfur dioxide and its international path in the days                   following the eruption, from June 16th to June 30th. The                   sulfur gas cloud dissipates as the gas turns into droplets of                   sulfuric acid. Both the gas and subsequent acid were                   contributors to the overall dust cloud that cooled the global                   climate.

However, the                   initial effect of the injection of sulfur dioxide into the                   atmosphere was so strong, that a small hole was created in the                   ozone layer, (from June 15th, 1991 through June 30, 1991) as                   seen here, in blue, using TOMS data. This visualization shows                   global ozone levels before and after the eruption. After the                   hole dissipates, continued low levels of ozone, in very light                   blue, can be seen around the tropics.                      Image Courtesy:  NASA                     Shuttle                   Images of the Atmosphere                                                                                    Click                   here for print res image top left                     Click                   here for print res image top right                     These images highlight the                   difference in the atmosphere before and after the Mt.

These aerosols eventually                   made their way around the globe, contributing to a temporary                   worldwide cooling.

GX054-57-11369555	"December 10, 2003     Scientists ""Reconstruct"" Earth's Climate Over Past Millennia      Using the perspective of the last few centuries and millennia, speakers in a press conference at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco will discuss the latest research involving climate reconstructions and different climate models.    The press conference features Caspar Ammann of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), Boulder, Colo.; Drew Shindell of NASAs Goddard Institute for Space Studies, New York; and Tom Crowley of Duke University, Durham, N.C. The press conference is at 5 p.m. EST, Thursday, December 11 in the Moscone Convention Center West, Room 2012.    Changes in the suns activity have been considered responsible for some part of past climatic variations. Although useful measurements of solar energy are limited to the last 25 years of satellite data, this record is not long enough to confirm potential trends in solar energy changes over time. Tentative connections between the measured solar activity, with sunspots or the production of specific particles in the Earths atmosphere (such as carbon-14 and beryllium-10), have been used to estimate past solar energy.    Ammann will discuss how he used a set of irradiance estimates with the NCAR coupled Ocean-Atmosphere General Circulation computer model to show the climate system contains a clearly detectable signal from the sun. Ammanns work with the model also demonstrates that smaller, rather than larger, background trends in the suns emitted energy are in better agreement with the long-term climate record, as obtained from proxy climate records, such as tree-ring data.    Shindell will discuss how he used a climate model that included solar radiation changes, volcanic eruptions, and natural internal variability to arrive at a more accurate look at Earths changing climate today. Shindell said that while solar radiation changes and volcanoes exert a similar influence on global or hemispheric average-temperature changes, the solar component has the biggest regional effect over time scales of decades to centuries, while volcanoes cause the largest year-to-year changes.    Crowley will discuss one of the goals of climate modeling, to test whether moderately reliable predictions of regional climate change can be made under global warming scenarios. Using paleoclimate data, scientists can in some cases test computer climate-model performance. This testing would occur for a time period in which models accurately predict the larger (hemispheric-scale) response to changes in the Earths radiation balance.    NASAs Earth Science Enterprise is dedicated to understanding the Earth as an integrated system and applying Earth System Science to improve prediction of climate, weather and natural hazards using the unique vantage point of space.    NCAR is a research laboratory operated by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, a consortium of 67 universities offering doctoral programs in the atmospheric and related sciences. NCARs primary sponsor is the National Science Foundation.    ###  Contacts:   Elvia Thompson   Headquarters, Washington   Phone: 202/358-1696   Rob Gutro   Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.

A lag time of arguably 10-30 years allowed for the climate system to be affected by an increased ozone layer that altered the heating of the oceans. According to the model, diminished jet stream winds caused by a dimmer sun created cold land temperatures by reducing the transport of warm Pacific air to America and warm Atlantic air to Europe. During this shift, winter temperatures cooled as much as 2 to 4 degrees F - enough to freeze rivers and alter agriculture, economy, disease, etc    Pictured is the climate model used by researchers to watch temperature anomalies. As such, 1780 was used as an arbitrary baseline; the ice age period, then, is colder/bluer and 1780 is white or neutral. Redder colors in more modern times reflect warmer temperatures.

In that time, it goes from a minimum (seen here in 1996) to a maximum (2000) period of activity that affects us everyday. When particularly active, solar storms can spew tons of radiation to Earth in the form of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) that can affect power grids, spacecraft, and communication systems. Credit: NASA / ESA                            Carbon Trends    The lack of activity on the Sun was strongly felt during the Little Ice Age, yet scientists credit greenhouse gases and global warming with having such an impact on us today. Most experts point to 1850, start of the industrial age, to when the major influence of climate started to shift from the Sun to ourselves. Click on the image for an animation.

The 1991 Pinatubo eruption was sulfur-rich, producing volcanic clouds that lasted a number of years in the stratosphere. The Pinatubo eruption widely expanded the area of ozone loss over the Arctic and Antarctic. Red colors indicate higher elevations and blue colors indicate lower elevations for the plume.

This data taken from NASAs Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) instrument shows that initial burst of sulfur dioxide and its international path in the days following the eruption, from June 16th to June 30th.

However, the initial effect of the injection of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere was so strong, that a small hole was created in the ozone layer, (from June 15th, 1991 through June 30, 1991) as seen here, in blue, using TOMS data. This visualization shows global ozone levels before and after the eruption. After the hole dissipates, continued low levels of ozone, in very light blue, can be seen around the tropics.

Though ozone holes appear each year over the South Pole, low levels of ozone only occasionally form over the northern polar regions during very cold winters. Scientists say the northern ozone hole may reappear for several consecutive years after a period of high volcanic activity. A northern ozone hole could be significant because more people live in Arctic regions than near the South Pole.

Narrator (Dr. WILLIAM A. GUTSCH) over NASA and STScI footage and  animations of the HST and its discoveries:   November, 1995: the Hubble Space Telescope reveals  astonishing close-up  images of star forming regions in M-16, the Eagle  Nebula, some seven  thousand light years from Earth -- amazingly detailed images that show  organic-looking columns of gas, light years long, sculpted by the  pressure of light and particles from nearby stars.    In the years since its launch in 1990, the Hubble has looked much further  out into our still mysterious universe, peering deep into galaxies and  the black holes which seem to power some of them, painting a portrait of  dark space dotted with myriad shapes, the abode perhaps of other  astronomically-inclined beings who survey the universe with their own  space telescopes.     But Hubble itself has also  looked much closer to home, revealing a  colder, drier Mars than that seen by the last spacecraft to come this  way, twenty years ago. Hubble also tracked the impact of mountain-sized  chunks of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on Jupiter and surveyed the results of  this once -in-a-thousand lifetimes' cosmic collision.    Hampered at first by a misshapen mirror, a highly successful Servicing  Mission in 1993 replaced one camera and inserted corrective lenses that  restored much of Hubble's promised eyesight. This demonstrated that  further improvements can be expected from new instruments to be installed  in 1997 and on into the next century. This remarkable telescope, a  cooperative venture of America's NASA and the European Space Agency has  helped rewrite the book on our cosmos near and far, delivering  block-buster images from orbit nearly every week.        GUTSCH, on camera, in the lobby of STScI:  This is a model of the Hubble Space Telescope here at the Space Telescope  Science Institute in Baltimore. The real space telescope is five times  larger and orbits the globe every couple of hours more than three hundred  miles above our heads. Now I have a question for you. How would you like  to be able to use the real space telescope to observe objects across the  universe? Well, believe it or not, this coming March this largest  telescope ever put into space is going to be as close to you as your  television screen or your computer modem. Students like you from across  the country and around the world will be able to work with top research  scientists at deciding which of several objects in space we are going to  be studying next March with this very special telescope.     This program is going to tell you how to participate in this exciting and  totally unique experiment in science education and outreach. And outreach  is a good word because, via the Internet, you are going to be able to  reach out to this unique research tool.        closeup:   Hi, I'm Dr. Bill  Gutsch. Welcome to Live from the Hubble Space  Telescope.    Student announcer:  Passport to Knowledge presents Live from the Hubble Space Telescope.  TITLE SEQUENCE    Narrator (Dr. GUTSCH) over NASA and STScI footage and animations of  the HST and its discoveries:   The Hubble Space Telescope is an amazingly complex observatory,  forty-three feet long, the size of a school bus, and weighing over  twenty-five thousand pounds. Every few hours it orbits the Earth, passing  from dark night into the heat of sunlight. Packed deep down inside the  telescope's insulated shell is its ninety-four-and-a-half inch primary  mirror, which allows scientists to see things ten times clearer than the  telescopes on the surface of the Earth. A secondary mirror bounces light  from distant objects down into an area the size of a dinner plate, where  an array of cameras and other detectors wait. In outer space, the Hubble  can catch ultraviolet radiation, and sometimes infrared, blocked by the  Earth's turbulent water-laden atmosphere. An array of filters can select  different colors in different kinds of light, giving Hubble great  flexibility in the types of observations it can do.    Hubble signals bounce from orbit via Tracking and Data Relay Satellites  down to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, which  controls the spacecraft itself, and finally on to the Space Telescope  Science Institute on the campus of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore,  which is responsible for all scientific aspects of Hubble's missions.     GUTSCH on camera:   By now I think you can see  how unique and exciting a research tool the  Hubble Space Telescope is for doing cutting-edge astronomy. In fact, for  every five astronomers who want to get time on the Hubble Space Telescope  there's only enough time to give one of those a chance to actually use  it. (editor's note: the current ratio is more like 10:1, which makes our  project all the more astonishing!) But this Spring, NASA and the Space  Telescope Science Institute are giving us and you three complete orbits  of the Hubble Space Telescope with which to do some exciting new  research. And they are giving us all of the facilities, the scientists,  the computers, that they normally give the top researchers around the  world.     Now here is where you come in. Together, we have to choose which of four  planets the Hubble Space Telescope is going to observe next Spring. We  picked planets for several reasons: one, they are rather bright objects,  and that means that we can do some real science in only a couple of  orbits of the Hubble Space Telescope, and secondly because planets  usually have some rather interesting details on their surfaces or in  their atmospheres.    Here at Passport to Knowledge we have also enlisted the services of four  top research planetary astronomers, we'll call them our ""Planetary  advocates"", who are going to work with you at trying to figure out and  trying to determine which one of the four planets we are going to be  studying.     The Planet Advocates are seen: GUTSCH continues voice over:  In alphabetical order, our Planet Advocates are:     Dr. Reta Beebe, from New  Mexico State University, who will help us study the planet  Jupiter. For Pluto, Dr. Marc Buie, from the Lowell  observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. For the planet  Neptune, we have Dr. Heidi Hammel, from the Massachusetts Institute of  Technology... And for Uranus, Dr. Carolyn Porco from  the University of Arizona.  Our thanks to all of them for their commitment to this exciting project.  In  many ways, you students will be the co-investigators on this research  project with these scientists, and this program will show you how to  participate.        Now go to the schedule         Closing Underwriter announcement:   Live from the Hubble Space Telescope     is made possible in part  by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National  Science Foundation, PBS K-12 Learning Services and Public Television."
GX237-23-7189295	"National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Maryland 20771 http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov  June 1999 FS-1999-06-022-GSFC  The Ear th Observing System Terra Series These ar ticles focus on the overarching science priorities of the EOS Terra mission http://terra.nasa.gov  Aerosols What Are Aerosols? Aerosols are tiny liquid and solid par ticles suspended in the air. Most occur naturally, originating from volcanoes, dust storms, forest and grassland fires, living vegetation, and sea spray (Figure 1). Human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and the alteration of natural surface cover, also generate aerosols. Averaged over the globe, aerosols made by human activities currently account for about 10 percent of the total amount of aerosols in our atmosphere. Most of that 10 percent is concentrated in the Nor thern Hemisphere, especially downwind of industrial sites, slash-and-burn agricultural regions, and overgrazed grasslands. Scientists have much to learn about the way aerosols affect regional and global climate. We have yet to accurately quantify the relative impacts on climate of natural aerosols and those of human origin. Moreover, we do not know in what regions of the planet the amount of atmospheric aerosol is increasing, is diminishing, and is remaining roughly constant. Overall, we are even unsure whether aerosols are warming or cooling our planet.  Figure 1. Aerosol par ticles larger than about 1 micrometer in size are produced by windblown dust and sea salt from sea spray and bursting bubbles. Aerosols smaller than 1 micrometer are mostly formed by condensation processes such as conversion of sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas (released from volcanic eruptions) to sulfate particles and by formation of soot and smoke during burning processes. After formation, the aerosols are mixed and transported by atmospheric motions and are primarily removed by cloud and precipitation processes.    2  Why do we care about aerosols? Aerosols tend to cause cooling of the Ear th's surface immediately below them. Because most aerosols reflect sunlight back into space, they have a ""direct"" cooling effect by reducing the amount of solar radiation that reaches the surface. The magnitude of this cooling effect depends on the size and composition of the aerosol particles, as well as the reflective properties of the underlying surface. It is thought that aerosol cooling may par tially offset expected global warming that is attributed to increases in the amount of carbon dioxide from human activity. Aerosols are also believed to have an ""indirect"" effect on climate by changing the proper ties of clouds (Figures 2a and 2b). Indeed, if there were no aerosols in the atmosphere, clouds would be much less common. It is ver y difficult to for m cloud droplets without small aerosol particles acting as ""seeds"" to star t the formation of cloud droplets. According to theory, as aerosol concentration increases within a cloud, the water in the cloud gets spread over many more particles, each of which is correspondingly smaller. Smaller par ticles fall more slowly in the atmosphere and decrease the amount of rainfall. In this way, changing aerosols in the atmosphere can change the frequency of cloud occurrence, cloud thickness, and rainfall amounts. If there are more aerosols, scientists expect more cloud droplets to form. Since the total amount of condensed water in the cloud is not expected to change much, the average droplet must become smaller. This has two consequences--clouds with smaller droplets reflect more sunlight (as explained in Figure 2a & b), and such clouds last longer, because it takes more time for small droplets to coalesce into drops that are large enough to fall to the ground. Both effects increase the amount of sunlight that is reflected to space without reaching the surface. Aerosol particles may be solid or liquid; they range in size from 0.01 microns (or micrometers) to several tens of microns. For example, cigarette smoke particles are in the middle of this size range and typical cloud droplets are 10 or more microns in diameter. Under normal circumstances, the majority of aerosols form a thin haze in the lower atmosphere (troposphere), where they are washed out of the air  Figure 2a. The high aerosol concentrations in these clouds provide the nucleation points necessary for the formation of many small liquid water droplets. Up to 90% of visible radiation (light) is reflected back to space by such clouds without reaching Earth's surface.  Figure 2b. Clouds with low aerosol concentrations and a few large droplets do not scatter light well, and allow much of the Sun's light to pass through and reach the surface.   3  by rain within about a week. Aerosols are also found in a par t of the atmosphere just above the troposphere (called the ""stratosphere""). A severe volcanic eruption, such as Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991, can put large amounts of aerosol into the stratosphere. Since it does not rain in the stratosphere, these aerosols can remain there for many months, producing beautiful sunsets around the globe, and possibly causing summer temperatures to be cooler than normal. Scientists estimate that Mount Pinatubo injected about 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, cooling average global temperatures over the following year by about half a degree (Figure 3). During the last 30 years, scientist have identified several major aerosol types and they have developed general ideas about the amount of aerosol to be found in different seasons and locations. Still, key details about the amount and properties of aerosols are needed to calculate their current effect on surface temperatures; so far, it has not been possible to make these measurements on a global scale. New Measurement Capabilities Currently, satellite instruments provide our best hope of making, at a reasonable cost, continuous, global observations of aerosols to help scientists measure how these particles influence climate. Two instruments onboard NASA's Terra spacecraft will work together to measure atmospheric aerosols. The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument has nine separate cameras that will collect global imagery on the daylit side of the Ear th. These cameras will look at the Ear th in nine different directions and at four separate wavelengths. MISR will produce a multi-angle, multi-spectral data set unlike any ever before obtained by satellite instruments. The new information will make it possible to measure aerosol amount from space more accu-  rately than ever before, over ocean as well as over some land surfaces. The obser vations will also tell scientists something about par ticle size and composition. With MISR data, scientists will be able to distinguish air masses containing different aerosol types on a routine basis around the globe. Experimenters with instruments on the ground and in aircraft will work with the MISR team to characterize in more detail the particles in these air masses. MISR's global aerosol monitoring program will contribute to studies of the Ear th's energy balance, (see Earth's Energy Balance, NASA Facts FS1999-06-025-GSFC) and will provide inputs to computer models of regional and global trends in Ear th's climate. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) will study the atmosphere, land, and ocean in a wide range of ""colors""--spectral bands in the visible and infrared regions of the spectrum. The daily multi-  Figure 3. As volcanoes erupt, they blast huge clouds into the atmosphere. These clouds are made up of particles and gases, including sulfur dioxide (SO2). Millions of tons of sulfur dioxide gas from a major volcanic eruption can reach the stratosphere. There, with the help of water vapor (H2O), the sulfur dioxide conver ts to tiny persistent sulfuric acid (H2SO4) aerosols. These aerosols reflect energy coming from the sun, thereby preventing the sun's rays from heating the Ear th's surface. Volcanic eruptions are thought to be responsible for the global cooling that has been observed for a few years after a major eruption. The amount and global extent of the cooling depend on the force of the eruption and, possibly on its location relative to prevailing wind patterns.    4  spectral measurements from MODIS will be used to measure global aerosol amounts, and to distinguish between relatively large deser t dust par ticles and small par ticles in smoke and industrial/urban pollution. The instrument contains an alarm that will aler t scientists when a volcano erupts, enabling them to observe and measure the volcanic plume. MODIS will also provide information about the distribution and characteristics of forest fires and help scientists estimate emissions (e.g., gases and smoke particles) from burning biomass. Moreover, MODIS will measure the proper ties of clouds--such as droplet size--and will determine how aerosols may impact clouds' abilities to reflect sunlight back into space. Detailed measurements of aerosol properties from 100 ground-based automated instruments distributed around the world will complement the aerosol data obtained by MISR and MODIS. This network of robotic aerosol obser ving stations, called AERONET, looks upward from the ground, providing information about aerosol amount, par ticle proper ties, and their effect on solar radiation. Each AERONET station contains a computer that operates the instrument automatically, collects and organizes the data, and sends the results via satellite to NASA. Using MISR, MODIS, and AERONET data, along with field and aircraft measurements by teams of scientists from many countries, researchers will determine with greater accuracy than ever before the role aerosols play in reflecting and absorbing sunlight, and the  indirect effect aerosols have on the proper ties of clouds. The Terra Spacecraft Terra is the flagship of the Earth Obser ving System (EOS), a series of spacecraft to observe the Earth from the unique vantage point of space. Focused on key measurements identified by a consensus of U.S. and international scientists, EOS will enable research on the complex interactions of Ear th's land, ocean, air, ice and life systems. Terra will circle the Ear th in an orbit that descends perpendicularly across the equator each day at 10:30 a.m. local time, when cloud cover is at a minimum and the space-based view of the surface is least obstructed. Each individual swath of measurements can be compiled into global images as frequently as every two days. Over a month or more, in combination with measurements from other polar orbiting satellites, Terra measurements will provide accurate monthly-mean climate assessments that can be compared with computer model simulations and predictions. The Earth Observing System has three major components: the EOS spacecraft, an advanced ground-based computer network for processing, storing, and distributing the resulting data (the EOS Data and Information System); and teams of scientists and applications specialists who will study the data and help users in industr y, universities and the public apply it to issues ranging from agriculture to urban planning.

Pinatubo                   volcano on June 15, 1991, was the largest volcanic eruption                   the world had seen in nearly a century. In addition to the                   widespread destruction that the volcano wrought on the                   Philippine island of Luzon, Mt. Pinatubo's impact was felt                   around the world. Global average temperatures cooled for more                   than a year after the eruption due to the massive injection of                   dust and gases into the upper atmosphere.                     With the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption, the                   global effects of volcanoes on climate were captured in detail                   for the first time by a suite of Earth-observing satellites.                   The following scientists who were involved in many of these                   trailblazing studies are available for interviews:                                                                   A Temporary Global Cooling.  Global warming was halted - at least temporarily - by the aerosol cloud from the eruption, which lowered global average temperatures by 0.5 degrees Celsius (about 1 degree Fahrenheit) through 1992.                      NASA                     climate modelers precisely predicted this volcano-induced                     cooling – a powerful demonstration of the capability of                     these computer simulations.

Pinatubo                     pumped so much volcanic ash and gas into the upper reaches                     of the atmosphere that the normal levels of stratospheric                     aerosols increased by more than 20 times, leading to a                     short-lived global cooling.

The                     protective ozone layer in the upper atmosphere weakened for                     more than a year as the result of gases injected into the                     stratosphere by the eruption.

The                     eruption also caused changes in regional weather patterns.                     Climate models showed that Pinatubo produced a shift in wind                     patterns in the North Atlantic that lead to a                     warmer-than-usual winter in Europe in 1991-92.

The millions of tons of ash and rock that blanketed the                     flanks of Mt. Pinatubo created dangerous rivers of mud                     during the annual rainy season. Scientists are keeping an                     eye on this shifting natural hazard with airborne and space                     sensors.

As satellites tracked volcanic aerosols moving                     around the globe, researchers saw movements through the                     troposphere into the stratosphere for the first time.

GX003-78-7704458	"Science@NASA     Home              Hubble Opens for Business        Following the successful Space Shuttle     servicing mission last December, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope     is working better than ever.                            January 24, 2000  -- NASA announced     today that the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is back in business     and working better than ever. To show off the capabilities of     the newly refurbished telescope, the Space Telescope Science     Institute released two new pictures of remote galaxies and a     colorful dying star.         The images were taken January 10 - 13, 2000, to recommission     the HST following the recent shuttle servicing mission. In December,     1999, astronauts refitted Hubble with improved electronics, a     new computer, and critically needed replacement gyroscopes.          Above:  In its first glimpse of the     heavens following the successful December 1999 servicing mission,     NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured this spectacular view     of planetary nebula NGC 2392.                                                                                            Sign up for             our EXPRESS SCIENCE NEWS delivery                                     ""After a two-month hiatus, it is a tremendous boost     to all of astronomy to see Hubble back in action,"" said     Steven Beckwith, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute,     the Hubble science operations center in Baltimore, MD. ""NASA     has restored the observatory to a condition that was better than     it was even before the fourth gyroscope failed,""         Astronomers resumed operations this month by aiming the telescope     at two scientifically intriguing and photogenic celestial targets.     One object is an intricate structure of shells and streamers     of gas around a dying sun-like star 5,000 light-years away.                                                                                            Send this page to a friend!                                      Designated NGC 2392, it is dubbed the ""Eskimo Nebula""     because, as seen through ground-based telescopes, it resembles     a face inside a furry parka. In Hubble's sharp view, the ""furry""     features resemble giant comets all pointing away from the central     star, like the spokes of a wheel. ""The clumps that form     the comet heads all seem to be located at a similar distance     from the star. This fact will be important in developing a theory     of why the clumps formed in the first place,"" said planetary     nebula expert J. Patrick Harrington of the University of Maryland,     College Park, MD. He adds, ""Of all the planetary nebulae     imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope, this new image is unsurpassed     in subtle beauty.""         A second target is a massive cluster of galaxies called Abell     2218. The cluster is so massive that its enormous gravitational     field deflects light rays passing through it, much as an optical     lens bends light to form an image. This phenomenon, called gravitational     lensing, magnifies, brightens, and distorts images from faraway     objects. The cluster's magnifying powers provides a powerful     ""zoom lens"" for viewing distant galaxies that could     not normally be observed with the largest telescopes.                            Above:  Hubble Space Telescope image     of Abell 2218. This massive cluster of galaxies resides in the     constellation Draco, some 2 billion light-years from Earth. The     arcs are images of very distant galaxies far behind the cluster     that have been distorted by the effect of gravitational lensing.             This useful phenomenon has produced the arc-shaped patterns found     throughout the Hubble picture. These ""arcs"" are the     distorted images of very distant galaxies and quasars, which     lie 5 to 10 times farther than the lensing cluster. This distant     population existed when the universe was just a quarter of its     present age. Through gravitational lensing these remote objects     are magnified, enabling scientists to study them in more detail.          Below : The original black and white     HST image of Abell 2218, captured in 1994.          The     Hubble telescope first viewed this cluster in 1994, producing     one of the most spectacular demonstrations of gravitational lensing     up to that time. Scientists who analyzed that black-and-white     picture discovered more than 50 remote, young galaxies. Hubble's     latest multicolor image of the cluster will allow astronomers     to probe in greater detail the internal structure of these early     galaxies. The color picture already reveals several arc-shaped     features that are embedded in the cluster and cannot be easily     seen in the black-and-white image.         The colors in this picture yield clues to the ages, distances,     and temperatures of stars, the stuff of galaxies. Blue pinpoints     hot young stars. The yellow-white color of several of the galaxies     represents the combined light of many stars. Red identifies cool     stars, old stars, and the glow of stars in distant galaxies.     This view is only possible by combining Hubble's unique image     quality with the rare lensing effect provided by the magnifying     cluster.         ""For the first time we can view the internal color structure     of some very distant galaxies. This gives us new insight into     details of what young galaxies are like,"" says Richard Ellis     at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, and University     of Cambridge, England and a co-investigator on an earlier (black-     and-white) Hubble image of Abell 2218 taken in 1994. ""The     color of a distant source is preserved by gravitational lensing.     By matching images of the same color, families of multiple images     produced by the lensing process can be identified.""         Spacecraft operators report that all the new equipment installed     on the telescope in December is working perfectly, including     the new computer, solid state recorder, and fine guidance sensor.     In particular the new gyroscopes are allowing Hubble to reliably     point with exquisite precision at celestial objects.          The Space Telescope Science Institute is operated by the Association     of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. for NASA, under     contract with NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt,     MD. The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international     cooperation between NASA and the European Space Agency.

Servicing Mission 3B is actually the fourth visit to Hubble. NASA                  split the original Servicing Mission 3 into two parts and conducted                  3A in December of 1999.                  How long will the mission take? What is the                  timetable?                  The crew of Space Shuttle Columbia will conduct Servicing Mission                  3B in early 2002 and perform five spacewalks over an 11-day mission.                   Click here for the mission                  timeline.                                 Why do we have to service?                  As new technology becomes available, space-walking astronauts                  fit the telescope with the latest, high performance equipment.                  They also replace components that would otherwise wear out and                  limit Hubble's life. Each time astronauts visit the Hubble Space                  Telescope, they leave it newer and better than they found it.                                 What is the biggest improvement/change?                  The biggest improvement will be the installation of the Advanced                  Camera for Surverys (ACS) - it will effectively increase Hubble's                  discovery efficiency by 10 times. Hubble will also receive a new                  look with its smaller, rigid solar arrays.                 How noticeable will the improvements be?                  By being able to collect data 10x faster with ACS, conceivably,                  10x the amount of discoveries can be made. In terms of image quality,                  it is akin to upgrading a digital camera. A difference will be                  noticable, but a person may have to know what to look for. Also,                  images taken with by ACS will not have the ""missing""                  corner squares typical of the ones taken by Wide Field Planetary                  Camera 2.                                 How do astronauts get close to Hubble to work                  on it?                  Astronauts fly up to Hubble in a space shuttle, grapple it, and                  pull it in so it stands within the shuttle's open bay. They then                  leave the shuttle in their space suits during Extra Vehicular                  Activities (EVA) - or spacewalks - to work on Hubble up close.                                 How many astronauts are on the mission? -                  what are their jobs?                  There are 7 astronauts on the mission - A mission commander, pilot,                  payload commander/mission specialist, and 4 more additional mission                  specialists.  Click                  here to find out more about the crew.                 How are the astronauts trained?                  Not including their extensive backgrounds in science, the airforce,                  the space program, etc... the crew are trained in the Neutral                  Buoyancy Lab at Johnson Space Center in Houston, where zero-gravity                  conditions are simulated underwater. They also get hands-on training                  with the actual Hubble parts and instruments that they will install,                  at Goddard Space Flight Center in MD.                 How many servicing missions remain? When is                  the next?                  One more after SM3B. On SM4 in 2004, we will be installing the                  Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS), the most sensitive ultraviolet                  spectrograph ever flown on Hubble, and the Wide Field Camera 3                  (WFC3), the first truly panchromatic camera (sensitive to a wide                  range of colors) on Hubble.                                                                                                                                                                                  General Questions about Hubble...                                                                                                                 When is the end of Hubble's mission?                  The current plan is to operate Hubble until 2010. We anticipate                  a mission to Hubble will be required in 2010 either to return                  it to the ground, or to raise it to a higher orbit (possibly with                  the aid of an attached booster) where it cannot fall back to Earth.                 Where can I find images taken by Hubble?                  The archive of Hubble images is maintained by the  Space                  Telescope Science Institute.                 What Does Hubble weigh and how big is it?                  Hubble weighs about 11000 kg (24000 lbs) on Earth. More exactly,                  it weighs 11065 kg (24395 lbs) pre-SM3B, and will weigh 11864                  kg (26155 lbs) post-SM3B. It is about the size of a big tractor-trailer                  truck. To be more precise: The length is 13.2 meters (43.5 ft.)                  and the maximum diatemer is 4.2 meters (14 ft.)                 You can compare this to a car, which weighs around one or two                  tons (or roughly 1000 to 2000 kg). Thus, Hubble weighs as much                  as 6 to 12 cars (depending on their size). It is not phenomenally                  heavy. To get really heavy stuff, look at big aircraft carriers                  and monster skyscrapers!                 How fast does Hubble travel?                  At its current altitude, Hubble orbits the earth about every 96                  minutes, with a speed of approximately 17,000 mi/hr or 27,200                  km/hr.                 How high up is Hubble?                  The Hubble Space Telescope is a low earth orbiting (LEO) satellite.                  It is located about 320 nautical miles (360 statute miles, 600                  km) above the surface of the earth.                 How can I see Hubble pass over my area?

The Announcement of Opportunity for The Hubble Space Telescope,                  dated March 1977, cites that the main scientific objectives for                  Hubble are to determine:                 A. The constitution, physical characteristics, and dynamics of                  celestial bodies.                 B. The nature of processes which occur in the extreme physical                  conditions existing in and between astronomical objects.                 C. The history and evolution of the universe.                 D. Whether the laws of nature are universal in the space-time                  continuum.                 Who was Edwin Hubble?                    Hubble, Edwin Powell 1889-1953, American astronomer, was born                  in Marshfield, Mo. As a staff member (from 1919) at Mt. Wilson                  Observatory, Hubble used the 100-in. (254-cm) telescope there                  to discover that there are large-scale galaxies beyond the Milky                  Way and that they are distributed almost uniformly in all directions.                 In what is now known as Hubble's Law, he was the first to offer                  observational evidence supporting the theory of the expanding                  universe.                 What is Hubble's Law?                  Hubble's law is a statement that the greater the distance between                  any two galaxies, the greater is their relative speed of separation.                  In other words, the universe is expanding roughly uniformly. This                  empirical finding is more consistent with the Big Bang theory                  of the universe's origin than with the steady state theory.                 The law was first proposed in 1929 by Edwin Hubble, who observed                  that the more distant a galaxy, the greater its redshift, and                  hence its velocity relative to our Galaxy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Glossary                 |  FAQ  |  Links                                                Talk to Us!                                                                                                                                  :::::: Contact:  webmaster@sm3b.gsfc.nasa.gov           | Global Science & Technology, Inc. ::::::                                       |          Page Last Updated:  February  1, 2002 |"
GX004-15-10887663	Hubble Space Telescope First Servicing Mission    On the front:  Astronaut F. Story Musgrave, anchored on the end of the  Remote Manipulator System (RMS) arm on the Space Shuttle Endeavour, prepares to  be elevated to the top of the towering Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to install covers  on magnetometers. Astronaut Jeffrey A. Hoffman, at bottom, teamed up with Musgrave  to perform final servicing tasks on the telescope.   The nearly flawless 11-day mission to service Hubble included a record-breaking five  spacewalks in which astronauts performed a number of tasks designed to improve the  telescope and extend its life.    COSTAR   To compensate for HST's blurred vision, astronauts installed a phone booth-size  device called the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR).  Using 10 corrective mirrors ranging in size from a dime to a quarter, COSTAR  improved the quality of data from three instruments: the European Space Agency  (ESA) Faint Object Camera (FOC), the Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS) and the  Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS).    WIDE FIELD/PLANETARY CAMERA II   Astronauts also installed a second-generation camera known as the Wide  Field/Planetary II Camera. This camera, already under construction when Hubble was  launched on April 24, 1990, included its own corrective optics as well as a number  of technological improvements. It replaced the original Wide Field/Planetary Camera I.    OTHER ENHANCEMENTS   Also replaced were ESA's two solar arrays, which gather sunlight to power Hubble; a  Solar Array Drive Electronics (SADE) unit, which transmits commands to the array  wings; two magnetometers, which measure the spacecraft's relative orientation to Earth's magnetic field; two gyroscope packages, which help point HST and track  targets; a kit to improve the reliability of the Goddard High Resolution Spectograph; a  386 co-processor to augment the telescope's onboard DF-224 computer; and fuse  plugs for the gyros and science instruments.    The STS-61 HST First Servicing Mission was carried out from the Endeavour following  its flight into space December 2, 1993, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.  Endeavour returned to Earth on December 13, 1993. The seven-member crew  included Richard O. Covey, commander; Kenneth D. Bowersox, pilot; Musgrave,  payload commander; Hoffman, mission specialist; ESA's Claude Nicollier, the  mission specialist who operated the RMS arm; and Tom Akers and Kathryn C.  Thornton, mission specialists who formed the second spacewalking team.   Hubble is managed by Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., for the  Office of Space Science at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.

GX004-65-16017244	HST MISSION STATEMENT       HST is one of NASA's Great Observatories. It was launched aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery on April 24, 1990 and deployed into a low Earth orbit (331.5 nautical miles; 614 kilometers altitude). The HST's mirror is 2.4 meters in diameter with optics supporting astronomical observations in the vacuum of space: ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared (wavelengths from 1150 Angstroms to 2.5 microns). It has a planned 20-year science mission and will be periodically serviced in-orbit by Space Shuttle crews. HST was launched with the following science instruments on-board:  the Faint Object Camera (FOC), the Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS), the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS), the High Speed Photometer (HSP), and the WideField/Planetary Camera 1 (WFPC1). The HST's Fine Guidance Sensors (FGSs) also support astrometric science. The HSP was removed during the first servicing mission in December, 1993 and the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) and the Wide Field/Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) were installed. During the second servicing mission in February, 1997, astronauts replaced the FOS and GHRS with an advanced Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS). During Servicing Mission 3A, in December 1999, astronauts replaced failing gyros, installed a new computer, upgraded other telescope subsystems and perform(ed) scheduled preventative maintenance.  Servicing Mission 3B, in March 2002, included the addition of: the Advanced Camera for Surveys -- Hubble's latest in a series of science instruments; smaller, more rigid solar arrays; a new power control unit; and an experimental cooling system to restore science to the dormant NICMOS.     The HST is a joint endeavor of NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), which provided the FOC and the HST's solar arrays. The HST is designated by NASA as a general observer facility. It has a worldwide user community.    GSFC is responsible for HST project management, including mission and science operations, servicing missions, and all associated development activities. HST management and direction is provided by two project offices which report to the HST Program Office.    The  Space Telescope Science Institute [STScI] , in Baltimore, Maryland, is managed by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) and operated under contract to GSFC. The STScI conducts the HST science operation, and supports observers obtaining new data or using archived HST data.        HOME  |  MISSION STATEMENT  |  PROJECTS  |  HST OBSERVATORY  |  MANAGEMENT

It will replace the (mechanical) Engineering Science                  Tape Recorder and provide more than a ten-fold increase in data                  storage capacity for the observatory.                                   Another SSR has already been installed in HST during SM2. This                  unit shows unexpected behavior from ionizing particles, but internal                  error checking and recovery maintains normal operation. The goal                  for HOST has been to test the second unit to ensure that the observed                  behavior is generic to the design, and that there are no hidden                  faults in the unit already on HST.

GX004-88-2702077	Hubble Facts  National Aeronautics and Space Administration  FS-96(12)-025-GSFC     Hubble Space Telescope Second Servicing Mission (SM-2)      Hubble's Next Challenge     Discovery is set to lift off from the Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral, Fla. in early 1997 on a ten-day mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Mission STS-82 marks the second servicing mission of Hubble since the telescope was deployed in April 1990.      Hubble has revolutionized astronomers' vision of the universe more than any prior telescopes. Many new details about planets, stars, and galaxies have been revealed in the short span of six years:  Hubble provided us with dramatic and detailed views of comet fragments smashing into Jupiter;  we now have more clues about the existence of black holes in the core of galaxies;  and thanks to Hubble, significant progress has been made in determining the age and size of the universe.    Now, with astronauts geared to embark on another mission to service the telescope, we can expect to see even deeper into our universe.  Astronauts will install two new astronomy instruments and replace other hardware. This servicing will render the telescope more scientifically powerful than ever.    Mission Success Criteria     The objectives of the second Hubble servicing mission are to improve Hubble's productivity: to extend HST's wavelength range into the near infrared for imaging and spectroscopy, to greatly increase the efficiency of spectrographic science and to replace failed or degraded spacecraft components.   The payload complement for the mission includes three categories of items: 1. Science Instruments to enhance science productivity, 2. Primary spacecraft maintenace items and 3. Secondary spacecraft maintenance items.    New Science Instruments     The Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) provides unique and powerful spectroscopic capabilities for the HST. A spectrograph separates the light gathered by the telescope into its spectral components so that the composition, temperature, motion, and other chemical and physical properties can be analyzed.    STIS's two-dimensional detectors allow the instrument to gather 30 times more spectral data and 500 times more spatial data than existing spectrographs on Hubble which look at one place at a time. One of the greatest advantages to using STIS is in the study of supermassive black holes.    STIS will search for massive black holes by studying the star and gas dynamics around galactic centers. It will measure the distribution of matter in the universe by studying quasar absorption lines, use its high sensitivity and spatial resolution to study star formation in distant galaxies and perform spectroscopic mapping of solar system objects.   The Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) promises to gain valuable new information on the dusty centers of galaxies and the formation of stars and planets. NICMOS consists of three cameras. It will provide the capability for infrared imaging and spectroscopic observations of astronomical targets.    NICMOS will give astronomers their first clear view of the universe at near-infrared wavelengths between 0.8 and 2.5 micrometers-longer wavelengths than the human eye can see. The expansion of the universe shifts the light from very distant objects toward longer red and infrared wavelengths.    NICMOS's near infrared capabilities will provide views of objects too distant for research by current Hubble optical and ultraviolet instruments. NICMOS's detectors perform more efficiently than previous infrared detectors.      Primary Spacecraft Hardware     In addition to installing the new science instruments, astronauts will replace existing hardware with upgrades. Hubble will get a refurbished Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS), an optical sensor that is used on HST to provide pointing information for the spacecraft and as a scientific instrument for astrometric science. The modification to this FGS spare will add the capability for ground-controlled alignment corrections.    The addition of the Optical  Contol Electronics Enhancement Kit (OCE-EK) will provide the electronic pathway for commanding the alignment mechanisms.  The Solid State Recorder (SSR) will replace one of HST's three Engineering Science Tape Recorders (ESTR). The SSR provides much more flex ibility than an ESTR, which is a reel-to-reel recorder and can store ten times more data. One of the other ESTRs will also be replaced but with with a spare ESTR unit. Future missions may see all the reel-to-reel units replaced with solid state recorders.     One of Hubble's four Reaction Wheel Assemblies (RWA) will be replaced by a refurbished spare. The RWA is part of Hubble's Pointing Control System. Spin momentum in the wheels moves the telescope to a target and maintains it in a stable position.    Secondary Spacecraft Hardware     Four Data Interface Units (DIU) on HST provide command and data interfaces between the spacecraft's data management system and the other HST subsystems.  DIU-2 will be replaced with a spare unit that has been modified and upgraded to correct for failures that occured in the original unit.     The Solar Array Drive Electronics (SADE) controls the positioning of the solar arrays. HST has two SADEs, one unit was replaced during the first servicing mission. The unit that was returned from orbit has been refurbished to correct for problems that resulted in transistor failures and will be used to replace the second unit, SADE-2. The SADEs are provided by the European Space Agency, NASA's partner in the Hubble program.    Work on the  Magnetic Sensing System (MSS) on Hubble during the first servicing mission required the astronaut crew to construct protective covers for the hardware using materials that were available on the Shuttle.  Some of this material is degrading in the space environment and will require the installation of more durable covers during the second servicing mission.   The crew will take more than 150 other crew aids and tools on this mission.  They range from a simple bag for carrying some of the smaller tools to sophisticated, battery-operated power tools.    The HST was designed to allow new instruments to be easily installed as old ones become obsolete. Components will be changed out by astronauts conducting EVAs (extravehicular activity) or  spacewalks.     Doing the Job     A seven-member crew has been selected for this mission. Four astronauts will conduct the planned spacewalks:  Mark  Lee, Gregory Harbaugh, Steven Smith and Joseph Tanner are part of the extravehicular activity crew. Kenneth Bowersox is the commander, Scott Horowitz is the pilot, and Steven Hawley is the Remote Manipulator System Operator.    The EVA crew will make at least four spacewalks. Training for this mission began nearly two years prior to launch. Astronauts train extensively at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas in its 25-foot deep Weightless Environment Training Facility; at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., in a 40-foot deep Neutral Buoyancy Simulator; and at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., in a 12,500 square-foot cleanroom.     A Glance at the Past     The HST is a joint project between NASA and the European Space Agency. There were great expectations for HST after is was launched in 1990. Because it did not have the distorting effects of Earth's atmosphere, it was expected to easily surpass the capabilities of ground-based telescopes. However, two months after the HST was released into orbit, engineers discovered that the telescope's 2.4-meter (94 inch) main mirror was flawed.  The mirror was too flat near the edge by about 1/50th the width of a human hair. Instead of light being focused to a sharp point, light collected by the mirror spread into a fuzzy halo. Computer processing was used to sharpen the images.   To realize its full potential the telescope had to be repaired. The mirror itself couldn't be fixed or changed; so NASA had to develop corrective optics for HST's instruments, much like eye-   glasses used to correct human sight. A new camera, called the Wide Field & Planetary Camera-2, had its corrective optics built right in. To correct the telescope's other instruments, engineers devised a special instrument, called the COSTAR (Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement) that would use mechanical arms to place pairs of small mirrors in front of the openings of the telescope's remaining three instruments. Each pair of mirrors was shaped to properly refocus light from the flawed main mirror.    That first servicing mission, on Dec. 2, 1993, was the most difficult and challenging spacecraft repair mission ever attempted. It was an eleven-day mission that included a record five EVAs.     Technological Advances     Besides rapidly advancing our understanding of the universe, the HST is making direct contributions to the health, safety, and quality of our lives through a variety of technological spinoffs.    A new, non-surgical breast biopsy technique using a device originally developed for HST's Imaging Spectrograph (STIS), is now saving women pain, scarring, radiation exposure, time and money. This technique, called stereotactic automated large-core needle biopsy, enables a doctor to precisely locate a suspicious lump and use a needle instead of a scalpel to remove tissue for study. This precise process is possible because of a key improvement in digital imaging technology known as a Charge Coupled Device or CCD.     Looking Toward the Future     The HST was designed to operate for 15 years. But like many of NASA's other observatories that have exceeded their projected operating years, HST will likely deliver new science for a long time. As long as the HST continues to rewrite astronomy text books, and as long as funds are available, NASA will likely continue to operate the telescope. So far, two more reservicing missions are planned for 1999 and 2002 to keep the telescope functioning efficiently and to improve its scientific capability.

GX071-54-13429040	"A NASA Hubble Space Telescope image of a spiral-shaped disk of hot gas in the core of active galaxy M87. Hubble measurements show the disk is rotating so rapidly it contains a massive black hole at its hub.  Source: NASA     BRINGING THE UNIVERSE INTO FOCUS   The razor-sharp images from the repaired Hubble Space Telescope bring the incredible splendor of distant heavenly objects into human view for the first time.  Recently, for example, scientists used the Hubble to gather evidence that a massive black hole really exists at the center of a neighboring galaxy.  Confronting--and even solving--some of the deepest mysteries of the universe may have no seemingly practical payoff, but it nonetheless appeals to the deep-seated human desire for knowledge of how we fit into the cosmos.  Story Musgrave, the payload commander for the recent Hubble servicing mission, put it this way: ""I have thought of that instrument as contributing to my personal ideas about what my place in the universe is, what it is to be human.""        The Hubble telescope revealed a pancake-shaped disk of hot gas at the center of the giant M87 galaxy.  So sharp was the image that astronomers could see by the pattern of movement that the spinning disk of gas was being sucked down into and swallowed by something at the center.  Measurements with the telescope determined the speed of the gas--an incredible 1.2 million miles per hour-- allowing astronomers to calculate the mass of the central object.  It is equal to 2 to 3 billion suns, so massive for its size that it could only be a black hole--a collapsed condition of matter whose gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape. Black holes are predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity and have been suspected on the basis of other astronomical evidence, but they are such a strange and novel phenomenon that some scientists have remained skeptical.  Now the new Hubble observations have provided proof--""the smoking gun"", as one astronomer put it.        In addition to such dramatic discoveries, the Hubble is also being used to study the size and age of the universe, the evolution of galaxies from minute fluctuations in the early cosmos, and the details of star birth and star death.  There are still plenty of mysteries to unravel about the vastness of space surrounding our planetary home--mysteries that are now in better focus.        The refurbished Hubble Space Telescope is a triumph of technology and human ingenuity, captured in the public mind by the sight of NASA's astronauts unfurling Hubble's new solar panels in space, against the distant backdrop of our home planet.  The Hubble servicing mission demonstrated what can happen when scientists and engineers join together to solve a difficult problem.  The flawed mirror was discovered soon after Hubble's 1990 launch.  A team immediately gathered to examine dozens of possible ""fixes"".  The resulting corrective device, an optical jukebox called COSTAR, was devised and built in only 26 months.  Combined with the remarkable ability of the astronauts who installed it and otherwise upgraded the space telescope, the result placed innovative technology in the service of humanity's vision and age-old quest for knowledge about our environment and our place in it."
