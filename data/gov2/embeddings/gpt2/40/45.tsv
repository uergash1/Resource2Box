I recommend it, especially to health  educators, health practitioners and ESOL teachers interested in issues of  cultural conflict as they affect the health and well-being of students,  patients, and neighbors.  I wonder if educators, researchers and health practitioners on this list have read the book and what they think of it, what they think might be useful to a discussion of adult education from a health perspective and from a teaching perspective.   To  get the ball rolling, in a chapter at the end of the book called ""The Eight Questions,"" Fadiman  refers to a set of eight questions developed by  a psychiatrist and cultural anthropologist named Arthur Kleinman who  chairs the department of social medicine at Harvard Medical School.  She  thinks the questions are deceptively simple, a ""work of genius.""  Fadiman says  they are designed to get at a patient's ""explanatory model,"" to learn, from patients' cultural perspectives, how _they_ understand what their health or medical problem is. The idea is that with this understanding a  health practitioner (for example, an M.D.) might negotiate a cultural compromise, a treatment which a patient would understand and actively  carry out, one which makes sense to the patient and which does not violate  her or his cultural beliefs.  Failure to negotiate -- as this book reveals -- could result in ""patient noncompliance"" (from a medical perspective) in taking medicine or performing other essential steps of a treatment, or alternatively the violation of a person's deeply held religious/cultural  beliefs (as one chapter puts this conflict ""The Life or the Soul"") and even  the patient's death.  I like the idea of negotiation, that medical (and adult education) practitioners need to try to meet patients/students who have very different cultural belief systems half way.  Immigrants need to understand  Western medical ways of thinking, (and other American cultural systems) but as Fadiman argues, health practitioners (and educators) need to understand students' cultural belief systems, and actively look for (and write about) ways to negotiate respectful and effective solutions to health problems where there is a conflict in belief systems.  Here are Kleinman's eight questions to be asked of the patient or the patient's family (Fadiman P. 260):  1. What do you call the problem? 2. What do you think has caused the problem 3. Why do you think it started when it did? 4. What do you think the sickness does? How does it work? 5. How severe is the sickness?  Will it have a short or long course? 6. What kind of treatment do you think the patient should receive? What    are the most important results you hope to receive from the treatment? 7. What are the chief problems the sickness has caused? 8. What do you fear most about the sickness?""  Finally, what does this have to do with adult literacy?  In many states -- mine is one -- a majority of students in the adult basic education (and ESOL) system are immigrants. Many come from cultures, such as the Hmong, which understand the world in ways which are critically different from what is taught in American schools.  Many of the issues for the Hmong family described in Fadiman's book are the same for our students. If we ignore this, how can we be successful and humane?  I would be interested in your thoughts about this book.  David J.

But during the past few weeks, mass advertising   (""spam"") seemed to reach epidemic proportions in many parts of Texas.    In fact, several Internet providers report their operations have been   crippled by huge volumes of spam thrown onto their servers, often with   fraudulent headers and unauthorized remailing.  These unethical (and   sometimes illegal) practices increase costs, jeopardize service quality,   and for smaller ISPs, threaten the Internet service provider's survival.    Even healthy companies feel the strain when assaulted by spam remailers.   Turning Point Information Systems, a mid-size central Texas ISP, has   been deluged with more than 100,000 spam posts a day, without permission   through their servers.  Bounces from these add another 20 - 30K messages   to their daily traffic, with predictable impact on system operations.   Angry customers and extra costs have given Turning Point a sudden and   painful lesson in the price of emailer's advertising greed.    Two individual victims of spam fraud are Texans Tracey LaQuey Parker   and Patrick Parker, whose innocuous domain (""flowers.com"") was forged in   a spam message across the Internet.  The Parker, authors of some of the   country's most respected Internet publications, awoke to find more than   6,000 complaints clogging their email and shutting down their service.    SO WHAT TO DO   Turning Point, the Parkers, and the Texas ISP Association are pursuing   legal recourse against illegal spam practices, aided by attorney Pete   Kennedy, who won the famed Steve Jackson case against the Secret Service.   (The focus of any legal action here would be genuine fraud, rather than   attempt to restrict merely annoying, but Constitutional, free e-speech.)    But ""Internet Law"" is young, and rapidly evolving.  Specific anti-spam   bills are just now being proposed.  One state bill is Nevada Senate Bill   Number 13, prefiled 1/14/97 by Senator Raggio.  This proposed law (BDR   15-723) ""prohibits sending certain unsolicited electronic mail under   certain circumstances"" - especially w/no prior commercial relationship.    And Monday (5/12/97) a ""Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-mail""   (CAUCE) proposed amending the federal ""junk fax law"" (within 47 USC 227)   to include explicit email protection and penalties for abuse.   < http://www.cauce.org >    Besieged spam victims and their Internet providers aren't waiting for   laws and lawsuits to eventually, maybe, someday cure their daily blight   of unwelcome email messages.  They are working on technological methods   to reduce or eliminate unsolicited mail without unduly restricting posts   from legitimate correspondents.  It's not an easy task.    Part of the problem lies with the spammer's ruthless determination.   True, many of their posts are headed by a disingenuous disclaimer that   recipients ""will receive only this one message"" unless they want more   from that sender or ""may remove their names"" from the lists.  In many   cases however this promise is as false as the name listed as the sender;   False or misleading email is quickly becoming an Internet art form. (One   clue is when action request is other than simple ""Reply to"" the sender.)    Defenses employed range from micro-filtering offending domain names   (which the abusers predictably change constantly) to blocking entire   feeds from the Internet.  One ISP reports they had to block both AGIS   (a bandwidth provider frequently used by abusers) and even Compuserve   (itself victimized by unsolicited and unwelcome advertising remailers.)     ANTI-SPAMARAMA   Efforts to fight spam are arising across the Internet.  In our state,   the Texas ISP Association has launched an active Anti-Spam commitment,   combining legal, legislative and technical responses to a problem which   is beginning to diminish the joy and value of Internet communication.   For information:  Jim Koen <jkoen@xxxxxxxxxx> Graham Toal <spam@xxxxxx>    A international effort, also centered in Texas, is being discussed in a   Dallas meeting Wednesday, 5/14/97.  Representatives of major national   players (AT&T, MCI, Sprint, AOL, Compuserve, IBM, Microsoft, etc) plus   Internet trade associations and public interest groups are being invited   by Experian (TRW's descendant company) to consider their proposal for an   Internet-wide ""E-Mail Directory and Anti-Spam File.""

There are some sensational things happening - many of which are relevant to  MatML. Some brief thoughts:  - Frank Olken gave a splendid talk on units which was very well received by  lots of folks. Frank - and JohnMcC - certainly have the moral go-ahead to  develop this on behalf of the XML community. [It isn't formally part of XML  Schemas, but I think it would be welcomed].  - The Schema activity reported. [Schemas are the ""expanded DTDs in XML  format"".] They are very powerful but IMO non-trivial. They are being very  strongly pushed by the e-commerce people. I think MatML should adopt  Schemas but use a subset in the first instance - datatypes, constraints  (min/max, etc.). There is also an activity by Makoto Murata (an original  member of the XML WG) who has developed an approach for managing schemas  more simply,  called RELAX. Interestingly this is slated for adoption as a  Japanese standard (JIS), *next week*! I am amazed at the speed of this.  Makoto will make OpenSource software available for this and some of the  folks who want a ""simple"" approach to XML will use this. Worth looking at.  - SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is sensational. I have also discovered  that *roundtripping* is possible with SVG. This means that you can go round  the circle MatML->SVG->MatML and not lose any information. IMO this means  that graphs must be a central part of the MatML activity. [Of course, I  don't know anything about materials science :-), but I feel confident about  this.] For example you can attach full semantic information to lines,  areas, points, etc. A phase diagram could carry full information about each  phase, triple points, etc. *within the graph*.  - The browser-is-the-computer movement is very strong and Mozilla showed  their latest approach to building GUIs on the fly (XUL). This means that  you can customise materials catalogs on the browser (e.g. mix text, number,  graphics, etc). Also IBM Weblets look very exciting in this area.   P.

Competing applications are being  accepted for funding to stimulate research and support a wide range of studies and analyses of varied aspects of welfare program changes at the national,  state and local levels.  This research will address the effects of welfare reform  changes on families and children; the experiences of states and localities  involved in implementing changes; or the experiences, responses, and impacts on other entities or programs involved in implementing changes.  Organizations eligible to apply for this Federal funding include public entities; private-for-profit organizations (if fee is waived); and public  or private nonprofit organizations, including universities.  Federal funding under this announcement is intended to support research analysis and evaluation exclusively, not program operation or service provision.  Projects funded under this announcement are intended to complement other  aspects of the ACF research strategy for welfare reform evaluation and study.   Funding under this announcement is intended to stimulate research and support a  wide range of studies or components of studies and analyses of welfare program changes brought about by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, and specifically the Temporary Assistance to  Needy Families (TANF) program.  ACF anticipates providing up to $1.95 million  for the total group of approved projects in FY 1997, and up to $750,000 in FY  1988, subject to the availability of funds in each year, and a like amount in succeeding years.

When asked what role lack of education played in rural homelessness, one service provider responded that over-education was more of a problem for those homeless than was under-education and illiteracy. He explained that due to the lack of jobs and lack of diversity in employment, high school diplomas actually had been stigmatizing in the job market for  many of his clients.  I'm curious to know if this is true in rural areas across the country, or perhaps specific to Oklahoma. Have any rural service providers faced this in their work?

I work with adults at the high school level who sometimes are poor readers. I notice that very seldom do they ever have problems with phonics. They seem to have learned this very well over and over again when they were in school. Often they have very limited vocabulary. Sight words (or the lack thereof) impede their reading. Fluency is often a problem. Memory can be troublesome (i.e. they can understand what they read as they read it, but when you ask them to retell or answer questions about the material, they can't remember.). Sometimes structural analysis (i.e. breaking down big words into little words) is a weakness. I also sometimes work with college students. They read fairly well, but they are what I'd call passive readers. They just let their eyes pass over the words and they don't think about what they've read. They don't really have a reading problem, but their lack of engagement kills them on their tests and assignments.  Do I use diagnostics? Of course. How else would we know what to do if we don't take a careful look at exactly what the student both does and does not do as she or he reads?  What do I do? That depends on what the student needs. I was trained to look at reading as the balanced use of a number of different strategies. When there is a reading problem, it's because the reader may have not learned some strategies, or s/he has an overreliance on one strategy (i.e. it's not balanced). The answer is to help the reader achieve balance. Through diagnosis, you figure out what strategies are weak or missing. Then you try to help the reader improve in those areas. There are many many practices and techniques for the various reading strategies. Among my favorites are language experience, repeated reading, playing Scrabble, cloze, asking and answering as many questions as you can about a passage and guess-the-covered-word activities. The professional journals are full of many others.  There are a couple things I feel do NOT especially help a student who has trouble reading. I tend to get in a lot of trouble saying it, but I don't believe we help poor readers very much by trying to identify a cause of their problem. dwelling on the psychological, intellectual, and emotional processes that interfere with reading does not tell me what I need to know to try to help the person read better. The effort would be better spent learning about the reader's strategies and working on the areas of weakness. There is an exception to this. Identifying the physical problem of poor vision and correcting it can sometimes make all the difference. I can see how this might also hold for hearing problems, but I have no experience in that area.

Welfare reform has also led to state by state differences in regulations related to immigrants.  What is not clear to me is the direct impact of either of these measures on what we do-- teaching English as a second language. I know that some programs have seen an impact already. If you have information or opinions on this topic, could you post them to the list at  nifl-esl@literacy.nifl.gov ?  Thanks!

February 5, 2003               3.1  Each Customer has access to newsgroups.                These newsgroups allow a Customer to read and post messages on a                variety of topics. Newsgroups may also have a charter or a FAQ that                describes what subjects are appropriate for each newsgroup. Misuse                of newsgroups may result in the termination of the Customer's SCC                Service account.               3.2  SCC does not control the content of the                newsgroups available to its Customer. SCC believes that decisions                about which newsgroups and messages to read are best left to Customers.                Screening software is available from third parties, and it is the                Customer's responsibility to use such tools if desired. SCC is not                responsible for the content of any newsgroup message, whether or                not an SCC Customer posted the message.               3.3  Messages posted to newsgroups must comply                with the written charters or FAQs for those newsgroups.                3.4  Advertisements, solicitations, or other                commercial messages should be posted only in those newsgroups whose                charters or FAQs explicitly permit them. Each Customer is responsible                for determining the policies of a given newsgroup before posting                to it.

February 5, 2003               3.1  Each Customer has access to newsgroups.                These newsgroups allow a Customer to read and post messages on a                variety of topics. Newsgroups may also have a charter or a FAQ that                describes what subjects are appropriate for each newsgroup. Misuse                of newsgroups may result in the termination of the Customer's SCC                Service account.               3.2  SCC does not control the content of the                newsgroups available to its Customer. SCC believes that decisions                about which newsgroups and messages to read are best left to Customers.                Screening software is available from third parties, and it is the                Customer's responsibility to use such tools if desired. SCC is not                responsible for the content of any newsgroup message, whether or                not an SCC Customer posted the message.               3.3  Messages posted to newsgroups must comply                with the written charters or FAQs for those newsgroups.               3.4  Advertisements, solicitations, or other                commercial messages should be posted only in those newsgroups whose                charters or FAQs explicitly permit them. Each Customer is responsible                for determining the policies of a given newsgroup before posting                to it.

Is it possible to feed Resolve with a user-generated NCS mask?    No, unfortunately you can't feed Resolve a mask at the moment. Could be    useful, I see.    >2). Is it reasonable to use NCS in Prime-and-switch mode?    >The program accepts NCS matrixes, but I am getting a confusing log    >while running it.    Actually, everything seems quite normal to me in your NCS+ prime-and-switch    run.  The initial FOM is coming from the sigmaa analysis and is pretty    high. Subsequent FOM come from the map likelihood function only and are    typically lower. A final FOM of 0.5 in prime-and-switch  phasing is very good.    Keep in mind that prime-and-switch phasing is just keeping most of the    correct phase information and tossing the biased information; this often    makes the map look worse because a lot of that beautiful map was just    coming from the model, not from the data.    Good luck!   -Tom    Thomas C.

According to my own experiments, ROUGE1 correlated well with extraction type of summaries which are most of previous summarization systems generated. However, if a system does re-generation or it outputs only keywords (in order to optimize for the size limit of 75 bytes and 665 bytes) then ROUGE1 will favor those systems only output keywords. This is due to ROUGE1 only care about content overlap and not fluency of the summaries.  In the 26th slide (""DUC 2003 Headline Generation Task"") of my talk at the workshop on Machine Translation Evaluation - Towards Systematizing MT Evaluation (available on the ROUGE site:  http://www.isi.edu/~cyl/ROUGE ), I found that applying ROUGE1 across systems correlated less than applying ROUGE1 within system output groups. In fact, if we just applied ROUGE1 on the groups that output sentences, we got 100% correlation with human and 100% in reliability of the results.  In MT evaluation, longer n-grams are used to quantify the fluency of the MT output. I think there is a place for high order ROUGE scores (i.e. n > 1) but can they can only show their strength when re-generation is involved (as in MT) or readability is a concern (as keywords/phrases vs. sentences).

These are the grades: F for attempts to reduce poverty. While national poverty rate has decreased in the past five years, the percentage of women in poverty has increased. B for progress in appointing women to decision making positions  This was the highest grade the US received in all the categories. D for efforts to promote the rights of girls.  This grade was received primarily because of the US failure to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The US and Somalia are the ONLY countries in the world that have not done so. A separate UN study found that although almost all girls in the US are enrolled in high school, the US lags in achieving gender equality in secondary school enrollment.  Also, only 12% of congressional seats are held by women. Besides being interesting, I am sharing these facts, because I think that these may be interesting facts to share with adult learners and can lead to interesting discussions, journal writing, and letters to government officials.  Let us know if you do share them with your learners and what kinds of reactions/responses are elicited.

While single men certainly have historically been America's ""homeless,"" people are shocked to hear that families with children are the fastest growing segment of the homeless. Perhaps this is because one doesn't SEE homeless families -- they are more likely to stick with doubled-up situations, or turn to the shelters, making every effort to avoid ending up in the streets.  Apart from stereotypes and opinions about the homeless, the most disappointing thing I have found in talking about these issues with people I otherwise have great respect for is that they just don't want to hear about it -- either because they resent what they see as ""guilt-trips"", or they have become numb to depressing stories they have heard all their lives, or they see discussion as futile because they see homelessness as a stagnant issue that has changed very little and is unlikely to change in the future regardless of anyone's efforts.  What they don't see are the individuals behind the banner ""homeless,"" the shattered lives and the lives rebuilt. They don't see the relevance of homelessness to their own lives, despite the fact that they are asked for money every day, or that their children have classmates who are homeless, or that they have friends who may once have been homeless, or that they may one day be homeless themselves. At most, they see homelessness as a drain on their tax dollars, a drain that would just go away if they could ignore it.  I think it is counter-productive to call anyone not yet informed a ""pig of ignorance""; even if language used does sometimes sound piggish, often it simply illustrates the reaction most people have when talking about a topic they do not feel comfortable with. Instead of criticizing them, we should take a second look at our own speech and actions, and reevaluate the efforts we are making not just to educate, but to attune people to the realities and imperatives of homelessness. Sympathetic attitudes and opinions will achieve little if people fail to place a priority on the issues causing homelessness in their voting and day-to-day lives. Only once people are not just informed, but ""fired up"" enough about homelessness to force representatives to prioritize homeless issues both with their vote and with their response to advocacy efforts can those attitudes and opinions positively affect both services and government.

By the way, if the email correspondence is any indication-we should have a fascinating conference!  Here are some of the responses: One person hopes that issues raised in this conference can lead to a momentum to try to change policy. Does anyone have further thoughts about this comment? In response to how language/culture can be defined, people have shared with me that they see the following groups as being important to consider when discussing women and literacy: a. deaf language/culture b. Appalachian language/culture c. African American language/culture d. ESL issues e. language/culture that assumes heterosexual orientation f.  assumed shared medical language/culture Does anyone have other communities that they would like to see added to this list? Another thought-how is language/culture defined?  For example, can singing be part of what one thinks of when one thinks of language?

This appears to track with GNU C version 2.7.2 (I saw the bug when I compiled with gcc 2.7.2 and I used the -O flag). I also arrived at the conclusion  that the use of ""const"" in the typedef for CA_SYNC_GID only leads to problems - so I removed it. This should not require any change in any of the CA clients. I recently committed this change to 3.13 beta at APS.  If there is interest I will patch 3.12.  I have only seen this problem show up when compiling with gnu C/C++ 2.7.2  (which is not distributed with vxWorks 5.2).

ROUGE scoring - its meaning and usefulness - will no doubt be one of the man subjects of discussion at the workshop. I know TIDES has a goal expressed in terms of ROUGE1.

Homes for the Homeless has developed the ""Practical Living/Useful Skills"" (PLUS) curricula to accomplish similar goals, and you may find it helpful.  The PLUS program, one of the many educaitonal programs run by Homes for the Homeless at each of its four Residential Educational/Employment Training (RET) Centers, is designed to enhance the independent living skills of homeless and low-income parents facing the challenges involved in obtaining and maintaining permanent housing. PLUS strives to help clients accomplish the following goals:     * Build self-esteem     * Create personal support networks     * Learn practical skills and information     * Develop linkages to community resources.  The program includes six workshops, each broken down into 4 to 7 sessions. Workshop topics include:     * Parenting     * Stress Management     * Women, Sex and HIV/AIDS     * Family Violence     * Housing     * Women's Health  The curricula costs $25 for each workshop, $125 for the set. Homes for the Homeless also offers trainings for service providers to learn to facilitate the PLUS workshops with their clients. The series has been completed for this year, but trainings for individual or multiple organizations can be arranged.  If you are interested in purchasing the curricula or setting up a training, please contact Anna Smith at Homes for the Homeless at (212) 529-5252.  Hope this was helpful!

I trivially incorporated it into our code, seeding it  with the time (you could use secs or usecs).  There is a C  version among many others.  It is freely available.

As far as I'm aware, HOL is not used much in education. Sometimes students  are taught HOL, but as part of a course in mechanical verification rather  than as an aide for other subjects. However I hope this situation will  change in the future as more elegant proof styles become available. See for  example the Web page "" http://www.abo.fi/~jgrundy/schoolmath/schoolmath.html "".       2) How much are formal proofs longer than usual proofs?    I don't think this has been studied extensively. First, HOL is more usually  applied to verification proofs rather than textbook mathematics, so there just  aren't many comparisons to be made. Also, the ability to write arbitrary  proof procedures and to use them in various different styles makes it hard to  give a uniform measure.       3) What are the lengths (lines) of formal proofs of the following theorems:       a) The set of all prime numbers is infinite;       b) 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + n^2 = n*(n+1)*(2*n+1) / 6          (if you have such formal proofs please send them to me, or give a            reference);    Some proofs I did in a version of HOL are given below. They're a bit ugly;  with more use of automated proof procedures they could probably be made a  lot more elegant.       4) How much time is needed for a typical student to write such          formal proofs?    I don't know. Probably a long time. The proofs below took me around  6 minutes for the sum-of-squares and 57 minutes for the primes, though the  latter involved defining a lot of preliminary stuff. And I'm a fairly  experienced HOL user.       5) How much time is needed for your system to check such proofs?    About 15 seconds each.    Cheers,    John.    =========================================================================  John Harrison                   | email:  jharriso@abo.fi  Abo Akademi University          | web:    http://www.abo.fi/~jharriso/  Department of Computer Science  | phone: +358 (9)21 265-4049  Lemminkaisenkatu 14a            | fax:   +358 (9)21 265-4732  20520 Turku                     | home:  +358 (9)21 2316132  FINLAND                         | time:  UTC+2:00  =========================================================================    (* sum of squares *)    let SUMMATION = new_recursive_definition num_Axiom    `(SUMMATION 0 f = f 0) /\     (SUMMATION (SUC n) f = SUMMATION n f + f (SUC n))`;;    let SOS_LEMMA = prove   (`!n. 6 * SUMMATION n (\i. i EXP 2) = n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)`,    INDUCT_TAC THEN    ASM_REWRITE_TAC[ARITH; SUMMATION; LEFT_ADD_DISTRIB] THEN    REWRITE_TAC[EXP_2] THEN ARITH_TAC);;    let SOS = prove   (`SUMMATION n (\i. i EXP 2) = (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) DIV 6`,    REWRITE_TAC[GSYM SOS_LEMMA] THEN    MATCH_MP_TAC(GSYM DIV_MULT) THEN    REWRITE_TAC[ARITH]);;    (* infinity of primes *)    parse_as_infix(""divides"",(12,""right""));;    let divides = new_definition    `m divides n = ?x. n = m * x`;;    let prime = new_definition    `prime(p) = p > 1 /\ !n. n divides p ==> (n = 1) \/ (n = p)`;;    let FINITE_RULES,FINITE_INDUCT,FINITE_CASES =    new_inductive_definition      `FINITE EMPTY /\       !(x:A) s.
