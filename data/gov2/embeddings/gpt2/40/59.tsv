Formats may be proprietary or nonproprietary, native to one particular          software program or useable in a number of programs, and each has its          own characteristics, making one ""better"" than another for its          desired use. This wide range of characteristics creates a challenge to          interoperability. How is a user to know which file format is best for          them?         CISD          Response Strategy:  NIST          can assist the industry by providing an inventory of digital content types          and formats. This page is intended as a reference to inform the public          of what is out there - primarily, each format's particular characteristics          and issues when converting. It is also only an introduction to the basics          of the standards, not a detailed technical resource. For more detailed          information, please follow the links at the end of each section.          Several          standards are discussed on this page. Inclusion of a standard or product          is not an endorsement. Conversely, omission is not intended to deprecate          its use. If there are any terms mentioned here that you are unfamiliar with, please refer to the  glossary .         This          document will continue to change as more information is added and corrected.

Dozens more are          out there, but these seem to be the most popular, or those ""on the          cutting edge."" Some formats would be worth looking at due to their          superior compression, but only appeal to a small sector because they are          native, proprietary formats. In the case of MDLP formatted audio, it is          only used by Sony MiniDisc's Net MD Walkman series. ( More           about MDLP formats and usage.) Others work similarly to other, more popular          file types, like AIFF (Mac) to WAV (PC). ( More           about AIFF.)         As audio          copyright infringement becomes more of a concern to record companies,          some are encrypting their CDs to make them unreadable in home computers.          Thus, converting your CD collection to a digital music library is impossible          with these CDs. Even so, additional software - programs called rippers          and encoders or de-encoders - are necessary to extract the data from the          CD. A simple search on a software download site will yield hundreds of          results.          Listed          below is the interoperability of the formats already looked at, with links          to more information about the file format.         AAC:           Encoding          used by Universal, BMG and Liquid Audio, but due to different encryption          may not be compatible with some software and hardware players; increased          interoperability hindered by AAC Licensing Agreement.  More .           AC3:  Since AC3 is primarily used for DVD audio, it is not as common          on a user-level or on the Internet, but that is changing as many are realizing          its superior quality over even CD audio without massive file sizes. A          few programs exist to convert AC3 into more popular user-level formats          like MP3 and WAV.  More .           MIDI:  Designed for interoperability between different synths, but          its interoperability with other audio formats is limited.  More .           MP3:  A number of independent programs exist to de-encode MP3 to          WAV very simply.  More .           RealAudio:  As a proprietary format, conversion programs are limited.           More .           Waveform:  Numerous freeware and shareware programs exist to convert          WAV to MP3 and vice versa, other file formats more limited. More .           WMA:  Available programs most commonly convert to WAV, MP3, and          OGG. (OGG is an open-format file format from  Vorbis           that is still in its infancy. It supports 48kHz, 16-bit, multi-channel          high-quality audio.)

They are however, those most widely used, or those primed to become            most widely used. Plenty of formats that seemed to have potential didn't,            or haven't, gotten off the ground, such as  JPEG-LS             (see section 2.3). There are also numerous formats that are native to            only one particular program, such as  Adobe            Photoshop 's PSD.                 As many formats as          there are, there are even more programs to create, edit, and convert them.

New formats are still emerging,        however.  VP5  by        On2Technologies, released in February 2002, for example, claims to deliver        higher quality at lower bit rates than MPEG-2, MPEG-4, Real 8, Windows Media,        and QuickTime, but has yet to take hold.

It is an introduction to the basics of            the standards. For more detailed information, please follow the links            at the end of each section. If there are any terms mentioned here that            you are unfamiliar with, please refer to the  glossary .              * Several standards              are discussed on this page. Inclusion of a standard or product is              not an endorsement. Conversely, omission is not intended to deprecate              its use.                                                    Why?                                        There              are hundreds of file formats for representing media online or in print              for countless other applications. Formats may be proprietary or nonproprietary,              native to one particular software program, or useable in a number              of programs, and each has its own characteristics, making one ""better""              than another for its desired use. This wide range of characteristics              can create a challenge for interoperability. How is a user to know              which file format is best for them?

Dozens more are            out there, but these seem to be the most popular, or those ""on            the cutting edge."" Some formats would be worth looking at due to            their superior compression, but only appeal to a small sector because            they are native, proprietary formats. In the case of MDLP formatted            audio, it is only used by Sony MiniDisc's Net MD Walkman series. ( More             about MDLP formats and usage.) Others work similarly to other, more            popular file types, like AIFF (Mac) to WAV (PC). ( More             about AIFF.)           As            audio copyright infringement becomes more of a concern to record companies,            some are encrypting their CDs to make them unreadable in home computers.            Thus, converting your CD collection to a digital music library is impossible            with these CDs. Even so, additional software - programs called rippers            and encoders or de-encoders - are necessary to extract the data from            the CD. A simple search on a software download site will yield hundreds            of results.            Listed            below is the interoperability of the formats already looked at, with            links to more information about the file format.           AAC:             Encoding            used by Universal, BMG and Liquid Audio, but due to different encryption            may not be compatible with some software and hardware players; increased            interoperability hindered by AAC Licensing Agreement.  More .             AC3:  Since AC3 is primarily used for DVD audio, it is not as            common on a user-level or on the Internet, but that is changing as many            are realizing its superior quality over even CD audio without massive            file sizes. A few programs exist to convert AC3 into more popular user-level            formats like MP3 and WAV.  More .             MIDI:  Designed for interoperability between different synths,            but its interoperability with other audio formats is limited.  More .             MP3:  A number of independent programs exist to de-encode MP3            to WAV very simply.  More .             RealAudio:  As a proprietary format, conversion programs are limited.             More .             Waveform:  Numerous freeware and shareware programs exist to convert            WAV to MP3 and vice versa, other file formats more limited. More .             WMA:  Available programs most commonly convert to WAV, MP3, and            OGG. (OGG is an open-format file format from  Vorbis             that is still in its infancy. It supports 48kHz, 16-bit, multi-channel            high-quality audio.)

They are however, those most widely used, or those primed              to become most widely used. Plenty of formats that seemed to have              potential didn't, or haven't, gotten off the ground, such as  JPEG-LS               (see section 2.3). There are also numerous formats that are native              to only one particular program, such as  Adobe              Photoshop 's PSD.

However, in order to increase interoperability between            different systems the file types are more flexible than other media            types, so the list is shorter. Still, this is not meant to be representative            of every text format out there.

New formats are          still emerging, however.

NLS/BPH distributes its talking books on standard audio    cassettes designed to play at half commercial speed and using four tracks. The    NLS configuration can pack up to six hours of reading time onto one cassette.    The C-1 side- and speed-selector switches enable readers to play cassettes created    with the standard, commercial configuration as well as the NLS talking-book    configuration. The C-1 player is shipped with a fully charged, rechargeable    nickel-cadmium battery that will operate the player for about six hours after    being fully charged. Simply plug the player into a standard household outlet to recharge it. Remember, you can always call your library about using    the NLS/BPH player.   Using the Standard Cassette Player   You can operate the C-1 on its battery, or you can take the power cord from    the recessed area in the back of the player and plug it into an electrical outlet.    Here is a typical sequence for reading an NLS cassette talking book.       Open the tape compartment door by pressing the eject key, far right and        marked with a raised square.     Insert the cassette, label side up, with the tape edge facing out. Seat        the cassette by pushing it back until it clicks. Press the compartment door        down until it clicks.     Press and lock down the play key (green with a raised circle) to start        the player. Adjust the volume slide switch (nearest the front edge of the        player).     Stop the player at any point by pressing the red key with a raised ""x"",        first on the left.     To review the cassette soundtrack, press rewind, the key between play and        stop with the raised less-than sign, or arrow head pointing left.     To advance the cassette soundtrack, press fast forward, the key between        play and eject with the raised greater-than sign, or arrow head pointing        right.     To remove a cassette from the player, make sure it is stopped. Press the        eject key, far right with a raised square. The tape compartment door will        snap up, and the tape will pop free of its seated position. To play the        next side, turn the tape over (print/braille label down), reinsert, seat        in the door, and press the door shut. Then press the start key. After reading        sides 1 and 2, rock the side selector switch to the right to listen to sides        3 and 4.      Tips   Switches and Buttons   Speed, volume, tone and side-selector switches are on the right of the player.    Begin at the top of these controls, in the middle of the player as you face    it, and you will find the following:    Variable Speed Control   Used to slow down or speed up the reading of the book. The voice    of the narrator becomes distorted as the playback speed is changed.   Speed   A different sort of speed switch is just under the variable    speed control. This is the speed switch that is used to match the speed of the    player with the recording speed on the cassette. It is a rocker switch. Press,    or rock it down, to the left (15/16) for our talking books. Press, or rock it    down, to the right for commercial cassettes.   Side-Selector Switch   Another rocker switch, the side-selector switch enables readers    to listen to both commercial and talking-book cassettes. Here are the things    you should know about talking-book cassettes before you use the side-selector    switch:       Talking-book cassettes will appear to be oddly numbered because of the        four-side (or, four-track) system. The first side of the first cassette        will be 1. The first side of the next cassette will be 5. Then, 9 and so        on.     Turn the cassette over after each side.     When starting with side 1, push the side selector switch down to the left,        marked 1-2.  Do not change the switch to listen to side        2.  Push the side-selector switch down to the right for sides 3 and        4. It is important to be methodical about the use of the side switch, or        you may find yourself skipping whole segments of the book.     As guidance, the narrator will provide instructions at the end of each        side.     Tone Control   This slider switch raises (to the right) or lowers (to the left)    the pitch of the narrator's voice.   Volume control   The volume control is also a slider. Louder to the right, softer    to the left.   Battery Maintenance   To maintain battery life, the player should be played frequently unplugged,    on battery. After several hours, up to six or until the battery fails, plug    the player back into an electrical outlet to charge the battery. The player    will operate, plugged in, while the battery recharges.   Do not remove the battery.  As a nickel-cadmium product,    it is toxic if not disposed of properly. If you suspect the player will not    work because of battery problems, call the library serving you. They will arrange    for a replacement player.

To receive multimedia streaming, you need two types of software: a browser and a streaming media player. The fact that you can view this text means that you have a browser. Most of the new browsers support multimedia streaming. But if you have an older version, you may need to upgrade your browser to one that supports multimedia streaming. The most popular browsers are Microsofts Explorer and Netscape. Which one you use, however, is a matter of personal taste. The important thing is to have a browser that will support multimedia. If you have browser versions older than Internet Explorer 5.0 or Netscape 4.7, youll have trouble receiving certain streaming mediaespecially with Netscape.  Installing a browser is easy and free.  To install the latest version of the Microsoft browser, click here . To install the latest version of the   Netscape browser, click here .        Lets Now Focus on the Media Player  A media player is another piece of software that helps you run multimedia. If you have a new computer, odds are that your machine came with a media player installed. If you dont have one installed, however, well tell you how to install one on your computer. If you have an older machine, we recommend that you update your media player to a newer version. The latest media players are much better in terms of ease of use and quality of picture and sound. We strongly advise that you download the latest version of Microsoft Media Player (Media Player 7).  Click here to download it . It is free.   For additional help to properly install Windows Media Player, click here .  Some people have installed the Real Audio Media Player (sometimes it is called Real Video). Keep in mind that while the latest browsers are, for the most part, interchangeable because they follow the same standards, streaming media players have different and incompatible operational standards. This means to view streaming video from a Web area, you need to use a media player that is compatible with the streaming media being offered on the Web site.   We stream from our servers using the Microsoft format. In order to receive PREVLINE multimedia, you must have a Microsoft Media Player installed on your computer.     Some Web sites serve multimedia in the real audio format, which was the first of the effective streaming formats. Perhaps you or someone else downloaded and installed the Real Audio format media player and disconnected the Microsoft Media Player. If so,   re-install the Microsoft Media Player by clicking here . You do not need to uninstall your Real Player. The two can co-exist on your computer.  Some computers have other media players, such as the Yamaha Media Player. Some of these media players do a wonderful job of playing CD-ROMS. If you have a specialized media player, it might have been designed for playing media on your computer but not for streaming media that comes over the Web. So, youll need to install a media player that will support Web-based media.  Wires  As silly as it seems, a large number of users find that they dont get decent reception of streaming media because they have loose wires or the wires are not plugged into the sockets. Check the wires from your speakers to your computer to ensure there is a solid connection. If you get a crackly sound or no sound at all, a loose wire may be the problem.  Turn Up the Volume  One of the most common problems people have with multimedia is that the sound doesnt work. When you consider that there are a number of controls from which you can adjust sound levels on a computer, its no wonder that people have trouble with their sound. For example, if you dont hear sound when you run multimedia, the culprit could be your speakers. Most speakers have volume controls on the front of one or two speakers. If you dont have any sound, check the speaker controls. Some speakers have an on/off switchmake sure the speakers are switched to on. Next, check that the volume control is set high enough to hear sound.  If your speakers arent the problem, next check the volume adjustment that is part of your operating software on your computer desktop. Look on the lower right hand corner of your basic desktop Windows screen. You should see a little icon for a speaker. If you click on this icon, a sound control panel will appear with a slide control. With your mouse, slide the volume control to about the middle (you can adjust it later to be louder or softer to suit your needs).  On this same window, notice that there is a box called mute.  Make sure this box is not checked. If this box is checked, you wont hear any sound no matter how high you have the volume set on other controls. (Some people prefer not to have sounds playing on their computer while they work, so they check this box and uncheck it when they want to hear sound.)  If you do not see the speaker icon on your desktop, you have to access the sound control panel through the control panel. Click on My Computer then click on the control panel. There you will find an icon for speakers. Click on that icon and then go through the steps we just mentioned and adjust the sound to about mid-range. In this window, there is a box that, when checked, allows you to show the speaker icon on the lower right hand corner of your screen. We recommend checking this box so that you can easily access the volume control panel.  A few computers have elaborate sound cards, which have their own sets of controls that go far beyond just volume but have multiple settings that allow you to adjust for such things as treble and bass. If these settings are all in the lowest position, adjust them at mid-range for an initial setting. Again, you can adjust them to meet your needs after you have determined that you can get sound when you run a multimedia program.   Hardware  If you get the video portion but no sound, the problem might be a lack of hardware. Your computer may not have a sound card or speakers (the little speaker installed inside your computer may not be sufficient to handle the demands of multimedia). If you dont have external speakers, your speakers may be built into the monitorthe volume controls may be on your monitor.  You could have speakers but no sound card (although it is highly unlikely). If you dont have speakers, you should check to see if you have a sound card. If you do, all you need is speakers. If you dont have a sound card, you will need to purchase one and have it installed.  Pick-ups and Synchronization  Another problem that sometimes occurs is that the sound or video (or both) hiccups and skips or jumps ahead. Sometimes the synchronization of the sound and the video is off. These difficulties are most related to the capacity of your computer and your Internet connection.  If you have a poor Internet connection and packets of sound are coming through, the Internet system will resend the packet. Sometimes the packet will be sent two or three times and computer software that recognizes such conditions simply jumps ahead and picks up the good signal. When this happens, sometimes the sound hiccups. Sometimes a signal cannot come in as fast as it should to function in real time and that causes hiccups. If you have an older 28.8 modem (or less) you will get hiccups and there is not much that you can do to improve the connection. We suggest that you upgrade to a 58.8 modem (which is twice as fast as a 28.8 modem). Even with a 58.8 modem you can have problems if your computer is busy running other programs. For example, if you are running your e-mail program and your word processor program, it may be too much for your computers processor to also run multimedia without hiccups and poor synchronization. If this is the case, you can improve the situation by closing all applications except your browser and your media player. If the problem still persists, you might have to correct the problem by adding more memory to your computer.   Of course, you will always get much better multimedia reception if you have a higher speed Internet connection. If you do a lot of Web surfing, you might consider upgrading your connection speed to a DSL or cable modemboth are hundreds of times faster than a telephone dial-up modem.   Wait for the Buffering  A common complaint among new multimedia Web users is that once the media player opens nothing happens. People often assume something is wrong with the system. Actually, a short delay of 20 or 30 seconds is normal. During this delay, your computer begins to collect the information from the connection it has made with another server and stores a modest amount in memory. Once a packet of information is received, your computer begins to display what it has stored. This process is called buffering. While your computer is playing the first packet of information it received, it continues to receive more information and store it in memory until it is time for it to be played. The faster your Internet connection, the less time will be required for this initial buffering.

GX067-51-12249483	"National Information Standards Organization   Digital Talking Book Standards Committee   Playback Device Guidelines   Prioritized List of Features for Digital Talking Book Playback Devices   Version Date: December 30,1999   Contents   Introduction     General   Physical Characteristics   Audio Characteristics   Power   Media   User Interface   Document Navigation   Help Functions   File/Stream Format   Compatibility   Multilingual Functions   Presentation Functions   Copyright   Administrative Aspects     Introduction   The National Information Standards Organization (NISO) is a nonprofit association accredited as a standards developer by the American National Standards Institute. At the initiative of the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, Library of Congress, NISO Standards Committee ""AQ"" was formed in March, 1997, to develop a national standard for a digital talking book (DTB) for blind and physically handicapped readers. A DTB is envisioned to be, in its fullest implementation, a group of digitally-encoded files containing an audio portion recorded in human speech; the full text of the work in electronic form, marked with the tags of a descriptive markup language; and a linking file that synchronizes the text and audio portions. As this document illustrates, such a structure will allow the DTB user a broad range of capabilities not possible with current talking books.  The NISO DTB committee developed this list of features desired by users for a DTB playback device. It is intended for use as a guideline by organizations designing DTB players. The committee recommends that three types of playback device be developed, as described below:       Basic DTB player.  This machine would be a portable unit capable of playing digital audio recordings. Its primary characteristic would be its ease of operation. It would therefore include a limited number of controls and functions. It would not include the capability to access a full-text file that might accompany the audio file. It would be used mostly by less sophisticated talking-book readers who wish to read primarily in a linear fashion. Both this device and the following one are envisioned as containing a speaker of sufficient quality for long-term listening. Neither is seen as an ""ultra-portable"" which requires the use of headphones. There will certainly be a need for such very lightweight players, but they are not the subject of these guidelines.     Advanced DTB player.  This device would also be portable but would be designed for use by students, professionals, and others who wish to access documents randomly, use sophisticated navigation tools, set bookmarks, etc. It would include most of the features found in the computer-based version.     Computer-based DTB player  This player would consist only of software and would operate on a user-supplied personal computer. It would provide the most complete and sophisticated suite of features of the three players.     Each feature listed below was assigned one of the following three priorities for each of the three types of player:    Essential   Highly desirable   Useful     So the designation 1C, 2B, 3A following a feature indicates that it was classified as useful for the level 1 player, highly desirable for the level 2 unit, and essential for the level 3 playback device. A digital talking book that is compliant with NISO standard X?X must be able to play on all three types of players, but with different levels of functionality.   ( Back to Contents )       General    1.1 Simplest version, no more complex than C-1 (1B)     The basic device is no more difficult to operate than the standard   NLS C-1 cassette player.    1.2 ???Meets accessibility guidelines for telecommunications devices  (specifically for hearing impaired) (1A, 2A, 3A)     (Reference section 508.)   ( Back to Contents )       2. Physical Characteristics   2.1 Weight   Device weighs less than 1.59 kg (3-1/2 pounds). (1A, 2A)   Device weighs less than 1.36 kg (3 pounds). (1B, 2B)   Device weighs less than 1.13 kg (2-1/2 pounds). (1C, 2C)   These weights are based on the assumption that the power transformer is an external unit integrated with a power cord that is detachable from the unit. The weight of the power cord and transformer is not included in the above weights.   2.2 Dimensions   Device is relatively compact, with the sum of height, width, and length not exceeding:  50.8 cm (20 inches) (1A, 2A)  45.72 cm (18 inches) (1B, 2B)  40.64 cm (16 inches) (1C, 2C)   2.3 Durability (1A, 2A)   Device must be at least as durable as high-quality handheld portable consumer electronics devices of similar manufacture (e.g., solid state or electromechanical).   2.4 Operates in wide range of environmental conditions (1A, 2A)   Device operates normally under conditions of extreme temperature and humidity: -20 degrees C (-4 degrees F) to 50 degrees C (122 degrees F) and 20 percent to100 percent relative humidity (non-condensing).   2.5 Shock-resistant (Sound does not skip when device is jarred) (1A, 2A)   2.6 Spill proof (1A, 2A)   Device is constructed so as to prevent spilled liquids from entering.   2.7 Vermin-proof (1A, 2A,)   Device is constructed so as to prevent infestation by vermin. Internal heat sources may attract such infestation.   2.8 If a physical medium is used, it will not be ejected if the device is dropped. (1B, 2B)   2.9 Output connectors: headphone jack (for headphones and amplified speakers), line-out jacks (1A, 2A)   Many readers use headphones or external speakers for improved sound quality.   2.10 Speaker   2.10.1 Device has a built-in speaker (1A, 2A)   2.10.2 Ability to point speaker   Many older users have impaired hearing at higher frequencies. Speakers are directional at higher frequencies, so it shall be possible to direct their output toward the user for optimal performance. (1B, 2B)   2.10.3 Speaker capacity   Speaker shall be able to reproduce a 1KHz sine wave and generate 80db SPL at 1 meter with minimal distortion. (1A, 2A)   2.11 Device has a small footprint and is physically stable, with a low center of gravity. (1A, 2A)   2.12 The power transformer is integrated with a power cord that is detachable from the unit. (1B, 2B)   2.13 Device exceeds UL standards for safety (1A, 2A)   2.14 Device includes easily-distinguishable tactile markings for controls, jacks, etc. (1A, 2A)   2.15 Controls are color-coded (1A, 2A)   2.16 Print labeling is in a high-contrast, upper/lowercase, large-print, sanserif font (14 point or larger) (1A, 2A)   2.17 Device is aesthetically pleasing (1B, 2B)   2.18 Device is easy to clean (1A, 2A)   2.19 Device is easy to maintain (1A, 2A) (It may be desirable that it be repairable by volunteers)   2.20 External digital input/output connectivity   Ports and system shall enable remote diagnostics, external controls, exporting of text, sharing of bookmarks, etc. (1A, 2A)   Software must support data exchange through operating system (3A)   2.21 Non-skid feet   Device shall have non-skid feet to minimize accidental movement on low-friction surfaces. (1A, 2A)   ( Back to Contents )      3. Audio Characteristics   3.1 Sound quality (1A, 2A, 3A) (To be quantified)   Audio material shall be distributed in a form that provides a minimum of FM quality sound to the user. (This section will be expanded, based upon Audio Engineering Society project AES-X74,  Recommended Practices for Internet Quality Descriptions .)  3.2 Volume control (1A, 2A, 3A)   The user can adjust the volume to meet hearing and listening conditions.  3.3 Tone control (1A, 2A, 3B)   The user can adjust the equalization (the amount of low, mid-range or high frequencies) to suit individual tastes and listening conditions. The device shall include a high-frequency adjustment to compensate for age-related hearing loss.  3.4 Variable speed, with pitch restoration (1A, 2A, 3A)   Playback speed is adjustable over a range from 1/3 to at least 3 times the normal playback speed, and the pitch of the narration is not altered by the speed change. The Time-Scale Modification system shall not produce audible chopping, burble, or reverberation and shall not skip over significant units of sound at high playback speeds.  3.5 Pitch restoration control; independent of speed (1B, 2B, 3B)   Although pitch restoration may be the default, the user can adjust the pitch of the narrator's voice independent of the speed to make it more intelligible at extreme speeds, or to compensate for hearing loss.  3.6 Amplitude compression (1C, 2C, 3C)   Gives the user a method of narrowing the volume range between the quietest and the loudest portions of a talking book. This would be useful when listening to the book at a distance, in a noisy environment, or for a person whose hearing has limited dynamic range. The AC-3 audio compression standard includes this function.  3.7 Stereo (3B)   Could be useful in auditorially displaying spatial arrangements of information, such as matrices in T.V. Raman's ASTER system.  3.8 Balance control (stereo) (3A)   ( Back to Contents )    4. Power   4.1 Device operates off of AC and battery power. (1A, 2A)   4.2 Smart (multivoltage) power supply (1B, 2B)   Adapts automatically to local AC voltage.  4.3 Battery saver (1A, 2A)   Player automatically manages battery discharge for maximum battery life.  4.4 Battery indicator (1A, 2A)   The user is automatically warned when the battery is low but can also query the device at any time to get a reading of current battery discharge/charge status.  4.5 Ability to accept standard batteries (1A, 2A)   Even if a special rechargeable battery pack is provided, off-the-shelf batteries can be purchased and used in the player.  4.6 Battery capacity   The user can expect the player to operate on a fully-charged battery at normal speed and 60 db SPL measured at one meter for:  6 hours (1A, 2A)  10 hours (1B, 2B)  14 hours (1C, 2C)  ( Back to Contents )      5. Media   5.1 Media/data robustness (1A, 2A, 3A)   The distribution system or media will remain free of perceptible errors for a long time, under a wide variety of handling or transmission conditions, without placing unreasonable burdens on users.  5.2 One-way medium (1B, 2B, 3B)   Media would not need to be returned to the library.  ( Back to Contents )    6. User Interface   6.1 Controls designed for accessibility by maximum range of abilities (1A, 2A, 3A)   Controls are physically differentiable by touch; require a minimum of hand/arm strength to operate and a minimum of dexterity to manipulate, and are operable by devices such as mouthsticks.  6.2 Universal control interface (1A, 2A, 3A)   The user interface allows control by all users including, for example, those who can only access the device with a breath switch and those who require an interface in a language other than English. Users with other types of interface requirements will be accommodated.  6.3 No need to use visual display to operate device (1A, 2A, 3A)   The user interface does not require the ability to view a visual display. All interaction by the user can be done via audible feedback with input by physical controls/audio input/keyboard.  6.4 Single button control (1 button at a time) (1A, 2A, 3A)   The pressing of multiple keys simultaneously is not required; if a ""shift"" function is used, it must operate in a ""sticky"" or sequential manner where the first key is released before the second key is pressed.  6.5 Immediate interruption of audio messages when any key is pressed (1A, 2A, 3A)   While an audio message is playing, the pressing of any other key will stop the playing of the message immediately and the playing of any new message (or the document) will begin.  6.6 Multiple user-defined default profiles (2B, 3B)   Several user-defined configuration profiles can be created, stored, and retrieved for a variety of reading configurations.  6.7 User preferences non-volatile (1C, 2B, 3B)   Stored user preferences are saved in such a manner so that they are retained when the machine loses power or is turned off.  6.8 Reset to known state, factory or user-defined (1A, 2A, 3A)   A software/hardware reset by the user is possible so the device can be returned to a previously known state (to factory default settings or a previous user-defined configuration profile).  6.9 Cancel/Undo features (2B, 3B)   ""Cancel"" is used for commands that are in process and have not yet been executed. For example, if the user presses the ""Go To"" button but then decides not to complete the command (i.e., enter the page number, etc.), he would use the ""cancel"" feature. The ""undo"" command returns the user to the point or status before a command was executed. For example, using the ""undo"" feature after setting a bookmark would remove that bookmark.  6.10 Continuous long play without intervention (1A, 2A, 3A)   The device has the ability to play continuously on AC power, without user intervention, the full contents of a document (e.g., book or magazine) up to the full capacity of the storage/delivery medium utilized.  6.11 Sleeping user detector (1C, 2C)   The interface includes a detector that can determine when the user has fallen asleep and automatically turn off the machine.  6.12 Locator device (1C, 2C)   The device can be located audibly by an external means such as a remote control or a hand clap.  ( Back to Contents )    7. Document Navigation   7.1 Start and stop (1A, 2A, 3A)   The machine/output can be started/stopped easily.  7.2 Instant stop/start (1A, 2A, 3A)   Playback can be stopped/started instantly by the user. The device can be stopped and then restarted and no audio material will be missed.  7.3 Multiple levels of granularity -- document accessible at fine level of detail (2A, 3A)   Document can be accessed at various levels of definition such as by paragraph, by sentence, or by word, depending upon user needs.  7.4 Useable table of contents/index (1A, 2A, 3A)   User can access the table of contents/index from any point in the book and select an entry for immediate access. Links from table of contents lead to the item selected. Links from index lead to the top of the page selected.  7.5 Easy skips (defined by document) (1A, 2A, 3A)   User can skip through the document by segments defined by document elements such as chapters, pages, paragraphs, etc. In this mode, the user moves through the elements sequentially, rather than jumping directly to a specific target.  7.6 Ability to move directly to a specific target   7.6.1  User can easily jump directly to a specific point in the document such as page 56 or chapter 12. The user selects or enters the name of the target and then initiates the jump. (2B, 3A)  7.6.2  User can jump directly to a location identified in the document as a target (for example a cross-reference). The user encounters a cross-reference, for example, ""See Appendix 5,"" and activates the link to that location. When a user prompts the device to follow a link, the device launches the nearest previous link. This allows a user to activate a link even if he has not reacted immediately after being notified of the link. See section 7 of Text Navigation Features List (1A, 2A, 3A)   7.7 Cross-Reference notification   7.7.1  The user has the option of being notified via an audible signal when a cross-reference is encountered. Default for device 1 is to disable the audio signal; for devices 2 and 3 default is to enable it. (1C, 2A, 3A)  7.7.2  User may choose among several audible indicators. (2A, 3A)   7.8 Internal and external cross-reference targets   7.8.1  The user can query the player as to whether a link leads to an internal or external target, since the decision to follow a link may depend on the target's location. (2A, 3A)  7.8.2  The user can ask for the current state of the player, so if the device is sitting quietly after an external link has been activated, the user can determine what action to take, if any. (2A, 3A)  7.8.3  If the user feels too much time has elapsed after activating a link to an external target, he or she can cancel the request without causing the system to crash. If the user needs to take some action, the player will prompt him or her. (2A, 3A)  7.8.4  The device can continue to play while retrieving external resources. (2B, 3B)   7.9 Navigation Control Center (1A, 2A, 3A)   Device includes a Navigation Control Center which allows the user to easily obtain an overview of the structure of the book and provides a convenient means for navigating through it. See sections 5 and 5.1 of the Text Navigation Features List.  7.10 Ability to retrace steps (1A, 2A, 3A)   Device maintains a ""history"" file of the locations the user has passed through when moving through the document in discrete steps (e.g., as described in 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6 above). The user can move backwards and forwards through that list of locations.  7.11 Easy repeats, skips (user-defined, time-based) (2C, 3C)   User can skip through the document by time intervals set by the user.  7.12 Ability to skip over user-selected text elements (2B, 3B)   Various elements of the document such as page numbers, footnotes, picture captions, tables, sidebars, and production notes (material added by the talking book producer) can be skipped by the user. For example, the configuration profile can be set to specify that optional production notes should be skipped (required production notes cannot be skipped).  7.13 Ability to manage notes (2A, 3A)   Footnotes can be managed in a variety of ways. The user can set her configuration profile so that:     footnote references and the footnotes themselves are automatically played in full,     footnote references are played but the footnotes are not unless the user chooses to hear one, or     footnote references and footnotes are skipped.     7.14 Reading of notes (1A, 2A, 3A)   At any time during the reading of a note, the user shall be able to interrupt the reading and return to the point in the text immediately following the note reference.  7.15 Setting and Labeling Bookmarks   7.15.1  User can set one or more bookmarks for later access. Bookmarks are saved even when machine is turned off and are deleted only upon user initiation. The device accommodates at least 100 simple bookmarks (those that simply mark a point but do not label it). (This limit does not apply to the type 3 device, where the capacity of the hard drive would set the limit.) (1A, 2A)  7.15.2  User can tag bookmarks with text or voice labels. The same label can be assigned to multiple bookmarks to create a set of related bookmarks. The user can browse through all existing bookmarks. (See section 9 of Text Navigation Features List.)  The device has sufficient capacity to store the following volume of voice-labeled bookmarks at telephone quality (8KHz sample rate, 8-bit samples):  15 minutes (2A)  30 minutes (2B)  60 minutes (2C)  (This limit does not apply to the type 3 device, where the capacity of the hard drive would set the limit.)  7.16 Automatic bookmark at stop - ability to bypass (1A, 2A, 3A)   If selected by the user, the software will automatically place a bookmark at the point in the playback where the user stops. The user can choose to bypass this feature.  7.17 Separate sets of bookmarks stored for each book (1A, 2A, 3A)   For example, if the user has four different books in process, the device maintains four separate sets of bookmarks.  7.18 Ability to name and export bookmarks (2B, 3B)   A user may need to move bookmarks from one machine to another if one is being returned for maintenance, or may wish to share his list of bookmarks with others reading the same book. Bookmarks shall follow NISO standard X?X to unsure interoperability among playback devices.  7.19 Ability to add information (highlighting and notes) (2B, 3A)   User can highlight portions of text, assigning text or voice labels, or more lengthy notes, to each marked section. The user can browse through a list of the full set of highlighted sections and then jump directly to a chosen portion. When the user is re-reading the document, an audible indicator should identify highlighted portions. As with cross-references, user options include enable (default), disable, and a choice among several audible indicators. The user should also be able to learn what label, if any, was attached to the highlighted section. (See section 10 or Text Navigation Features List.)  7.20 Ability to mark text for later access or export (2C, 3A)   Text can be marked/exported for later use (scrapbook, citations; i.e., a clipboard function that can be appended or overwritten). Limitations on the amount of text that may be exported will be set to meet copyright requirements.  7.21 Current location (possibly including time remaining to end of book (1B, 2B, 3B)   User can obtain information about current location in book relative to the entire book such as ""n% read, n% remaining"" or ""n hours remaining,"" and logical location such as ""chapter 5, page 129, paragraph 3"".  7.22 Spell words (2A, 3A)   Words can be spelled upon user request; spelling can also be done by phonetic alphabet (alpha, bravo, Charlie, etc.).  7.23 Search by words, groupings of words (3B)   Text file can be searched by word/groups of words as input by the user.  7.24 Quick and easy access to multiple books (1A, 2A, 3A)   The interface allows the user to quickly access other documents, e.g., the user should be able to switch from one book to another quickly whether the book is a physical medium or has been/is being retrieved electronically. Documents can be switched easily with all user settings for the new document intact.  7.25 Multiple source capability (2C,3C)   A variety of media/data sources can be accessed such as different physical media, a network stream, cable, and satellite.  7.26 Multiple users on 1 book simultaneously (2A/B, 3A/B)   Playback medium can be configured so that more than one user can access the book without disrupting settings set by previous users.  7.27 Automatic threading (follow story or article to completion) (1A, 2B, 3B)   Complicated document format can be followed in a logical order.  7.28 Multiple modes for accessing tables (2A, 3A)   The user can choose among a variety of ways in which a table can be read -- for example, by row, by column, or by specific cell. (See section 15 of Text Navigation Features List.)  7.29 Reading nested lists (???)   The user can invoke a function that assists with the comprehension of the layout of nested lists, specifically, the level at which a given items falls within the list. (See section 16 of Text Navigation Features List.)  7.30 Ability to identify text attributes (subscript, superscript, underlined, bold, etc.) (ASTER-like) (3A)   Text attributes can be easily accessed and displayed upon user request. The function can be enable/disabled by the user.  7.31 Key information software -- searches document for key features (2C, 3C)   Software such as ""Speech Skimmer"" identifies most important elements in a document.  7.32 Fast forward and fast reverse (1A, 2A, 3A)   Controls allow user to move forwards or backwards through the text at 5 to 20 times normal speed, with audible feedback (""chatter,"" tones, or spoken cues) providing information on the structure of the document. See section 2 of Text Navigation Features List.  ( Back to Contents )    8. Help Functions   8.1 Key identifier (1B/C, 2A, 3A)   Buttons identify themselves when pressed. This function can be enabled/disabled by the user.  8.2 Confirmation messages (""earcons"") (1A, 2A, 3A)   Spoken messages confirm user's action, e.g. system says ""play"" when ""play"" key is pressed. ""Verbosity level"" (how frequently the system speaks) is configurable by the user. (2B, 3B) (There are at least two dimensions for varying verbosity: 1. What percent of the controls are audibly confirmed? An experienced user might want only one or two important actions confirmed; a novice might want all confirmed. 2. How extensive is the confirmation message? Might experienced users need only a single word, e.g., ""contents,"" while novices need a more extensive explanation such as ""move to table of contents""?)  8.3 Audible error feedback (1A, 2A, 3A)   Tones or spoken messages are generated when user attempts an invalid function, e.g. pressing the ""move forward"" key when already at the end of the document. Configurable/queryable. One configuration might involve the use of a tone to indicate an error, with a spoken message following if invoked by the user.  8.4 ""Drill down capability"" (Tell me where I am.) (1B, 2B, 3B)   More button presses provide more detailed information. For example, multiple presses might elicit location information such as title, chapter, page, etc.  8.5 Help functions   Basic help functions (1B)  Rich set of context-sensitive helps (2B, 3B)  8.6 Summary Information   User can query the device and obtain a quick overview of the document (e.g., 563 pages, 9 hours of play, 4 levels of heading, 2 parts, 12 chapters, 5 tables). Information is dynamic and can be tailored to the contents of the user's current location (e.g., chapter 11). (See section 20 of Text Navigation Features List.)  8.7 Optional reminders (e.g., book overdue) (1B, 2B, 3B)   Capability exists for lending agency to add audible reminders to documents distributed to users.  ( Back to Contents )    9. File/Stream Format   9.1 Rich source base/file (able to produce various production outputs) (1A, 2A, 3A)   The original document file contains as much information as possible so that the variety of outputs possible is maximized.  9.2 Human and electronic speech must be available; but both are not required to play book (1A, 2A, 3A)   Although the system is designed for the linking of electronic text and narrated audio, a document can be played even when one of these modalities is not included.  9.3 Functionality transferable to other devices (platform independent) (3B)   The software-based playback system must be useable on several types of computers.  9.4 Functionality based on source (e.g. presentation software comes with book) (1C, 2C, 3C)   A digital talking book includes some or all of the software needed to play it; perhaps the behavior of the player can be modified or updated with software that accompanies the document.  ( Back to Contents )    10. Compatibility   10.1 Compatible with commercial books (1B, 2B, 3B)   The device or software can play audio/electronic books which were not produced specifically for use by blind or physically handicapped persons.  10.2 Can play music (1C, 2C, 3C)   ( Back to Contents )    11. Multilingual Functions   11.1 Multi-lingual message capability (1B, 2B, 3B)   Control messages such as key identification, confirmation, error feedback, etc. can be rendered in multiple languages.  11.2 Multi-lingual text to speech (2C, 3C)   Text files can be translated into synthetic speech in multiple languages.  ( Back to Contents )    12. Presentation Functions   12.1 Text file can be read via a connected braille display. (2A, 3A)   12.2 Text file can be displayed through link to video monitor. (2B, 3B)   12.3 Characteristics of visually-displayed information can be controlled (color, size, zoom, contrast, font, spacing, background, etc.) (3B)   12.4 Visual elements can be presented in alternative formats   Speech (1A, 2A, 3A)  Others (2B, 3B)    ( Back to Contents )    13.

If 24-hour traffic counts are available, it's relatively easy to find the traffic volume associated with the noisiest hour. The noise analyst can then take noise samples before, during, and after the peak traffic hours, and determine the actual noisiest hour at a site near the highway. The noisiest hour obtained in this manner will be suitable for all other sites.   Some sound level meters have data logging capabilities that allow the collection of hourly noise levels over a 24-hour period or multiple 24-hour periods. This type of meter can be left out for one or more days to confirm when the noisiest hour occurs. Ideally, the meter should be left out for several days so that daily consistency in the data can be observed. It's important to recognize that an unattended meter will measure noise from all events in the area, including events that are not related to traffic. If the meter is kept in the same location for several days at a location close the highway, the daily consistency of the data can be observed. If the data is consistent, the likelihood of contamination from non-traffic sources is low."

Download Macromedia Flash Player                   Additional Details      The latest release of the Macromedia Player is now at version 6.0. If you already  have 5.0 installed, there is no need to upgrade. The reason they released an upgrade  is that their new product (Flash MX) has the ability to integrate video. At this  point, we are not developing with this technology, so you will not need the latest  player. The majority of browsers released now have support for flash built in.

NLS/BPH distributes its talking books on standard audio    cassettes designed to play at half commercial speed and using four tracks. The    NLS configuration can pack up to six hours of reading time onto one cassette.    The C-1 side- and speed-selector switches enable readers to play cassettes created    with the standard, commercial configuration as well as the NLS talking-book    configuration. The C-1 player is shipped with a fully charged, rechargeable    nickel-cadmium battery that will operate the player for about six hours after    being fully charged. Simply plug the player into a standard household outlet to recharge it. Remember, you can always call your library about using    the NLS/BPH player.   Using the Standard Cassette Player   You can operate the C-1 on its battery, or you can take the power cord from    the recessed area in the back of the player and plug it into an electrical outlet.    Here is a typical sequence for reading an NLS cassette talking book.       Open the tape compartment door by pressing the eject key, far right and        marked with a raised square.     Insert the cassette, label side up, with the tape edge facing out. Seat        the cassette by pushing it back until it clicks. Press the compartment door        down until it clicks.     Press and lock down the play key (green with a raised circle) to start        the player. Adjust the volume slide switch (nearest the front edge of the        player).     Stop the player at any point by pressing the red key with a raised ""x"",        first on the left.     To review the cassette soundtrack, press rewind, the key between play and        stop with the raised less-than sign, or arrow head pointing left.     To advance the cassette soundtrack, press fast forward, the key between        play and eject with the raised greater-than sign, or arrow head pointing        right.     To remove a cassette from the player, make sure it is stopped. Press the        eject key, far right with a raised square. The tape compartment door will        snap up, and the tape will pop free of its seated position. To play the        next side, turn the tape over (print/braille label down), reinsert, seat        in the door, and press the door shut. Then press the start key. After reading        sides 1 and 2, rock the side selector switch to the right to listen to sides        3 and 4.      Tips   Switches and Buttons   Speed, volume, tone and side-selector switches are on the right of the player.    Begin at the top of these controls, in the middle of the player as you face    it, and you will find the following:    Variable Speed Control   Used to slow down or speed up the reading of the book. The voice    of the narrator becomes distorted as the playback speed is changed.   Speed   A different sort of speed switch is just under the variable    speed control. This is the speed switch that is used to match the speed of the    player with the recording speed on the cassette. It is a rocker switch. Press,    or rock it down, to the left (15/16) for our talking books. Press, or rock it    down, to the right for commercial cassettes.   Side-Selector Switch   Another rocker switch, the side-selector switch enables readers    to listen to both commercial and talking-book cassettes. Here are the things    you should know about talking-book cassettes before you use the side-selector    switch:       Talking-book cassettes will appear to be oddly numbered because of the        four-side (or, four-track) system. The first side of the first cassette        will be 1. The first side of the next cassette will be 5. Then, 9 and so        on.     Turn the cassette over after each side.     When starting with side 1, push the side selector switch down to the left,        marked 1-2.  Do not change the switch to listen to side        2.  Push the side-selector switch down to the right for sides 3 and        4. It is important to be methodical about the use of the side switch, or        you may find yourself skipping whole segments of the book.     As guidance, the narrator will provide instructions at the end of each        side.     Tone Control   This slider switch raises (to the right) or lowers (to the left)    the pitch of the narrator's voice.   Volume control   The volume control is also a slider. Louder to the right, softer    to the left.   Battery Maintenance   To maintain battery life, the player should be played frequently unplugged,    on battery. After several hours, up to six or until the battery fails, plug    the player back into an electrical outlet to charge the battery. The player    will operate, plugged in, while the battery recharges.   Do not remove the battery.  As a nickel-cadmium product,    it is toxic if not disposed of properly. If you suspect the player will not    work because of battery problems, call the library serving you. They will arrange    for a replacement player.

If you have trouble using multimedia, this section will provide some suggestions on how to improve your reception and use this technology that is rapidly becoming central to the whole Internet.    To receive multimedia streaming, you need two types of software: a browser and a streaming media player. The fact that you can view this text means that you have a browser. Most of the new browsers support multimedia streaming. But if you have an older version, you may need to upgrade your browser to one that supports multimedia streaming. The most popular browsers are Microsoft’s Explorer and Netscape. Which one you use, however, is a matter of personal taste. The important thing is to have a browser that will support multimedia. If you have browser versions older than Internet Explorer 5.0 or Netscape 4.7, you’ll have trouble receiving certain streaming media—especially with Netscape.  Installing a browser is easy and free.   To install the latest version of the Microsoft browser, click here . To install the latest version of the   Netscape browser, click here .    Let’s Now Focus on the Media Player     A media player is another piece of software that helps you run multimedia. If you have a new computer, odds are that your machine came with a media player installed. If you don’t have one installed, however, we’ll tell you how to install one on your computer. If you have an older machine, we recommend that you update your media player to a newer version. The latest media players are much better in terms of ease of use and quality of picture and sound. We strongly advise that you download the latest version of Microsoft Media Player (Media Player 7).   Click here to download it . It is free.    For additional help to properly install Windows Media Player, click here .    Some people have installed the Real Audio Media Player (sometimes it is called Real Video). Keep in mind that while the latest browsers are, for the most part, interchangeable because they follow the same standards, streaming media players have different and incompatible operational standards. This means to view streaming video from a Web area, you need to use a media player that is compatible with the streaming media being offered on the Web site.   We stream from our servers using the Microsoft format. In order to receive PREVLINE multimedia, you must have a Microsoft Media Player installed on your computer.       Some Web sites serve multimedia in the real audio format, which was the first of the effective streaming formats. Perhaps you or someone else downloaded and installed the Real Audio format media player and disconnected the Microsoft Media Player. If so,   re-install the Microsoft Media Player by clicking here . You do not need to uninstall your Real Player. The two can co-exist on your computer.  Some computers have other media players, such as the Yamaha Media Player. Some of these media players do a wonderful job of playing CD-ROMS. If you have a specialized media player, it might have been designed for playing media on your computer but not for streaming media that comes over the Web. So, you’ll need to install a media player that will support Web-based media.    Wires   As silly as it seems, a large number of users find that they don’t get decent reception of streaming media because they have loose wires or the wires are not plugged into the sockets. Check the wires from your speakers to your computer to ensure there is a solid connection. If you get a crackly sound or no sound at all, a loose wire may be the problem.    Turn Up the Volume    One of the most common problems people have with multimedia is that the sound doesn’t work. When you consider that there are a number of controls from which you can adjust sound levels on a computer, it’s no wonder that people have trouble with their sound. For example, if you don’t hear sound when you run multimedia, the culprit could be your speakers. Most speakers have volume controls on the front of one or two speakers. If you don’t have any sound, check the speaker controls. Some speakers have an on/off switch—make sure the speakers are switched to “on.” Next, check that the volume control is set high enough to hear sound.  If your speakers aren’t the problem, next check the volume adjustment that is part of your operating software on your computer desktop. Look on the lower right hand corner of your basic desktop Windows screen. You should see a little icon for a speaker. If you click on this icon, a sound control panel will appear with a slide control. With your mouse, slide the volume control to about the middle (you can adjust it later to be louder or softer to suit your needs).  On this same window, notice that there is a box called “mute.”  Make sure this box is not checked. If this box is checked, you won’t hear any sound no matter how high you have the volume set on other controls. (Some people prefer not to have sounds playing on their computer while they work, so they check this box and uncheck it when they want to hear sound.)   If you do not see the speaker icon on your desktop, you have to access the sound control panel through the control panel. Click on “My Computer” then click on the “control panel.” There you will find an icon for speakers. Click on that icon and then go through the steps we just mentioned and adjust the sound to about mid-range. In this window, there is a box that, when checked, allows you to show the speaker icon on the lower right hand corner of your screen. We recommend checking this box so that you can easily access the volume control panel.  A few computers have elaborate sound cards, which have their own sets of controls that go far beyond just volume but have multiple settings that allow you to adjust for such things as treble and bass. If these settings are all in the lowest position, adjust them at mid-range for an initial setting. Again, you can adjust them to meet your needs after you have determined that you can get sound when you run a multimedia program.     Hardware    If you get the video portion but no sound, the problem might be a lack of hardware. Your computer may not have a sound card or speakers (the little speaker installed inside your computer may not be sufficient to handle the demands of multimedia). If you don’t have external speakers, your speakers may be built into the monitor—the volume controls may be on your monitor.  You could have speakers but no sound card (although it is highly unlikely). If you don’t have speakers, you should check to see if you have a sound card. If you do, all you need is speakers. If you don’t have a sound card, you will need to purchase one and have it installed.    Pick-ups and Synchronization   Another problem that sometimes occurs is that the sound or video (or both) “hiccups” and skips or jumps ahead. Sometimes the synchronization of the sound and the video is off. These difficulties are most related to the capacity of your computer and your Internet connection.  If you have a poor Internet connection and packets of sound are coming through, the Internet system will resend the packet. Sometimes the packet will be sent two or three times and computer software that recognizes such conditions simply jumps ahead and picks up the good signal. When this happens, sometimes the sound hiccups. Sometimes a signal cannot come in as fast as it should to function in real time and that causes hiccups. If you have an older 28.8 modem (or less) you will get hiccups and there is not much that you can do to improve the connection. We suggest that you upgrade to a 58.8 modem (which is twice as fast as a 28.8 modem). Even with a 58.8 modem you can have problems if your computer is busy running other programs. For example, if you are running your e-mail program and your word processor program, it may be too much for your computer’s processor to also run multimedia without hiccups and poor synchronization. If this is the case, you can improve the situation by closing all applications except your browser and your media player. If the problem still persists, you might have to correct the problem by adding more memory to your computer.     Of course, you will always get much better multimedia reception if you have a higher speed Internet connection. If you do a lot of Web surfing, you might consider upgrading your connection speed to a DSL or cable modem—both are hundreds of times faster than a telephone dial-up modem.     Wait for the Buffering   A common complaint among new multimedia Web users is that once the media player opens nothing happens. People often assume something is wrong with the system. Actually, a short delay of 20 or 30 seconds is normal. During this delay, your computer begins to collect the information from the connection it has made with another server and stores a modest amount in memory. Once a packet of information is received, your computer begins to display what it has stored. This process is called buffering. While your computer is playing the first packet of information it received, it continues to receive more information and store it in memory until it is time for it to be played. The faster your Internet connection, the less time will be required for this initial buffering.                                    Research    |      Initiatives    |      Funding    |      Regional Information (RADAR Network)    |      Home                                                                                                                                                                              (800) 729-6686 or  webmaster@health.org                                    About Us  |  Privacy  |  Accessibility  |  Site Map  |  Awards

GX009-72-15942345	"GFDL Scientific Visualization Guide   Animation Programs         GIFMerge   DESCRIPTION             GIFMerge  is a program for assembling a number of GIF images     into a  GIF89a      animation file usually for direct display on WWW pages.  It allows the     specification of inter-frame timing for precise control over how long each     frame is shown when played back.  It also has the ability to specifiy one     of the colors as being ""transparent"" so that backgrounds can     show through that color when the animation is on a WWW page.  The     transparent color is specified with its RGB components and if the actual     one isn't found then the closest is chosen.        PLUSES             Precise inter-frame timing control.        MINUSES             Cannot specify a transparent color with an index number; try          WhirlGIF  instead.      Cannot input GIF files using the GIF89a format, only the older GIF87a         format.  In order to find out the type of a GIF file just load it into                    XV  and press the "" I "" key to bring         up the image information window.        HOW TO INVOKE            Here is an example of 6 GIF files                                         assembled into a looping animation                  gifmerge -50 -l0 die1.gif die2.gif  \    die3.gif die4.gif die5.gif die6.gif > die_anim.gif            The "" -50 "" option specifies a 1/2 (or 50/100) second delay     between images and the "" -l0 "" option specifies that the     animation should loop infinitely when on a WWW page.  If the     "" -l "" is not specified at all then Netscape will play the     animation only once.        HINTS            Also see  WhirlGIF  listed below.        DOCUMENTATION             Official  GIFMerge           WWW page               makemovie (IRIX only)   DESCRIPTION             makemovie  is part of SGI's Media Tools and is basically     a command-line version of  Movie Maker  with a subset of     its options.   makemovie  allows specification of the     compression scheme, looping, framerate, and frame size of the movie.        PLUSES             Convenient for creating movies in batch mode.        MINUSES             Cannot directly create a QuickTime animation, but can convert         one to an SGI movie.        HOW TO INVOKE             Example of creating an SGI movie with MVC2 compression designed to         play at 5 fps:          makemovie -o sample.mv -c mvc2 -r 5 frame*.rgb         HINTS            See  Movie Maker  to further edit the movie and      Movie Player  to play it back.        DOCUMENTATION             man page               Movie Maker       DESCRIPTION             Movie Maker  is part of SGI's Media Tools and is an     interactive animation editor.  A file browser lets you select images and     insert them into a ""filmstrip"" window which contains thumbnail     versions of all the frames in the animation.  You can later rearrange them     from this window as desired.   Movie Maker  can import and     export QuickTime animations as well as SGI movies.  There is also a     preview option to see the work in progress.        PLUSES             Very easy to use!        MINUSES             No support for other animation formats such as MPEG.      May not be able to import certain QuickTime files with unsupported         compression schemes.        HOW TO INVOKE             To start  Movie Maker  by itself just enter:          moviemaker       and select an animation from the file browser, or start it with a         file:          moviemaker sample.mv         HINTS             Movies are edited in place so any changes that are made immediately         affect the current animation file.  Therefore, it is a good idea to         create a backup file whenever possible.      Movie Maker  claims to export SGI movie files with RLE         compression and QuickTime files with RPZA compression, but that's not         the case since an error appears if either of them are chosen.        DOCUMENTATION             man page       On-line manuals in the IRIS InSight Library              Movie Player       DESCRIPTION             Movie Player  is part of SGI's Media Tools and is a program     for playing animations in the SGI movie and QuickTime formats.  The     control panel has buttons and menus for things such as single stepping     forward/backward, playing forward/backward, playing fast forward/reverse,     jumping to a particular frame, looping, scaling the animation up/down,     half/normal/double speed, and volume adjustment (accessible with the     middle mouse button in the animation window).        PLUSES             Comprehensive control panel.      Usually good playback speed.        MINUSES             It can only play SGI movies and QuickTime animations.      Cannot deal with some QuickTime compression schemes.        HOW TO INVOKE             To start  Movie Player  by itself just enter:          movieplayer       and select an animation from the file browser, or start it with a         file:          movieplayer sample.mv         HINTS             Movie Player  will skip images if it cannot decode the     animation fast enough to meet the frame rate specified in the animation     file.  This can happen if the image size is very large or if it's     playing on a slow machine.  In order to guarantee that every frame is     always shown, select the ""Play Every Frame"" item from the     ""Options"" menu.  This will override the animation's default     frame rate and play it as fast as possible without skipping any frames.        DOCUMENTATION             man page       On-line manuals in the IRIS InSight Library              mpeg_play       DESCRIPTION             mpeg_play  is a basic MPEG player with a few GUI controls.     An animation can only really move forwards by either single-frame stepping     or continuous playing with optional looping.  Although, there is a rewind     button to jump back to the first frame.        PLUSES             It's easy to use!        MINUSES             Playback can be uneven, depending on the amount of decoding required         to go from one frame to the next.      No reverse-play or ""swing"" options, zoom, or speed controls.        HOW TO INVOKE             To start  mpeg_play  just enter:          mpeg_play -dither color file.mpg       The "" -dither color "" option simply tells the program         to use 24-bit mode for displaying the animation rather than the         default 8-bit mode.  This should always be specified to avoid         unnecessary color dithering.        HINTS            For more even playback and robust controls, try  glmpeg_play      using the ""buffer to disk"" option.        DOCUMENTATION             man page               ppm2fli   DESCRIPTION             ppm2fli  is a program for assembling a number of images into     an  FLI/FLC      animation file.  This program only directly works with images in the     ""PPM"" format, but provides a filter capability so that any other     image format may be used as well.   ppm2fli  assumes an output     size of 640x480 unless told otherwise on the command-line so it will not     automatically make the animation the size of the first input image as     many other programs do.  It is also not possible to specify the input     images directly on the command-line.  Instead, they must be listed in a     text file with each file on a separate line.   ppm2fli  has     many other options for control over the output animation such as playback     speed, color quantization (24-bit to 8-bit; note again that FLI/FLC only     supports up to 256 colors), etc.        PLUSES             Usually does a very good job converting 24-bit source images down to         its 8-bit format.        MINUSES             Somewhat cumbersome command-line invocation.        HOW TO INVOKE            Here is an example of creating an FLC animation from all the GIF     images listed in a text file called "" pics.list "".            ppm2fli -g 376x349 -s 200 -f giftopnm pics.list sample.flc            The "" -g "" option forces the animation to be specific     dimensions, such as of the source images.  The "" -s ""     option indicates that the animation should play back at 5fps (specified in     1/1000 second delays).  The "" -f "" option specifies the     filter program that converts the source images (in this case GIF files) to     the PPM format that  ppm2fli  can understand.        HINTS             If the source images contain a large number of colors (e.g. >256         for all of them) then  ppm2fli  can be instructed to         better optimize the color table in the output animation at the         expense of somewhat longer processing time.  The highest quality is         achieved with this option:          -Qn 2048       To easily find out the dimensions of a source image use either          ImageMagick 's          identify          or SGI's (IRIX-only)          imginfo .      Add the "" -N "" option to the command-line in order to         produce an animation that can play backwards properly with          XAnim .  This option makes the animation somewhat larger         since extra frame-to-frame information has to be included.  When          XAnim  tries to play an FLI/FLC in reverse without this         extra information, remnants of old images are sometimes left on the         screen when going from frame to frame.      ppm2fli  can create an old format FLI file rather than         the newer (default format) FLC with the "" -O "" option.         This is for compatibility with older animation players (usually         PC-based) and should probably be avoided if at all possible.      You can quickly generate a text file containing all the images for an         animation with a line such as the following:          ls -1 *.rgb > pics.list         DOCUMENTATION             man page       Official  ppm2fli           WWW page                TkAniMaker       DESCRIPTION             TkAniMaker  is a tool for sequencing a series of SGI RGB     images into an animation.  The primary animation destination is videotape     using the ""video"" machine in the main computer room.      TkAniMaker  automatically manages the images' time codes and     executes the appropriate commands. The process is now as simple as     selecting some images and how long they should be visible.           Besides videotape animations,  TkAniMaker  also has     ""preview"" options for creating (and playing back) SGI movie and     MPEG animation files. They give an approximation of how the videotape     animation will look.   TkAniMaker  can also serve as just an     SGI movie / MPEG animation creator ignoring the videotape functions.  In     addition, everything done by  TkAniMaker  can be saved as a     script for later use, meaning an animation is completely reproducible.        PLUSES             Extensive help pages.      Entirely GUI driven for ease of use.        MINUSES             All the images must be in the same directory.  This is a limitation of         the  mpeg_encode  program which is called by          TkAniMaker .      Cannot prematurely abort the creation of videotape, SGI movie, or MPEG         animations except by aborting  TkAniMaker .  This         capability will be added in the next release...      Can only resize/scale images when making SGI movies or MPEG         animations, but not for videotape animations.  This capability will be         added in the next release...      Only runs on an IRIX-based SGI machine.        HOW TO INVOKE             TkAniMaker  uses the Tcl/Tk libraries and various external     programs that it finds through environment variables.  These variables can     be set and the program run with a compact command-line invocation such as:            /home/hnv/pub/irix/anim/tkanimaker               HINTS            Send e-mail to the author's address at the bottom of the page regarding     any comments or suggestions for improvement.              DOCUMENTATION             On-line help pages              WhirlGIF   DESCRIPTION             WhirlGIF  is a program for assembling a number of GIF images     into a  GIF89a      animation file usually for direct display on WWW pages.  It allows the     specification of inter-frame timing for precise control over how long each     frame is shown when played back.  It also has the ability to specifiy one     of the colors as being ""transparent"" so that backgrounds can     show through that color when the animation is on a WWW page.  The     transparent color is specified as an index number (0-255; the background     color is frequently 0) or with the actual RGB components.        PLUSES             Precise inter-frame timing control.        MINUSES            Cannot input GIF files using the GIF89a format, only the older GIF87a     format.  In order to find out the type of a GIF file just load it into            XV  and press the "" I "" key to bring up     the image information window.        HOW TO INVOKE            Here is an example of 7 GIF files                                               assembled into a looping animation                        whirlgif -trans #a7a7a7 -time 10 -loop 0 -o led_anim.gif  \    led1.gif led2.gif led3.gif led4.gif led5.gif led6.gif led7.gif  \    led6.gif led5.gif led4.gif led3.gif led2.gif                  The "" -trans #a7a7a7 "" option specifies what color should     be considered as transparent.  The "" -time 10 "" option     specifies a 1/10 (or 10/100) second delay between images.  The     "" -loop 0 "" option specifies that the animation should loop     infinitely when on a WWW page.  If the "" -loop "" is not     specified at all then Netscape will play the animation only once.     Finally, the "" -o "" option specifies the name of the output     animation.        HINTS            Also see  GIFMerge  listed above.        DOCUMENTATION             man page       Official  WhilrGIF           WWW page               XAnim     DESCRIPTION             XAnim  is a very popular animation player for Unix     workstations.  It handles just about every animation format you would     ever encounter.  There are many options for playing an animation which     are all available from a separate GUI control panel.  The control panel     has buttons for single stepping forward/backward, playing forward/backward     jumping to the first/last frame, plus speed and volume adjustment.  Dozens     of other options are also available as command-line switches.        PLUSES             Large variety of supported formats.      Has audio capability for animations with a sound track.        MINUSES             The GUI control panel could be a little more intuitive.  For example,         the ""-"" and ""+"" buttons actually change the delay         between images and so the ""-"" makes the animation play         faster rather than slower as you would guess.      Doesn't support some of the newer audio and/or video codecs (i.e.     compression and decompression algorithms) such as Sorenson.        HOW TO INVOKE             To play an animation just enter:          xanim file.qt       or with with audio output enabled:          xanim +Ae file.qt         HINTS            When enabling audio output, you should also set the initial audio volume     with the "" +Av x "" option where  x  ranges from     0 to 100.  A low setting of 1 is good.  Some animations may specify a very     high audio volume so when playing them, sound may come blasting out of the     workstation's speaker with little warning.  KDE's  Sound Mixer      program (in the ""Multimedia"" menu of the K panel) also     influences the workstation's audio volume and it may inadvertently be set     to a high level.  Setting the initial volume prevents any surprises.  Once     the animation is playing, the volume can be adjusted with KDE's      Sound Mixer  or the vertical slider on  XAnim 's     control panel.

This is done by calculating the difference in noise levels produced by the traffic present at the time of the measurement and the noise level produced by traffic deemed to generate the highest noise level of the day. The model is presumed to correctly calculate the difference in noise levels from the difference in traffic characteristics. Current models do a good job in predicting relative differences in noise levels based on differences in traffic.  The adjustment steps shown in this slide are typical if the noisiest existing traffic characteristics are known, or can be estimated with confidence. Pertinent traffic conditions are the hourly volumes and average speeds for all the vehicle types that can be evaluated by the noise prediction model.  The adjustment method requires accurate traffic counts and average speed measurements for each vehicle type. As will be discussed later, it is not necessary to measure noise over a one-hour period to obtain a measurement representative of one hour. Because the prediction model calculates hourly noise levels on the basis of hourly traffic volumes, the traffic counted for a fraction of an hour coinciding with the noise measurement needs to be expanded to an hour. Thus, if noise and traffic are measured for 15 minutes, the traffic counts need to be multiplied by a factor of 4. The difference between the modeled noise level at the time of the noise measurement and the modeled noise level from the worst-noise-hour traffic is then applied to the measurement to obtain the worst-hour noise level. This method of obtaining the worst-hour noise level depends largely on the measurement, and to a lesser extent on the modeled results. The measured sound level that has been adjusted to correspond to the worst noise hour is called  the ""adjusted measurement""."

These effects were previously discussed in detail in the Fundamentals training module. The most common atmospheric phenomena that can change noise levels are temperature gradients, and variations in wind speed and wind direction. These phenomena can cause significant upward or downward refraction, or bending of sound waves through the atmosphere. Wind speeds over 5 meters per second, high and low humidity, and differences in temperature can affect microphone performance and measured sound levels.  Pertinent meteorological observations should always accompany noise measurements. These measurements can be made with simple handheld instruments or more sophisticated tripod-mounted instruments. Examples of these types of instruments are shown here.  At a minimum, meteorological equipment should be able to measure wind speed, temperature, and relative humidity. A compass can be used to measure wind direction. More sophisticated, but relatively inexpensive, instruments are also available. These instruments, which can also measure wind direction, can be connected to microprocessors that can log data and average the meteorological data over the time period that the noise measurements are taken."

Warm-up time of the meter and any accessories is typically at least one minute and usually specified by the manufacturers. Place the microphone in an upright position with the windscreen removed. With the microphone in an upright position, place the acoustical calibrator gently over the microphone. Be sure that the microphone is inserted all the way into the cavity. When activated, the calibrator emits a signal at a reference frequency and decibel level. Typically, the nominal reference decibel level is 94 dB or 114 dB. These numbers correspond with a relative pressure of 1 Pascal and 10 Pascal, respectively. The actual value is shown on the calibrator's calibration tag. The reference frequency is typically 1000 Hz. This frequency is convenient, because no adjustment needs to be made to A-weighted sound levels. Some calibrators offer choices of different frequencies. Since Caltrans routinely measures A-weighted noise levels, it is recommended that calibrations always be performed at 1000 Hz to avoid errors in adjustments from the linear calibration value to the A-weighted value on the sound level meter. After the calibrator is properly positioned over the microphone, allow the signal to stabilize before reading the calibrator value. The meter is adjusted to the calibrator value as necessary. Follow guidance in the meters  user manual to perform the adjustment."

In this table the first column shows the hour of the day, the second column displays the Leq for that hour, and the third column shows the difference between the worst-hour noise level and the noise level for each hour. In this case, the highest noise level of 71.5 dBA occurs at 9:00 am. The noise level from this hour serves as the reference point against which noise levels from the other hours are compared. For the 9:00 hour, no adjustment needs to be made -in other words, the adjustment is zero. Adjustments for all other hours can be calculated by subtracting each hour's noise level from the 9:00 hour noise level. With this table, a noise measurement that is not taken during the worst noise hour  can be adjusted to the highest hourly measurement by adding the adjustment to the measured noise level for that hour. This adjustment can be made at the 24-hour noise measurement position or at other noise measurement positions along the highway."

The purpose of a particular noise measurement will dictate how, when, and where the measurement should be performed.  A wide variety of instruments are available to perform noise measurements. Again, it is not the intent of this module to discuss specific brands of instruments. Rather, the instrumentation topic will cover generic classifications and elements common to all instruments. Likewise, noise measurements will be discussed in generic terms and won't include specific operating procedures for specific brands or types of equipment. Local atmospheric effects can have a profound influence on noise measurement results. Accordingly, a discussion of meteorological effects and constraints related to noise measurements will be provided. The selection of noise measurement locations depends on the purpose of the measurements. Topography and distance from the noise source influence noise exposure and must also be considered. These issues will  be discussed in the section on the selection of measurement positions. Finally, in order to adequately represent the time interval of interest of a fluctuating noise source, and to gain statistical confidence in the measurement results, a discussion of measurement times, duration, and number of repetitions will be provided."

In most cases, the meter is calibrated at the actual location of the measurement. At this time, the windscreen should be placed over the microphone, and the microphone should be oriented as directed in  the meter's user manual. Depending on the type of microphone and the source to be measured, microphones are either placed vertically pointing upwards, horizontally toward the source of interest, or at some angle between horizontal and vertical. The meters user manual will give guidance on the correct orientation. As mentioned earlier, Caltrans recommends that the microphone be placed at a height of 5 feet, or 1.5 meters, above the ground for routine noise measurements. Exceptions to this are special cases where the specific location of interest is at a different height.  Once the meter and microphone are correctly oriented, the various settings for desired noise descriptors, frequency weighting, and other appropriate functions should be selected.  The instrument is now ready to take measurements. Switch the meter from standby mode to sampling mode. Stand near the meter, but not between the source and microphone. Be ready to pause the sampling when noise from undesired sources have the potential to contaminate the measurement. Typically unwanted sources include sudden airplane or helicopter over flights, barking dogs, talking, or other activity near a microphone. If a curious pedestrian approaches to ask questions, either walk away from the meter or temporarily pause the meter. For highway noise measurements, traffic volumes should simultaneously be counted and classified by vehicle type. Average traffic speeds should be obtained either by radar or by a vehicle moving with the flow of traffic.  The minimum number of vehicle classifications consists of autos, medium trucks, and heavy trucks. Medium trucks have two axles and dual rear wheels. Heavy trucks have three or more axles. Meteorological observations should also be made during the measurements."

Some meters can be set to run for a certain time duration or a specific start and stop time. These meters will stop sampling automatically. Depending on the sophistication of the sound level meter system, the measured data is recorded by external instruments, internally stored, or displayed only. In the latter case, the data should be manually recorded on a data sheet. Even if the data is internally stored or recorded, it's good practice to write the displayed data down as a backup to recorded data. Auxiliary data, such as the traffic counts and meteorological data, should also be recorded. After the measurement has been completed, remember to perform the after-measurement calibration."

Only the vector component perpendicular to the highway is of interest. If this component blows from the highway to the receiver as shown, the wind vector component is positive by convention and is called a downwind component.  A wind vector component that blows from the receiver towards the highway is negative and is called an upwind component."

Noise levels at these sites can be obtained either by modeling or by measurement. Those receivers where the noise levels are measured are called ""noise measurement sites"". A noise measurement site is always considered a receiver, but a receiver is not always a noise measurement site. Receivers used in a noise analysis are carefully selected to be representative of areas of interest in the study area. These areas include noise-sensitive areas, areas where the greatest noise impacts are expected, and areas selected to represent  background noise conditions.  Typically, a noise study includes modeled receiver positions, as well as noise measurement sites. Noise measurement sites need to be selected more carefully than modeled receiver positions because a measurement site must be physically accessed, while a modeled receiver position is simply a point on a map. Sometimes a planned measurement site may be inaccessible or unsuitable. In that case, an alternate site is selected that is acoustically representative of the original planned site. There are three general classifications of noise measurement site selection. Sites are selected according to the purpose of the measurements, acoustical equivalence, and site geometry. These classifications will be discussed in detail in the following slides."

GX002-56-10804475	"Problems with audio?                                        W e       have recently changed the format we use for readings of our stories.       Many readers likely never noticed. For some it was a pleasant       change, including those readers who formerly couldn't listen       to the stories because their computer platform didn't support       the necessary proprietary player. For some of you, though, the       new format has presented an unpleasant bump in the information       highway. We're sorry if hit the bump, which is fairly likely       if you're reading this!          The simplest solution in most cases is to simply update       to the latest version of your current audio player.  Pretty       much every audio player out there now can play streaming MP3's       -- but this wasn't true even a couple of months ago. If you have       an older version, it may not handle the format correctly.          Below is a list of  Frequently Asked Questions  and their       answers.          How do I play the       story files?         How do I play other       audio?         With AOL 6.0, I get an error       when I try to listen to the story. What's wrong?         Why the change from Real format?         Where can I get more information       about MP3s?         Where can I find a free       MP3 player?                  How do I play the story files?          To play the audio files that accompany the stories, you need       a program that knows how to play MP3 audio files. You also need       a web browser, and an Internet connection, but if you're reading       the story or this page you must already have them. There are       several free players available for most computer platforms. Several       are listed below. If you don't have a player already installed,       you'll need to  download       one  and install it. Once installed, you can click on the       ""Listen to this story"" link, and the story will start       playing.          Your browser must know that a player program is available       to send the file to. This is normally taken care of during the       installation of the player. If the browser has forgotten or been       confused, reinstalling or updating the software will typically       fix the problem.          How do I play other audio?          Other audio on the site works just like playing the story       files. However, some of these links go to actual live streams.       Unlike the story files, which you can download and play later,       certain of these files are like a radio station that you tune       into. So don't try to download these before you listen! They'll       fill your whole disk and still not be through!          With AOL 6.0, I get an error when I try       to listen to the story. What's wrong?          AOL 6.0 includes the AOL Media Player, a subset of the functionality       of WinAmp, that is, well, broken. Our ""Listen to this story""       link takes you to a small playlist file that contains the address       of the actual MP3 file. The AOL Media Player doesn't understand       this convention. You have two choices.          1. Click on the ""Download the MP3 file"" link instead.        AOL Media Player will stream the file for you like the other       link should. You'll have to right-click this link and choose       ""Save Target as..."" is you want to actually save the       file.          2. Disable AOL Media Player and use another Media Player        To disable AOL Media Player, do the following:        Click on ""Settings"" in the AOL Toolbar.        Choose ""Preferences"" from the menu.        Click on the ""Multimedia"" link.        Uncheck ""Use AOL Media Player for supported file types""        Click ""Save""        If you already have another Media Player (WinAmp, Windows Media       Player, RealPlayer, etc.) installed, it should now work normally.       If not you can install one now, or update an older version.          Why the change from Real format?          Previously we provided story links and some other audio links in Real format.       While this was an effective audio format, it was proprietary and required all users to download        Real.com's RealPlayer to use. The MP3 format we're now using works just fine with the current versions       of RealPlayer, as well as with software that ships with almost all current computers, and with software       that is available for operating systems for which no RealPlayer existed.          Where can I get more information about       MP3s?          Here are some links to non-NASA websites that have information       and how-tos on listening to MP3 audio:  MP3.com ,        CMJ ,  Cajun       and Zydeco Radio Guide , and  MP3-It          * Disclaimer:       NASA makes no endorsement and offers no evaluation of any vendor's       products, whether listed here or not.

As with other baleen whales, fin whale sounds are primarily short (0.3 - 3 s), low frequency (20 - 100 Hz) vocalizations (Schevill and Watkins 1962, Watkins 1981, Cummings  et al.  1986, Watkins and Bird 1987, Edds 1988, Thompson  et al.  1992). The most common sounds produced by a fin whale is the so called ""20 Hz pulse"" that lasts approximately 1 s in duration and sweeps from 25-44 Hz down to 16-20 Hz. These pulses typically occur in pairs (""doublets"") or in patterns (pulse trains). There are geographical differences in the frequency sweep of fin whale 20 Hz calls; such differences may be useful in defining regional stocks (Thompson  et al.  1992).                 click for audio clip   speed: 10X / wav:237KB"

The whistles come in any of the following colors: red, blue, pink, orange, green, and yellow, and were sold individually from a 6-dozen display box. The whistles easily break apart releasing small parts that may pose a potential choking hazard.     These ""Siren Whistles"" were sold nationwide over the last 2 1/2 years.     While neither CPSC nor Hayes Specialties Corporation is aware of any injuries associated with the whistles distributed by Hayes, CPSC is aware of a number of choking incidents with siren type whistles. CPSC became aware of the potential choking hazard posed by these ""Siren Whistles"" through a firm that purchased the whistles from Hayes Specialties Corporation.     CPSC Chairman Jacqueline Jones-Smith said, ""Consumers having these Siren Whistles should take them away from children and return them to the store where they were purchased for a full refund of the purchase price.""     Consumers who have any questions about this recall may contact Hayes Specialties Corporation at 517-755-6541."
