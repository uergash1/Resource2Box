GX026-55-11390100	"Gregoire: New Tobacco Product Disguised as Candy          OLYMPIA - Attorney General Christine Gregoire today warned that a new          tobacco product made to look like candy could lure young people into nicotine          addiction, and she urged the federal government to regulate the product's          marketing and sales.         The          product, which goes under the name ""Ariva,"" contains compressed          tobacco powder along with sweeteners, mint and other flavorings, and resembles          a brand of popular breath mints already on the market. Ariva is now marketed          in at least 40 states and is expected to be available in Washington soon.         ""We sued tobacco companies to stop them from targeting kids to make          them the next generation of addicted tobacco users,"" Gregoire said.          ""A key element of the tobacco settlement was to limit young people's          exposure to tobacco and the nicotine it contains.""          Gregoire said tobacco products of all kinds kill more than 440,000 Americans          every year and that the nicotine in these products keep children and adults          addicted.         She is one of 42 Attorneys General who today asked the Federal Food and          Drug Administration to regulate Ariva.         ""Ariva may look and taste like a harmless candy mint, but it could          lead to a nicotine addiction and it should be regulated like the dangerous          product it is,"" Gregoire said.          In a letter to the FDA, Attorneys General noted that because the Ariva          looks like a breath mint and does not emit smoke or strong tobacco odors          when used, parents and teachers may not be able to determine if a child          is using the product.         Although its manufacturer publicly claims that Ariva is aimed at current          smokers who are in situations where they can't smoke, Ariva has many features          that appeal to children, including chewing gum-style packaging and candy-like          sweetness.                     The Attorneys General told the FDA that the marketing and packaging for          Ariva falsely implies that the product is a healthy alternative to smoking,          when in fact it contains toxic and cancer-causing substances.          The Attorneys General support a petition calling for FDA regulation of          Ariva that was submitted by numerous public health and medical organizations.          Organizations supporting FDA regulation include: the National Center for          Tobacco-Free Kids, the American Medical Association, the American Cancer          Society, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association,          the American Legacy Foundation and numerous other major public health          organizations.         -30-                         Index"

Obesity Research Center: Babcock 1029 St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital Center 1111 Amsterdam Avenue       New York, NY, 10025                           Introduction   Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today. I am Dr. Carol Boozer. I  received my doctorate of science in nutrition from Harvard University, School of  Public Health. I am presently on the faculties of the Institute of Human  Nutrition, in the Department of Medicine at Columbia University and at the New  York Obesity Research Center at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York. I  have received research funding from the National Institutes of Health and have  served on NIH study sections and as an NIH site visit reviewer. I currently  receive significant research support from NIH grants. My career has been devoted  to research in the areas of nutrition and obesity with the intention to promote  public health.   Ephedra Studies   Issues relating to ephedra are highly controversial. My interest in this issue  is through my role as a scientist who was the principal investigator in two of  the very few clinical trials of the efficacy for weight loss and safety of  herbal ephedra/caffeine combinations. My position today is to promote the role  of science in the policy making process in general and in this issue in  particular.   The sudden death of any individual is tragic to the family and friends and a  loss to the country. The effort to reduce the number of these tragedies and  promote public health should be the highest priority. Reports of adverse events  related to the use of ephedra must be taken seriously, and they are useful in  pointing to areas that require research. They do not constitute scientific proof  of an association between ephedra consumption and injury. The reason why such  reports cannot prove cause and effect is easily understood by the following  example. If a city is considering whether installation of a traffic light has  reduced accidents at a dangerous intersection, both the accident rate before the  installation, the ""background rate"" and the rate after installation  must be known. However, even if both rates are known, a difference in rates  might not be due to the light itself since other factors such as weather,  condition of the road, or the opening of a bar in the area could affect the  rate. A reduction in the accident rate following installation of the light  cannot, in and of itself, prove that the light caused the change.   Methodology   Scientists have carefully considered the methodology required to show causality.  The ""gold standard"" method in clinical studies is the randomized,  double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Randomization is a process whereby  individuals are assigned to treatment groups in such a way that the two groups  are similar in all other characteristics, except for the treatment under study.  This controls for the possibility of even unknown factors affecting one group  differently from the other. Double-blinding insures impartiality, since  throughout the study neither the participants nor the investigators know the  treatment group of any participant. Finally, inclusion of a placebo group allows  assessment of the background rate, in a group that is similar in all aspects to  the treatment group, except for the treatment under study.   The two clinical trials of ephedra-containing products that I conducted were  both randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies undertaken to assess  the efficacy for weight loss and safety of herbal/ephedra combinations. A  statistician not involved in carrying out the studies provided the randomization  codes using a system that would maximize the chance that placebo and treatment  groups would on average be similar in characteristics such as age, body weight,  gender distribution, income, education, etc. Since none of the research staff  involved in the study knew the codes, there was no way that they could bias the  results by treating one group differently from the other during the study. Only  after the study was completed and after the data had been entered into computer  spreadsheets was the code broken by the statistician who analyzed the data. The  data for the group receiving the ephedra was then compared with the data for the  group receiving placebo. Since the groups were similar at the start of the study  and followed the same protocol with the exception of the treatment, herbal  ephedra/caffeine or placebo, any differences that were found could be attributed  to the treatment.   These two studies were the only clinical trials of ephedra and ephedrine that  were given the highest ranking for quality in the recently published Rand  Report.   Results   The two studies together included 234 men and women who were overweight, but  otherwise healthy. Half received herbal ephedra/caffeine and half placebo. One  study continued for 8 weeks, the other for 6 months. In both studies, those  receiving the herbal treatment lost more body weight and body fat and had  improved blood lipids compared with those receiving placebo. No individual in  either study experienced a significant adverse event (defined in the scientific  community as death, heart attack, stroke, etc.). In both studies, the herbal  groups had increased heart rate and slightly increased blood pressure relative  to placebo groups. Heart monitors, used in the 6-month study, showed that herbal  treatment did not increase heart irregularities. Drop-out rates were similar in  the herbal and placebo groups in both studies, but in the 8-week study, the  reasons given for dropping out of the herbal treatment group included more  self-reported side effects (primarily palpitations). In the 6-month study, the  numbers of individuals who dropped out due to side effects were very low and  were similar between the two groups. The side effects reported more frequently  by all subjects in the herbal groups compared with placebo groups were: dry  mouth, insomnia, headache and heartburn.   Reaction   These studies were published in the International Journal of Obesity. &  Prior to publication, experts in the field critically reviewed each paper and  made recommendations to the editor as to the validity of methods, interpretation  of results and scientific importance, a process called peer-review. Subsequent  to publication, there have been attacks on the studies by the media and others.   The public is not well served by suppression of scientific studies. The value of  scientific study does not depend on agreement of outcome with preconceived  expectation. While no study is perfect, these studies were conducted without  pressure from the industry sponsors for a predetermined outcome, as evidenced by  their contractual agreement to publication of results regardless of outcome. The  studies were conducted with impartiality that was assured by the randomized,  double-blind, placebo-controlled design. They were subjected to peer-review and  published in a reputable scientific journal.   Rejection of scientific data in favor of anecdotal stories is inconsistent with  the advancement of knowledge or responsible public health policy. The Rand  Report reviewed approximately 20,000 adverse event reports. They classified  events as ""sentinel"" if they provided three things: 1) documentation  that the event did occur, 2) documentation or toxicological evidence that the  subject had consumed ephedra within 24 hours prior to the adverse event, and 3)  evidence that an adequate investigation had assessed and excluded other  potential causes. Only 21, approximately 1 in 1,000 reports, reached this level  and only two of these were deaths.   One estimate of ephedra consumption in the United States was 12 million people  in 1999. Among such a large number of people, some adverse events would occur  whether or not individuals were taking ephedra. Data from the U.S. Government's  Division of Vital Statistics estimates the death rate from heart disease alone  to be roughly 1 in 5,500 even in young individuals, age 25-44 years. Among the  millions of people consuming ephedra, the background rate of deaths and other  serious adverse events would be in the thousands, many fold higher than the 21  documented sentinel events. That is why the Rand Report states that  ""classification as a sentinel event does not imply a proven cause and  effect relationship.""   While efficacy of ephedra in promoting weight loss is established, it is not my  position that the safety of herbal ephedra is proven for different populations  or with different usage. Additional research would be required to determine  effects in people who are not healthy, or who consume ephedra at levels above  those studied, or for periods longer than six months, or in combination with  prescription or illicit drugs. But, at present, there is no scientific data  proving that consumption of ephedra/caffeine combinations for weight loss are  unsafe, when consumed in accordance with appropriate warning labels.   Additional research on the effects of ephedra on weight loss and in other areas,  such as athletic performance, is clearly needed. I urge those who are  responsible for policy to promote such research and to be guided by its  findings.

According        to Commissioner David Mulligan: ""These products which are often promoted        with claims of increased athletic performance, body building muscle gains,        energy 'boosts' or a natural high, may pose a significant health risk to        consumers.""                 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has received reports of approximately        600 adverse events involving ephedra, including a number of deaths that        are actively being investigated. One of these deaths occurred in Massachusetts        and involved the consumption of a thermogenic protein drink containing ma        huang extract marketed over the counter in health food stores to increase        athletic performance and muscle building.                 While some of the herbal products such as ""herbal ecstasy"" are marketed        to appear as ""legal"" alternatives to street drugs, many of the products        such as the one involved in the Massachusetts case, are marketed towards        health-conscious individuals with claims of increased athletic performance,        body building muscle gains and energy boosts. The Department of Public Health        is warning consumers not to consume any of the ecstasy-type products which        are promoted as giving a natural ""high"" similar to illegal street drugs.        Consumers are further cautioned not to consume herbal dietary supplements        containing ephedra for increasing general health or athletic performances        unless they have consulted a physician.                 Ephedrine is a stimulant that can have adverse effects on the heart and        central nervous system ranging from dizziness and rapid heart beat to psychosis        and heart attack. A recently obtained death certificate for the Massachusett's        case indicated that a 23 year old college student died on April 19, 1996,        of a heart problem (myocardial necrosis) associated with ephedrine toxicity        from the ingestion of a protein drink containing ma huang extract. Commissioner        Mulligan stated that ""The Department is pursuing additional information        from the medical community, and is requesting that any cases of adverse        effects related to these products be brought immediately to our attention.""                        Ephedrine is available as a manufactured synthetic drug and is a constituent        of a number of FDA approved medications for use as a bronchodilator, to        make breathing easier, and is most commonly packaged in over-the-counter        drug products.                 The dietary supplements containing ""ephedra"" or ""ma huang"" are not approved        as drugs by the FDA, and their safety is being questioned. A federal law        passed in 1994, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA)        permits these dietary supplements to be marked without proof of safety.        FDA is only permitted to act after the marketed dietary supplement has been        proven to be unsafe. Due to the growing number of adverse effects reprted        to FDA nationally, including the Massachusetts case, our Department is working        closely with FDA and the medical community to review additional regulatory        actions that may be taken concerning dietary supplements that contain ephedrine,        especially those that might also contain the stimulant caffeine.                 Individuals who have experienced adverse health effects should contact the        Department of Public Health's Division of Food and Drugs at (617) 727-2670.

GX261-32-11554083	"Club Drugs: Herbal Ecstasy What is herbal ecstasy? How is it different from Ecstasy? Herbal ecstasy is a combination of herbs that are legal, cheap, and advertised as a ""natural high."" Herbal ecstasy can be bought over the counter in drug stores, music stores, and shops around the country for approximately $3.00 per pill. http://www.lef.org/fda-museum/3suppress_truth_nutrients/let_092996.html  The active ingredients are caffeine and ephedra, also know as ma huang. Ma huang is a drug that' been used in China for 2000 years to treat breathing problems. s Ibid  Ecstasy, on the other hand is illegal and the active ingredient is MDMA (this stands for methlyenedioxymethamphetamine). Both drugs are stimulants (uppers), though, and basically have the same effects on the body. www.drugfreeamerica.org/clubdrugs  What is the herbal ecstasy high like? Users describe feeling, tingly, relaxed and/or energetic. www.drugfreeamerica.org/hecstasy_faqs.html  What are the effects of herbal ecstasy? Isn' it safer than the illegal t Ecstasy? NO! Ephedrine (the key ingredient in herbal ecstasy) speeds up your heart and central nervous system, just like Ecstasy, and can cause harmful reactions in people with high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and other conditions. People who are sensitive to ephedrine can suffer from heart attacks, strokes, and seizures when taking the drug, also. Ibid In fact, in 1996 the FDA reported 15 deaths and 395 illnesses related to use of herbal ecstasy. On April 10, of that year, they issued a warning against ""herbal ecstasy"" use. http://ndsn.org/MAY96/HERBAL.html  In addition to heart attacks and seizures, Herbal Ecstasy can also cause psychosis (a lost sense of reality). A Great Britain man suffered from a psychosis after long-term use of Herbal Ecstasy. After being admitted to an emergency room for hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren' there), he hallucinated that someone was trying to t kill him, and jumped from an upstairs window trying to escape his imaginary attacker. http://www.lef.org/fda-museum/3suppress_truth_nutrients/let_092996.html  For more information please contact: ADEPT 405 West Fifth Street, Suite 211, Santa Ana, CA 92701 ( (714) 834-4058  www.oc.ca.gov/hca/public/ADEPT/index/htm"

The Internet is a gateway to information of great diversity in many countries and cultures around the world. Because of its international character, however, there is no external monitoring of the Internet. While most of the information accessed can be valuable and enlightening, the user may also find materials that are unreliable, personally offensive or illegal under U.S. law. The Library cannot police a global network and each individual user must take responsibility for his or her own activities on the Internet and for the activities of his or her children.           Although the Library can not police the Internet, the Harrison Regional Library System will follow and strictly enforce Alabama State Law 13A-12-200.3 that specifically prohibits the dissemination or display of obscene matter. Computers available for public use are filtered to decrease opportunities for display of pornography. The library has provided a private method to allow adult computer users to request by-pass of the libraries filtering system. Technology protection measures may be disabled, as necessary, for bona fide research or other lawful purposes by people aged 18 and older. Requests to by-pass the libraries filtering system will be reviewed by the Director of the Harrison Regional Library to determine that unfiltered access will not violate federal or Alabama State laws.               Minor Children       The Internet is a new opportunity for children to expand their minds and experiences, and to develop skills necessary for the future. The quality of a child's experience will be directly related to a parent's investment in that experience. No individual, company, or government controls or monitors the Internet. While most of the information accessed can be valuable and enlightening, the minor child may also find materials that are unreliable, personally offensive or illegal under U.S. law.    In an attempt to protect young Internet users, minor Children under the age of 18 must have the written permission of their parents or guardians to use the Library’s Internet computers. Children under the age of 8 must be accompanied by a responsible adult. Minor children can not request an opportunity to by-pass the Library’s filtering service.           The Library has installed a filtering service on all library computers with Internet access, and will enforce the operation of same during any use of those computers, to prevent minors from accessing visual depictions that are (1) obscene, (2) child pornography, or (3) harmful to minors. The term ""harmful to minors"" is defined by the Communications Act of 1934 (47 USC Section 254 [h][7]), as meaning any picture, image, graphic image file, or other visual depiction that taken as a whole and with respect to minors, appeals to a prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion; depicts, describes, or represents, in a patently offensive way with respect to what is suitable for minors, an actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact, actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual acts, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals; taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value as to minors. Filtering software is not foolproof. It diminishes the likelihood that searchers will inadvertently retrieve text or images that they may find offensive, but does not eliminate that possibility.        Parents or legal guardians must assume responsibility for deciding which library resources are appropriate for their own children. Parents or legal guardians should guide their children in use of the Internet and inform them about materials they should not use. While the Library affirms and acknowledges the rights and responsibilities of parents and guardians to monitor and determine their children's access to Library materials and resources, including those available through the Internet, the Library has taken certain measures designed to assist in the safe and effective use of these resources by all minors.   1.                    To address the issue of access by minors to inappropriate material on the Internet, including material that is harmful to minors, the Library:       Ø        Develops and maintains a special web site for children and teens;        Ø        Develops and provides training programs on safe and effective Internet use;        Ø        Encourages staff to guide minors away from materials that may be inappropriate   Ø        Distributes a publication entitled ""Kid’s  Rules for Online Safety .""   2.           To address the issue of the safety and security of minors when using electronic mail, chat rooms and other forms of direct electronic communications, as well as the unauthorized disclosure, use and dissemination of personal identification information regarding minors, the Library provides training programs and also urges minors to keep in mind the following safety guidelines:       Ø        It  is not acceptable for a minor to receive any material that is deemed harmful to minors under the  Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA)  through a web site, email, chat room, or other direct electronic communication.       Ø        Never give out identifying information such as home address, school name, or telephone number.

Ø        Remember that everything one reads may not be true.        3.           To address the issue of unauthorized access, including so-called ""hacking,"" and other unlawful activities by minors online, minors and all other Library users are hereby advised that use of the Library's computers for hacking or any other unlawful activity is strictly prohibited.   Rules Governing Use         Due to the limited resources available for provision of public access to the Internet, the Library may set limits, for example, on use of large files of still or moving images or sound, or on downloading files in any medium. The Library also reserves the right to limit the amount of time an individual user can devote to a single session. The public must comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, including laws governing the transmission and dissemination of information while accessing the Internet.    Users may not:        ·          Use the network to make unauthorized entry into other computational, informational or communication services or resources.        ·          Distribute unsolicited advertising.        ·          Invade the privacy of others.        ·          Make any attempt to damage computer equipment or software.        ·          Engage in any activity that is harassing or defamatory.        ·          Use the Internet for any illegal activity, including violation of copyright or other rights of third parties, or in a manner inconsistent with the Library's tax-exempt status or its proper operation.        Further examples of unacceptable use include, but are not limited to, the following:        ·          Damaging or destroying equipment, software, or data belonging to the Library or to other users, including adding, altering, or deleting files on Library workstation hard drives or other Library computer equipment.        ·          Unauthorized copying of copyrighted material.        ·          Violating software license agreements.        ·          Violating computer system or network integrity, including attempts to bypass network security functions, obtain passwords, or alter the configuration of Library workstations in any way.        ·          Gambling on the Internet.         ·          Wasting finite resources (including printing without paying).                Violations may result in loss of access. Unlawful activities will be dealt with in an appropriate manner.    Public Users' Security  Users should be aware that the Internet is not a secure medium and that third parties may be able to obtain information regarding users' activities. However, The Harrison Regional Library System will not release information on the use of specific Internet resources by members of the public except as required by law or necessary for the proper operation of the Library.     Compliance       The user’s access to the Library’s computer network and Internet is a privilege, not a right. A user violates this policy by his or her own action or by failing to report any violations by other users that come to the attention of the user. Further, a user violates this policy if he or she permits another to use his or her account or password to access the computer network and Internet. Failure to comply with this policy and its procedures will result in the forfeiture of the user’s right to access these computers.        The Library reserves the right to take appropriate action to insure compliance with this policy.       The Library reserves the right to determine what constitutes inappropriate behavior. The Library reserves the right to terminate the Internet access privileges of any person abusing these principles.                Use of the Library's Internet computers will be on a first-come, first-served basis. No appointments will be taken.       ____________________________________________       Kids' Rules for Online Safety           1.        I will not give out personal information such as my address, telephone number, parents’ work address/telephone number, or the name and location of my school without my parents’ permission.       2.          2.

INTERNET ACCESS This is the Internet Safety Policy of the JCLC, the host site that provides Internet access to the nineteen member libraries of Jefferson County. The Internet, a worldwide network of computer networks is an essential medium for obtaining and transmitting information of all types. Therefore, public access to the Internet is germane to the public Library's mission. However, the Internet is an unregulated medium. It also provides access to information that is inaccurate, illegal or that some may find offensive or disturbing. The JCLC will identify on its web site specific Internet sites that have potential interest for JCLC users. But the JCLC cannot control a user's access to other Internet resources. I. RESPONSIBILITIES OF JCLC USERS AND STAFF JCLC member library staff will not monitor a user's Internet use, except for length of use at a member library site, in order to ensure equal opportunity of access for everyone. The user, or the parent of a minor, is responsible for his or her Internet session at all times. The JCLC member library, through local Internet policies, reserves the right to terminate an Internet session that disrupts JCLC services or that involves user behavior that violates the member library policies or JCLC's policies. As with all JCLC resources, the JCLC affirms the right and responsibility of parents/guardians, NOT JCLC member library staff, to determine and monitor their minor children's use of the Internet. Parents are responsible for their minor children's use of the JCLC's resources and member library's facilities. Parents who believe that their children cannot responsibly use the JCLC's Internet access are requested to monitor their children's Internet use.   II. UNACCEPTABLE USES OF NETWORK AND/OR COMPUTERS Among the uses that are considered unacceptable and which constitute a violation of this Policy are the following: A. Uses that violate the law or encourage others to violate the law. Transmitting of offensive or harassing messages; offering for sale or use any substance the possession or use of which is prohibited by law; viewing, transmitting or downloading pornographic materials or materials that encourage others to violate the law; downloading or transmitting confidential, trade secret information, or copyrighted materials. Even if materials on the networks are not marked with the copyright symbol, users should assume that all materials are protected unless there is explicit permission on the materials to use them. The term ""harmful to minors"" is defined by the Communications Act of 1934 (47 USC Section 254 [h][7]), as meaning: · any picture, image, graphic image file, or other visual depiction that taken as a whole and with respect to minors, appeals to a prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion; · depicts, describes, or represents, in a patently offensive way with respect to what is suitable for minors, an actual or · simulated sexual act or sexual contact, actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual acts, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals; · taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value as to minors. Specific to Alabama: A. Dissemination or public display of obscene matter is a misdemeanor in Alabama. Code of Alabama 13A-12-200.3 B. Dissemination or public display of obscene matter containing visual reproduction of person under 17 years of age involved in obscene acts is a Class B felony in Alabama. Code of Alabama 13A-12-191. C. Violation of the above ordinances 13A-12-200.3 and 13A-12-191 may subject you to loss of library privileges or criminal prosecution. D. Copies obtained from the Internet may be subject to copyright law. Violation of the law may subject you to an action for damages and/or an injuction.   B. Uses that cause harm to others or damage to their property. Engaging in defamation (harming another's reputation by lies); uploading a worm, virus, ""trojan horse,"" ""time bomb"" or other harmful form of programming or vandalism; participating in ""hacking"" activities or any form of unauthorized access to other computers, networks, or information systems. C. Uses that jeopardize the security of the computer network or other networks on the Internet. Disclosing or sharing the user's library card password with others; impersonating another user; using one's own software programs on the JCLC member library's computers; altering the JCLC's member library computer settings; damaging or modifying computer equipment or software. D. Uses that compromise the safety and security of minors when using e-mail, chat rooms and other forms of direct electronic communications: Child less than 16 years of age: Giving others private information about one's self or others, including credit card numbers and social security numbers; arranging a face-to-face meeting with someone one has ""met"" on the computer network or Internet without a parent's permission.   III. INTERNET SAFETY A. General Warning; Individual Responsibility of Parents and Users. All users and their parents/guardians are advised that access to the electronic network may include the potential for access to materials inappropriate for children. Every user must take responsibility for his or her use of the computer network and Internet and stay away from these sites. Parents of minors are the best guides to materials to shun. If a child finds that other users are visiting offensive or harmful sites, he or she should report such use to library staff. B. Personal Safety. In using the computer network and Internet, do not reveal personal information such as your home address or telephone number. Do not use your real last name or any other information which might allow a person to locate you without first obtaining the permission of a parent. Do not arrange a face-to-face meeting with someone you ""meet"" on the computer network or Internet without your parent's permission (child less than 16 years of age). Regardless of your age, you should never agree to meet a person you have only communicated with on the Internet in a secluded place or in a private setting. C. ""Hacking"" and Other Illegal Activities. It is a violation of this Policy to use the public library computer network or the Internet to gain unauthorized access to other computers or computer systems, or to attempt to gain such unauthorized access. Any use which violates state or federal law relating to copyright, trade secrets, the distribution of obscene or pornographic materials, or which violates any other applicable law or municipal ordinance, is strictly prohibited. D. Confidentiality of Library Records; · Code of Alabama 41-8-10. Registration, etc. records of public libraries to be confidential; right of parents to inspect records. · Code of Alabama 36-12-40. Inspection and Copying of Records. Personally identifiable information concerning users may not be disclosed or used in any way on the Internet without the permission of a parent or guardian (of a minor child), or the permission of the user himself/herself. Users should never give out private or confidential information about themselves or others on the Internet, particularly credit card numbers and Social Security numbers. A member library director may authorize the release of directory information, as defined by the Code of Alabama, for internal administrative or planning purposes. Any disclosure of current patron information to legal authorities, as required by law with search warrant or subpoena, must be authorized by the Director of the member library where the search warrant or subpoena is served.   IV. DISCLAIMERS While the JCLC endeavors to provide access to information of the highest quality, the JCLC specifically disclaims any warrant as to the information's accuracy, timeliness, authoritativeness, usefulness or fitness for a particular purpose. The JCLC will have no liability for direct, indirect or consequential damages related to the use of information accessed through the JCLC's Internet service. Since software and information downloaded from any sources, including the Internet, may contain computer viruses, users are advised to utilize virus-checking software on their home computers. The JCLC is not responsible for damage to users' disks or computers or for any loss of data, damage or liability that may occur from use of the JCLC's member library's computers. V. PROCEDURES The JCLC member library will develop such rules, policies and procedures as are necessary to ensure the fair and reasonable use of Internet access at each local member library facility. VI. RESPONSE TO VIOLATIONS The user's access to the JCLC's computer network and Internet is a privilege, not a right. A user violates this Policy by his or her own action or by failing to report any violations by other users that come to the attention of the user. Further, a user violates this Policy if he or she permits another to use his or her library card account or password to access the computer network and Internet. Failure to comply with this Policy and its procedures may result in the forfeiture of the user's right to access member library computers.   VII. Adoption Adopted by the Board of Directors of the Jefferson County Library Cooperative _______________________2002.   ***********************************************   2001 - 2002 Acceptable Use and Internet Safety Policy For The Computer Network  Of    Sample Document --Indian Valley   The Indian Valley Local School District (Ohio)   http://www.ivtv.k12.oh.us/documents/StudAUP01.htm     2001 - 2002 Acceptable Use and Internet Safety Policy    For The Computer Network Of The    Indian Valley Local School District      The Indian Valley Local School District is pleased to make available to students access to interconnected computer systems within the District and to the Internet, the world-wide network that provides various means of accessing significant educational materials and opportunities.  In order for the School District to be able to continue to make its computer network and Internet access available, all students must take responsibility for appropriate and lawful use of this access. Students must understand that one student’s misuse of the network and Internet access may jeopardize the ability of all students to enjoy such access. While the School’s teachers and other Staff will make reasonable efforts to supervise student use of network and Internet access, they must have student cooperation in exercising and promoting responsible use of this access. Below is the Acceptable Use and Internet Safety Policy (""Policy"") of the School District and the Data Acquisition Site that provides Internet access to the School District. Upon reviewing, signing, and returning this Policy as the students have been directed, each student will be given the opportunity to enjoy Internet access at School and is agreeing to follow the Policy. If a student is under 18 years of age, he or she must have his or her parents or guardians read and sign the Policy. The School District cannot provide access to any student who, if 18 or older, fails to sign and submit the Policy to the School as directed or, if under 18, does not return the Policy as directed with the signatures of the student and his/her parents or guardians.  Listed below are the provisions of your agreement regarding computer network and Internet use. If you have any questions about these provisions, you should contact the person that your School has designated as the one to whom you can direct your questions.

Active Restriction Measures. The School, either by itself or in combination with the Data Acquisition Site providing Internet access, will utilize filtering software or other technologies to prevent students from accessing visual depictions that are (1) obscene, (2) child pornography, or (3) harmful to minors. The School will also monitor the online activities of students, through direct observation and/or technological means, to ensure that students are not accessing such depictions or any other material which is inappropriate for minors.  Internet filtering software or other technology-based protection systems may be disabled by a supervising teacher or school administrator, as necessary, for purposes of bona fide research or other educational projects being conducted by students age 17 and older.    The term ""harmful to minors"" is defined by the Communications Act of 1934 (47 USC Section 254 [h][7]), as meaning any picture, image, graphic image file, or other visual depiction that  - taken as a whole and with respect to minors, appeals to a prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion;  - depicts, describes, or represents, in a patently offensive way with respect to what is suitable for minors, an actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact, actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual acts, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals;  - taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value as to minors.

All such information files shall be and remain the property of the School District and no user shall have any expectation of privacy regarding such materials.    VI. FAILURE TO FOLLOW POLICY  The user’s use of the computer network and Internet is a privilege, not a right. A user who violates this Policy, shall at a minimum, have his or her access to the computer network and Internet terminated, which the School District may refuse to reinstate for the remainder of the student’s enrollment in the School District. A user violates this Policy by his or her own action or by failing to report any violations by other users that come to the attention of the user. Further, a user violates this Policy if he or she permits another to use his or her account or password to access the computer network and Internet, including any user whose access has been denied or terminated. The School District may also take other disciplinary action in such circumstances.   VII. WARRANTIES/INDEMNIFICATION  The School District makes no warranties of any kind, either express or implied, in connection with its provision of access to and use of its computer networks and the Internet provided under this Policy. It shall not be responsible for any claims, losses, damages or costs (including attorney's fees) of any kind suffered, directly or indirectly, by any user or his or her parent(s) or guardian(s) arising out of the user’s use of its computer networks or the Internet under this Policy.

If after you have provided your account information, some or all of the information changes, you must notify the person designated by the School to receive such information.    STUDENT’S AGREEMENT    Every student, regardless of age, must read and sign below:    I have read, understand and agree to abide by the terms of the foregoing Acceptable Use and Internet Safety Policy. Should I commit any violation or in any way misuse my access to the School District's computer network and the Internet, I understand and agree that my access privilege may be revoked and School disciplinary action may be taken against me.    ____________________________________________ ______________________________  Student name (PRINT CLEARLY) Home phone    ____________________________________________ ______________________________  Student signature Date    ______________________________________________________________________________  Address    User (place an ""X"" in the correct blank): I am 18 or older _____ I am under 18 _____    If I am signing this Policy when I am under 18, I understand that when I turn 18, this Policy will continue to be in full force and effect and agree to abide by this Policy.    PARENT’S OR GUARDIAN’S AGREEMENT    _________________________________  Student’s name   To be read and signed by parents or guardians of students who are under 18:    As the parent or legal guardian of the above student, I have read, understand and agree that my child or ward shall comply with the terms of the School District's Acceptable Use and Internet Safety Policy for the student’s access to the School District's computer network and the Internet. I understand that access is being provided to the students for educational purposes only. However, I also understand that it is impossible for the School to restrict access to all offensive and controversial materials and understand my child’s or ward’s responsibility for abiding by the Policy. I am therefore signing this Policy and agree to indemnify and hold harmless the School, the School District and the Data Acquisition Site that provides the opportunity to the School District for computer network and Internet access against all claims, damages, losses and costs, of whatever kind, that may result from my child’s or ward’s use of his or her access to such networks or his or her violation of the foregoing Policy.

The purpose of this policy is to identify the limitations on this privacy and the general restrictions applying to the use of computers and electronic messaging systems of the District.    Acceptable and Unacceptable Uses  The computers, computer network and messaging systems of the School District are intended for educational uses and work-related communications. Incidental use of the e-mail and voice mail systems by staff members for personal communications is permitted as long as such communications are limited in number, are initiated during non-work periods, and do not interfere with the primary intended uses of the system.  The following are uses which are unacceptable under any circumstances:  the transmission of any language or images which are of a graphic sexual nature  the transmission of jokes, pictures, or other materials which are obscene, lewd, vulgar, or disparaging of persons based on their race, color, sex, age, religion, national origin, or sexual orientation  the transmission of messages or any other content which would be perceived by a reasonable person to be harassing or threatening  uses that constitute defamation (libel or slander)  uses that violate copyright laws  uses that attempt to gain unauthorized access to another computer system or to impair the operation of another computer system (for example, the transmission of a computer virus or an excessively large e-mail attachment)  any commercial or profit-making activities  any fundraising activities, unless specifically authorized by an administrator    Security and Integrity  Staff members shall not take any action which would compromise the security of any computer, network or messaging system. This would include the unauthorized release or sharing of passwords and the intentional disabling of any security features of the system.  Staff members shall not take any actions which may adversely affect the integrity, functionality, or reliability of any computer (for example, the installation of hardware or software not authorized by the System Administrator).  Staff members shall report to the System Administrator or a School District administrator any actions by students which would violate the security or integrity of any computer, network or messaging system whenever such actions become known to them in the normal course of their work duties. This shall not be construed as creating any liability for staff members for the computer-related misconduct of students.    Right of Access  Although the Board of Education respects the natural desire of all persons for privacy in their personal communications, and will attempt to preserve this privacy whenever possible, the operational and security needs of the District’s computer network and messaging systems require that full access be available at all times. The School District therefore reserves the right to access and inspect any computer, device, or electronic media within its systems and any data, information, or messages which may be contained therein. All such data, information, and messages are the property of the School District and staff members should have no expectation that any messages sent or received on the School District’s systems will always remain private.    AGREEMENT   I have read the ""Network Privacy and Acceptable Use Policy for Staff Members"" relating to staff use of the computers, computer networks, and electronic messaging systems of the School District.  I would like to be given access to the School District’s computer network and any electronic messaging systems is a privilege which may be withdrawn in the event of non-compliance with the above Policy. I agree to comply with the ""Network Privacy and Acceptable Use Policy for Staff Members"" and understand that access to the network and messaging systems is a privilege which may be withdrawn in the event of noncompliance with the above Policy.   ******************************   Sample Document    This is the Offical Internet Use POLICY:    ALACHUA COUNTY LIBRARY DISTRICT POLICY STATEMENT  INTERNET ACCESS POLICY    Approved by:  Board of Trustees 12/15/99  Governing Board 1/13/00   The Alachua County Library District offers filtered and unfiltered access to the Internet in fulfillment of our mission to ""collect, organize, and make accessible recreational, educational, informational and cultural resources to meet the changing needs of Alachua County residents of all ages, and cultural and economic backgrounds.""* Access is offered equally to all users without charge. In providing public access to the Internet, the Alachua County Library District subscribes to the principles of intellectual freedom expressed in the American Library Association's LIBRARY BILL OF RIGHTS and FREEDOM TO READ statements and its interpretations of these documents. Library staff will not monitor, control, or restrict anyone's access to equipment or the range of information available within the limits of State and/or Federal law. Parents or designated guardians, who wish to limit or restrict the access of their own children, should personally oversee their use of the Internet and other forms of electronic information. Minors who visit the library without a parent or guardian are responsible for their own decisions and behaviors. Users of Library computing resources must comply with federal and state laws, Library rules and policies, and the terms of applicable contracts including software licenses while using Library computing resources. Examples of applicable laws, rules and policies include the laws of libel, privacy, copyright, trademark, obscenity and child pornography; the Florida Computer Crimes Act, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which prohibit ""hacking,"" ""cracking"" and similar activities. Users who engage in electronic communications with persons in other states or countries or on other systems or networks may also be subject to the laws of those jurisdictions and the rules and policies of those other systems and networks. Users must not use computing resources to gain unauthorized access to local or remote computers or to impair or damage the operations of ACLD computers or networks, PC workstations or peripherals. This includes blocking communication lines and running, installing or sharing virus programs. Deliberate attempts to circumvent data protection or other security measures are not allowed. The Alachua County Library District Code of Conduct applies to the use of all Internet workstations.INTERNET ACCESS DISCLAIMER Provision of this service does not constitute any endorsement by the Alachua County Library District. The Library shall have no liability for direct, indirect or consequential damages related to the use of information accessed on the Internet from Library equipment. Internet users are reminded that: Not all sources on the Internet provide accurate, complete, or current information. Individuals are responsible for the decision to choose either filtered or unfiltered Internet access. Filtering software does not block all material users might find offensive.Public library workstations are not private or secure. *Alachua County Library District, Long Range Facilities and Service Plan ********* And here's our Internet PROCEDURE. This is what ALA's Intellectual Freedom Office was so thrilled with, especially section 9. ******** PROCEDURE: FILE: ACLD GENERAL PROCEDURES USE OF PUBLIC INTERNET WORKSTATIONS EFFECTIVE: April 27, 2000 The following procedures are designed to facilitate the equitable distribution of electronic resources at all Alachua County Library District locations.1. Computer workstations are designed for use by one person. Exceptions may be made by library staff. 2. Patrons are allowed to download from the Internet to a disk only. Patrons must provide their own disk. 3. Patrons' personal software or hardware may not be used or installed on library equipment. 4. Printing from Internet Workstations is available at a nominal cost to the patron. There is no limit to the number of pages a patron can print. 5. All copyright laws apply to the Internet workstations. Refer patrons with questions to the posted signs at the print release stations and provide copies at the service desk for patron review. 6. Because workstations are located in public areas, what is viewed is not private. Under Florida Statute Chapters 847.011(1) and 847.0133(1), the display of obscene materials to minors, viewing child pornography and the printing of such materials is illegal and punishable. Staff who observe or have patrons report these situations should contact their Department Manager or person-in-charge. Document the incident with a Problem Behavior Report. 7. All standard Internet Workstations are equipped with privacy screens. Staff should remove a privacy screen only upon a patron request. All workstations are set to ""time out"" after a set period of no activity. 8. Patron comments about Internet service or content should be handled through discussion as any other complaint or concern. If patrons wish to formally comment on Internet content, staff should give them a ""Patron Comment on Materials"" form to complete. The completed form will be forwarded to the Automated Services Coordinator within one working day of its receipt by library staff. The Automated Services coordinator will appoint a staff committee to review the challenged internet content in light of the INTERNET ACCESS POLICY AND DISCLAIMER. This committee will then formulate a written recommendation, responding to the patron comment and will forward this recommendation to the Library Director within four (4) weeks of the committee appointment. (This process is similar to the one in place for comments on print and audio-visual materials.) Within one week of receiving the committee's recommendation, the Library Director will prepare a final written response to the patron. This response will be forwarded to the patron and to the Board of Trustees. Comments relating to adding or deleting websites from a filtered workstation will be reviewed and the committee will forward the request to the Library Director who will forward the request to FIRN, if appropriate, and will respond to the patron. At any time, patrons will be able to communicate directly with FIRN from our screens, if they wish to do so. 9. On all Internet workstations, patrons will be able to choose, from a menu, filtered or unfiltered access to the Internet. Library staff will not monitor, control or restrict anyone's access to the range of information available within the limits of State and/or Federal law. Parents or designated guardians, who wish to limit or restrict the access of their own children, should personally oversee their use of the Internet and other forms of electronic information. Children who visit the library without a parent or guardian will be responsible for their own decisions and behaviors. 10. When necessary, to facilitate access to high-demand resources, staff in-charge can change the designated login on a workstation. 11. Internet users will have access to Web-based and AFN e-mail, chat and games within the limits of State/Federal law. The Library District does not provide e-mail accounts for users but simply provides access to patrons' existing e-mail accounts ********* And here's our SIGNUP PROCEDURE: ********* PROCEDURE: FILE: ACLD GENERAL PROCEDURES SIGN-UP OF PUBLIC INTERNET WORKSTATIONS EFFECTIVE: April 27, 2000 To ensure equitable access to Internet Workstations for all library users, Branch or Department Managers may deem it necessary to sign-up patrons for Internet use during peak hours. When sign-up is used, all library facilities will adhere to the following guidelines. 1. Patrons must schedule a session for the Internet workstations at the public service desk, using existing sign-up sheets supplied by HQPS. 2. A scheduled session is at least a 30 minute block of time. Sessions are scheduled on the half-hour or hour. Each Branch Manager shall establish a consistent timetable of half hour and/or hourly sessions. Timetables should be compatible with traffic patterns in the library. For example: Timetable A: indicates a peak traffic pattern 2pm-closing Monday - Friday and weekends. 10 am -2 pm Monday-Friday sessions are 1 hour. 2 pm-closing Monday-Friday sessions are 30 minutes Saturday-Sunday sessions are 30 minutes Timetable B: indicates peak traffic pattern all open library hours. 30 minute sessions all open library hours Timetable C: indicates ample available equipment during all open library hours including peak. 1 hour sessions all open library hours 3. Patrons may sign up for the next available session at the end of their 1st session. 4. Scheduled sessions are limited to 2 per person per day. 5. Reservations can be taken, either in-person or on the phone, for same day or next library business day. 6. If a patron does not arrive within 5 minutes after the session is scheduled to begin, library staff can offer it to another patron. 7. Internet Workstations are available during the hours the library is open. In order to facilitate printing, finishing documents, etc. at closing time, the last scheduled session will be one hour before closing. *********** The thing that makes this work is a series of screens designed by our staff where the user has to FIRST, agree to accept our internet policy, and SECOND, choose either filtered or unfiltered use. If you don't accept, OR don't choose to filter or not, you can't get to the Internet. This solution was thought up by a committee of our staff and we all thought it was brilliant. We still do...but of course we still get complaints! -ch Carol Hole Alachua County Library Gainesville, FL chole@exchange.acld.lib.fl.us         ************************* Sample Document #4   Sample Internet Use Policy for CIPA Compliance (portions taken from Newark Public Library, New Jersey State Library, and The Indian Valley [Ohio] Local School District) Mission   The mission of The *** Public Library is to provide for the people of *** an easily available local collection of and global access to the universal record of human thought, wisdom, ideals, information, experiences, and artistic expressions. Internet Access The Internet, a world-wide network of computer networks is an essential medium for obtaining and transmitting information of all types. Therefore, public access to the Internet is germane to the Library's mission. However, the Internet is an unregulated medium. It also provides access to information that is inaccurate, illegal or that some may find offensive or disturbing. The Library will identify on its web site specific Internet sites that have potential interest for Library users. But the Library cannot control a user's access to other Internet resources. Responsibilities of Library Staff and Users Library staff will not monitor a user's Internet use, except for length of use in order to ensure equal opportunity of access for everyone. The user, or the parent of a minor, is responsible for his or her Internet session at all times. The Library reserves the right to terminate an Internet session that disrupts library services or that involves user behavior that violates the Library's policies. As with all Library resources, the Library affirms the right and responsibility of parents/guardians, NOT Library staff, to determine and monitor their minor children's use of the Internet. (Minors are defined in this policy as children and young people under the age of 17 years.) Parents are responsible for their minor children’s use of the Library’s resources and facilities. Parents who believe that their children cannot responsibly use the Library’s Internet access are requested to monitor their children’s Internet use.Disclaimers While the Library endeavors to provide access to information of the highest quality, the Library specifically disclaims any warrant as to the information's accuracy, timeliness, authoritativeness, usefulness or fitness for a particular purpose. The Library will have no liability for direct, indirect or consequential damages related to the use of information accessed through the Library's Internet service. The Library, having installed and enforced the operation of filtering software in compliance with the Children’s Internet Protection Act, will have no liability for damages related to the operation of, or failure of, the filtering software, or for its circumvention by users.Since software and information downloaded from any sources, including the Internet, may contain computer viruses, users are advised to utilize virus checking software on their home computers. The Library is not responsible for damage to users' disks or computers or for any loss of data, damage or liability that may occur from use of the Library's computers. Unacceptable Uses of Computers Among the uses that are considered unacceptable and which constitute a violation of this policy are the following: 1. Uses that violate the law or encourage others to violate the law. Transmitting of offensive or harassing messages; offering for sale or use any substance the possession or use of which is prohibited by law; viewing, transmitting or downloading pornographic materials or materials that encourage others to violate the law; downloading or transmitting confidential, trade secret information, or copyrighted materials. Even if materials on the networks are not marked with the copyright symbol, users should assume that all materials are protected unless there is explicit permission on the materials to use them. 2. Uses that cause harm to others or damage to their property. Engaging in defamation (harming another's reputation by lies); uploading a worm, virus, ""trojan horse,"" ""time bomb"" or other harmful form of programming or vandalism; participating in ""hacking"" activities or any form of unauthorized access to other computers, networks, or information systems. 3. Uses that jeopardize the security of access of the computer network or other networks on the Internet. Disclosing or sharing the user’s password with others; impersonating another user; using one’s own software programs on the library's computers; altering the Library’s computer settings; damaging or modifying computer equipment or software.4. Uses that compromise the safety and security of minors when using e-mail, chat rooms and other forms of direct electronic communications: Minors under age 17: Giving others private information about one’s self or others, including credit card numbers and social security numbers; arranging a face-to-face meeting with someone one has ""met"" on the computer network or Internet without a parent’s permission. 5. Uses that Violate Confidentiality of Information: The New Jersey Confidentiality of Library Records Law (NJSA 18A:73-43.2) prohibits unauthorized disclosure, use, or dissemination of personal information regarding Library users, including minors. Personally identifiable information about users may not be disclosed or used in any way, except to law enforcement authorities as provided in the law.Technology Protection Measures The Library, either by itself or in combination with its Internet access provider, will install filtering software or other technologies on all library computers with Internet access, and will enforce the operation of same during any use of those computers, to prevent minors from accessing visual depictions that are (1) obscene, (2) child pornography, or (3) harmful to minors. The term ""harmful to minors"" is defined by the Communications Act of 1934 (47 USC Section 254 [h][7]), as meaning any picture, image, graphic image file, or other visual depiction that taken as a whole and with respect to minors, appeals to a prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion; depicts, describes, or represents, in a patently offensive way with respect to what is suitable for minors, an actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact, actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual acts, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals; taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value as to minors. Filtering software is not foolproof. It diminishes the likelihood that searchers will inadvertently retrieve text or images that they may find offensive, but does not eliminate that possibility. Filters often block access to sites that users would consider both inoffensive and useful. If you do not find what you need, please do not hesitate to ask a librarian for help. Technology protection measures may be disabled by a library staff member, as necessary, for bona fide research or other lawful purposes by people aged 17 and older. Procedures The Library staff will develop such rules and procedures as are necessary to ensure the fair and reasonable use of Internet access. Response to Violations The user’s access to the Library’s computer network and Internet is a privilege, not a right. A user violates this policy by his or her own action or by failing to report any violations by other users that come to the attention of the user. Further, a user violates this policy if he or she permits another to use his or her account or password to access the computer network and Internet. Failure to comply with this policy and its procedures will result in the forfeiture of of the user’s right to access these computers.       From:  Heather Gallegos-Rex, Director Library Development Services / New Mexico State Library / 1209 Camino Carlos ReySanta Fe, NM 87505 / voice: 505-476-9720 / fax: 505-476-9721    Mythical Public Library   Mythical, New Mexico INTERNET AND COMPUTER ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY PURPOSE STATEMENT    The Mythical Public Library provides access to the Internet as one means of fulfilling its mission to ""inform, educate, entertain, and culturally enrich by providing books and other Library resources, facilities and professional services for use by all individuals…."" [Mission Statement, approved by the Advisory Board of Mythical Public Library on February 17,1992]. All Internet resources accessible through the Library are provided equally to all users, with the understanding that it is the individual user’s responsibility to demonstrate judgment, respect for others, and appropriate conduct while using Public Library resources and facilities.Internet computers will not be used by anyone, including minors, for illegal activity, to access illegal materials, or to access materials that by local community standards would be obscene. Library employees are authorized to take prompt and appropriate actions to enforce the Rules of Conduct, and/or to prohibit use by persons who fail to comply with the Internet Acceptable Use Policy as stated or implied herein. Parents are responsible for their children’s use of the Library’s resources and facilities. Parents who believe that their children cannot responsibly use the Library’s Internet access are requested to monitor their children’s Internet use.RULES OF CONDUCT Internet computers will not be used for illegal activity, to access illegal materials, or to access materials that by local community standards would be obscene.Installation, downloading, or modification of software is prohibited. Users will respect copyright laws and licensing agreements. Users will not make any attempt to gain unauthorized access to restricted files or networks, or to damage or modify computer equipment or software. Prompt payment is required by users who incur charges for printing or other authorized fees. Users must sign up to use the Internet on a next-available-terminal basis. Terminals will not be ""reserved"" for persons who are not in the immediate vicinity when their name is called, and telephone reservations will not be taken. Access sessions will be limited to thirty minutes, unless otherwise authorized by the Librarian in Charge. Users must end their session and leave the terminal when asked to do so by authorized Library staff, even if they have not completed their access session. Upon completion of an Internet access session, a user may be required to wait 30 minutes before signing up for another session. The Librarian in Charge may establish the number of access sessions available per day, per user; such limitations will be dependent on facility-specific demand in order to provide access for a variety of users. Users will respect the privacy of other users, and will refrain from attempting to view or read material being used by others. The New Mexico Library Privacy Act prohibits unauthorized disclosure, use, or dissemination of personal information regarding Library users, including minors. By mutual agreement, two persons may share one access session as long as their behavior or conversation does not disturb other users or Library staff. OPTIONAL USE OF FILTERED SEARCH ENGINES (Note: Include this paragraph if you intend to use filters.)The Mythical Public Library supports the right and responsibility of parents to direct the use of the Internet by their own children, and provides access to filtered search engines on Internet terminals. Filtered search engines (which are not under the control of the Library) may restrict access to sites that could be deemed objectionable, but may also limit access to sites that have legitimate research value. No filtering system is completely effective or efficient. Access to filtered search engines has been provided, but Library staff will not require that children utilize filtered search engines for their research. Adults doing bona fide research may request that filters be disabled. TERMINATION OR PROHIBITION OF USER ACCESS When Library employees believe that the user has failed to comply with the Internet Acceptable Use Policy and/or the Rules of Conduct, they are authorized to terminate any user’s access session or to prohibit a user from subsequent access sessions for up to two weeks from the date of informing the user of that action. After a hearing before the Library’s administrative authority, a Library patron may be permanently barred from Internet access from the Library.Internet users whose access session has been terminated or prohibited will be given information concerning the process to protest the action and/or request that Internet access privileges be reinstated. Temporary or permanent denial of Internet privileges at any Mythical Public Library facility will be effective at all Mythical Public Library facilities.              Last updated 07/29/2003       by Theresa C.

Conclusion; Severability 182       Preliminary Statement     This case challenges an act of Congress that makes the use of  filtering software by public libraries a condition of the receipt of federal  funding. The Internet, as is well known, is a vast, interactive medium based on  a decentralized network of computers around the world. Its most familiar feature  is the World Wide Web (the ""Web""), a network of computers known as servers that  provide content to users. The Internet provides easy access to anyone who wishes  to provide or distribute information to a worldwide audience; it is used by more  than 143 million Americans. Indeed, much of the world's knowledge accumulated  over centuries is available to Internet users almost instantly. Approximately  10% of the Americans who use the Internet access it at public libraries. And  approximately 95% of all public libraries in the United States provide public  access to the Internet.   While the beneficial effect of the Internet in expanding the  amount of information available to its users is self-evident, its low entry  barriers have also led to a perverse result - facilitation of the widespread  dissemination of hardcore pornography within the easy reach not only of adults  who have every right to access it (so long as it is not legally obscene or child  pornography), but also of children and adolescents to whom it may be quite  harmful. The volume of pornography on the Internet is huge, and the record  before us demonstrates that public library patrons of all ages, many from ages  11 to 15, have regularly sought to access it in public library settings. There  are more than 100,000 pornographic Web sites that can be accessed for free and  without providing any registration information, and tens of thousands of Web  sites contain child pornography.    Libraries have reacted to this situation by utilizing a number  of means designed to insure that patrons avoid illegal (and unwanted) content  while also enabling patrons to find the content they desire. Some libraries have  trained patrons in how to use the Internet while avoiding illegal content, or  have directed their patrons to ""preferred"" Web sites that librarians have  reviewed. Other libraries have utilized such devices as recessing the computer  monitors, installing privacy screens, and monitoring implemented by a ""tap on  the shoulder"" of patrons perceived to be offending library policy. Still others,  viewing the foregoing approaches as inadequate or uncomfortable (some librarians  do not wish to confront patrons), have purchased commercially available software  that blocks certain categories of material deemed by the library board as  unsuitable for use in their facilities. Indeed, 7% of American public libraries  use blocking software for adults. Although such programs are somewhat effective  in blocking large quantities of pornography, they are blunt instruments that not  only ""underblock,"" i.e., fail to block access to substantial amounts of content  that the library boards wish to exclude, but also, central to this litigation,  ""overblock,"" i.e., block access to large quantities of material that library  boards do not wish to exclude and that is constitutionally protected.     Most of the libraries that use filtering software seek to block  sexually explicit speech. While most libraries include in their physical  collection copies of volumes such as  The Joy of Sex  and  The Joy of  Gay Sex , which contain quite explicit photographs and descriptions,  filtering software blocks large quantities of other, comparable information  about health and sexuality that adults and teenagers seek on the Web. One  teenager testified that the Internet access in a public library was the only  venue in which she could obtain information important to her about her own  sexuality. Another library patron witness described using the Internet to  research breast cancer and reconstructive surgery for his mother who had breast  surgery. Even though some filtering programs contain exceptions for health and  education, the exceptions do not solve the problem of overblocking  constitutionally protected material. Moreover, as we explain below, the  filtering software on which the parties presented evidence in this case  overblocks not only information relating to health and sexuality that might be  mistaken for pornography or erotica, but also vast numbers of Web pages and  sites that could not even arguably be construed as harmful or inappropriate for  adults or minors.    The Congress, sharing the concerns of many library boards,  enacted the Children's Internet Protection Act (""CIPA""),  Pub. L. No. 106-554 , which  makes the use of filters by a public library a condition of its receipt of two  kinds of subsidies that are important (or even critical) to the budgets of many  public libraries - grants under the Library Services and Technology Act,   20 U.S.C. § 9101  et  seq.  (""LSTA""), and so-called ""E-rate discounts"" for  Internet access and support under the Telecommunications Act,    47 U.S.C. § 254 . LSTA grant funds are awarded,  inter alia , in order to: (1)  assist libraries in accessing information through electronic networks, and (2)  provide targeted library and information services to persons having difficulty  using a library and to underserved and rural communities, including children  from families with incomes below the poverty line. E-rate discounts serve the  similar purpose of extending Internet access to schools and libraries in  low-income communities. CIPA requires that libraries, in order to receive LSTA  funds or E-rate discounts, certify that they are using a ""technology protection  measure"" that prevents patrons from accessing ""visual depictions"" that are  ""obscene,"" ""child pornography,"" or in the case of minors, ""harmful to minors.""  20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(1)(A) (LSTA); 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(B) & (C) (E-rate).     The plaintiffs, a group of libraries, library associations,  library patrons, and Web site publishers, brought this suit against the United  States and others alleging that CIPA is facially unconstitutional    because: (1) it induces public libraries to violate their patrons'  First Amendment rights contrary to the requirements of  South Dakota v.  Dole , 483 U.S. 203 (1987); and (2) it requires libraries to relinquish  their First Amendment rights as a condition on the receipt of federal funds and  is therefore impermissible under the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions.   In arguing that CIPA will induce  public libraries to violate the First Amendment, the plaintiffs contend that  given the limits of the filtering technology, CIPA's conditions effectively  require libraries to impose content-based restrictions on their patrons' access  to constitutionally protected speech. According to the plaintiffs, these  content-based restrictions are subject to strict scrutiny under public forum  doctrine,  see   Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of  Va. , 515 U.S. 819, 837 (1995), and are therefore permissible only if they  are narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest and no less  restrictive alternatives would further that interest,  see   Reno v.  ACLU , 521 U.S. 844, 874 (1997). (1)   The government responds  that CIPA will not induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment, since  it is possible for at least some public libraries to constitutionally comply  with CIPA's conditions. Even if some libraries' use of filters might violate the  First Amendment, the government submits that CIPA can be facially invalidated  only if it is impossible for any public library to comply with its conditions  without violating the First Amendment.   Pursuant to CIPA, a three-judge Court was convened to try the  issues.  Pub. L. No.  106-554 .   Following an intensive  period of discovery on an expedited schedule to allow public libraries to know  whether they need to certify compliance with CIPA by July 1, 2002, to receive  subsidies for the upcoming year, the Court conducted an eight-day trial at which  we heard 20 witnesses, and received numerous depositions, stipulations and  documents. The principal focus of the trial was on the capacity of currently  available filtering software. The plaintiffs adduced substantial evidence not  only that filtering programs bar access to a substantial amount of speech on the  Internet that is clearly constitutionally protected for adults and minors, but  also that these programs are intrinsically unable to block only illegal Internet  content while simultaneously allowing access to all protected speech.     As our extensive findings of fact reflect, the plaintiffs  demonstrated that thousands of Web pages containing protected speech are wrongly  blocked by the four leading filtering programs, and these pages represent only a  fraction of Web pages wrongly blocked by the programs. The plaintiffs' evidence  explained that the problems faced by the manufacturers and vendors of filtering  software are legion. The Web is extremely dynamic, with an estimated 1.5 million  new pages added every day   and the contents of existing Web  pages changing very rapidly. The category lists maintained by the blocking  programs are considered to be proprietary information, and hence are unavailable  to customers or the general public for review, so that public libraries that  select categories when implementing filtering software do not really know what  they are blocking.   There are many reasons why filtering software suffers from  extensive over- and underblocking, which we will explain below in great detail.  They center on the limitations on filtering companies' ability to: (1)  accurately collect Web pages that potentially fall into a blocked category  (e.g., pornography); (2) review and categorize Web pages that they have  collected; and (3) engage in regular re-review of Web pages that they have  previously reviewed. These failures spring from constraints on the technology of  automated classification systems, and the limitations inherent in human review,  including error, misjudgment, and scarce resources, which we describe in detail   infra  at 58-74. One failure of critical importance is that the  automated systems that filtering companies use to collect Web pages for  classification are able to search only text, not images. This is crippling to  filtering companies' ability to collect pages containing ""visual depictions""  that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors, as CIPA requires. As  will appear, we find that it is currently impossible, given the Internet's size,  rate of growth, rate of change, and architecture, and given the state of the art  of automated classification systems, to develop a filter that neither  underblocks nor overblocks a substantial amount of speech.    The government, while acknowledging that the filtering software  is imperfect, maintains that it is nonetheless quite effective, and that it  successfully blocks the vast majority of the Web pages that meet filtering  companies' category definitions (e.g., pornography). The government contends  that no more is required. In its view, so long as the filtering software  selected by the libraries screens out the bulk of the Web pages proscribed by  CIPA, the libraries have made a reasonable choice which suffices, under the  applicable legal principles, to pass constitutional muster in the context of a  facial challenge. Central to the government's position is the analogy it  advances between Internet filtering and the initial decision of a library to  determine which materials to purchase for its print collection. Public libraries  have finite budgets and must make choices as to whether to purchase, for  example, books on gardening or books on golf. Such content-based decisions, even  the plaintiffs concede, are subject to rational basis review and not a stricter  form of First Amendment scrutiny. In the government's view, the fact that the  Internet reverses the acquisition process and requires the libraries to, in  effect, purchase the entire Internet, some of which (e.g., hardcore pornography)  it does not want, should not mean that it is chargeable with censorship when it  filters out offending material.   The legal context in which this extensive factual record is set  is complex, implicating a number of constitutional doctrines, including the  constitutional limitations on Congress's spending clause power, the  unconstitutional conditions doctrine, and subsidiary to these issues, the First  Amendment doctrines of prior restraint, vagueness, and overbreadth.    There are a number of potential entry points into the analysis, but the  most logical is the spending clause jurisprudence in which the seminal case is   South Dakota v. Dole , 483 U.S. 203 (1987).  Dole  outlines four  categories of constraints on Congress's exercise of its power under the Spending  Clause, but the only  Dole  condition disputed here is the fourth and  last, i.e., whether CIPA requires libraries that receive LSTA funds or E-rate  discounts to violate the constitutional rights of their patrons. As will appear,  the question is not a simple one, and turns on the level of scrutiny applicable  to a public library's content-based restrictions on patrons' Internet access.  Whether such restrictions are subject to strict scrutiny, as plaintiffs contend,  or only rational basis review, as the government contends, depends on public  forum doctrine.   The government argues that, in providing Internet access,  public libraries do not create a public forum, since public libraries may  reserve the right to exclude certain speakers from availing themselves of the  forum. Accordingly, the government contends that public libraries' restrictions  on patrons' Internet access are subject only to rational basis review.     Plaintiffs respond that the government's ability to restrict  speech on its own property, as in the case of restrictions on Internet access in  public libraries, is not unlimited,   and that the more widely the state facilitates the dissemination of private  speech in a given forum, the more vulnerable the state's decision is to restrict  access to speech in that forum . We agree with the  plaintiffs that public libraries' content-based restrictions on their patrons'  Internet access are subject to strict scrutiny. In providing even filtered  Internet access, public libraries create a public forum open to any speaker  around the world to communicate with library patrons via the Internet on a  virtually unlimited number of topics. Where the  state provides access to a ""vast democratic  forum[],""  Reno v. ACLU , 521 U.S. 844, 868 (1997), open to any member of  the public to speak on subjects ""as diverse as human thought,""  id.  at  870 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), the state's decision  selectively to exclude from the forum speech whose content the state disfavors  is subject to strict scrutiny, as such exclusions risk distorting the  marketplace of ideas that the state has facilitated. Application of strict  scrutiny finds further support in the extent to which public libraries'  provision of Internet access uniquely promotes First Amendment values in a  manner analogous to traditional public fora such as streets, sidewalks, and  parks, in which content-based restrictions are always subject to strict  scrutiny.   Under strict scrutiny, a public library's use of filtering  software is permissible only if it is narrowly tailored to further a compelling  government interest and no less restrictive alternative would serve that  interest. We acknowledge that use of filtering software furthers public  libraries' legitimate interests in preventing patrons from accessing visual  depictions of obscenity, child pornography, or in the case of minors, material  harmful to minors. Moreover, use of filters also helps prevent patrons from  being unwillingly exposed to patently offensive, sexually explicit content on  the Internet.    We are sympathetic to the position of the government, believing  that it would be desirable if there were a means to ensure that public library  patrons could share in the informational bonanza of the Internet while being  insulated from materials that meet CIPA's definitions, that is, visual  depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or in the case of minors,  harmful to minors. Unfortunately this outcome, devoutly to be wished, is not  available in this less than best of all possible worlds. No category definition  used by the blocking programs is identical to the legal definitions of  obscenity, child pornography, or material harmful to minors, and, at all events,  filtering programs fail to block access to a substantial amount of content on  the Internet that falls into the categories defined by CIPA. As will appear, we  credit the testimony of plaintiffs' expert Dr. Geoffrey Nunberg that the  blocking software is (at least for the foreseeable future) incapable of  effectively blocking the majority of materials in the categories defined by CIPA  without overblocking a substantial amount of materials. Nunberg's analysis was  supported by extensive record evidence. As noted above, this inability to  prevent both substantial amounts of underblocking and overblocking stems from  several sources, including limitations on the technology that software filtering  companies use to gather and review Web pages, limitations on resources for human  review of Web pages, and the necessary error that results from human review  processes.   Because the filtering software mandated by CIPA will block  access to substantial amounts of constitutionally protected speech whose  suppression serves no legitimate government interest, we are persuaded that a  public library's use of software filters is not narrowly tailored to further any  of these interests. Moreover, less restrictive alternatives exist that further  the government's legitimate interest in preventing the dissemination of  obscenity, child pornography, and material harmful to minors, and in preventing  patrons from being unwillingly exposed to patently offensive, sexually explicit  content. To prevent patrons from accessing visual depictions that are obscene  and child pornography, public libraries may enforce Internet use policies that  make clear to patrons that the library's Internet terminals may not be used to  access illegal speech. Libraries may then impose penalties on patrons who  violate these policies, ranging from a warning to notification of law  enforcement, in the appropriate case. Less restrictive alternatives to filtering  that further libraries' interest in preventing minors from exposure to visual  depictions that are harmful to minors include requiring parental consent to or  presence during unfiltered access, or restricting minors' unfiltered access to  terminals within view of library staff. Finally, optional filtering, privacy  screens, recessed monitors, and placement of unfiltered Internet terminals  outside of sight-lines provide less restrictive alternatives for libraries to  prevent patrons from being unwillingly exposed to sexually explicit content on  the Internet.   In an effort to avoid the potentially fatal legal implications  of the overblocking problem, the government falls back on the ability of the  libraries, under CIPA's disabling provisions,  see   CIPA § 1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(3)),  CIPA §1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(D)) , to  unblock a site that is patently proper yet improperly blocked. The evidence  reflects that libraries can and do unblock the filters when a patron so  requests. But it also reflects that requiring library patrons to ask for a Web  site to be unblocked will deter many patrons because they are embarrassed, or  desire to protect their privacy or remain anonymous. Moreover, the unblocking  may take days, and may be unavailable, especially in branch libraries, which are  often less well staffed than main libraries. Accordingly, CIPA's disabling  provisions do not cure the constitutional deficiencies in public libraries' use  of Internet filters.    Under these circumstances we are constrained to conclude that  the library plaintiffs must prevail in their contention that CIPA requires them  to violate the First Amendment rights of their patrons, and accordingly is  facially invalid, even under the standard urged on us by the government, which  would permit us to facially invalidate CIPA only if it is impossible for a  single public library to comply with CIPA's conditions without violating the  First Amendment. In view of the limitations inherent in the filtering technology  mandated by CIPA, any public library that adheres to CIPA's conditions will  necessarily restrict patrons' access to a substantial amount of protected  speech, in violation of the First Amendment. Given this conclusion, we need not  reach plaintiffs' arguments that CIPA effects a prior restraint on speech and is  unconstitutionally vague. Nor do we decide their cognate unconstitutional  conditions theory, though for reasons explained  infra  at note 36, we  discuss the issues raised by that claim at some length.    For these reasons, we will enter an Order declaring Sections  1712(a)(2) and 1721(b) of the Children's Internet Protection Act, codified at 20  U.S.C. § 9134(f) and 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6), respectively, to be facially invalid  under the First Amendment and permanently enjoining the defendants from  enforcing those provisions.          Findings of  Fact             Statutory      Framework                       Nature and Operation of        the E-rate and LSTA Program s     In the Telecommunications Act of 1996  (""1996 Act""), Congress directed the Federal Communications Commission (""FCC"") to  take the steps necessary to establish a system of support mechanisms to ensure  the delivery of affordable telecommunications service to all Americans. This  system, referred to as ""universal service,"" is codified in section 254 of the  Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the 1996 Act.  See  47 U.S.C. §  254. Congress specified several groups as beneficiaries of the universal service  support mechanism, including consumers in high-cost areas, low-income consumers,  schools and libraries, and rural health care providers.  See  47 U.S.C. §  254(h)(1). The extension of universal service to schools and libraries in  section 254(h) is commonly referred to as the Schools and Libraries Program, or  ""E-rate"" Program.   Under the E-rate Program, ""[a]ll  telecommunications carriers serving a geographic area shall, upon a bona fide  request for any of its services that are within the definition of universal  service . . ., provide such services to elementary schools, secondary schools,  and libraries for educational purposes at rates less than the amounts charged  for similar services to other parties."" 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(1)(B). Under FCC  regulations, providers of ""interstate telecommunications"" (with certain  exceptions,  see  47 C.F.R. § 54.706(d)), must contribute a portion  of their revenue for disbursement among eligible carriers that are providing  services to those groups or areas specified by Congress in section 254. To be  eligible for the discounts, a library must: (1) be eligible for assistance from  a State library administrative agency under the Library Services and Technology  Act,  see infra ; (2) be funded as an independent entity, completely  separate from any schools; and (3) not be operating as a for-profit business.   See  47 C.F.R. § 54.501(c). Discounts on services for eligible libraries  are set as a percentage of the pre-discount price, and range from 20% to 90%,  depending on a library's level of economic disadvantage and its location in an  urban or rural area.  See  47 C.F.R. § 54.505. Currently, a library's  level of economic disadvantage is based on the percentage of students eligible  for the national school lunch program in the school district in which the  library is located.   The Library Services and Technology Act  (""LSTA""), Subchapter II of the Museum and Library Services Act, 20 U.S.C. § 9101   et seq. , was enacted by Congress in 1996 as part of the Omnibus  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 104-208. The LSTA  establishes three grant programs to achieve the goal of improving library  services across the nation. Under the Grants to States Program, LSTA grant funds  are awarded,  inter alia , in order to assist libraries in accessing  information through electronic networks and pay for the costs of acquiring or  sharing computer systems and telecommunications technologies.  See  20  U.S.C. § 9141(a). Through the Grants to States program, LSTA funds have been  used to acquire and pay costs associated with Internet-accessible computers  located in libraries.                      CIPA          The Children's Internet Protection Act  (""CIPA"") was enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001,  which consolidated and enacted several appropriations bills, including the  Miscellaneous Appropriations Act, of which CIPA was a part.  See  Pub. L.  No. 106-554 .  CIPA addresses three distinct types of federal funding  programs: (1) aid to elementary and secondary schools pursuant to Title III of  the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965,  see  CIPA § 1711  (amending Title 20 to add § 3601); (2) LSTA grants to states for support of  libraries,  see  CIPA § 1712 (amending the Museum and Library Services  Act, 20 U.S.C. § 9134); and (3) discounts under the E-rate program,  see   CIPA § 1721(a) & (b) (both amending the Communications Act of 1934, 47  U.S.C. § 254(h)). Only sections 1712 and 1721(b) of CIPA, which apply to  libraries, are at issue in this case.   As explained in more detail below, CIPA  requires libraries that participate in the LSTA and E-rate programs to certify  that they are using software filters on their computers to protect against  visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or in the case of minors,  harmful to minors. CIPA permits library officials to disable the filters for  patrons for bona fide research or other lawful purposes, but disabling is not  permitted for minor patrons if the library receives E-rate discounts.                               CIPA's Amendments to          the E-rate Program    Section 1721(b) of CIPA imposes  conditions on a library's participation in the E-rate program. A library ""having  one or more computers with Internet access may not receive services at discount  rates,"" CIPA § 1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(A)(i)), unless the  library certifies that it is ""enforcing a policy of Internet safety that  includes the operation of a technology protection measure with respect to any of  its computers with Internet access that protects against access through such  computers to visual depictions that are - (I) obscene; (II) child pornography;  or (III) harmful to minors,"" and that it is ""enforcing the operation of such  technology protection measure during any use of such computers by minors."" CIPA  § 1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(B)). (2)   CIPA defines a ""technology protection measure"" as ""a specific technology that  blocks or filters access to visual depictions that are obscene, . . . child  pornography, . . . or harmful to minors."" CIPA § 1703(b)(1) (codified at 47  U.S.C. § 254(h)(7)(I)).   To receive E-rate discounts, a library  must also certify that filtering software is in operation during adult use of  the Internet. More specifically, with respect to adults, a library must certify  that it is ""enforcing a policy of Internet safety that includes the operation of  a technology protection measure with respect to any of its computers with  Internet access that protects against access through such computers to visual  depictions that are - (I) obscene; or (II) child pornography,"" and that it is  ""enforcing the operation of such technology protection measure during any use of  such computers."" CIPA § 1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C. §  254(h)(6)(C)).   Interpreting the statutory terms ""any use,"" the  FCC has concluded that ""CIPA makes no distinction between computers used only by  staff and those accessible to the public.""  In re Federal-State Joint Board  on Universal Service: Children's Internet Protection Act , CC Docket No.  96-45, Report and Order, FCC 01-120, ¶ 30 (Apr. 5, 2001).    With respect to libraries receiving  E-rate discounts, CIPA further specifies that ""[a]n administrator, supervisor,  or other person authorized by the certifying authority . . . may disable the  technology protection measure concerned, during use by an adult, to enable  access for bona fide research or other lawful purpose."" CIPA §1721(b) (codified  at 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(D)).                               CIPA's Amendments to          the LSTA Program     Section 1712 of CIPA amends the Museum  and Library Services Act (20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)) to provide that no funds made  available under the Act ""may be used to purchase computers used to access the  Internet, or to pay for direct costs associated with accessing the Internet,""  unless such library ""has in place"" and is enforcing ""a policy of Internet safety  that includes the operation of a technology protection measure with respect to  any of its computers with Internet access that protects against access through  such computers to visual depictions"" that are ""obscene"" or ""child pornography,""  and, when the computers are in use by minors, also protects against access to  visual depictions that are ""harmful to minors."" CIPA § 1712 (codified at 20  U.S.C. § 9134(f)(1)).  Section 1712 contains definitions of ""technology  protection measure,"" ""obscene,"" ""child pornography,"" and ""harmful to minors,""  that are substantially similar to those found in the provisions governing the  E-rate program. CIPA § 1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(7));  see  also   supra  note 2.   As under the E-rate program, ""an  administrator, supervisor or other authority may disable a technology protection  measure . . . to enable access for bona fide research or other lawful purposes.""  CIPA § 1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(3)). Whereas CIPA's amendments to  the E-rate program permit disabling for bona fide research or other lawful  purposes only during adult use, the LSTA provision permits disabling for both  adults and minors.             Identity of the Plaintiffs                       Library and Library        Association Plaintiffs     Plaintiffs American Library Association, Alaska Library Association,  California Library Association, Connecticut Library Association, Freedom to Read  Foundation, Maine Library Association, New England Library Association, New York  Library Association, and Wisconsin Library Association are non-profit  organizations whose members include public libraries that receive either E-rate  discounts or LSTA funds for the provision of Internet access. Because it is a  prerequisite to associational standing, we note that the interests that these  organizations seek to protect in this litigation are central to their  raison  d'être .    Plaintiffs Fort Vancouver Regional  Library District, in southwest Washington state; Multnomah County Public  Library, in Multnomah County, Oregon; Norfolk Public Library System, in Norfolk,  Virginia; Santa Cruz Public Library Joint Powers Authority, in Santa Cruz,  California; South Central Library System (""SCLS""), centered in Madison,  Wisconsin; and the Westchester Library System, in Westchester County, New York,  are public library systems with branch offices in their respective localities  that provide Internet access to their patrons.    The Fort Vancouver Regional Library  District, for over three years from 1999-2001, received $135,000 in LSTA grants  and $19,500 in E-rate discounts for Internet access. The Multnomah County Public  Library received $70,000 in E-rate discounts for Internet access this year, and  has applied for $100,000 in E-rate discounts for the upcoming year. The Norfolk  Public Library System received $90,000 in E-rate discounts for Internet access  this year, and has received a $200,000 LSTA grant to put computer labs in eight  of its libraries. The Santa Cruz Public Library Joint Powers Authority received  $20,560 in E-rate discounts for Internet access in 2001-02. The SCLS received  between $3,000 and $5,000 this year in E-rate discounts for Internet access.     The Fort Vancouver Regional Library  District Board is a public board whose members are appointed by elected county  commissioners. The Multnomah County Library is a county department, whose board  is appointed by the county chair and confirmed by the other commissioners. The  SCLS is an aggregation of 51 independently governed statutory member public  libraries, whose relationship to SCLS is defined by state law. The governing  body of the SCLS is the Library Board of Trustees, which consists of 20 members  nominated by county executives and ratified by county boards of supervisors.                       Patron and Patron Association Plaintiffs      Plaintiffs Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now,  Friends of the Philadelphia City Institute Library, and the Pennsylvania  Alliance for Democracy are nonprofit organizations whose members include  individuals who access the Internet at public libraries that receive E-rate  discounts or LSTA funds for the provision of public Internet access. We note for  the purpose of associational standing that the interests that these  organizations seek to protect in this litigation are germane to their  purposes.   Plaintiffs Emmalyn Rood, Mark Brown,  Elizabeth Hrenda, C. Donald Weinberg, Sherron Dixon, by her father and next  friend Gordon Dixon, James Geringer, Marnique Tynesha Overby, by her next friend  Carolyn C. Williams, William J. Rosenbaum, Carolyn C. Williams, and Quiana  Williams, by her mother and next friend Sharon Bernard, are adults and minors  who use the Internet at public libraries that, to the best of their knowledge,  do not filter patrons' access to the Internet. Several of these plaintiffs do  not have Internet access from home.   Emmalyn Rood is a sixteen-year-old who  uses the Multnomah County Public Library. When she was 13, she used the Internet  at the Multnomah County Public Library to research issues relating to her sexual  identity. Ms. Rood did not use her home or school computer for this research, in  part because she wished her searching to be private. Although the library  offered patrons the option of using filtering software, Ms. Rood did not use  that option because she had had previous experience with such programs blocking  information that was valuable to her, including information relating to gay and  lesbian issues.   Plaintiff Mark Brown used the Internet  at the Philadelphia Free Library to research breast cancer and reconstructive  surgery for his mother who had breast surgery. Mr. Brown's research at the  library provided him and his mother with essential information about his  mother's medical condition and potential treatments.                      Web Publisher        Plaintiffs     Plaintiff Afraid to Ask, Inc., based in  Saunderstown, Rhode Island, publishes a health education Web site,  www.AfraidtoAsk.com. Dr. Jonathan Bertman, the president and medical director of  Afraid to Ask, is a family practice physician in rural Rhode Island and a  clinical assistant professor of family medicine at Brown University.  AfraidtoAsk.com's mission is to provide detailed information on sensitive health  issues, often of a sexual nature, such as sexually transmitted diseases, male  and female genitalia, and birth control, sought by people of all ages who would  prefer to learn about sensitive health issues anonymously, i.e., they are  ""afraid to ask ."" As part of its educational mission,  AfraidtoAsk.com often uses graphic images of sexual anatomy to convey  information. Its primary audience is teens and young adults. Based on survey  data collected on the site, half of the people visiting the site are under 24  years old and a quarter are under 18. AfraidtoAsk.com is blocked by several  leading blocking products as containing sexually explicit content.   Plaintiff Alan Guttmacher Institute has a Web site that  contains information about its activities and objectives, including its mission  to protect the reproductive choices of women and men. Plaintiff Planned  Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. (""Planned Parenthood"") is a national  voluntary organization in the field of reproductive health care. Planned  Parenthood owns and operates several Web sites that provide a range of  information about reproductive health, from contraception to prevention of  sexually transmitted diseases, to finding an abortion provider, and to  information about the drug Mifepristone. Plaintiff Safersex.org is a Web site  that offers free educational information on how to practice safer  sex.   Plaintiff Ethan Interactive, Inc., d/b/a Out In America, is an  online content provider that owns and operates 64 free Web sites for gay,  lesbian, bisexual and transgendered persons worldwide. Plaintiff PlanetOut  Corporation is an online content provider for gay, lesbian, bisexual and  transgendered persons. Plaintiff the Naturist Action Committee (""NAC"") is the  nonprofit political arm of the Naturist Society, a private organization that  promotes a way of life characterized by the practice of nudity. The NAC Web site  provides information about Naturist Society activities and about state and local  laws that may affect the rights of Naturists or their ability to practice  Naturism, and includes nude photographs of its members.   Plaintiff Wayne L. Parker was the Libertarian candidate in the  2000 U.S. Congressional election for the Fifth District of Mississippi (and is  running again in 2002). He publishes a Web site that communicates information  about his campaign and that provides information about his political views and  the Libertarian Party to the public. Plaintiff Jeffrey Pollock was the  Republican candidate in the 2000 U.S. Congressional election for the Third  District of Oregon. He operates a Web site that is now promoting his candidacy  for Congress in 2002. (3)             The Internet                       Background     As we noted at the outset, the Internet is a vast, interactive  medium consisting of a decentralized network of computers around the world. The  Internet presents low entry barriers to anyone who wishes to provide or  distribute information. Unlike television, cable, radio, newspapers, magazines  or books, the Internet provides an opportunity for those with access to it to  communicate with a worldwide audience at little cost. At least 400 million  people use the Internet worldwide, and approximately 143 million Americans were  using the Internet as of September 2001. Nat'l Telecomm. & Info. Admin.,   A Nation Online: How Americans Are Expanding Their Use of the Internet   (February 2002),  available at    http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/dn/ .   The World Wide Web is a part of the Internet that consists of a  network of computers, called ""Web servers,"" that host ""pages"" of content  accessible via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or ""HTTP."" Anyone with a computer  connected to the Internet can search for and retrieve information stored on Web  servers located around the world. Computer users typically access the Web by  running a program called a ""browser"" on their computers. The browser displays,  as individual pages on the computer screen, the various types of content found  on the Web and lets the user follow the connections built into Web pages   - called ""hypertext links,""  ""hyperlinks,"" or ""links"" - to additional content. Two popular browsers are  Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator.    A ""Web page"" is one or more files a  browser graphically assembles to make a viewable whole when a user requests  content over the Internet. A Web page may contain a variety of different  elements, including text, images, buttons, form fields that the user can fill  in, and links to other Web pages. A ""Web site"" is a term that can be used in  several different ways. It may refer to all of the pages and resources available  on a particular Web server. It may also refer to all the pages and resources  associated with a particular organization, company or person, even if these are  located on different servers, or in a subdirectory on a single server shared  with other, unrelated sites. Typically, a Web site has as an intended point of  entry, a ""home page,"" which includes links to other pages on the same Web site  or to pages on other sites. Online discussion groups and chat rooms relating to  a variety of subjects are available through many Web sites.    Users may find content on the Web using  engines that search for requested keywords. In response to a keyword request, a  search engine will display a list of Web sites that may contain relevant content  and provide links to those sites. Search engines and directories often return a  limited number of sites in their search results (e.g., the Google search engine  will return only 2,000 sites in response to a search, even if it has found, for  example, 530,000 sites in its index that meet the search criteria).    A user may also access content on the  Web by typing a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into the address line of the  browser. A URL is an address that points to some resource located on a Web  server that is accessible over the Internet. This resource may be a Web site, a  Web page, an image, a sound or video file, or other resource. A URL can be  either a numeric Internet Protocol or ""IP"" address, or an alphanumeric ""domain  name"" address. Every Web server connected to the Internet is assigned an IP  address. A typical IP address looks like ""13.1.64.14."" Typing the URL  "" http://13.1.64.14 /"" into a browser will bring the user to the Web server  that corresponds to that address. For convenience, most Web servers have  alphanumeric domain name addresses in addition to IP addresses. For example,  typing in "" http://www.paed.uscourts.gov "" will  bring the user to the same Web server as typing in  "" http://204.170.64.143 .""    Every time a user attempts to access  material located on a Web server by entering a domain name address into a Web  browser, a request is made to a Domain Name Server, which is a directory of  domain names and IP addresses, to ""resolve,"" or translate, the domain name  address into an IP address. That IP address is then used to locate the Web  server from which content is being requested. A Web site may be accessed by  using either its domain name address or its IP address.    A domain name address typically consists  of several parts. For example, the alphanumeric URL  http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents/opinions  can be broken  down into three parts. The first part is the transfer protocol the computer will  use in accessing the content (e.g., ""http"" for Hypertext Transfer Protocol);  next is the name of the host server on which the information is stored (e.g.,   www.paed.uscourts.gov ); and then the name of the particular file or  directory on that server (e.g.,  /documents/opinions ).   A single Web page may be associated with  more than one URL. For example, the URLs  http://www.newyorktimes.com  and   http://www.nytimes.com  will both take the user to the  New York  Times  home page. The topmost directory in a Web site is often referred to  as that Web site's root directory or root URL. For example, in   http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents , the  root URL is  http://www.paed.uscourts.gov . There may be hundreds or thousands  of pages under a single root URL, or there may be one or only a few.   There are a number of Web hosting  companies that maintain Web sites for other businesses and individuals, which  can lead to vast amounts of diverse content being located at the same IP  address. Hosting services are offered either for a fee, or in some cases, for  free, allowing any individual with Internet access to create a Web site. Some  hosting services are provided through the process of ""IP-based hosting,"" where  each domain name is assigned a unique IP number. For example,  www.baseball.com  might map to the IP  address ""10.3.5.9"" and  www.XXX.com   might map to the IP address ""10.0.42.5."" Other hosting services are provided  through the process of ""name-based hosting,"" where multiple domain name  addresses are mapped to a single IP address. If the hosting company were using  this method, both  www.baseball.com  and  www.XXX.com  could map to a single IP address, e.g., ""10.3.5.9.""  As a result of the ""name-based hosting"" process, up to tens of thousands of  pages with heterogeneous content may share a single IP address.                      The Indexable Web, the        ""Deep Web""; Their Size and Rates of Growth and Change          The universe of content on the Web that  could be indexed, in theory, by standard search engines is known as the  ""publicly indexable Web."" The publicly indexable Web is limited to those pages  that are accessible by following a link from another Web page that is recognized  by a search engine. This limitation exists because online indexing techniques  used by popular search engines and directories such as Yahoo, Lycos and  AltaVista, are based on ""spidering"" technology, which finds sites to index by  following links from site to site in a continuous search for new content. If a  Web page or site is not linked by others, then spidering will not discover that  page or site.    Furthermore, many larger Web sites  contain instructions, through software, that prevent spiders from investigating  that site, and therefore the contents of such sites also cannot be indexed using  spidering technology. Because of the vast size and decentralized structure of  the Web, no search engine or directory indexes all of the content on the  publicly indexable Web. We credit current estimates that no more than 50% of the  content currently on the publicly indexable Web has been indexed by all search  engines and directories combined. No currently available method or combination  of methods for collecting URLs can collect the addresses of all URLs on the  Web.   The portion of the Web that is not  theoretically indexable through the use of ""spidering"" technology, because other  Web pages do not link to it, is called the ""Deep Web."" Such sites or pages can  still be made publicly accessible without being made publicly indexable by, for  example, using individual or mass emailings (also known as ""spam"") to distribute  the URL to potential readers or customers, or by using types of Web links that  cannot be found by spiders but can be seen and used by readers. ""Spamming"" is a  common method of distributing to potential customers links to sexually explicit  content that is not indexable.   Because the Web is decentralized, it is  impossible to say exactly how large it is. A 2000 study estimated a total of 7.1  million unique Web sites, which at the Web's historical rate of growth, would  have increased to 11 million unique sites as of September 2001. Estimates of the  total number of Web pages vary, but a figure of 2 billion is a reasonable  estimate of the number of Web pages that can be reached, in theory, by standard  search engines. We need not make a specific finding as to a figure, for by any  measure the Web is extremely vast, and it is constantly growing. The indexable  Web is growing at a rate of approximately 1.5 million pages per day. The size of  the un-indexable Web, or the ""Deep Web,"" while impossible to determine  precisely, is estimated to be two to ten times that of the publicly indexable  Web.    In addition to growing rapidly, Web  pages and sites are constantly being removed, or changing their content. Web  sites or pages can change content without changing their domain name addresses  or IP addresses. Individual Web pages have an average life span of approximately  90 days.                     The        Amount of Sexually Explicit Material on the Web      There is a vast amount of sexually explicit material available via the  Internet and the Web.   Sexually explicit material on the Internet is   easy to access using any public  search engine, such as, for example, Google or AltaVista.   Although  much of the sexually explicit material available on the Web is posted on  commercial sites that require viewers to pay in order to gain access to the  site, a large number of sexually explicit sites may be accessed for free and  without providing any registration information. Most importantly, some Web sites  that contain sexually explicit content have innocuous domain names and therefore  can be reached accidentally.  A  commonly cited example is   http://www.whitehouse.com . Other  innocent-sounding URLs that retrieve graphic, sexually explicit depictions  include  http://www.boys.com ,  http://www.girls.com ,   http://www.coffeebeansupply.com , and  http://www.BookstoreUSA.com .   Moreover, commercial Web sites that contain sexually explicit material  often use a technique of attaching pop-up windows to their sites, which open new  windows advertising other sexually explicit sites without any prompting by the  user. This technique makes it difficult for a user quickly to exit all of the  pages containing sexually explicit material, whether he or she initially  accessed such material intentionally or not.    The percentage of Web pages on the  indexed Web containing sexually explicit content is relatively small. Recent  estimates indicate that no more than 1-2% of the content on the Web is  pornographic or sexually explicit. However, the absolute number of Web sites  offering free sexually explicit material is extremely large, approximately  100,000 sites.              American Public Libraries         The more than 9,000 public libraries  in the United States are typically funded (at least in large part) by state or  local governments. They are frequently overseen by a board of directors that is  either elected or is appointed by an elected official or a body of elected  officials. We heard testimony from librarians and library board members working  in eight public library systems in different communities across the country,  some of whom are also plaintiffs in this case. They hailed from the following  library systems: Fort Vancouver, Washington; Fulton County, Indiana; Greenville,  South Carolina; a regional consortium of libraries centered in Madison,  Wisconsin; Multnomah County, Oregon; Norfolk, Virginia; Tacoma, Washington; and  Westerville, Ohio. The parties also took depositions from several other  librarians and library board members who did not testify during the trial, and  submitted a number of other documents regarding individual libraries'  policies.                     The Mission of Public Libraries, and Their Reference and Collection        Development Practices     American public libraries operate in a wide variety of communities,  and it is not surprising that they do not all view their mission identically.  Nor are their practices uniform. Nevertheless, they generally share a common  mission -  to provide patrons  with a wide range of information and ideas.    Public libraries across the country  have endorsed the American Library Association's (""ALA"") ""Library Bill of  Rights"" and/or ""Freedom to Read Statement,"" including every library testifying  on behalf of the defendants in this case.  The ""Library Bill of Rights,"" first adopted by  the ALA in 1948, provides, among other things, that ""[b]ooks and other library  resources should be provided for the interest, information, and enlightenment of  all people of the community the library serves."" It also states that libraries  ""should provide materials and information presenting all points of view on  current and historical issues"" and that library materials ""should not be  proscribed or removed because of partisan or doctrinal disapproval.""     The ALA's ""Freedom to Read""  statement, adopted in 1953 and most recently updated in July 2000, states, among  other things, that ""[i]t is in the public interest for publishers and librarians  to make available the widest diversity of views and expressions, including those  that are unorthodox or unpopular with the majority."" It also states that ""[i]t  is the responsibility of . . . librarians . . . to contest encroachments upon  th[e] freedom [to read] by individuals or groups seeking to impose their own  standards or tastes upon the community at large.""    Public libraries provide information  not only for educational purposes, but also for recreational, professional, and  other purposes.  For example,  Ginnie Cooper, Director of the Multnomah County Library, testified that some of  the library's most popular items include video tapes of the British Broadcasting  Corporation's ""Fawlty Towers"" series, and also print and ""books on tape""  versions of science fiction, romance, and mystery novels. Many public libraries  include sexually explicit materials in their print collection, such as  The  Joy of Sex  and  The Joy of Gay Sex . Very few public libraries,  however, collect more graphic sexually explicit materials, such as XXX-rated  videos, or  Hustler  magazine. (4)   The mission of public librarians is to provide their patrons with a  wide array of information, and they surely do so. Reference librarians across  America answer more than 7 million questions weekly. If a patron has a  specialized need for information not available in the public library, the  professional librarian will use a reference interview to find out what  information is needed to help the user, including the purpose for which an item  will be used. Reference librarians are trained to assist patrons without judging  the patron's purpose in seeking information, or the content of the information  that the patron is seeking.    Many public libraries routinely  provide patrons with access to materials not in their collections through the  use of bibliographic access tools and interlibrary loan programs. Public  libraries typically will assist patrons in obtaining access to all materials  except those that are illegal, even if they do not collect those materials in  their physical collection.    In order to provide this  access, a librarian may attempt to find material not included in the library's  own collection in other libraries in the system, through interlibrary loan, or  through a referral, perhaps to a government agency or a commercial bookstore.  Interlibrary loan is expensive, however, and is therefore used infrequently.     Public librarians also apply  professional standards to their collection development practices. Public  libraries generally make material selection decisions and frame policies  governing collection development at the local level. Collection development is a  key subject in the curricula of Masters of Library Science programs and is  defined by certain practices. In general, professional standards guide public  librarians to build, develop and create collections that have certain  characteristics, such as balance in its coverage and requisite and appropriate  quality. To this end, the goal of library collections is not universal coverage,  but rather to find those materials that would be of the greatest direct benefit  or interest to the community. In making selection decisions, librarians consider  criteria including the content of the material, its accuracy, the title's niche  in relation to the rest of the collection, the authority of the author, the  publisher, the work's presentation, and how it compares with other material  available in the same genre or on the same subject.    In pursuing the goal of achieving a  balanced collection that serves the needs and interests of their patrons,  librarians generally have a fair amount of autonomy, but may also be guided by a  library's collection development policy. These collection development policies  are often drawn up in conjunction with the libraries' governing boards and with  representatives from the community, and may be the result of public hearings,  discussions and other input.    Although many librarians use  selection aids, such as review journals and bibliographies, as a guide to the  quality of potential acquisitions, they do not generally delegate their  selection decisions to parties outside of the public library or its governing  body. One limited exception is the use of third-party vendors or approval plans  to acquire print and video resources. In such arrangements, third-party vendors  provide materials based on the library's description of its collection  development criteria. The vendor sends materials to the library, and the library  retains the materials that meet its collection development needs and returns the  materials that do not. Even in this arrangement, however, the librarians still  retain ultimate control over their collection development and review all of the  materials that enter their library's collection.                      The Internet in Public        Libraries    The vast majority of public libraries  offer Internet access to their patrons.  According to a recent report by the U.S. National Commission on  Libraries and Information Science, approximately 95% of all public libraries  provide public access to the Internet. John C. Bertot & Charles R. McClure,   Public Libraries and the Internet 2000: Summary Findings and Data  Tables , Report to National Commission on Libraries and Information Science,  at 3 .  The Internet vastly expands the amount of  information available to patrons of public libraries. The widespread  availability of Internet access in public libraries is due, in part, to the  availability of public funding, including state and local funding and the  federal funding programs regulated by CIPA.   Many libraries face a large amount of  patron demand for their Internet services.  At some libraries, patron demand for Internet  access during a given day exceeds the supply of computer terminals with access  to the Internet. These libraries use sign-in and time limit procedures and/or  establish rules regarding the allowable uses of the terminals, in an effort to  ration their computer resources.  For example, some of the libraries whose librarians testified at  trial prohibit the use of email and chat functions on their public Internet  terminals.    Public libraries play an important  role in providing Internet access to citizens who would not otherwise possess  it.  Of the 143 million  Americans using the Internet, approximately 10%, or 14.3 million people, access  the Internet at a public library.  Internet access at  public libraries is more often used by those with lower incomes than those with  higher incomes. About 20.3% of Internet users with household family income of  less than $15,000 per year use public libraries for Internet  access.   Approximately 70% of libraries serving  communities with poverty levels in excess of 40% receive E-rate discounts.                                 Internet Use          Policies in Public Libraries     Approximately 95% of libraries with  public Internet access have some form of ""acceptable use"" policy or ""Internet  use"" policy governing patrons' use of the Internet. These policies set forth the  conditions under which patrons are permitted to access and use the library's  Internet resources.  These  policies vary widely. Some of the less restrictive policies, like those held by  Multnomah County Library and Fort Vancouver Regional Library, do not prohibit  adult patrons from viewing sexually explicit materials on the Web, as long as  they do so at terminals with privacy screens or recessed monitors, which are  designed to prevent other patrons from seeing the material that they are  viewing, and as long as it does not violate state or federal law to do so. Other  libraries prohibit their patrons from viewing all ""sexually explicit"" or  ""sexually graphic"" materials.    Some libraries prohibit the viewing  of materials that are not necessarily sexual, such as Web pages that are  ""harmful to minors,"" ""offensive to the public,"" ""objectionable,"" ""racially  offensive,"" or simply ""inappropriate.""   Other libraries  restrict access to Web sites that the library just does not want to provide,  even though the sites are not necessarily offensive. For example, the Fulton  County Public Library restricts access to the Web sites of dating services.  Similarly, the Tacoma Public Library's policy does not allow patrons to use the  library's Internet terminals for personal email, for online chat, or for playing  games.    In some cases, libraries instituted  Internet use policies after having experienced specific problems, whereas in  other cases, libraries developed detailed Internet use policies and regulatory  measures (such as using filtering software) before ever offering public Internet  access. Essentially four interests motivate libraries to institute Internet use  policies and to apply the methods described above to regulate their patrons' use  of the Internet.    First, libraries have sought to  protect patrons (especially children) and staff members from accidentally  viewing sexually explicit images, or other Web pages containing content deemed  harmful, that other patrons are viewing on the Internet. For example, some  librarians who testified described situations in which patrons left sexually  explicit images minimized on an Internet terminal so that the next patron would  see them when they began using it, or in which patrons printed sexually explicit  images from a Web site and left them at a public printer.    Second, libraries have attempted to  protect patrons from unwittingly or accidentally accessing Web pages that they  do not wish to see while they are using the Internet. For example, the  Memphis-Shelby County (Tennessee) Public Library's Internet use policy states  that the library ""employs filtering technology to reduce the possibility that  customers may encounter objectionable content in the form of depictions of full  nudity and sexual acts.""    Third, libraries have sought to keep  patrons (again, especially children) from intentionally accessing sexually  explicit materials or other materials that the library deems inappropriate. For  example, a study of the Tacoma Public Library's Internet use logs for the year  2000 showed that  users  between the ages of 11 and 15 accounted for 41% of the filter blocks that  occurred on library computers. The study, which we credit, concluded that  children and young teens were actively seeking to access sexually explicit  images in the library.  The  Greenville Library's Board of Directors was particularly concerned that patrons  were accessing obscene materials in the public library in violation of South  Carolina's obscenity statute.    Finally, some libraries have  regulated patrons' Internet use to attempt to control patrons' inappropriate (or  illegal) behavior that is thought to stem from viewing Web pages that contain  sexually explicit materials or content that is otherwise deemed unacceptable.     We recognize the concerns that led  several of the public libraries whose librarians and board members testified in  this case to start using Internet filtering software. The testimony of the  Chairman of the Board of the Greenville Public Library is illustrative.   In December 1999, there was  considerable local press coverage in Greenville concerning adult patrons who  routinely used the library to surf the Web for pornography. In response to  public outcry stemming from the newspaper report, the Board of Trustees held a  special board meeting to obtain information and to communicate with the public  concerning the library's provision of Internet access.  At this meeting, the Board learned for the first time of complaints  about children being exposed to pornography that was displayed on the library's  Internet terminals.    In late January to early February of  2000, the library installed privacy screens and recessed terminals in an effort  to restrict the display of sexually explicit Web sites at the  library.   In February, 2000, the Board informed the  library staff that they were expected to be familiar with the South Carolina  obscenity statute and to enforce the policy prohibition on access to obscene  materials, child pornography, or other materials prohibited under applicable  local, state, and federal laws. Staff were told that they were to enforce the  policy by means of a ""tap on the shoulder.""   Prior to adopting its current Internet Use Policy, the Board adopted  an ""Addendum to Current Internet Use Policy."" Under the policy, the Board  temporarily instituted a two-hour time limit per day for Internet use; reduced  substantially the number of computers with Internet access in the library;  reconfigured the location of the computers so that librarians had visual contact  with all Internet-accessible terminals; and removed the privacy screens from  terminals with Internet access.    Even after the Board implemented the  privacy screens and later the ""tap-on-the-shoulder"" policy combined with placing  terminals in view of librarians, the  library experienced a high turnover rate among reference librarians  who worked in view of Internet terminals.  Finding that the policies that it had tried did not prevent the  viewing of sexually explicit materials in the library,  the Board at one point considered  discontinuing Internet access in the library.  The Board finally concluded that the methods  that it had used to regulate Internet use were not sufficient to stem the  behavioral problems that it thought were linked to the availability of  pornographic materials in the library. As a result, it implemented a mandatory  filtering policy.    We note, however, that none of the  libraries proffered by the defendants presented any systematic records or  quantitative comparison of the amount of criminal or otherwise inappropriate  behavior that occurred in their libraries before they began using Internet  filtering software compared to the amount that happened after they installed the  software. The plaintiffs' witnesses also testified that  because public libraries are public places,  incidents involving inappropriate behavior in libraries (sexual and otherwise)  existed long before libraries provided access to the Internet.                                Methods for          Regulating Internet Use     The methods that public libraries use  to regulate Internet use vary greatly. They can be organized into four  categories: (1) channeling patrons' Internet use; (2) separating patrons so that  they will not see what other patrons are viewing; (3) placing Internet terminals  in public view and having librarians observe patrons to make sure that they are  complying with the library's Internet use policy; and (4) using Internet  filtering software.    The first category - channeling  patrons' Internet use - frequently includes offering training to patrons on how  to use the Internet, including how to access the information that they want and  to avoid the materials that they do not want. Another technique that some public  libraries use to direct their patrons to pages that the libraries have  determined to be accurate and valuable is to establish links to ""recommended Web  sites"" from the public library's home page (i.e., the page that appears when  patrons begin a session at one of the library's public Internet terminals).  Librarians select these recommended Web sites by using criteria similar to those  employed in traditional collection development. However, unless the library  determines otherwise, selection of these specific sites does not preclude  patrons from attempting to access other Internet Web sites.    Libraries may extend the ""recommended  Web sites"" method further by limiting patrons' access to only those Web sites  that are reviewed and selected by the library's staff. For example, in 1996, the  Westerville, Ohio Library offered Internet access to children through a service  called the ""Library Channel."" This service was intended to be a means by which  the library could organize the Internet in some fashion for presentation to  patrons. Through the Library Channel, the computers in the children's section of  the library were restricted to 2,000 to 3,000 sites selected by librarians.  After three years, Westerville stopped using the Library Channel system because  it overly constrained the children's ability to access materials on the  Internet, and because the library experienced several technical problems with  the system.   Public libraries also use several  different techniques to separate patrons during Internet sessions so that they  will not see what other patrons are viewing. The simplest way to achieve this  result is to position the library's public Internet terminals so that they are  located away from traffic patterns in the library (and from other terminals),  for example, by placing them so that they face a wall. This method is obviously  constrained by libraries' space limitations and physical layout. Some libraries  have also installed privacy screens on their public Internet terminals. These  screens make a monitor appear blank unless the viewer is looking at it  head-on. (5)   Although the Multnomah and Fort Vancouver Libraries submitted records showing  that they have received few complaints regarding patrons' unwilling exposure to  materials on the Internet, privacy screens do not always prevent library patrons  or employees from inadvertently seeing the materials that another patron is  viewing when passing directly behind a terminal. They also have the drawback of  making it difficult for patrons to work together at a single terminal, or for  librarians to assist patrons at terminals, because it is difficult for two  people to stand side by side and view a screen at the same time. Some library  patrons also find privacy screens to be a hindrance and have attempted to remove  them in order to improve the brightness of the screen or to make the view  better.    Another method that libraries use to  prevent patrons from seeing what other patrons are viewing on their terminals is  the installation of ""recessed monitors."" Recessed monitors are computer screens  that sit below the level of a desk top and are viewed from above. Although  recessed monitors, especially when combined with privacy screens, eliminate  almost all of the possibility of a patron accidentally viewing the contents on  another patron's screen, they suffer from the same drawbacks as privacy screens,  that is, they make it difficult for patrons to work together or with a librarian  at a single terminal. Some librarians also testified that recessed monitors are  costly, but did not indicate how expensive they are compared to privacy screens  or filtering software. A related technique that some public libraries use is to  create a separate children's Internet viewing area, where no adults except those  accompanying children in their care may use the Internet terminals. This serves  the objective of keeping children from inadvertently viewing materials  appropriate only for adults that adults may be viewing on nearby terminals.     A third set of techniques that public  libraries have used to enforce their Internet use policies takes the opposite  tack from the privacy screens/recessed monitors approach by placing all of the  library's public Internet terminals in prominent and visible locations, such as  near the library's reference desk. This approach allows librarians to enforce  their library's Internet use policy by observing what patrons are viewing and  employing the tap-on-the-shoulder policy. Under this approach, when patrons are  viewing materials that are inconsistent with the library's policies, a library  staff member approaches them and asks them to view something else, or may ask  them to end their Internet session. A patron who does not comply with these  requests, or who repeatedly views materials not permitted under the library's  Internet use policy, may have his or her Internet or library privileges  suspended or revoked. But many librarians are uncomfortable with approaching  patrons who are viewing sexually explicit images, finding confrontation  unpleasant. Hence some libraries are reluctant to apply the tap-on-the-shoulder  policy.    The fourth category of methods that  public libraries employ to enforce their Internet use policies, and the one that  gives rise to this case, is the use of Internet filtering software. According to  the June 2000  Survey of Internet Access Management in Public Libraries ,  approximately 7% of libraries with public Internet access had mandated the use  of blocking programs by adult patrons. Some public libraries provide patrons  with the option of using a blocking program, allowing patrons to decide whether  to engage the program when they or their children access the Internet. Other  public libraries require their child patrons to use filtering software, but not  their adult patrons.    Filtering software vendors sell their  products on a subscription basis. The cost of a subscription varies with the  number of computers on which the filtering software will be used. In 2001, the  cost of the Cyber Patrol filtering software was $1,950 for 100 terminal  licenses. The Greenville County Library System pays $2,500 per year for the N2H2  filtering software, and a subscription to the Websense filter costs Westerville  Public Library approximately $1,200 per year.    No evidence was presented on the cost  of privacy screens, recessed monitors, and the tap-on-the-shoulder policy,  relative to the costs of filtering software. Nor did any of the libraries  proffered by the government present any quantitative evidence on the relative  effectiveness of use of privacy screens to prevent patrons from being  unwillingly exposed to sexually explicit material, and the use of filters,  discussed below. No evidence was presented, for example, comparing the number of  patron complaints in those libraries that have tried both  methods.   The librarians who testified at trial  whose libraries use Internet filtering software all provide methods by which  their patrons may ask the library to unblock specific Web sites or pages. Of  these, only the Tacoma Public Library allows patrons to request that a URL be  unblocked without providing any identifying information; Tacoma allows patrons  to request a URL by sending an email from the Internet terminal that the patron  is using that does not contain a return email address for the user. David Biek,  the head librarian at the Tacoma Library's main branch, testified at trial that  the library keeps records that would enable it to know which patrons made  unblocking requests, but does not use that information to connect users with  their requests. Biek also testified that he periodically scans the library's  Internet use logs to search for: (1) URLs that were erroneously blocked, so that  he may unblock them; or (2) URLs that should have been blocked, but were not, in  order to add them to a blocked category list. In the course of scanning the use  logs, Biek has also found what looked like attempts to access child pornography.  In two cases, he communicated his findings to law enforcement and turned over  the logs in response to a subpoena.    At all events, it takes time for  librarians to make decisions about whether to honor patrons' requests to unblock  Web pages. In the libraries proffered by the defendants, unblocking decisions  sometimes take between 24 hours and a week. Moreover, none of these libraries  allows unrestricted access to the Internet pending a determination of the  validity of a Web site blocked by the blocking programs. A few of the  defendants' proffered libraries represented that individual librarians would  have the discretion to allow a patron to have full Internet access on a staff  computer upon request, but none claimed that allowing such access was mandatory,  and patron access is supervised in every instance. None of these libraries makes  differential unblocking decisions based on the patrons' age. Unblocking  decisions are usually made identically for adults and minors. Unblocking  decisions even for adults are usually based on suitability of the Web site for  minors.    It is apparent that many patrons are  reluctant or unwilling to ask librarians to unblock Web pages or sites that  contain only materials that might be deemed personal or embarrassing, even if  they are not sexually explicit or pornographic. We credit the testimony of  Emmalyn Rood, discussed above, that she would have been unwilling as a young  teen to ask a librarian to disable filtering software so that she could view  materials concerning gay and lesbian issues. We also credit the testimony of  Mark Brown, who stated that he would have been too embarrassed to ask a  librarian to disable filtering software if it had impeded his ability to  research treatments and cosmetic surgery options for his mother when she was  diagnosed with breast cancer.    The pattern of patron requests to  unblock specific URLs in the various libraries involved in this case also  confirms our finding that patrons are largely unwilling to make unblocking  requests unless they are permitted to do so anonymously. For example,   the Fulton County Library  receives only about 6 unblocking requests each year, the Greenville Public  Library has received only 28 unblocking requests since August 21, 2000, and the  Westerville, Ohio Library has received fewer than 10 unblocking requests since  1999.  In light of the fact  that a substantial amount of overblocking occurs in these very libraries,   see infra  Subsection II.E.4, we find that the lack of unblocking  requests in these libraries does not reflect the effectiveness of the filters,  but rather reflects patrons' reluctance to ask librarians to unblock sites.               Internet Filtering      Technology                       What Is Filtering        Software, Who Makes It, and What Does It Do?       Commercially available products that  can be configured to block or filter access to certain material on the Internet  are among the ""technology protection measures"" that may be used to attempt to  comply with CIPA. There are numerous filtering software products available  commercially. Three network-based filtering products - SurfControl's Cyber  Patrol, N2H2's Bess/i2100, and Secure Computing's SmartFilter - currently have  the lion's share of the public library market.  The parties in this case deposed  representatives from these three companies.  Websense, another network-based blocking  product, is also currently used in the public library market, and was discussed  at trial.    Filtering software may be installed  either on an individual computer or on a computer network.  Network-based filtering software products are  designed for use on a network of computers and funnel requests for Internet  content through a centralized network device. Of the various commercially  available blocking products, network-based products are the ones generally  marketed to institutions, such as public libraries, that provide Internet access  through multiple terminals.    Filtering programs function in a  fairly simple way. When an Internet user requests access to a certain Web site  or page, either by entering a domain name or IP address into a Web browser, or  by clicking on a link, the filtering software checks that domain name or IP  address against a previously compiled ""control list"" that may contain up to  hundreds of thousands of URLs. The three companies deposed in this case have  control lists containing between 200,000 and 600,000 URLs. These lists determine  which URLs will be blocked.    Filtering software companies divide  their control lists   into multiple categories for which they have  created unique definitions. SurfControl uses 40 such categories, N2H2 uses 35  categories (and seven ""exception"" categories), Websense uses 30 categories, and  Secure Computing uses 30 categories.  Filtering software customers choose which categories of URLs they  wish to enable. A user ""enables"" a category in a filtering  program   by configuring the program to block all of the  Web pages listed in that category.    The following is a list of the  categories offered by each of these four filtering programs.  SurfControl's Cyber Patrol offers the  following categories: Adult/Sexually Explicit; Advertisements; Arts &  Entertainment; Chat; Computing & Internet; Criminal Skills; Drugs, Alcohol  & Tobacco; Education; Finance & Investment; Food & Drink; Gambling;  Games; Glamour & Intimate Apparel; Government & Politics; Hacking; Hate  Speech; Health & Medicine; Hobbies & Recreation; Hosting Sites; Job  Search & Career Development; Kids' Sites; Lifestyle & Culture; Motor  Vehicles; News; Personals & Dating; Photo Searches; Real Estate; Reference;  Religion; Remote Proxies; Sex Education; Search Engines; Shopping; Sports;  Streaming Media; Travel; Usenet News; Violence; Weapons; and Web-based Email.     N2H2 offers the following categories: Adults Only; Alcohol; Auction;  Chat; Drugs; Electronic Commerce; Employment Search; Free Mail; Free Pages;  Gambling; Games; Hate/Discrimination; Illegal; Jokes; Lingerie; Message/Bulletin  Boards; Murder/Suicide; News; Nudity; Personal Information; Personals;  Pornography; Profanity; Recreation/Entertainment; School Cheating Information;  Search Engines; Search Terms; Sex; Sports; Stocks; Swimsuits; Tasteless/Gross;  Tobacco; Violence; and Weapons. The ""Nudity"" category purports to block only  ""non-pornographic"" images. The ""Sex"" category is intended to block only those  depictions of sexual activity that are not intended to arouse. The  ""Tasteless/Gross"" category includes contents such as ""tasteless humor"" and  ""graphic medical or accident scene photos.""   Additionally, N2H2 offers seven ""exception categories."" These  exception categories include Education, Filtered Search Engine, For Kids,  History, Medical, Moderated, and Text/Spoken Only. When an exception category is  enabled, access to any Web site or page via a URL associated with both a  category and an exception, for example, both ""Sex"" and ""Education,"" will be  allowed, even if the customer has enabled the product to otherwise block the  category ""Sex.""    As of November 15, 2001, of  those Web sites categorized by N2H2 as ""Sex,"" 3.6% were also categorized as  ""Education,"" 2.9% as ""Medical,"" and 1.6% as ""History.""    Websense offers the following categories: Abortion Advocacy; Advocacy  Groups; Adult Material; Business & Economy; Drugs; Education; Entertainment;  Gambling; Games; Government; Health; Illegal/Questionable; Information  Technology; Internet Communication; Job Search; Militancy/Extremist; News &  Media; Productivity Management; Bandwidth Management; Racism/Hate; Religion;  Shopping; Society & Lifestyle; Special Events; Sports; Tasteless; Travel;  Vehicles; Violence; and Weapons. The ""Adult"" category includes ""full or partial  nudity of individuals,"" as well as sites offering ""light adult humor and  literature"" and ""[s]exually explicit language."" The ""Sexuality/Pornography""  category includes,  inter alia , ""hard-core adult humor and literature""  and ""[s]exually explicit language."" The ""Tasteless"" category includes  ""hard-to-stomach sites, including offensive, worthless or useless sites,  grotesque or lurid depictions of bodily harm."" The ""Hacking"" category blocks  ""sites providing information on or promoting illegal or questionable access to  or use of communications equipment and/or software.""    SmartFilter offers the following categories: Anonymizers/Translators;  Art & Culture; Chat; Criminal Skills; Cults/Occult; Dating; Drugs;  Entertainment; Extreme/Obscene/Violence; Gambling; Games; General News; Hate  Speech; Humor; Investing; Job Search; Lifestyle; Mature; MP3 Sites; Nudity;  On-line Sales; Personal Pages; Politics, Opinion & Religion; Portal Sites;  Self-Help/Health; Sex; Sports; Travel; Usenet News; and Webmail.    Most importantly, no category  definition used by filtering software companies is identical to CIPA's  definitions of visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful  to minors. And category definitions and categorization decisions are made  without reference to local community standards. Moreover, there is no judicial  involvement in the creation of filtering software companies' category  definitions and no judicial determination is made before these companies  categorize a Web page or site.    Each filtering software company  associates each URL in its control list with a ""tag"" or other identifier that  indicates the company's evaluation of whether the content or features of the Web  site or page accessed via that URL meets one or more of its category  definitions. If a user attempts to access a Web site or page that is blocked by  the filter, the user is immediately presented with a screen that indicates that  a block has occurred as a result of the operation of the filtering software.  These ""denial screens"" appear only at the point that a user attempts to access a  site or page in an enabled category.    All four of the filtering programs on  which evidence was presented allow users to customize the category lists that  exist on their own PCs or servers by adding or removing specific URLs. For  example, if a public librarian charged with administering a library's Internet  terminals comes across a Web site that he or she finds objectionable that is not  blocked by the filtering program that his or her library is using, then the  librarian may add that URL to a category list that exists only on the library's  network, and it would thereafter be blocked under that category. Similarly, a  customer may remove individual URLs from category lists. Importantly, however,  no one but the filtering companies has access to the complete list of URLs in  any category.  The actual URLs  or IP addresses of the Web sites or pages contained in filtering software  vendors' category lists are considered to be proprietary information, and are  unavailable for review by customers or the general public, including   the proprietors of Web sites  that are blocked by filtering software . (6)     Filtering software companies do not  generally notify the proprietors of Web sites when they block their sites. The  only way to discover which URLs are blocked and which are not blocked by any  particular filtering company is by testing individual URLs with filtering  software, or by entering URLs one by one into the ""URL checker"" that most  filtering software companies provide on their Web sites. Filtering software  companies will entertain requests for recategorization from proprietors of Web  sites that discover their sites are blocked. Because new pages are constantly  being added to the Web, filtering companies provide their customers with  periodic updates of category lists. Once a particular Web page or site is  categorized, however, filtering companies generally do not re-review the  contents of that page or site unless they receive a request to do so, even  though the content on individual Web pages and sites changes frequently.                       The Methods that        Filtering Companies Use to Compile Category Lists          While the way in which filtering  programs operate is conceptually straightforward - by comparing a requested URL  to a previously compiled list of URLs and blocking access to the content at that  URL if it appears on the list - accurately compiling and categorizing URLs to  form the category lists is a more complex process that is impossible to conduct  with any high degree of accuracy. The specific methods that filtering software  companies use to compile and categorize control lists are, like the lists  themselves, proprietary information. We will therefore set forth only general  information on the various types of methods that all filtering companies deposed  in this case use, and the sources of error that are at once inherent in those  methods and unavoidable given the current architecture of the Internet and the  current state of the art in automated classification systems. We base our  understanding of these methods largely on the detailed testimony and expert  report of Dr. Geoffrey Nunberg, which we credit. The plaintiffs offered, and the  Court qualified, Nunberg as an expert witness on automated classification  systems. (7)     When compiling and categorizing URLs for their category  lists, filtering software companies go through two distinct phases. First, they  must collect or ""harvest"" the relevant URLs from the vast number of sites that  exist on the Web. Second, they must sort through the URLs they have collected to  determine under which of the company's self-defined categories (if any), they  should be classified. These tasks necessarily result in a tradeoff between  overblocking (i.e., the blocking of content that does not meet the category  definitions established by CIPA or by the filtering software companies), and  underblocking (i.e., leaving off of a control list a URL that contains content  that would meet the category definitions defined by CIPA or the filtering  software companies).                                The ""Harvesting""          Phase     Filtering  software companies, given their limited resources, do not attempt to index or  classify all of the billions of pages that exist on the Web. Instead, the set of  pages that they attempt to examine and classify is restricted to a small portion  of the Web. The companies use a variety of automated and manual methods to  identify a universe of Web sites and pages to ""harvest"" for classification.  These methods include: entering certain key words into search engines; following  links from a variety of online directories (e.g., generalized directories like  Yahoo or various specialized directories, such as those that provide links to  sexually explicit content); reviewing lists of newly-registered domain names;  buying or licensing lists of URLs from third parties; ""mining"" access logs  maintained by their customers; and reviewing other submissions from customers  and the public.  The goal of  each of these methods is to identify as many URLs as possible that are likely to  contain content that falls within the filtering companies' category definitions.     The first method, entering certain  keywords into commercial search engines, suffers from several limitations.  First, the Web pages that may be ""harvested"" through this method are limited to  those pages that search engines have already identified. However, as noted  above, a substantial portion of the Web is not even theoretically indexable  (because it is not linked to by any previously known page), and only  approximately 50% of the pages that are theoretically indexable have actually  been indexed by search engines. We are satisfied that the remainder of the  indexable Web, and the vast ""Deep Web,"" which cannot currently be indexed,  includes materials that meet CIPA's categories of visual depictions that are  obscene, child pornography, and harmful to minors. These portions of the Web  cannot presently be harvested through the methods that filtering software  companies use (except through reporting by customers or by observing users' log  files), because they are not linked to other known pages. A user can, however,  gain access to a Web site in the unindexed Web or the Deep Web if the Web site's  proprietor or some other third party informs the user of the site's URL. Some  Web sites, for example, send out mass email advertisements containing the site's  URL, the spamming process we have described above.    Second, the search engines that  software companies use for harvesting are able to search text only, not images.   This is of critical  importance, because CIPA, by its own terms, covers only ""visual depictions."" 20  U.S.C. § 9134(f)(1)(A)(i); 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(5)(B)(i). Image recognition  technology is immature, ineffective, and unlikely to improve substantially in  the near future. None of the filtering software companies deposed in this case  employs image recognition technology when harvesting or categorizing URLs. Due  to the reliance on automated text analysis and the absence of image recognition  technology, a Web page with sexually explicit images and no text cannot be  harvested using a search engine. This problem is complicated by the fact that  Web site publishers may use image files rather than text to represent words,  i.e., they may use a file that computers understand to be a picture, like a  photograph of a printed word, rather than regular text, making automated review  of their textual content impossible. For example, if the Playboy Web site  displays its name using a logo rather than regular text, a search engine would  not see or recognize the Playboy name in that logo.    In addition to collecting URLs  through search engines and Web directories (particularly those specializing in  sexually explicit sites or other categories relevant to one of the filtering  companies' category definitions), and by mining user logs and collecting URLs  submitted by users, the filtering companies expand their list of harvested URLs  by using ""spidering"" software that can ""crawl"" the lists of pages produced by  the previous four methods, following their links downward to bring back the  pages to which they link (and the pages to which those pages link, and so on,  but usually down only a few levels). This spidering software uses the same type  of technology that commercial Web search engines use.    While useful in expanding the number  of relevant URLs, the ability to retrieve additional pages through this approach  is limited by the architectural feature of the Web that page-to-page links tend  to converge rather than diverge. That means that the more pages from which one  spiders downward through links, the smaller the proportion of new sites one will  uncover; if spidering the links of 1000 sites retrieved through a search engine  or Web directory turns up 500 additional distinct adult sites, spidering an  additional 1000 sites may turn up, for example, only 250 additional distinct  sites, and the proportion of new sites uncovered will continue to diminish as  more pages are spidered.    These limitations on the technology used to harvest a set of URLs for  review will necessarily lead to substantial underblocking of material with  respect to both the category definitions employed by filtering software  companies and CIPA's definitions of visual depictions that are obscene, child  pornography, or harmful to minors.                                The ""Winnowing"" or          Categorization Phase     Once the URLs have been harvested, some  filtering software companies use automated key word analysis tools to evaluate  the content and/or features of Web sites or pages accessed via a particular URL  and to tentatively prioritize or categorize them. This process may be  characterized as ""winnowing"" the harvested URLs.   Automated systems currently used by filtering software vendors to  prioritize, and to categorize or tentatively categorize the content and/or  features of a Web site or page accessed via a particular URL operate by means of  (1) simple key word searching, and (2) the use of statistical algorithms that  rely on the frequency and structure of various linguistic features in a Web  page's text. The automated systems used to categorize pages do not include image  recognition technology.  All  of the filtering companies deposed in the case also employ human review of some  or all collected Web pages at some point during the process of categorizing Web  pages. As with the harvesting process, each technique employed in the winnowing  process is subject to limitations that can result in both overblocking and  underblocking.    First, simple key-word-based filters  are subject to the obvious limitation that no string of words can identify all  sites that contain sexually explicit content, and most strings of words are  likely to appear in Web sites that are not properly classified as containing  sexually explicit content. As noted above, filtering software companies also use  more sophisticated automated classification systems for the statistical  classification of texts. These systems assign weights to words or other textual  features and use algorithms to determine whether a text belongs to a certain  category. These algorithms sometimes make reference to the position of a word  within a text or its relative proximity to other words. The weights are usually  determined by machine learning methods (often described as ""artificial  intelligence""). In this procedure, which resembles an automated form of trial  and error, a system is given a ""training set"" consisting of documents  preclassified into two or more groups, along with a set of features that might  be potentially useful in classifying the sets. The system then ""learns"" rules  that assign weights to those features according to how well they work in  classification, and assigns each new document to a category with a certain  probability.    Notwithstanding their ""artificial  intelligence"" description, automated text classification systems are unable to  grasp many distinctions between types of content that would be obvious to a  human. And of critical importance, no presently conceivable technology can make  the judgments necessary to determine whether a visual depiction fits the legal  definitions of obscenity, child pornography, or harmful to minors.     Finally, all the filtering software  companies deposed in this case use some form of human review in their process of  winnowing and categorizing Web pages, although one company admitted to  categorizing some Web pages without any human review .  SmartFilter states that ""the final categorization of every Web site  is done by a human reviewer."" Another filtering company asserts that of the  10,000 to 30,000 Web pages that enter the ""work queue"" to be categorized each  day, two to three percent of those are automatically categorized by their  PornByRef system (which only applies to materials classified in the pornography  category), and the remainder are categorized by human review. SurfControl also  states that no URL is ever added to its database without human review.     Human review of Web pages has the  advantage of allowing more nuanced, if not more accurate, interpretations than  automated classification systems are capable of making, but suffers from its own  sources of error.  The  filtering software companies involved here have limited staff, of between eight  and a few dozen people, available for hand reviewing Web pages. The reviewers  that are employed by these companies base their categorization decisions on both  the text and the visual depictions that appear on the sites or pages they are  assigned to review. Human reviewers generally focus on English language Web  sites, and are generally not required to be multi-lingual.    Given the speed at which human  reviewers must work to keep up with even a fraction of the approximately 1.5  million pages added to the publicly indexable Web each day, human error is  inevitable. Errors are likely to result from boredom or lack of attentiveness,  overzealousness, or a desire to ""err on the side of caution"" by screening out  material that might be offensive to some customers, even if it does not fit  within any of the company's category definitions. None of the filtering  companies trains its reviewers in the legal definitions concerning what is  obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors, and none instructs reviewers  to take community standards into account when making categorization decisions.     Perhaps because of limitations on the  number of human reviewers and because of the large number of new pages that are  added to the Web every day, filtering companies also widely engage in the  practice of categorizing entire Web sites at the ""root URL,"" rather than  engaging in a more fine-grained analysis of the individual pages within a Web  site. For example, the filtering software companies deposed in this case all  categorize the entire Playboy Web site as Adult, Sexually Explicit, or  Pornography. They do not differentiate between pages within the site containing  sexually explicit images or text, and for example, pages containing no sexually  explicit content, such as the text of interviews of celebrities or politicians.  If the ""root"" or ""top-level"" URL of a Web site is given a category tag, then  access to all content on that Web site will be blocked if the assigned category  is enabled by a customer.    In some cases, whole Web sites are  blocked because the filtering companies focus only on the content of the home  page that is accessed by entering the root URL. Entire Web sites containing  multiple Web pages are commonly categorized without human review of each  individual page on that site. Web sites that may contain multiple Web pages and  that require authentication or payment for access are commonly categorized based  solely on a human reviewer's evaluation of the pages that may be viewed prior to  reaching the authentication or payment page.    Because there may be hundreds or  thousands of pages under a root URL, filtering companies make it their primary  mission to categorize the root URL, and categorize subsidiary pages if the need  arises or if there is time. This form of overblocking is called ""inheritance,""  because lower-level pages inherit the categorization of the root URL without  regard to their specific content. In some cases, ""reverse inheritance"" also  occurs, i.e., parent sites inherit the classification of pages in a lower level  of the site. This might happen when pages with sexual content appear in a Web  site that is devoted primarily to non-sexual content. For example, N2H2's Bess  filtering product classifies every page in the Salon.com Web site, which  contains a wide range of news and cultural commentary, as ""Sex, Profanity,""  based on the fact that the site includes a regular column that deals with sexual  issues.   Blocking by both domain name and IP  address is another practice in which filtering companies engage that is a  function both of the architecture of the Web and of the exigencies of dealing  with the rapidly expanding number of Web pages.  The category lists maintained by filtering  software companies can include URLs in either their human-readable domain name  address form, their numeric IP address form, or both.  Through ""virtual hosting"" services, hundreds  of thousands of Web sites with distinct domain names may share a single numeric  IP address. To the extent that filtering companies block the IP addresses of  virtual hosting services, they will necessarily block a substantial amount of  content without reviewing it, and will likely overblock a substantial amount of  content.    Another technique that filtering companies use in order to deal with  a structural feature of the Internet is blocking the root level URLs of  so-called ""loophole"" Web sites. These are Web sites that provide access to a  particular Web page, but display in the user's browser a URL that is different  from the URL with which the particular page is usually associated. Because of  this feature, they provide a ""loophole"" that can be used to get around filtering  software, i.e., they display a URL that is different from the one that appears  on the filtering company's control list. ""Loophole"" Web sites include caches of  Web pages that have been removed from their original location, ""anonymizer""  sites, and translation sites.    Caches are archived copies that some  search engines, such as Google, keep of the Web pages they index. The cached  copy stored by Google will have a URL that is different from the original URL.  Because Web sites often change rapidly, caches are the only way to access pages  that have been taken down, revised, or have changed their URLs for some reason.  For example, a magazine might place its current stories under a given URL, and  replace them monthly with new stories. If a user wanted to find an article  published six months ago, he or she would be unable to access it if not for  Google's cached version.    Some sites on the Web serve as a  proxy or intermediary between a user and another Web page. When using a proxy  server, a user does not access the page from its original URL, but rather from  the URL of the proxy server. One type of proxy service is an ""anonymizer."" Users  may access Web sites indirectly via an anonymizer when they do not want the Web  site they are visiting to be able to determine the IP address from which they  are accessing the site, or to leave ""cookies"" on their browser. (8)   Some proxy servers can be used to attempt to translate Web page content from one  language to another. Rather than directly accessing the original Web page in its  original language, users can instead indirectly access the page via a proxy  server offering translation features.    As noted above, filtering companies  often block loophole sites, such as caches, anonymizers, and translation sites.  The practice of blocking loophole sites necessarily results in a significant  amount of overblocking, because the vast majority of the pages that are cached,  for example, do not contain content that would match a filtering company's  category definitions. Filters that do not block these loophole sites, however,  may enable users to access any URL on the Web via the loophole site, thus  resulting in substantial underblocking.                                The Process for          ""Re-Reviewing"" Web Pages After Their Initial          Categorization     Most filtering software companies do not engage in subsequent reviews  of categorized sites or pages on a scheduled basis. Priority is placed on  reviewing and categorizing new sites and pages, rather than on re-reviewing  already categorized sites and pages. Typically, a filtering software vendor's  previous categorization of a Web site is not re-reviewed for accuracy when new  pages are added to the Web site. To the extent the Web site was previously  categorized as a whole, the new pages added to the site usually share the  categorization assigned by the blocking product vendor.  This necessarily results in both over- and  underblocking, because, as noted above, the content of Web pages and Web sites  changes relatively rapidly.    In addition to the content on Web  sites or pages changing rapidly, Web sites themselves may disappear and be  replaced by sites with entirely different content. If an IP address associated  with a particular Web site is blocked under a particular category and the Web  site goes out of existence, then the IP address likely would be reassigned to a  different Web site, either by an Internet service provider or by a registration  organization, such as the American Registry for Internet Numbers,  see   http://www.arin.net,/ . In that case,  the site that received the reassigned IP address would likely be miscategorized.  Because filtering companies do not engage in systematic re-review of their  category lists, such a site would likely remain miscategorized unless someone  submitted it to the filtering company for re-review, increasing the incidence of  over- and underblocking.    This failure to re-review Web pages  primarily increases a filtering company's rate of overblocking. However, if a  filtering company does not re-review Web pages after it determines that they do  not fall into any of its blocking categories, then that would result in  underblocking (because, for example, a page might add sexually explicit  content).                      The Inherent Tradeoff        Between Overblocking and Underblocking    There is an inherent tradeoff between  any filter's rate of overblocking (which information scientists also call  ""precision"") and its rate of underblocking (which is also referred to as  ""recall""). The rate of overblocking or precision is measured by the proportion  of the things a classification system assigns to a certain category that are  appropriately classified. The plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Nunberg, provided the  hypothetical example of a classification system that is asked to pick out  pictures of dogs from a database consisting of 1000 pictures of animals, of  which 80 were actually dogs. If it returned 100 hits, of which 80 were in fact  pictures of dogs, and the remaining 20 were pictures of cats, horses, and deer,  we would say that the system identified dog pictures with a precision of 80%.  This would be analogous to a filter that overblocked at a rate of 20%.     The recall measure involves  determining what proportion of the actual members of a category the  classification system has been able to identify. For example, if the  hypothetical animal-picture database contained a total of 200 pictures of dogs,  and the system identified 80 of them and failed to identify 120, it would have  performed with a recall of 40%. This would be analogous to a filter that  underblocked 60% of the material in a category.    In automated classification systems, there is  always a tradeoff between precision and recall. In the animal-picture example,  the recall could be improved by using a looser set of criteria to identify the  dog pictures in the set, such as any animal with four legs, and all the dogs  would be identified, but cats and other animals would also be included, with a  resulting loss of precision. The same tradeoff exists between rates of  overblocking and underblocking in filtering systems that use automated  classification systems. For example, an automated system that classifies any Web  page that contains the word ""sex"" as sexually explicit will underblock much  less, but overblock much more, than a system that classifies any Web page  containing the phrase ""free pictures of people having sex"" as sexually  explicit.   This tradeoff between overblocking  and underblocking also applies not just to automated classification systems, but  also to filters that use only human review. Given the approximately two billion  pages that exist on the Web, the 1.5 million new pages that are added daily, and  the rate at which content on existing pages changes, if a filtering company  blocks only those Web pages that have been reviewed by humans, it will be  impossible, as a practical matter, to avoid vast amounts of underblocking.  Techniques used by human reviewers such as blocking at the IP address level,  domain name level, or directory level reduce the rates of underblocking, but  necessarily increase the rates of overblocking, as discussed above.     To use a simple example, it would be  easy to design a filter intended to block sexually explicit speech that  completely avoids overblocking. Such a filter would have only a single sexually  explicit Web site on its control list, which could be re-reviewed daily to  ensure that its content does not change. While there would be no overblocking  problem with such a filter, such a filter would have a severe underblocking  problem, as it would fail to block all the sexually explicit speech on the Web  other than the one site on its control list. Similarly, it would also be easy to  design a filter intended to block sexually explicit speech that completely  avoids underblocking. Such a filter would operate by permitting users to view  only a single Web site, e.g., the Sesame Street Web site. While there would be  no underblocking problem with such a filter, it would have a severe overblocking  problem, as it would block access to millions of non-sexually explicit sites on  the Web other than the Sesame Street site.    While it is thus quite simple to  design a filter that does not overblock, and equally simple to design a filter  that does not underblock, it is currently impossible, given the Internet's size,  rate of growth, rate of change, and architecture, and given the state of the art  of automated classification systems, to develop a filter that neither  underblocks nor overblocks a substantial amount of speech. The more effective a  filter is at blocking Web sites in a given category, the more the filter will  necessarily overblock. Any filter that is reasonably effective in preventing  users from accessing sexually explicit content on the Web will necessarily block  substantial  amounts of  non-sexually explicit speech.                      Attempts to Quantify Filtering Programs' Rates of Over- and        Underblocking    The government presented three studies, two from expert witnesses,  and one from a librarian fact witness who conducted a study using Internet use  logs from his own library, that attempt to quantify the over- and underblocking  rates of five different filtering programs. The plaintiffs presented one expert  witness who attempted to quantify the rates of over- and underblocking for  various programs. Each of these attempts to quantify rates of over- and  underblocking suffers from various methodological flaws.    The fundamental problem with  calculating over- and underblocking rates is selecting a universe of Web sites  or Web pages to serve as the set to be tested. The studies that the parties  submitted in this case took two different approaches to this problem. Two of the  studies, one prepared by the plaintiffs' expert witness Chris Hunter, a graduate  student at the University of Pennsylvania, and the other prepared by the  defendants' expert, Chris Lemmons of eTesting Laboratories, in Research Triangle  Park, North Carolina, approached this problem by compiling two separate lists of  Web sites, one of URLs that they deemed should be blocked according to the  filters' criteria, and another of URLs that they deemed should not be blocked  according to the filters' criteria. They compiled these lists by choosing Web  sites from the results of certain key word searches. (9)   The problem with this selection method is that it is neither random, nor does it  necessarily approximate the universe of Web pages that library patrons visit.     The two other studies, one by David  Biek, head librarian at the Tacoma Public Library's main branch, and one by Cory  Finnell of Certus Consulting Group, of Seattle, Washington, chose actual logs of  Web pages visited by library patrons during specific time periods as the  universe of Web pages to analyze. This method, while surely not as accurate as a  truly random sample of the indexed Web would be (assuming it would be possible  to take such a sample), has the virtue of using the actual Web sites that  library patrons visited during a specific period. Because library patrons  selected the universe of Web sites that Biek and Finnell's studies analyzed,  this removes the possibility of bias resulting from the study author's selection  of the universe of sites to be reviewed. We find that the Lemmons and Hunter  studies are of little probative value because of the methodology used to select  the sample universe of Web sites to be tested. We will therefore focus on the  studies conducted by Finnell and Biek in trying to ascertain estimates of the  rates of over- and underblocking that takes place when filters are used in  public libraries.    The government hired expert witness  Cory Finnell to study the Internet logs compiled by the public libraries systems  in Tacoma, Washington; Westerville, Ohio; and Greenville, South  Carolina.   Each of these libraries uses filtering  software that keeps a log of information about individual Web site requests made  by library patrons.  Finnell,  whose consulting firm specializes in data analysis, has substantial experience  evaluating Internet access logs generated on networked systems. He spent more  than a year developing a reporting tool for N2H2, and, in the course of that  work, acquired a familiarity with the design and operation of Internet filtering  products.    The Tacoma library uses Cyber Patrol  filtering software, and logs information only on sites that were blocked.  Finnell worked from a list of all sites that were blocked in the Tacoma public  library in the month of August 2001. The Westerville library uses the Websense  filtering product, and logs information on both blocked sites and non-blocked  sites. When the logs reach a certain size, they are overwritten by new usage  logs. Because of this overwriting feature, logs were available to Finnell only  for the relatively short period from October 1, 2001 to October 3, 2001. The  Greenville library uses N2H2's filtering product and logs both blocked sites and  sites that patrons accessed. The logs contain more than 500,000 records per day.  Because of the volume of the records, Finnell restricted his analysis to the  period from August 2, 2001 to August 15, 2001.    Finnell calculated an overblocking  rate for each of the three libraries by examining the host Web site containing  each of the blocked pages. He did not employ a sampling technique, but instead  examined each blocked Web site. If the contents of a host Web site or the pages  within the Web site were consistent with the filtering product's definition of  the category under which the site was blocked, Finnell considered it to be an  accurate block. Finnell and three others, two of whom were temporary employees,  examined the Web sites to determine whether they were consistent with the  filtering companies' category definitions. Their review was, of course,  necessarily limited by: (1) the clarity of the filtering companies' category  definitions; (2) Finnell's and his employees' interpretations of the  definitions; and (3) human error. The study's reliability is also undercut by  the fact that Finnell failed to archive the blocked Web pages as they existed  either at the point that a patron in one of the three libraries was denied  access or when Finnell and his team reviewed the pages. It is therefore  impossible for anyone to check the accuracy and consistency of Finnell's review  team, or to know whether the pages contained the same content when the block  occurred as they did when Finnell's team reviewed them. This is a key flaw,  because the results of the study depend on individual determinations as to  overblocking and underblocking, in which Finnell and his team were required to  compare what they saw on the Web pages that they reviewed with standard  definitions provided by the filtering company.    Tacoma library's Cyber Patrol  software blocked 836 unique Web sites during the month of August. Finnell  determined that 783 of those blocks were accurate and that 53 were inaccurate. (10)   The error rate for Cyber Patrol was therefore estimated to be 6.34%, and the  true error rate was estimated with 95% confidence to lie within the range of  4.69% to 7.99%. (11)   Finnell and his team reviewed 185 unique Web sites that were blocked by  Westerville Library's Websense filter during the logged period and determined  that 158 of them were accurate and that 27 of them were inaccurate. He therefore  estimated the Websense filter's overblocking rate at 14.59% with a 95%  confidence interval of 9.51% to 19.68%. Additionally, Finnell examined 1,674  unique Web sites that were blocked by the Greenville Library's N2H2 filter  during the relevant period and determined that 1,520 were accurate and that 87  were inaccurate. This yields an estimated overblocking rate of 5.41% and a 95%  confidence interval of 4.33% to 6.55%.   Finnell's methodology was materially  flawed in that it understates the rate of overblocking for the following  reasons. First, patrons from the three libraries knew that the filters were  operating, and may have been deterred from attempting to access Web sites that  they perceived to be ""borderline"" sites, i.e., those that may or may not have  been appropriately filtered according to the filtering companies' category  definitions. Second, in their cross-examination of Finnell, the plaintiffs  offered screen shots of a number of Web sites that, according to Finnell, had  been appropriately blocked, but that Finnell admitted contained only benign  materials. Finnell's explanation was that the Web sites must have changed  between the time when he conducted the study and the time of the trial, but  because he did not archive the images as they existed when his team reviewed  them for the study, there is no way to verify this. Third, because of the way in  which Finnell counted blocked Web sites - i.e., if separate patrons attempted to  reach the same Web site, or one or more patrons attempted to access more than  one page on a single Web site, Finnell counted these attempts as a single block,   see supra  note 10 - his results necessarily understate the number of  times that patrons were erroneously denied access to information.     At all events, there is no doubt that  Finnell's estimated rates of overblocking, which are based on the filtering  companies' own category definitions, significantly understate the rate of  overblocking with respect to CIPA's category definitions for filtering for  adults. The filters used in the Tacoma, Westerville, and Greenville libraries  were configured to block, among other things, images of full nudity and sexually  explicit materials. There is no dispute, however, that these categories are far  broader than CIPA's categories of visual depictions that are obscene, or child  pornography, the two categories of material that libraries subject to CIPA must  certify that they filter during adults' use of the Internet.    Finnell's study also calculated  underblocking rates with respect to the Westerville and Greenville Libraries  (both of which logged not only their blocked sites, but all sites visited by  their patrons), by taking random samples of URLs from the list of sites that  were not blocked. The study used a sample of 159 sites that were accessed by  Westerville patrons and determined that only one of them should have been  blocked under the software's category definitions, yielding an underblocking  rate of 0.6%. Given the size of the sample, the 95% confidence interval is 0% to  1.86%. The study examined a sample of 254 Web sites accessed by patrons in  Greenville and found that three of them should have been blocked under the  filtering software's category definitions. This results in an estimated  underblocking rate of 1.2% with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 0% to  2.51%.    We do not credit Finnell's estimates  of the rates of underblocking in the Westerville and Greenville public libraries  for several reasons. First,  Finnell's estimates likely understate the actual rate of  underblocking because patrons, who knew that filtering programs were operating  in the Greenville and Westerville Libraries, may have refrained from attempting  to access sites with sexually explicit materials, or other contents that they  knew would probably meet a filtering program's blocked categories. Second, and  most importantly, we think that the formula that Finnell used to calculate the  rate of underblocking in these two libraries is not as meaningful as the formula  that information scientists typically use to calculate a rate of  recall , which we describe  above in Subsection II.E.3. As Dr. Nunberg explained, the standard method that  information scientists use to calculate a rate of recall is to sort a set of  items into two groups, those that fall into a particular category (e.g., those  that should have been blocked by a filter) and those that do not. The rate of  recall is then calculated by dividing the number of items that the system  correctly identified as belonging to the category by the total number of items  in the category.    In the example above, we discussed a  database that contained 1000 photographs. Assume that 200 of these photographs  were pictures of dogs. If, for example, a classification system designed to  identify pictures of dogs  identified 80 of the dog pictures and failed to identify 120, it  would have performed with a recall rate of 40%. This would be analogous to a  filter that underblocked at a rate of 60%.  To calculate the recall rate of the filters  in the Westerville and Greenville public libraries in accordance with the  standard method described above, Finnell should have taken a sample of sites  from the libraries' Internet use logs (including both sites that were blocked  and sites that were not), and divided the number of sites in the sample that the  filter incorrectly failed to block by the total number of sites in the sample  that should have been blocked. What Finnell did instead was to take a sample of  sites that were not blocked, and divide the total number of sites in this sample  by the number of sites in the sample that should have been blocked. This made  the denominator that Finnell used much larger than it would have been had he  used the standard method for calculating recall, consequently making the  underblocking rate that he calculated much lower than it would have been under  the standard method. (12)   Moreover,  despite the relatively low rates of underblocking that Finnell's study found,  librarians from several of the libraries proffered by defendants that use  blocking products, including Greenville, Tacoma, and Westerville, testified that  there are instances of underblocking in their libraries.  No quantitative evidence was presented  comparing the effectiveness of filters and other alternative methods used by  libraries to prevent patrons from accessing visual depictions that are obscene,  child pornography, or in the case of minors, harmful to minors.    Biek undertook a similar study of the  overblocking rates that result from the Tacoma Library's use of the Cyber Patrol  software. He began with the 3,733 individual blocks that occurred in the Tacoma  Library in October 2000 and drew from this data set a random sample of 786 URLs.  He calculated two rates of overblocking, one with respect to the Tacoma  Library's policy on Internet use -  that the pictorial content of the site may not include ""graphic  materials depicting full nudity and sexual acts which are portrayed obviously  and exclusively for sensational or pornographic purposes"" - and the other with  respect to Cyber Patrol's own category definitions.  He estimated that Cyber Patrol overblocked 4%  of all Web pages in October 2000 with respect to the definitions of the Tacoma  Library's Internet Policy and 2% of all pages with respect to Cyber Patrol's own  category definitions. (13)      It is difficult to determine how  reliable Biek's conclusions are, because he did not keep records of the raw data  that he used in his study; nor did he archive images of the Web pages as they  looked when he made the determination whether they were properly classified by  the Cyber Patrol program. Without this information, it is impossible to verify  his conclusions (or to undermine them). And Biek's study certainly understates  Cyber Patrol's overblocking rate for some of the same reasons that Finnell's  study likely understates the true rates of overblocking used in the libraries  that he studied.    We also note that Finnell's study,  which analyzed a set of Internet logs from the Tacoma Library during which the  same filtering program was operating with the same set of blocking categories  enabled, found a significantly higher rate of overblocking than the Biek study  did. Biek found a rate of overblocking of approximately 2% while the Finnell  study estimated a 6.34% rate of overblocking. At all events, the category  definitions employed by CIPA, at least with respect to adult use - visual  depictions that are obscene or child pornography - are narrower than the  materials prohibited by the Tacoma Library policy, and therefore Biek's study  understates the rate of overblocking with respect to CIPA's definitions for  adults.    In sum, we think that Finnell's  study, while we do not credit its estimates of underblocking, is useful because  it states lower bounds with respect to the rates of overblocking that occurred  when the Cyber Patrol, Websense, and N2H2 filters were operating in public  libraries. While these rates are substantial - between nearly 6% and 15% - we  think, for the reasons stated above, that they greatly understate the actual  rates of overblocking that occurs, and therefore cannot be considered as  anything more than minimum estimates of the rates of overblocking that happens  in all filtering programs.                      Methods of Obtaining        Examples of Erroneously Blocked Web Sites     The plaintiffs assembled a list of  several thousand Web sites that they contend were, at the time of the study,  likely to have been erroneously blocked by one or more of four major commercial  filtering programs: SurfControl Cyber Patrol 6.0.1.47, N2H2 Internet Filtering  2.0, Secure Computing SmartFilter 3.0.0.01, and Websense Enterprise 4.3.0. They  compiled this list using a two-step process. First, Benjamin Edelman, an expert  witness who testified before us, compiled a list of more than 500,000 URLs and  devised a program to feed them through all four filtering programs in order to  compile a list of URLs that might have been erroneously blocked by one or more  of the programs. (14)   Second, Edelman forwarded subsets of the list that he compiled to librarians and  professors of library science whom the plaintiffs had hired to review the  blocked sites for suitability in the public library context.    Edelman assembled the list of URLs by  compiling Web pages that were blocked by the following categories in the four  programs: Cyber Patrol: Adult/Sexually Explicit; N2H2: Adults Only, Nudity,  Pornography, and Sex, with ""exceptions"" engaged in the categories of Education,  For Kids, History, Medical, Moderated, and Text/Spoken Only; SmartFilter: Sex,  Nudity, Mature, and Extreme; Websense: Adult Content, Nudity, and Sex.     Edelman then assembled a database of  Web sites for possible testing. He derived this list by automatically compiling  URLs from the Yahoo index of Web sites, taking them from categories from the  Yahoo index that differed significantly from the classifications that he had  enabled in each of the blocking programs (taking, for example, Web sites from  Yahoo's ""Government"" category). He then expanded this list by entering URLs  taken from the Yahoo index into the Google search engine's ""related"" search  function, which provides the user with a list of similar sites. Edelman also  included and excluded specific Web sites at the request of the plaintiffs'  counsel.    Taking the list of more than  500,000   URLs that he had compiled, Edelman used an automated  system that he had developed to test whether particular URLs were blocked by  each of the four filtering programs. This testing took place between February  and October 2001. He recorded the specific dates on which particular sites were  blocked by particular programs, and, using commercial archiving software,  archived the contents of the home page of the blocked Web sites (and in some  instances the pages linked to from the home page) as it existed when it was  blocked. (15)   Through this process, Edelman, whose testimony we credit, compiled a list of  6,777 URLs that were blocked by one or more of the four programs. Because these  sites were chosen from categories from the Yahoo directory that were unrelated  to the filtering categories that were enabled during the test (i.e.,  ""Government"" vs. ""Nudity""), he reasoned that they were likely erroneously  blocked. As explained in the margin, Edelman repeated his testing and discovered  that Cyber Patrol had unblocked most of the pages on the list of 6,777 after he  had published the list on his Web site. His records indicate that an employee of  SurfControl (the company that produces Cyber Patrol software) accessed his site  and presumably checked out the URLs on the list, thus confirming Edelman's  judgment that the majority of URLs on the list were erroneously blocked. (16)   Edelman forwarded the list of blocked sites to Dr. Joseph  Janes, an Assistant Professor in the Information School of the University of  Washington who also testified at trial as an expert witness. Janes reviewed the  sites that Edelman compiled to determine whether they are consistent with  library collection development, i.e., whether they are sites to which a  reference librarian would, consistent with professional standards, direct a  patron as a source of information. (17)      Edelman forwarded Janes a list of 6,775 Web sites, almost  the entire list of blocked sites that he collected, from which Janes took a  random sample of 859 using the SPSS statistical software package. Janes  indicated that he chose a sample size of 859 because it would yield a 95%  confidence interval of plus or minus 2.5%. Janes recruited a group of 16  reviewers, most of whom were current or former students at the University of  Washington's Information School, to help him identify which sites were  appropriate for library use. We describe the process that he used in the  margin. (18)   Due to the inability of a member of Janes's review team to complete the  reviewing process, Janes had to cut 157 Web sites out of the sample, but because  the Web sites were randomly assigned to reviewers, it is unlikely that these  sites differed significantly from the rest of the sample. That left the sample  size at 699, which widened the 95% confidence interval to plus or minus 2.8%.     Of the total 699 sites reviewed, Janes's team concluded that  165 of them, or 23.6% percent of the sample, were not of any value in the  library context (i.e., no librarian would, consistent with professional  standards, refer a patron to these sites as a source of information). They were  unable to find 60 of the Web sites, or 8.6% of the sample. Therefore, they  concluded that the remaining 474 Web sites, or 67.8% of the sample, were  examples of overblocking with respect to materials that are appropriate sources  of information in public libraries. Applying a 95% confidence interval of plus  or minus 2.8%, the study concluded that we can be 95% confident that the actual  percentage of sites in the list of 6,775 sites that are appropriate for use in  public libraries is somewhere between 65.0% and 70.6%. In other words, we can be  95% certain that the actual number of sites out of the 6,775 that Edelman  forwarded to Janes that are appropriate for use in public libraries (under  Janes's standard) is somewhere between 4,403 and 4,783.    The government raised some valid criticisms of Janes's  methodology, attacking in particular the fact that,  while sites that received two ""yes"" votes in  the first round of voting were determined to be of sufficient interest in a  library context to be removed from further analysis, sites receiving one or two  ""no"" votes were sent to the next round. The government also correctly points out  that results of Janes's study can be generalized only to the population of 6,775  sites that Edelman forwarded to Janes.  Even taking these criticisms into account, and discounting Janes's  numbers appropriately, we credit Janes's study as confirming that Edelman's set  of 6,775 Web sites contains at least a few thousand URLs that were erroneously  blocked by one or more of the four filtering programs that he used, whether  judged against CIPA's definitions, the filters' own category criteria, or  against the standard that the Janes study used. Edelman tested only 500,000  unique URLs out of the 4000 times that many, or two billion, that are estimated  to exist in the indexable Web. Even assuming that Edelman chose the URLs that  were most likely to be erroneously blocked by commercial filtering programs, we  conclude that many times the number of pages that Edelman identified are  erroneously blocked by one or more of the filtering programs that he tested.     Edelman's and Janes's studies provide  numerous specific examples of Web pages that were erroneously blocked by one or  more filtering programs. The Web pages that were erroneously blocked by one or  more of the filtering programs do not fall into any neat patterns; they range  widely in subject matter, and it is difficult to tell why they may have been  overblocked. The list that Edelman compiled, for example, contains Web pages  relating to religion, politics and government, health, careers, education,  travel, sports, and many other topics. In the next section, we provide examples  from each of these categories.                     Examples of        Erroneously Blocked Web Sites    Several of the erroneously blocked  Web sites had content relating to churches, religious orders, religious  charities, and religious fellowship organizations. These included the following  Web sites: the Knights of Columbus Council 4828, a Catholic men's group  associated with St. Patrick's Church in Fallon, Nevada,  http://msnhomepages.talkcity.com/SpiritSt/kofc4828 ,   which was blocked by Cyber Patrol in the ""Adult/Sexually Explicit"" category; the  Agape Church of Searcy, Arkansas,  http://www.agapechurch.com , which was  blocked by Websense as ""Adult Content"" ; the home page of the Lesbian and  Gay Havurah of the Long Beach, California Jewish Community Center,   http://www.compupix.com/gay/havurah.htm , which was blocked by N2H2 as  ""Adults Only, Pornography,"" by Smartfilter as ""Sex,"" and by Websense as ""Sex"";  Orphanage Emmanuel, a Christian orphanage in Honduras that houses 225 children,   http://home8.inet.tele.dk/rfb_viva , which was blocked by Cyber Patrol in the  ""Adult/Sexually Explicit"" category;  Vision Art Online, which sells wooden  wall hangings for the home that contain prayers, passages from the Bible, and  images of the Star of David,  http://www.visionartonline.com , which  was blocked in Websense's ""Sex"" category; and the home page of Tenzin Palmo, a  Buddhist nun, which contained a description of her project to build a Buddhist  nunnery and international retreat center for women,   http://www.tenzinpalmo.com , which was categorized as ""Nudity"" by  N2H2.   Several blocked sites also contained  information about governmental entities or specific political candidates, or  contained political commentary. These included: the Web site for Kelley Ross, a  Libertarian candidate for the California State Assembly,  http://www.friesian.com/ross/ca40 ,   which N2H2 blocked as ""Nudity""; the Web site for Bob Coughlin, a town selectman  in Dedham, Massachusetts,  http://www.bobcoughlin.org , which was  blocked under N2H2's ""Nudity"" category;  a list of Web sites containing  information about government and politics in Adams County, Pennsylvania,  http://www.geocities.com/adamscopa ,  which was blocked  by Websense as ""Sex""; the Web site for Wisconsin Right  to Life,  http://www.wrtl.org , which N2H2  blocked as ""Nudity""; a Web site that promotes federalism in Uganda,   http://federo.com , which N2H2 blocked as ""Adults Only, Pornography"";  ""Fight the Death Penalty in the USA,"" a Danish Web site dedicated to criticizing  the American system of capital punishment,  http://www.fdp.dk , which N2H2  blocked as ""Pornography""; and ""Dumb Laws,"" a humor Web site that makes fun of  outmoded laws,  http://www.dumblaws.com , which N2H2 blocked under  its ""Sex"" category.    Erroneously blocked Web sites  relating to health issues included the following: a guide to allergies,  http://www.x-sitez.com/allergy ,   which was categorized as ""Adults Only, Pornography"" by N2H2; a health question  and answer site sponsored by Columbia University,   http://www.goaskalice.com.columbia.edu , which was blocked as ""Sex"" by  N2H2, and as ""Mature"" by Smartfilter; the Western Amputee Support Alliance Home  Page,  http://www.usinter.net/wasa ,  which was blocked by N2H2 as  ""Pornography""; the Web site of the Willis-Knighton Cancer Center, a Shreveport,  Louisiana cancer treatment facility,  http://cancerftr.wkmc.com , which was  blocked by Websense under the ""Sex"" category; and a site dealing with halitosis,   http://www.dreamcastle.com/tungs , which was blocked by N2H2 as ""Adults,  Pornography,"" by Smartfilter as ""Sex,"" by Cyber Patrol as ""Adult/Sexually  Explicit,"" and by Websense as ""Adult Content.""    The  filtering programs also  erroneously blocked several Web sites having to do with education and careers.  The filtering programs blocked two sites that provide information on home  schooling. ""HomEduStation - the Internet Source for Home Education,""  http://www.perigree.net/~mcmullen/homedustation, ,  was categorized by Cyber Patrol as ""Adult/Sexually Explicit."" Smartfilter  blocked ""Apricot: A Web site made by and for home schoolers,""  http://apricotpie.com ,  as ""Sex."" The  programs also miscategorized several career-related sites. ""Social Work Search,""   http://www.socialworksearch.com/ ,   is a directory for social workers that Cyber Patrol placed in its  ""Adult/Sexually Explicit"" category. The ""Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Southern  Nevada,""  http://www.lambdalv.com ,   "" a forum for the business  community to develop relationships within the Las Vegas lesbian, gay,  transsexual, and bisexual community"" was blocked by N2H2 as ""Adults Only,  Pornography."" A site for aspiring dentists,  http://www.vvm.com/~bond/home.htm ,  was blocked by Cyber Patrol in its ""Adult/Sexually Explicit"" category.     The filtering programs erroneously  blocked many travel Web sites, including: the Web site for the Allen Farmhouse  Bed & Breakfast of Alleghany County, North Carolina,   http://planet-nc.com/Beth/index.html , which Websense blocked as ""Adult  Content""; Odysseus Gay Travel, a travel company serving gay men,   http://www.odyusa.com , which N2H2 categorized as ""Adults Only,  Pornography""; Southern Alberta Fly Fishing Outfitters,   http://albertaflyfish.com , which N2H2 blocked as ""Pornography""; and  ""Nature and Culture Conscious Travel,"" a tour operator in Namibia,   http://www.trans-namibia-tours.com , which was categorized as  ""Pornography"" by N2H2.    The filtering programs also  miscategorized a large number of sports Web sites. These included: a site  devoted to Willie O'Ree, the first African-American player in the National  Hockey League,  http://www.missioncreep.com/mw/oree.html , which Websense  blocked under its ""Nudity"" category; the home page of the Sydney University  Australian Football Club,  http://www.tek.com.au/suafc , which N2H2 blocked  as ""Adults Only, Pornography,"" Smartfilter blocked as ""Sex,"" Cyber Patrol  blocked as ""Adult/Sexually Explicit"" and Websense blocked as ""Sex""; and a fan's  page devoted to the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team,   http://www.torontomapleleafs.atmypage.com , which N2H2 blocked under the  ""Pornography"" category.                      Conclusion: The Effectiveness of Filtering        Programs     Public libraries have adopted a variety of means of dealing with  problems created by the provision of Internet access. The large amount of  sexually explicit speech that is freely available on the Internet has, to  varying degrees, led to patron complaints about such matters as unsought  exposure to offensive material, incidents of staff and patron harassment by  individuals viewing sexually explicit content on the Internet, and the use of  library computers to access illegal material, such as child pornography. In some  libraries, youthful library patrons have persistently attempted to use the  Internet to access hardcore pornography.   Those public libraries that have  responded to these problems by using software filters have found such filters to  provide a relatively effective means of preventing patrons from accessing  sexually explicit material on the Internet. Nonetheless, out of the entire  universe of speech on the Internet falling within the filtering products'  category definitions, the filters will incorrectly fail to block a substantial  amount of speech. Thus, software filters have not completely eliminated the  problems that public libraries have sought to address by using the filters, as  evidenced by frequent instances of underblocking. Nor is there any quantitative  evidence of the relative effectiveness of filters and the alternatives to  filters that are also intended to prevent patrons from accessing illegal content  on the Internet.    Even more importantly (for this  case), although software filters provide a relatively cheap and effective,  albeit imperfect, means for public libraries to prevent patrons from accessing  speech that falls within the filters' category definitions, we find that  commercially available filtering programs erroneously block a huge amount of  speech that is protected by the First Amendment. Any currently available  filtering product that is reasonably effective in preventing users from  accessing content within the filter's category definitions will necessarily  block countless thousands of Web pages, the content of which does not match the  filtering company's category definitions, much less the legal definitions of  obscenity, child pornography, or harmful to minors. Even Finnell, an expert  witness for the defendants, found that between 6% and 15% of the blocked Web  sites in the public libraries that he analyzed did not contain content that  meets even the filtering products' own definitions of sexually explicit content,  let alone CIPA's definitions.    This phenomenon occurs for a number  of reasons explicated in the more detailed findings of fact  supra .  These include limitations on filtering companies' ability to: (1) harvest Web  pages for review; (2) review and categorize the Web pages that they have  harvested; and (3) engage in regular re-review of the Web pages that they have  previously reviewed. The primary limitations on filtering companies' ability to  harvest Web pages for review is that a substantial majority of pages on the Web  are not indexable using the spidering technology that Web search engines use,  and that together, search engines have indexed only around half of the Web pages  that are theoretically indexable. The fast rate of growth in the number of Web  pages also limits filtering companies' ability to harvest pages for review.  These shortcomings necessarily result in significant underblocking.     Several limitations on filtering  companies' ability to review and categorize the Web pages that they have  harvested also contribute to over- and underblocking. First, automated review  processes, even those based on ""artificial intelligence,"" are unable with any  consistency to distinguish accurately material that falls within a category  definition from material that does not. Moreover, human review of URLs is  hampered by filtering companies' limited staff sizes, and by human error or  misjudgment. In order to deal with the vast size of the Web and its rapid rates  of growth and change, filtering companies engage in several practices that are  necessary to reduce underblocking, but inevitably result in overblocking. These  include: (1) blocking whole Web sites even when only a small minority of their  pages contain material that would fit under one of the filtering company's  categories (e.g., blocking the Salon.com site because it contains a sex column);  (2) blocking by IP address (because a single IP address may contain many  different Web sites and many thousands of pages of heterogenous content); and  (3) blocking loophole sites such as translator sites and cache sites, which  archive Web pages that have been removed from the Web by their original  publisher.    Finally, filtering companies' failure  to engage in regular re-review of Web pages that they have already categorized  (or that they have determined do not fall into any category) results in a  substantial amount of over- and underblocking. For example, Web publishers  change the contents of Web pages frequently. The problem also arises when a Web  site goes out of existence and its domain name or IP address is reassigned to a  new Web site publisher. In that case, a filtering company's previous  categorization of the IP address or domain name would likely be incorrect,  potentially resulting in the over- or underblocking of many thousands of pages.     The inaccuracies that result from  these limitations of filtering technology are quite substantial. At least tens  of thousands of pages of the indexable Web are overblocked by each of the  filtering programs evaluated by experts in this case, even when considered  against the filtering companies' own category definitions. Many erroneously  blocked pages contain content that is completely innocuous for both adults and  minors, and that no rational person could conclude matches the filtering  companies' category definitions, such as ""pornography"" or ""sex.""   The number of overblocked sites is of  course much higher with respect to the definitions of obscenity and child  pornography that CIPA employs for adults, since the filtering products' category  definitions, such as ""sex"" and ""nudity,"" encompass vast amounts of Web pages  that are neither child pornography nor obscene. Thus, the number of pages of  constitutionally protected speech blocked by filtering products far exceeds the  many thousands of pages that are overblocked by reference to the filtering  products' category definitions.    No presently conceivable technology can make the judgments  necessary to determine whether a visual depiction fits the legal definitions of  obscenity, child pornography, or harmful to minors. Given the state of the art  in filtering and image recognition technology, and the rapidly changing and  expanding nature of the Web, we find that filtering products' shortcomings will  not be solved through a technical solution in the foreseeable future. (19)     In sum, filtering products are currently unable to block only  visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors (or,  only content matching a filtering product's category definitions) while  simultaneously allowing access to all protected speech (or, all content not  matching the blocking product's category definitions). Any software filter that  is reasonably effective in blocking access to Web pages that fall within its  category definitions will necessarily erroneously block a substantial number of  Web pages that do not fall within its category definitions.       Analytic Framework for the Opinion: The Centrality of  Dole  and    the Role of the Facial Challenge     Both the plaintiffs and the government  agree that, because this case involves a challenge to the constitutionality of  the conditions that Congress has set on state actors' receipt of federal funds,  the Supreme Court's decision in  South Dakota v. Dole , 483 U.S. 203  (1987), supplies the proper threshold analytic framework. The constitutional  source of Congress's spending power is Article I, § 8, cl. 1, which provides  that ""Congress shall have Power . . . to pay the Debts and provide for the  common Defence and general Welfare of the United States."" In  Dole , the  Court upheld the constitutionality of a federal statute requiring the  withholding of federal highway funds from any state with a drinking age below  21.  Id.  at 211-12. In sustaining the provision's constitutionality,   Dole  articulated four general constitutional limitations on Congress's  exercise of the spending power.   First, ""the exercise of the spending power must be in pursuit  of 'the general welfare.'""  Id.  at 207. Second, any conditions that  Congress sets on states' receipt of federal funds must be sufficiently clear to  enable recipients ""to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the  consequences of their participation.""  Id.  (internal quotation marks and  citation omitted). Third, the conditions on the receipt of federal funds must  bear some relation to the purpose of the funding program.  Id.  And  finally, ""other constitutional provisions may provide an independent bar to the  conditional grant of federal funds.""  Id.  at 208. In particular, the  spending power ""may not be used to induce the States to engage in activities  that would themselves be unconstitutional. Thus, for example, a grant of federal  funds conditioned on invidiously discriminatory state action or the infliction  of cruel and unusual punishment would be an illegitimate exercise of the  Congress' broad spending power.""  Id.  at 210.   Plaintiffs do not contend that CIPA runs afoul of the first  three limitations. However, they do allege that CIPA is unconstitutional under  the fourth prong of  Dole  because it will induce public libraries to  violate the First Amendment. (20)   Plaintiffs therefore submit that the First Amendment ""provide[s] an independent  bar to the conditional grant of federal funds"" created by CIPA.   Id.  at 208. More specifically, they argue that by conditioning  public libraries' receipt of federal funds on the use of software filters, CIPA  will induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment rights of Internet  content-providers to disseminate constitutionally protected speech to library  patrons via the Internet, and the correlative First Amendment rights of public  library patrons to receive constitutionally protected speech on the Internet. (21)   The government concedes that under the  Dole  framework,  CIPA is facially invalid if its conditions will induce public libraries to  violate the First Amendment.  The government and the plaintiffs disagree,  however, on the meaning of  Dole 's ""inducement"" requirement in the  context of a First Amendment facial challenge to the conditions that Congress  places on state actors' receipt of federal funds. The government contends that  because plaintiffs are bringing a facial challenge, they must show that under no  circumstances is it possible for a public library to comply with CIPA's  conditions without violating the First Amendment. The plaintiffs respond that  even if it is possible for some public libraries to comply with CIPA without  violating the First Amendment, CIPA is facially invalid if it ""will result in  the impermissible suppression of a substantial amount of protected speech.""     Because it was clear in  Dole  that the states could  comply with the challenged conditions that Congress attached to the receipt of  federal funds without violating the Constitution, the  Dole  Court did  not have occasion to explain fully what it means for Congress to use the  spending power to ""induce [recipients] to engage in activities that would  themselves be unconstitutional.""  Dole , 483 U.S. at 210;  see    id.  at 211 (""Were South Dakota to succumb to the blandishments offered  by Congress and raise its drinking age to 21, the State's action in so doing  would not violate the constitutional rights of anyone.""). Although the  proposition that Congress may not pay state actors to violate citizens' First  Amendment rights is unexceptionable when stated in the abstract, it is unclear  what exactly a litigant must establish to facially invalidate an exercise of  Congress's spending power on this ground.   In general, it is well-established that a court may sustain a  facial challenge to a statute only if the plaintiff demonstrates that the  statute admits of no constitutional application.  See   United States  v. Salerno , 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987) (""A facial challenge to a legislative  Act is, of course, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the  challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the  Act would be valid."");  see also   Bowen v. Kendrick , 487 U.S.  589, 612 (1988) (""It has not been the Court's practice, in considering facial  challenges to statutes of this kind, to strike them down in anticipation that  particular applications may result in unconstitutional use of funds."") (internal  quotation marks and citation omitted).   First Amendment overbreadth doctrine creates a limited  exception to this rule by permitting facial invalidation of a statute that  burdens a substantial amount of protected speech, even if the statute may be  constitutionally applied in particular circumstances. ""The Constitution gives  significant protection from overbroad laws that chill speech within the First  Amendment's vast and privileged sphere. Under this principle, [a law] is  unconstitutional on its face if it prohibits a substantial amount of protected  expression.""  Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition , 122 S. Ct. 1389, 1399  (2002);  see also   Broadrick v. Oklahoma , 413 U.S. 601, 612  (1973). This more liberal test of a statute's facial validity under the First  Amendment stems from the recognition that where a statute's reach contemplates a  number of both constitutional and unconstitutional applications, the law's  sanctions may deter individuals from challenging the law's validity by engaging  in constitutionally protected speech that may nonetheless be proscribed by the  law. Without an overbreadth doctrine, ""the contours of regulation would have to  be hammered out case by case - and tested only by those hardy enough to risk  criminal prosecution to determine the proper scope of regulation.""   Dombrowski v. Pfister , 380 U.S. 479, 487 (1965);  see also    Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc. , 472 U.S. 491, 503 (1985) (""[A]n  individual whose own speech or expressive conduct may validly be prohibited or  sanctioned is permitted to challenge a statute on its face because it also  threatens others not before the court - those who desire to engage in legally  protected expression but who may refrain from doing so rather than risk  prosecution or undertake to have the law declared partially  invalid."").   Plaintiffs argue that the overbreadth doctrine is applicable  here, since CIPA ""threatens to chill free speech - because it will censor a  substantial amount of protected speech, because it is vague, and because the law  creates a prior restraint . . . ."" Unlike the statutes typically challenged as  facially overbroad, however, CIPA does not impose criminal penalties on those  who violate its conditions.   Cf.   Freedom of Speech  Coalition , 122 S. Ct. at 1398 (""With these severe penalties in force, few  legitimate movie producers or book publishers, or few other speakers in any  capacity, would risk distributing images in or near the uncertain reach of this  law.""). Thus, the rationale for permitting facial challenges to laws that may be  constitutionally applied in some instances is less compelling in cases such as  this, which involve challenges to Congress's exercise of the spending power,  than in challenges to criminal statutes.    Nonetheless, ""even minor punishments can chill protected  speech,""  id. , and absent the ability to challenge CIPA on its face,  public libraries that depend on federal funds may decide to comply with CIPA's  terms, thereby denying patrons access to substantial amounts of constitutionally  protected speech, rather than refusing to comply with CIPA's terms and  consequently losing the benefits of federal funds.  See  47 C.F.R. §  54.520(e)(1) (""A school or library that knowingly fails to ensure the use of  computers in accordance with the certifications required by this section, must  reimburse any funds and discounts received under the federal universal support  service support mechanism for schools and libraries for the period in which  there was noncompliance.""). Even in cases where the only penalty for failure to  comply with a statute is the withholding of federal funds, the Court has  sustained facial challenges to Congress's exercise of the spending power.   See, e.g. ,  Legal Servs.  Corp. v. Velazquez , 531 U.S. 533 (2001) (declaring unconstitutional on its  face a federal statute restricting the ability of legal services providers who  receive federal funds to engage in activity protected by the First Amendment).     The Court's unconstitutional conditions  cases, such as  Velazquez , are not strictly controlling, since they do  not require a showing that recipients who comply with the conditions attached to  federal funding will, as state actors, violate others' constitutional rights, as  is the case under the fourth prong of  Dole . However, they are highly  instructive.   The Supreme Court's pronouncements in the unconstitutional conditions  cases on what is necessary for a plaintiff to mount a successful First Amendment  facial challenge to an exercise of Congress's spending power have not produced a  seamless web. For example, in  Rust v. Sullivan , 500 U.S. 173 (1991),  the Court rejected a First Amendment facial challenge to federal regulations  prohibiting federally funded healthcare clinics from providing counseling  concerning the use of abortion as a method of family planning, explaining  that:   Petitioners are challenging the   facial  validity of the regulations. Thus, we are concerned only with  the question whether, on their face, the regulations are both authorized by the  Act and can be construed in such a manner that they can be applied to a set of  individuals without infringing upon constitutionally protected rights.  Petitioners face a heavy burden in seeking to have the regulations invalidated  as facially unconstitutional. . . . The fact that the regulations might operate  unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient  to render them wholly invalid.   Id.  at 183 (internal quotation  marks, alterations, and citation omitted). In contrast,  NEA v. Finley ,  524 U.S. 569 (1998), which also involved a facial First Amendment challenge to  an exercise of Congress's spending power, articulated a somewhat more liberal  test of facial validity than  Rust , explaining that ""[t]o prevail,  respondents must demonstrate a substantial risk that application of the  provision will lead to the suppression of speech.""  Id.  at  580.   Against this background, it is unclear  to us whether, to succeed in facially invalidating CIPA on the grounds that it  will ""induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves be  unconstitutional,""  Dole , 483 U.S. at 210, plaintiffs must show that it  is impossible for public libraries to comply with CIPA's conditions without  violating the First Amendment, or rather simply that CIPA will effectively  restrict library patrons' access to substantial amounts of constitutionally  protected speech, therefore causing many libraries to violate the First  Amendment. However, we need not resolve this issue. Rather, we may assume  without deciding, for purposes of this case, that a facial challenge to CIPA  requires plaintiffs to show that any public library that complies with CIPA's  conditions will necessarily violate the First Amendment and, as explained in  detail below, we believe that CIPA's constitutionality fails even under this  more restrictive test of facial validity urged on us by the government. Because  of the inherent limitations in filtering technology, public libraries can never  comply with CIPA without blocking access to a substantial amount of speech that  is both constitutionally protected and fails to meet even the filtering  companies' own blocking criteria. We turn first to the governing legal  principles to be applied to the facts in order to determine whether the First  Amendment permits a library to use the filtering technology mandated by  CIPA.       Level of Scrutiny Applicable to Content-based Restrictions on Internet    Access in Public Libraries     In analyzing the constitutionality of a public library's use of Internet  filtering software, we must first identify the appropriate level of scrutiny to  apply to this restriction on patrons' access to speech. While plaintiffs argue  that a public library's use of such filters is subject to strict scrutiny, the  government maintains that the applicable standard is rational basis review. If  strict scrutiny applies, the government must show that the challenged  restriction on speech is narrowly tailored to promote a compelling government  interest and that no less restrictive alternative would further that interest.   United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc. , 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000).  In contrast, under rational basis review, the challenged restriction need only  be reasonable; the government interest that the restriction serves need not be  compelling; the restriction need not be narrowly tailored to serve that  interest; and the restriction ""need not be the most reasonable or the only  reasonable limitation.""  Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund ,  473 U.S. 788, 808 (1985).   Software filters, by definition, block  access to speech on the basis of its content, and content-based restrictions on  speech are generally subject to strict scrutiny.  See   Playboy ,  529 U.S. at 813 (""[A] content-based speech restriction . . . can stand only if  it satisfies strict scrutiny.""). Strict scrutiny does not necessarily apply to  content-based restrictions on speech, however, where the restrictions apply only  to speech on government property, such as public libraries. ""[I]t is . . . well  settled that the government need not permit all forms of speech on property that  it owns and controls.""  Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v.  Lee , 505 U.S. 672, 678 (1992). We perforce turn to a discussion of public  forum doctrine.             Overview of Public Forum Doctrine     The government's power to restrict speech on its own property is not  unlimited. Rather, under public forum doctrine, the extent to which the First  Amendment permits the government to restrict speech on its own property depends  on the character of the forum that the government has created.  See    Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, Inc. , 473 U.S. 788  (1985). Thus, the First Amendment affords greater deference to restrictions on  speech in those areas considered less amenable to free expression, such as  military bases,  see   Greer v. Spock , 424 U.S. 828 (1976), jail  grounds,  see   Adderley v. Florida , 385 U.S. 39 (1966), or  public airport terminals,  see   Int'l Soc'y for Krishna  Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee , 505 U.S. 672 (1992), than to restrictions on  speech in state universities,  see   Rosenberger v. Rector &  Visitors of Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S. 819 (1995), or streets, sidewalks and  public parks,  see   Frisby v. Schultz , 487 U.S. 474 (1988);   Hague v. CIO , 307 U.S. 496 (1939).   The Supreme Court has identified three  types of fora for purposes of identifying the level of First Amendment scrutiny  applicable to content-based restrictions on speech on government property:  traditional public fora, designated public fora, and nonpublic fora. Traditional  public fora include sidewalks, squares, and public parks:   [S]treets and parks . . . have  immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind,  have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between  citizens, and discussing public questions. Such use of the streets and public  places has, from ancient times, been a part of the privileges, immunities,  rights, and liberties of citizens.   Hague , 307 U.S. at 515. ""In  these quintessential public forums, . . . [f]or the State to enforce a  content-based exclusion it must show that its regulation is necessary to serve a  compelling state interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.""   Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educs. Ass'n , 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983);   see also   Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness , 505 U.S. at  678 (""[R]egulation of speech on government property that has traditionally been  available for public expression is subject to the highest scrutiny."");   Frisby , 487 U.S. at 480 (""[W]e have repeatedly referred to public  streets as the archetype of a traditional public forum."").   A second category of fora, known as  designated (or limited) public fora, ""consists of public property which the  State has opened for use by the public as a place for expressive activity.""   Perry , 460 U.S. at 46. Whereas any content-based restriction on the use  of traditional public fora is subject to strict scrutiny, the state is generally  permitted, as long as it does not discriminate on the basis of viewpoint, to  limit a designated public forum to certain speakers or the discussion of certain  subjects.  See   Perry , 460 U.S. at 45 n.7. Once it has defined  the limits of a designated public forum, however, ""[r]egulation of such property  is subject to the same limitations as that governing a traditional public  forum.""  Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness , 505 U.S. at 678.  Examples of designated fora include university meeting facilities,  see    Widmar v. Vincent , 454 U.S. 263 (1981), school board meetings,   see   City of Madison Joint School Dist. v. Wisc. Employment  Relations Comm'n , 429 U.S. 167 (1976), and municipal theaters,  see    Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad , 420 U.S. 546  (1975).   The third category, nonpublic fora,  consists of all remaining public property. ""Limitations on expressive activity  conducted on this last category of property must survive only a much more  limited review. The challenged regulation need only be reasonable, as long as  the regulation is not an effort to suppress the speaker's activity due to  disagreement with the speaker's view.""  Int'l Soc'y for Krishna  Consciousness , 505 U.S. at 679.             Contours of the Relevant Forum: the Library's Collection as a Whole or      the Provision of Internet Access?     To apply public forum doctrine to this case, we must first determine  whether the appropriate forum for analysis is the library's collection as a  whole, which includes both print and electronic resources, or the library's  provision of Internet access. Where a plaintiff seeks limited access, for  expressive purposes, to governmentally controlled property, the Supreme Court  has held that the relevant forum is defined not by the physical limits of the  government property at issue, but rather by the specific access that the  plaintiff seeks:   Although . . . as an initial matter a  speaker must seek access to public property or to private property dedicated to  public use to evoke First Amendment concerns, forum analysis is not completed  merely by identifying the government property at issue. Rather, in defining the  forum we have focused on the access sought by the speaker. When speakers seek  general access to public property, the forum encompasses that property. In cases  in which limited access is sought, our cases have taken a more tailored approach  to ascertaining the perimeters of a forum within the confines of the government  property.   Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. &  Educ. Fund, Inc. , 473 U.S. 788, 801 (1985).    Thus, in  Cornelius , where the  plaintiffs were legal defense and political advocacy groups seeking to  participate in the Combined Federal Campaign charity drive, the Court held that  the relevant forum, for First Amendment purposes, was not the entire federal  workplace, but rather the charity drive itself.  Id.  at 801. Similarly,  in  Perry Education Association v. Perry Local Educators' Association ,  460 U.S. 37 (1983), which addressed a union's right to access a public school's  internal mail system and teachers' mailboxes, the Court identified the relevant  forum as the school's mail system, not the public school as a whole. In   Widmar v. Vincent , 454 U.S. 263 (1981), in which a student group  challenged a state university's restrictions on use of its meeting facilities,  the Court identified the relevant forum as the meeting facilities to which the  plaintiffs sought access, not the state university generally. And in   Christ's Bride Ministries, Inc. v. SEPTA ,   148 F.3d 242 (3d  Cir. 1998), involving a First Amendment challenge to the removal of  advertisements from subway and commuter rail stations, the Third Circuit noted  that the forum at issue was not the rail and subway stations as a whole, but  rather the advertising space within the stations.  Id.  at 248. Although  these cases dealt with the problem of identifying the relevant forum where   speakers  are claiming a right of access, we believe that the same  approach applies to identifying the relevant forum where the parties seeking  access are listeners or readers.   In this case, the patron plaintiffs are  not asserting a First Amendment right to compel public libraries to acquire  certain books or magazines for their print collections. Nor are the Web site  plaintiffs claiming a First Amendment right to compel public libraries to carry  print materials that they publish. Rather, the right at issue in this case is  the specific right of library patrons to access information on the Internet, and  the specific right of Web publishers to provide library patrons with information  via the Internet. Thus, the relevant forum for analysis is not the library's  entire collection, which includes both print and electronic media, such as the  Internet, but rather the specific forum created when the library provides its  patrons with Internet access.   Although a public library's provision of  Internet access does not resemble the conventional notion of a forum as a  well-defined physical space, the same First Amendment standards apply.   See   Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va. , 515  U.S. 819, 830 (1995) (holding that a state university's student activities fund  ""is a forum more in a metaphysical than a spatial or geographic sense, but the  same principles are applicable"");  see also   Cornelius , 473 U.S.  at 801 (identifying the Combined Federal Campaign charity drive as the relevant  unit of analysis for application of public forum doctrine).             Content-based Restrictions in Designated Public Fora          Unlike nonpublic fora such as airport terminals,  see   Int'l  Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee , 505 U.S. 672 (1992), military  bases,  see   Greer v. Spock , 424 U.S. 828 (1976), jail grounds,   see   Adderley v. Florida , 385 U.S. 39 (1966), the federal  workplace,  see   Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund ,  473 U.S. 788, 805 (1985), and public transit vehicles,  see   Lehman  v. City of Shaker Heights , 418 U.S. 298 (1974), the purpose of a public  library in general, and the provision of Internet access within a public library  in particular, is ""for use by the public . . . for expressive activity,""   Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educs. Ass'n , 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983),  namely, the dissemination and receipt by the public of a wide range of  information. We are satisfied that when the government provides Internet access  in a public library, it has created a designated public forum.  See    Mainstream Loudoun v. Bd. of Trustees of the Loudoun County Library , 24  F. Supp. 2d 552, 563 (E.D. Va. 1998);  cf.   Kreimer v. Bureau of  Police , 958 F.2d 1242, 1259 (3d Cir. 1992) (holding that a public library  is a limited public forum).   Relying on those cases that have  recognized that government has leeway, under the First Amendment, to limit use  of a designated public forum to narrowly specified purposes, and that  content-based restrictions on speech that are consistent with those purposes are  subject only to rational basis review, the government argues for application of  rational basis review to public libraries' decisions about which content to make  available to their patrons via the Internet.  See   Rosenberger ,  515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995) (""The necessities of confining a forum to the limited  and legitimate purposes for which it was created may justify the State in  reserving it for certain groups or for the discussion of certain topics."");   Perry , 460 U.S. at 46 n.7 (1983) (""A public forum may be created for a  limited purpose such as use by certain groups . . . or for the discussion of  certain subjects."").    In particular, the government forcefully  argues that a public library's decision to limit the content of its digital  offerings on the Internet should be subject to no stricter scrutiny than its  decisions about what content to make available to its patrons through the  library's print collection. According to the government, just as a public  library may choose to acquire books about gardening but not golf, without having  to show that this content-based restriction on patrons' access to speech is  narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest, so may a public  library make content-based decisions about which speech to make available on the  Internet, without having to show that such a restriction satisfies strict  scrutiny.   Plaintiffs respond that the government's  ability to restrict the content of speech in a designated public forum by  restricting the purpose of the designated public forum that it creates is not  unlimited.  Cf.   Legal  Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez , 531 U.S. 533, 547 (2001)  (""Congress cannot recast a condition on funding  as a mere definition of its program in every case, lest the First Amendment be  reduced to a simple semantic exercise.""). As Justice Kennedy has  explained:   If Government has a freer hand to draw  content-based distinctions in limiting a forum than in excluding someone from  it, the First Amendment would be a dead letter in designated public forums;  every exclusion could be recast as a limitation. . . . The power to limit or  redefine forums for a specific legitimate purpose does not allow the government  to exclude certain speech or speakers from them for any reason at  all.   Denver Area Telecomm. Consortium,  Inc. v. FCC , 518 U.S. 727, 801 (1996) (Kennedy, J., concurring in the  judgment).   Although we agree with plaintiffs that  the First Amendment imposes some limits on the state's ability to adopt  content-based restrictions in defining the purpose of a public forum, precisely  what those limits are is unclear, and presents a difficult problem in First  Amendment jurisprudence. The Supreme Court's ""cases have not yet determined . .  . that government's decision to dedicate a public forum to one type of content  or another is necessarily subject to the highest level of scrutiny. Must a local  government, for example, show a compelling state interest if it builds a band  shell in the park and dedicates it solely to classical music (but not to jazz)?  The answer is not obvious.""  Denver , 518 U.S. at 750 (plurality  opinion);  see also   Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad ,  420 U.S. 546, 572-73 (1975) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (""May an opera house  limit its productions to operas, or must it also show rock musicals? May a  municipal theater devote an entire season to Shakespeare, or is it required to  book any potential producer on a first come, first served basis?"").   We believe, however, that certain  principles emerge from the Supreme Court's jurisprudence on this question. In  particular, and perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, the more narrow the range  of speech that the government chooses to subsidize (whether directly, through  government grants or other funding, or indirectly, through the creation of a  public forum) the more deference the First Amendment accords the government in  drawing content-based distinctions.   At one extreme lies the government's  decision to fund a particular message that the government seeks to disseminate.  In this context, content-based restrictions on the speech that government  chooses to subsidize are clearly subject to at most rational basis review, and  even viewpoint discrimination is permissible. For example, ""[w]hen Congress  established a National Endowment for Democracy to encourage other countries to  adopt democratic principles, 22 U.S.C. § 4411(b), it was not constitutionally  required to fund a program to encourage competing lines of political philosophy  such as communism and fascism.""  Rust v. Sullivan , 500 U.S. 173, 194  (1991);  see also   Velazquez , 531 U.S. at 541  (""[V]iewpoint-based funding decisions can be sustained in instances in which the  government is itself the speaker, or in instances, like  Rust , in which  the government used private speakers to transmit information pertaining to its  own program."") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).    Although not strictly controlling, the  Supreme Court's unconstitutional conditions cases, such as  Rust  and   Velazquez , are instructive for purposes of analyzing content-based  restrictions on the use of public fora. This is because the limitations that  government places on the use of a public forum can be conceptualized as  conditions that the government attaches to the receipt of a benefit that it  offers, namely, the use of government property. Public forum cases thus resemble  those unconstitutional conditions cases involving First Amendment challenges to  the conditions that the state places on the receipt of a government benefit.   See Velazquez , 531 U.S. at 544 (""As this suit involves a subsidy,  limited forum cases . . . may not be controlling in the strict sense, yet they  do provide some instruction."").   Even when the government does not fund  the dissemination of a particular government message, the First Amendment  generally permits government, subject to the constraints of viewpoint  neutrality, to create public institutions such as art museums and state  universities, dedicated to facilitating the dissemination of private speech that  the government believes to have particular merit. Thus, in  NEA v.  Finley , 524 U.S. 569 (1998), the Court upheld the use of content-based  restrictions in a federal program awarding grants to artists on the basis of,   inter alia , artistic excellence. ""The very assumption of the NEA is  that grants will be awarded according to the artistic worth of competing  applications, and absolute neutrality is simply inconceivable.""  Id.  at  585 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).    Similarly, as Justice Stevens explained  in his concurring opinion in  Widmar v. Vincent , 454 U.S. 263 (1981),  the First Amendment does not necessarily subject to strict scrutiny a state  university's use of content-based means of allocating scarce resources,  including limited public fora such as its meeting facilities:   Because every university's resources are  limited, an educational institution must routinely make decisions concerning the  use of the time and space that is available for extracurricular activities. In  my judgment, it is both necessary and appropriate for those decisions to  evaluate the content of a proposed student activity. I should think it obvious,  for example, that if two groups of 25 students requested the use of a room at a  particular time - one to view Mickey Mouse cartoons and the other to rehearse an  amateur performance of Hamlet - the First Amendment would not require that the  room be reserved for the group that submitted its application first. Nor do I  see why a university should have to establish a ""compelling state interest"" to  defend its decision to permit one group to use the facility and not the  other.   Id.  at 278 (Stevens, J.,  concurring in the judgment). (22)   The more broadly the government  facilitates private speech, however, the less deference the First Amendment  accords to the government's content-based restrictions on the speech that it  facilitates. Thus, where the government creates a designated public forum to  facilitate private speech representing a diverse range of viewpoints, the  government's decision selectively to single out particular viewpoints for  exclusion is subject to strict scrutiny.   Compare   Rosenberger , 515 U.S. at 834 (applying heightened  First Amendment scrutiny to viewpoint-based restrictions on the use of a limited  public forum where the government ""does not itself speak or subsidize  transmittal of a message it favors but instead expends funds to encourage a  diversity of views from private speakers""),  with   Finley , 524  U.S. at 586 (""In the context of arts funding, in contrast to many other  subsidies, the Government does not indiscriminately encourage a diversity of  views from private speakers."") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).     Similarly, although the government may  create a designated public forum limited to speech on a particular topic, if the  government opens the forum to members of the general public to speak on that  topic while selectively singling out for exclusion particular speakers on the  basis of the content of their speech, that restriction is subject to strict  scrutiny. For instance, in  City of Madison Joint School District No. 8 v.  Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission , 429 U.S. 167 (1976), the Court  held that where a school board opens its meetings for public participation, it  may not, consistent with the First Amendment, prohibit teachers other than union  representatives from speaking on the subject of pending collective-bargaining  negotiations.  See   id.  at 175 (noting that the state ""has  opened a forum for direct citizen involvement"");  see also   Ark.  Educ. Television Comm'n v. Forbes , 523 U.S. 666, 680 (1998)  (distinguishing, for purposes of determining the appropriate level of First  Amendment scrutiny, a televised debate in which a public broadcasting station  exercises editorial discretion in selecting participating candidates from a  debate that has ""an open-microphone format"").   Finally, content-based restrictions on  speech in a designated public forum are most clearly subject to strict scrutiny  when the government opens a forum for virtually unrestricted use by the general  public for speech on a virtually unrestricted range of topics, while selectively  excluding particular speech whose content it disfavors. Thus, in   Conrad , the Court held that a local government violated the First  Amendment when it denied a group seeking to perform the rock musical ""Hair""  access to a general-purpose municipal theater open for the public at large to  use for performances.  See also   Denver , 518 U.S. at 802  (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment) (suggesting that strict scrutiny would  not apply to a local government's decision to ""build[] a band shell in the park  and dedicate[] it solely to classical music (but not jazz),"" but would apply to  ""the Government's creation of a band shell in which all types of music might be  performed except for rap music"").   Similarly, in  FCC v. League of Women  Voters of Cal. , 468 U.S. 364 (1984), the Court subjected to heightened  scrutiny a federal program that funded a wide range of public broadcasting  stations that disseminated speech on a wide range of subjects, where the federal  program singled out for exclusion speech whose content amounted to  editorializing. As the Court later explained:   In  FCC v. League of Women Voters of  Cal. , 468 U.S. 364 (1984) the Court was instructed by its understanding of  the dynamics of the broadcast industry in holding that prohibitions against  editorializing by public radio networks were an impermissible restriction, even  though the Government enacted the restriction to control the use of public  funds. The First Amendment forbade the Government from using the forum in an  unconventional way to suppress speech inherent in the nature of the  medium.   Velazquez , 531 U.S. at  543.   In sum, the more widely the state opens  a forum for members of the public to speak on a variety of subjects and  viewpoints, the more vulnerable is the state's decision selectively to  exclude certain speech on the basis of its disfavored content, as such  exclusions distort the marketplace of ideas that the state has created in  establishing the forum.  Cf.   Velazquez , 531 U.S. at 544  (""Restricting LSC attorneys in advising their clients and in presenting  arguments and analyses to the courts distorts the legal system by altering the  traditional role of the attorneys in much the same way broadcast systems or  student publication networks were changed in the limited forum cases . . . ."").     Thus, we believe that where the state  designates a forum for expressive activity and opens the forum for speech by the  public at large on a wide range of topics, strict scrutiny applies to  restrictions that single out for exclusion from the forum particular speech  whose content is disfavored. ""Laws designed or intended to suppress or restrict  the expression of  specific  speakers contradict basic First Amendment  principles.""  United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc. , 529 U.S. 803,  812 (2000);  see also   Denver , 518 U.S. at 782 (Kennedy, J.,  concurring in the judgment) (noting the flaw in a law that ""singles out one sort  of speech for vulnerability to private censorship in a context where  content-based discrimination is not otherwise permitted"").  Compare    Forbes , 523 U.S. at 679 (holding that the state does not create a  public forum when it ""allows selective  access  for individual speakers  rather than general access for a class of speakers"") (emphasis added),   with   Police Dep't of the City of Chicago v. Mosley , 408 U.S.  92, 96 (1972) (""Selective  exclusions  from a public forum may not be  based on content alone, and may not be justified by reference to content  alone."") (emphasis added).   We note further that to the extent that  the government creates a public forum expressly designed to facilitate the  dissemination of private speech, opens the forum to any member of the public to  speak on any virtually any topic, and then selectively targets certain speech  for exclusion based on its content, the government is singling out speech in a  manner that resembles the discriminatory taxes on the press that the Supreme  Court subjected to heightened First Amendment scrutiny in  Arkansas Writers'  Project, Inc. v. Ragland , 481 U.S. 221 (1987), and  Minneapolis Star  & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue , 460 U.S. 575  (1983), which we explain in the margin. (23)             Reasons for Applying Strict Scrutiny                       Selective Exclusion From a ""Vast Democratic Forum""           Applying these principles  to public libraries, we agree with the government that generally the First  Amendment subjects libraries' content-based decisions about which print  materials to acquire for their collections to only rational review. In making  these decisions, public libraries are generally free to adopt collection  development criteria that reflect not simply patrons' demand for certain  material, but also the library's evaluation of the material's quality.   See  Bernard W. Bell,  Filth, Filtering, and the First Amendment:  Ruminations on Public Libraries' Use of Internet Filtering Software , 53  Fed. Comm. L.J. 191, 225 (2001) (""Librarians should have the discretion to  decide that the library is committed to intellectual inquiry, not to the  satisfaction of the full range of human desires.""). Thus, a public library's  decision to use the last $100 of its budget to purchase the complete works of  Shakespeare even though more of its patrons would prefer the library to use the  same amount to purchase the complete works of John Grisham, is not, in our view,  subject to strict scrutiny.  Cf.   NEA v. Finley , 524 U.S. 569  (1998) (subjecting only to rational basis review the government's decision to  award NEA grants on the basis of,  inter alia , artistic  excellence).   Nonetheless, we disagree with the  government's argument that public libraries' use of Internet filters is no  different, for First Amendment purposes, from the editorial discretion that they  exercise when they choose to acquire certain books on the basis of librarians'  evaluation of their quality. The central difference, in our view, is that by  providing patrons with even filtered Internet access, the library permits  patrons to receive speech on a virtually unlimited number of topics, from a  virtually unlimited number of speakers, without attempting to restrict patrons'  access to speech that the library, in the exercise of its professional judgment,  determines to be particularly valuable.  Cf. Rosenberger v. Rector &  Visitors of Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S. 819, 834 (1995) (applying strict  scrutiny to viewpoint-based restrictions where the state ""does not itself speak  or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors but instead expends funds to  encourage a diversity of views from private speakers"").  See generally    supra  Section IV.C.    In those cases upholding the  government's exercise of editorial discretion in selecting certain speech for  subsidization or inclusion in a state-created forum, the state actor exercising  the editorial discretion has at least reviewed the content of the speech that  the forum facilitates. Thus, in  Finley  the NEA examined the content of  those works of art that it chose to subsidize, and in  Arkansas Educational  Television Commission v. Forbes , 523 U.S. 666 (1998), the public  broadcaster specifically reviewed and approved each speaker permitted to  participate in the debate.  See   id.  at 673 (""In the case of  television broadcasting, . . . broad rights of access for outside speakers would  be antithetical, as a general rule, to the discretion that stations and their  editorial staff must exercise to fulfill their journalistic purpose and  statutory obligations."");  Finley , 524 U.S. at 586 (""The NEA's mandate  is to make esthetic judgments, and the inherently content-based 'excellence'  threshold for NEA support sets it apart from the subsidy at issue in   Rosenberger  - which was available to all student organizations that  were 'related to the educational purpose of the University . . . .'"") (quoting   Rosenberger , 515 U.S. at 824);  see also   Cornelius v. NAACP  Legal Def. & Educ. Fund , 473 U.S. 788, 804 (1985) (""The Government's  consistent policy has been to limit participation in the [Combined Federal  Campaign] to 'appropriate' voluntary agencies and to require agencies seeking  admission to obtain permission from federal and local Campaign officials. . . .  [T]here is no evidence suggesting that the granting of the requisite permission  is merely ministerial.""). The essence of editorial discretion requires the  exercise of professional judgment in examining the content that the government  singles out as speech of particular value.   This exercise of editorial discretion is  evident in a library's decision to acquire certain books for its collection. As  the government's experts in library science testified, in selecting a book for a  library's collection, librarians evaluate the book's quality by reference to a  variety of criteria such as  its  accuracy, the title's niche in relation to the rest of the collection, the  authority of the author, the publisher, the work's presentation, and how it  compares with other material available in the same genre or on the same  subject . Thus, the content of every  book that a library acquires has been reviewed by the library's collection  development staff or someone to whom they have delegated the task, and has been  judged to meet the criteria that form the basis for the library's collection  development policy. Although some public libraries use ""approval plans"" to  delegate the collection development to third-party vendors which provide the  library with recommended materials that the library is then free to retain or  return to the vendor, the same principle nonetheless attains.   In contrast, in providing patrons with  even filtered Internet access, a public library invites patrons to access speech  whose content has never been reviewed and recommended as particularly valuable  by either a librarian or a third party to whom the library has delegated  collection development decisions. Although several of the government's librarian  witnesses who testified at trial purport to apply the same standards that govern  the library's acquisition of print materials to the library's provision of  Internet access to patrons, when public libraries provide their patrons with  Internet access, they intentionally open their doors to vast amounts of speech  that clearly lacks sufficient quality to ever be considered for the library's  print collection. Unless a library allows access to only those sites that have  been preselected as having particular value, a method that, as noted above, was  tried and rejected by the Westerville Ohio Public Library,  see    supra  at 46-47, even a library that uses software filters has opened  its Internet collection ""for indiscriminate use by the general public.""   Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educs. Ass'n , 460 U.S. 37, 47 (1983).  ""[M]ost Internet forums - including chat rooms, newsgroups, mail exploders, and  the Web - are open to all comers.""  Reno v. ACLU , 521 U.S. 844, 880  (1997).   The fundamental difference between a  library's print collection and its provision of Internet access is illustrated  by comparing the extent to which the library opens its print collection to  members of the public to speak on a given topic and the extent to which it opens  its Internet terminals to members of the public to speak on a given topic. When  a public library chooses to carry books on a selected topic, e.g. chemistry, it  does not open its print collection to any member of the public who wishes to  write about chemistry. Rather, out of the myriad of books that have ever been  written on chemistry, each book on chemistry that the library carries has been  reviewed and selected because the person reviewing the book, in the exercise of  his or her professional judgment, has deemed its content to be particularly  valuable. In contrast, when a public library provides Internet access, even  filtered Internet access, it has created a forum open to any member of the  public who writes about chemistry on the Internet, regardless of how  unscientific the author's methods or of how patently false the author's  conclusions are, regardless of the author's reputation or grammar, and  regardless of the reviews of the scientific community.   Notwithstanding protestations in CIPA's  legislative history to the contrary, (24)   members of the general public do define the content that public libraries make  available to their patrons through the Internet. Any member of the public with  Internet access could, through the free Web hosting services available on the  Internet, tonight jot down a few musings on any subject under the sun, and  tomorrow those musings would become part of public libraries' online offerings  and be available to any library patron who seeks them out.   In providing its patrons with Internet  access, a public library creates a forum for the facilitation of speech, almost  none of which either the library's collection development staff or even the  filtering companies have ever reviewed. Although filtering companies review a  portion of the Web in classifying particular sites, the portion of the Web that  the filtering companies actually review is quite small in relation to the Web as  a whole. The filtering companies' harvesting process, described in our findings  of fact, is intended to identify only a small fraction of Web sites for the  filtering companies to review. Put simply, the state cannot be said to be  exercising editorial discretion permitted under the First Amendment when it  indiscriminately facilitates private speech whose content it makes no effort to  examine.  Cf.  Bell,  supra , at 226 (""[C]ourts should take a much  more jaundiced view of library policies that block Internet access to a very  limited array of subjects than they take of library policies that reserve  Internet terminals for very limited use."").    While the First Amendment permits the  government to exercise editorial discretion in singling out particularly favored  speech for subsidization or inclusion in a state-created forum, we believe that  where the state provides access to a ""vast democratic forum[],""  Reno ,  521 U.S. at 868, open to any member of the public to speak on subjects ""as  diverse as human thought,""  id.  at 870, and then selectively excludes  from the forum certain speech on the basis of its content, such exclusions are  subject to strict scrutiny. These exclusions risk fundamentally distorting the  unique marketplace of ideas that public libraries create when they open their  collections, via the Internet, to the speech of millions of individuals around  the world on a virtually limitless number of subjects. (25)   A public library's content-based  restrictions on patrons' Internet access thus resemble the content-based  restrictions on speech subsidized by the government, whether through direct  funding or through the creation of a designated public forum, that the Supreme  Court has subjected to strict scrutiny, as discussed above in Section IV.C.  Although the government may subsidize a particular message representing the  government's viewpoint without having to satisfy strict scrutiny,  see    Rust v. Sullivan , 500 U.S. 173 (1991) , strict scrutiny applies to restrictions that  selectively exclude particular viewpoints from a public forum designed to  facilitate a wide range of viewpoints,  see   Rosenberger v. Rector  & Visitors of Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S. 819 (1995). Similarly, although  the state's exercise of editorial discretion in selecting particular speakers  for participation in a state-sponsored forum is subject to rational basis  review,  see   Ark. Educ. Television Comm'n v. Forbes , 523 U.S.  666 (1998), selective exclusions of particular speakers from a forum otherwise  open to any member of the public to speak are subject to strict scrutiny,   see   City of Madison Joint School Dist. No. 8 v. Wis. Employment  Relations Comm'n , 429 U.S. 167 (1976).    And while the government may, subject  only to rational basis review, make content-based decisions in selecting works  of artistic excellence to subsidize,  see   NEA v. Finley , 524  U.S. 569 (1998), the Supreme Court has applied heightened scrutiny where the  government opens a general-purpose municipal theater for use by the public, but  selectively excludes disfavored content,  see   Southeastern  Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad , 420 U.S. 546 (1975), where the government  facilitates the speech of public broadcasters on a virtually limitless number of  topics, but prohibits editorializing,  see   FCC v. League of Women  Voters of Cal. , 468 U.S. 364 (1984), and where the government funds a wide  range of legal services but restricts funding recipients from challenging  welfare laws,  see   Legal  Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez , 531 U.S. 533 (2001) . Similarly, where a public library opens a forum  to an unlimited number of speakers around the world to speak on an unlimited  number of topics, strict scrutiny applies to the library's selective exclusions  of particular speech whose content the library disfavors.                     Analogy to Traditional Public Fora     Application of strict scrutiny to public libraries' use of software  filters, in our view, finds further support in the extent to which public  libraries' provision of Internet access promotes First Amendment values in an  analogous manner to traditional public fora, such as sidewalks and parks, in  which content-based restrictions on speech are always subject to strict  scrutiny. The public library, by its very nature, is ""designed for freewheeling  inquiry.""  Bd. of Education v. Pico , 457 U.S. 853, 915 (1982)  (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). As such, the library is a ""mighty resource in the  free marketplace of ideas,""  Minarcini v. Strongsville City Sch. Dist. ,  541 F.2d 577, 582 (6th Cir. 1976), and represents a ""quintessential locus of the  receipt of information.""  Kreimer v. Bureau of Police for Morristown ,  958 F.2d 1242, 1255 (3d Cir. 1992);  see also   Sund v. City of  Wichita Falls , 121 F. Supp. 2d 530, 547 (N.D. Tex. 2000) (""The right to  receive information is vigorously enforced in the context of a public library .  . . ."");  cf.   Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v.  Lee , 505 U.S. 672, 681 (1992) (""[A] traditional public forum is property  that has as 'a principal purpose . . . the free exchange of ideas.'"") (quoting   Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund , 473 U.S. 788, 800  (1985)).   We acknowledge that the provision of  Internet access in a public library does not enjoy the historical pedigree of  streets, sidewalks, and parks as a vehicle of free expression. Nonetheless, we  believe that it shares many of the characteristics of these traditional public  fora that uniquely promote First Amendment values and accordingly warrant  application of strict scrutiny to any content-based restriction on speech in  these fora. Regulation of speech in streets, sidewalks, and parks is subject to  the highest scrutiny not simply by virtue of history and tradition, but also  because the speech-facilitating character of sidewalks and parks makes them  distinctly deserving of First Amendment protection. Many of these same  speech-promoting features of the traditional public forum appear in public  libraries' provision of Internet access.   First, public libraries, like sidewalks  and parks, are generally open to any member of the public who wishes to receive  the speech that these fora facilitate, subject only to narrow limitations.   See   Kreimer ,  958 F.2d  at  1260  (noting that a public library does not retain unfettered  discretion ""to choose whom it will permit to enter the Library,"" but upholding  the library's right to exclude patrons who harass patrons or whose offensive  personal hygiene precludes the library's use by other patrons) .  Moreover,   like traditional public fora, public  libraries are funded by taxpayers and therefore do not charge members of the  public each time they use the forum. The only direct cost to library patrons who  wish to receive information, whether via the Internet or the library's print  collection, is the time spent reading.   By providing Internet access to millions  of Americans to whom such access would otherwise be unavailable, public  libraries play a critical role in bridging the digital divide separating those  with access to new information technologies from those that lack access.  See  generally  National Telecommunications and Information Administration, U.S.  Department of Commerce,  Falling Through the Net: Defining the Digital  Divide  (1999),  available at    http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fttn99/contents.html .  Cf.  Velazquez , 531 U.S. at 546 (invalidating a content-based restriction on the  speech of federally funded legal services corporations and noting that given the  financial hardship of legal services corporations' clients, ""[t]he restriction  on speech is even more problematic because in cases where the attorney withdraws  from a representation, the client is unlikely to find other counsel""). Public  libraries that provide Internet access greatly expand the educational  opportunities for millions of Americans who, as explained in the margin, would  otherwise be deprived of the benefits of this new medium. (26)   Just as important as the openness of a  forum to listeners is its openness to speakers. Parks and sidewalks are  paradigmatic loci of First Amendment values in large part because they permit  speakers to communicate with a wide audience at low cost. One can address  members of the public in a park for little more than the cost of a soapbox, and  one can distribute handbills on the sidewalk for little more than the cost of a  pen, paper, and some photocopies.  See   Martin v. City of  Struthers , 319 U.S. 141, 146 (1943) (""Door to door distribution of  circulars is essential to the poorly financed causes of little people."");  Laurence H. Tribe,  American Constitutional Law  § 12-24 at 987 (2d ed.  1988) (""The 'public forum' doctrine holds that restrictions on speech should be  subject to higher scrutiny when, all other things being equal, that speech  occurs in areas playing a vital role in communication - such as in those places  historically associated with first amendment activities, such as streets,  sidewalks, and parks - especially because of how indispensable communication in  these places is to people who lack access to more elaborate (and more costly)  channels.""); Daniel A. Farber,  Free Speech without Romance: Public Choice  and the First Amendment , 105 Harv. L. Rev. 554, 574 n.86 (1991) (noting  that traditional public fora ""are often the only place where less affluent  groups and individuals can effectively express their message""); Harry Kalven,  Jr.,  The Concept of the Public Forum:  Cox v. Louisiana, 1965 Sup. Ct.  Rev. 1, 30 (""[T]he parade, the picket, the leaflet, the sound truck, have been  the media of communication exploited by those with little access to the more  genteel means of communication."").    Similarly, given the existence of  message boards and free Web hosting services, a speaker can, via the Internet,  address the public, including patrons of public libraries, for little more than  the cost of Internet access. As the Supreme Court explained in  Reno v.  ACLU , 521 U.S. 844 (1997), ""the Internet can hardly be considered a  'scarce' expressive commodity. It provides relatively unlimited, low-cost  capacity for communication of all kinds.""  Id.  at 870. Although the cost  of a home computer and Internet access considerably exceeds the cost of a  soapbox or a few hundred photocopies, speakers wishing to avail themselves of  the Internet may gain free access in schools, workplaces, or the public library.  As Professor Lessig has explained:   The ""press"" in 1791 was not the  New  York Times  or the  Wall Street Journal . It did not comprise large  organizations of private interests, with millions of readers associated with  each organization. Rather, the press then was much like the Internet today. The  cost of a printing press was low, the readership was slight, and anyone (within  reason) could become a publisher - and in fact an extraordinary number did. When  the Constitution speaks of the rights of the ""press,"" the architecture it has in  mind is the architecture of the Internet.   Lawrence Lessig,  Code  183  (1999).   While public libraries' provision of  Internet access shares many of the speech-promoting qualities of traditional  public fora, it also facilitates speech in ways that traditional public fora  cannot. (27)   In particular, whereas the architecture of real space limits the audience of a  pamphleteer or soapbox orator to people within the speaker's immediate vicinity,  the Internet renders the geography of speaker and listener  irrelevant:   Through the use of chat rooms, any  person with a phone line can become a town crier with a voice that resonates  farther than it could from any soapbox. Through the use of Web pages, mail  exploders, and newsgroups, the same individual can become a  pamphleteer.   Reno , 521 U.S. at 870 . By  providing patrons with Internet access, public libraries in effect open their  doors to an unlimited number of potential speakers around the world, inviting  the speech of any member of the public who wishes to communicate with  library patrons via the Internet.   Due to the low costs for speakers and  the irrelevance of geography, the volume of speech available to library  patrons on the Internet is enormous and far exceeds the volume of speech  available to audiences in traditional public fora.  See   id.  at  868 (referring to ""the vast democratic forums of the Internet""). Indeed, as  noted in our findings of fact, the Web is estimated to contain over one billion  pages, and is said to be growing at a rate of over 1.5 million pages per day.   See   id.  at 885 (noting ""[t]he dramatic expansion of this new  marketplace of ideas""). This staggering volume of content on the Internet ""is as  diverse as human thought,""  id.  at 870, and ""is thus comparable, from  the reader's viewpoint, to . . . a vast library including millions of readily  available and indexed publications,""  id.  at 853. As a result of the  Internet's unique speech-facilitating qualities, ""it is hard to find an aspiring  social movement, new or old, of left, right, or center, without a website, a  bulletin board, and an email list."" Kreimer,  supra  n.27,   at  125. ""[T]he growth of the Internet has been and continues to be phenomenal.""   Reno , 521 U.S. at 885.   This extraordinary growth of the  Internet illustrates the extent to which the Internet promotes First Amendment  values in the same way that the historical use of traditional public fora for  speaking, handbilling, and protesting testifies to their effectiveness as  vehicles for free speech.  Cf.   Martin , 319 U.S. at 145 (""The  widespread use of this method of communication [door-to-door distribution of  leaflets] by many groups espousing various causes attests its major  importance."");  Schneider v. State , 308 U.S. 147, 164 (1939)  (""[P]amphlets have proved most effective instruments in the dissemination of  opinion."").   The provision of Internet access in  public libraries, in addition to sharing the speech-enhancing qualities of fora  such as streets, sidewalks, and parks, also supplies many of the  speech-enhancing properties of the postal service, which is open to the public  at large as both speakers and recipients of information, and provides a  relatively low-cost means of disseminating information to a geographically  dispersed audience.  See   Lamont v. Postmaster Gen. , 381 U.S.  301 (1965) (invalidating a content-based prior restraint on the use of the  mails);  see also   Blount v. Rizzi , 400 U.S. 410 (1971) (same).  Indeed, the Supreme Court's description of the postal system in  Lamont   seems equally apt as a description of the Internet today: ""the postal system . .  . is now the main artery through which the business, social, and personal  affairs of the people are conducted . . . ."" 381 U.S. at 305 n.3.   In short, public libraries, by providing  their patrons with access to the Internet, have created a public forum that  provides any member of the public free access to information from millions of  speakers around the world. The unique speech-enhancing character of Internet use  in public libraries derives from the openness of the public library to any  member of the public seeking to receive information, and the openness of the  Internet to any member of the public who wishes to speak. In particular,  speakers on the Internet enjoy low barriers to entry and the ability to reach a  mass audience, unhindered by the constraints of geography. (28)   Moreover, just as the development of new media ""presents unique problems, which  inform our assessment of the interests at stake, and which may justify  restrictions that would be unacceptable in other contexts,""  United States v.  Playboy Entm't Group, Inc. , 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000), the development of  new media, such as the Internet, also presents unique possibilities for  promoting First Amendment values, which also inform our assessment of the  interests at stake, and which we believe, in the context of the provision of  Internet access in public libraries, justify the application of heightened  scrutiny to content-based restrictions that might be subject to only rational  review in other contexts, such as the development of the library's print  collection.  Cf.   id.  at 818 (""Technology expands the capacity  to choose; and it denies the potential of this revolution if we assume the  Government is best positioned to make these choices for  us."").   A faithful translation of First  Amendment values from the context of traditional public fora such as sidewalks  and parks to the distinctly non-traditional public forum of Internet access in  public libraries requires, in our view, that content-based restrictions on  Internet access in public libraries be subject to the same exacting standards of  First Amendment scrutiny as content-based restrictions on speech in traditional  public fora such as sidewalks, town squares, and parks:   The architecture of the Internet, as it  is right now, is perhaps the most important model of free speech since the  founding. . . . Two hundred years after the framers ratified the Constitution,  the Net has taught us what the First Amendment means. . . . The model for speech  that the framers embraced was the model of the Internet - distributed,  noncentralized, fully free and diverse.   Lessig,  Code , at 167, 185.  Indeed, ""[m]inds are not changed in streets and parks as they once were. To an  increasing degree, the more significant interchanges of ideas and shaping of  public consciousness occur in mass and electronic media.""  Denver Area Educ.  Telecomms. Consortium, Inc. v. FCC , 518 U.S. 727, 802-03 (1996) (Kennedy,  J., concurring in the judgment).   In providing patrons with even filtered  Internet access, a public library is not exercising editorial discretion in  selecting only speech of particular quality for inclusion in its collection, as  it may do when it decides to acquire print materials. By providing its patrons  with Internet access, public libraries create a forum in which any member of the  public may receive speech from anyone around the world who wishes to disseminate  information over the Internet. Within this ""vast democratic forum[],""   Reno , 521 U.S. at 868, which facilitates speech that is ""as diverse as  human thought,""  id.  at 870, software filters single out for exclusion  particular speech on the basis of its disfavored content. We hold that these  content-based restrictions on patrons' access to speech are subject to strict  scrutiny.       Application of Strict Scrutiny     Having concluded that strict scrutiny applies to public libraries'  content-based restrictions on patrons' access to speech on the Internet, we must  next determine whether a public library's use of Internet software filters can  survive strict scrutiny. To survive strict scrutiny, a restriction on speech  ""must be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling Government interest. If a  less restrictive alternative would serve the Government's purpose, the  legislature must use that alternative.""  United States v. Playboy Entm't  Group, Inc. , 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000) (citation omitted);  see also    Fabulous Assocs., Inc. v. Pa. Pub. Util. Comm'n , 896 F.2d 780, 787 (3d  Cir. 1990) (holding that a content-based burden on speech is permissible ""only  if [the government] shows that the restriction serves a compelling interest and  that there are no less restrictive alternatives"").    The application of strict scrutiny to a  public library's use of filtering products thus requires three distinct  inquiries. First, we must identify those compelling government interests that  the use of filtering software promotes. It is then necessary to analyze whether  the use of software filters is narrowly tailored to further those interests.  Finally, we must determine whether less restrictive alternatives exist that  would promote the state interest.             State Interests     We begin by identifying those legitimate state interests that a public  library's use of software filters promotes.                      Preventing the Dissemination of Obscenity, Child Pornography, and        Material Harmful to Minors     On its face, CIPA is clearly intended to prevent public libraries'  Internet terminals from being used to disseminate to library patrons visual  depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or in the case of minors,  harmful"

Many losses are suffered by victims who thought they were paying start up costs for a small business of their own.   Pyramid schemes are illegal scams in which large numbers of people pay money to a few people. Each new participant pays for the chance to advance and profit from payments of others who might join later.  Pyramid schemes try to hide their true nature in order to fool potential participants and  evade law enforcers.   To join, a potential participant will have to pay money.  The only way of advancing in a pyramid is to recruit others who also pay money.  If enough new participants continue to join, the pyramid scheme continues to operate.  In order for everyone in a pyramid scheme to profit, there would have to be a never-ending supply of new participants.  Often the new recruits are a participant's friends and family.  In reality each new level of participants has less chance of recruiting others and a greater chance of losing money.  The pyramid may collapse at any time.  This places the  participant in the position of victimizing his or her own friends and family.   Pyramid promoters are masters of group psychology.  Recruitment meetings create a frenzied, enthusiastic atmosphere where group pressure and promises of easy money prey upon the potential victim's rational mind and fear of missing a good deal.  Promoters also openly discourage thoughtful consideration and questioning of the scheme.  Victims often find themselves tricked into participating.    It is important to recognize that inherent in the scheme is a double problem for the participant.  First the scheme may collapse as the new participant buys in, causing the participant's new recruits to look to him for refunds.  Second, if law enforcement finds out about the scheme,  prosecutors can file charges against the participant who has introduced others as well as against the promoter since both are considered violators of the law.    Some pyramid promoters try to make their schemes look like multi-level marketing methods.  Multi-level marketing can be a lawful and legitimate business which uses a network of independent distributors to sell consumer products.  The difference between a pyramid scheme and a multi- level marketing plan is that in the latter, money is only made through the retail sale of a product.  Participants can sell without paying to participate in the marketing scheme and consumers can buy without also joining the marketing scheme.   To avoid becoming both a victim and simultaneously violating the law, do not let anyone rush you into making hasty and unwise decisions.  A good opportunity to build a business in a multi-level structure will not disappear over night.  Take time to consider your investment before signing  anything or giving  someone your money.   Ask questions about the company and its officers, the products, their cost, fair market value, source of supply and the potential market in your area.  Ask about start up fees, required purchases and about the company's policy on the buy-back of required purchases.  Inquire about the average earnings of active distributors.   Get written copies of all available company literature.  Consult with others who have had experience with the company and its products.  Check to see if the products are actually being sold to consumers.  Try to determine whether these would be a market for the product if the multi-level  marketing structure did not exist. Verify all information; do not assume that official looking documents are either accurate or complete.    If you suspect that a company may be an illegal pyramid, contact your local law enforcement offices such as the police department, the sheriff's department or the district attorney of the county in which the pyramid is operating.  Every person who contrives, prepares or operates any endless  chain is guilty of a public offense which can be punished by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding one year or in state prison for 16 months, two, or three years.

Obesity Research Center: Babcock 1029 St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital Center 1111 Amsterdam Avenue       New York, NY, 10025                       Introduction   Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today. I am Dr. Carol Boozer. I  received my doctorate of science in nutrition from Harvard University, School of  Public Health. I am presently on the faculties of the Institute of Human  Nutrition, in the Department of Medicine at Columbia University and at the New  York Obesity Research Center at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York. I  have received research funding from the National Institutes of Health and have  served on NIH study sections and as an NIH site visit reviewer. I currently  receive significant research support from NIH grants. My career has been devoted  to research in the areas of nutrition and obesity with the intention to promote  public health.   Ephedra Studies   Issues relating to ephedra are highly controversial. My interest in this issue  is through my role as a scientist who was the principal investigator in two of  the very few clinical trials of the efficacy for weight loss and safety of  herbal ephedra/caffeine combinations. My position today is to promote the role  of science in the policy making process in general and in this issue in  particular.   The sudden death of any individual is tragic to the family and friends and a  loss to the country. The effort to reduce the number of these tragedies and  promote public health should be the highest priority. Reports of adverse events  related to the use of ephedra must be taken seriously, and they are useful in  pointing to areas that require research. They do not constitute scientific proof  of an association between ephedra consumption and injury. The reason why such  reports cannot prove cause and effect is easily understood by the following  example. If a city is considering whether installation of a traffic light has  reduced accidents at a dangerous intersection, both the accident rate before the  installation, the ""background rate"" and the rate after installation  must be known. However, even if both rates are known, a difference in rates  might not be due to the light itself since other factors such as weather,  condition of the road, or the opening of a bar in the area could affect the  rate. A reduction in the accident rate following installation of the light  cannot, in and of itself, prove that the light caused the change.   Methodology   Scientists have carefully considered the methodology required to show causality.  The ""gold standard"" method in clinical studies is the randomized,  double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Randomization is a process whereby  individuals are assigned to treatment groups in such a way that the two groups  are similar in all other characteristics, except for the treatment under study.  This controls for the possibility of even unknown factors affecting one group  differently from the other. Double-blinding insures impartiality, since  throughout the study neither the participants nor the investigators know the  treatment group of any participant. Finally, inclusion of a placebo group allows  assessment of the background rate, in a group that is similar in all aspects to  the treatment group, except for the treatment under study.   The two clinical trials of ephedra-containing products that I conducted were  both randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies undertaken to assess  the efficacy for weight loss and safety of herbal/ephedra combinations. A  statistician not involved in carrying out the studies provided the randomization  codes using a system that would maximize the chance that placebo and treatment  groups would on average be similar in characteristics such as age, body weight,  gender distribution, income, education, etc. Since none of the research staff  involved in the study knew the codes, there was no way that they could bias the  results by treating one group differently from the other during the study. Only  after the study was completed and after the data had been entered into computer  spreadsheets was the code broken by the statistician who analyzed the data. The  data for the group receiving the ephedra was then compared with the data for the  group receiving placebo. Since the groups were similar at the start of the study  and followed the same protocol with the exception of the treatment, herbal  ephedra/caffeine or placebo, any differences that were found could be attributed  to the treatment.   These two studies were the only clinical trials of ephedra and ephedrine that  were given the highest ranking for quality in the recently published Rand  Report.   Results   The two studies together included 234 men and women who were overweight, but  otherwise healthy. Half received herbal ephedra/caffeine and half placebo. One  study continued for 8 weeks, the other for 6 months. In both studies, those  receiving the herbal treatment lost more body weight and body fat and had  improved blood lipids compared with those receiving placebo. No individual in  either study experienced a significant adverse event (defined in the scientific  community as death, heart attack, stroke, etc.). In both studies, the herbal  groups had increased heart rate and slightly increased blood pressure relative  to placebo groups. Heart monitors, used in the 6-month study, showed that herbal  treatment did not increase heart irregularities. Drop-out rates were similar in  the herbal and placebo groups in both studies, but in the 8-week study, the  reasons given for dropping out of the herbal treatment group included more  self-reported side effects (primarily palpitations). In the 6-month study, the  numbers of individuals who dropped out due to side effects were very low and  were similar between the two groups. The side effects reported more frequently  by all subjects in the herbal groups compared with placebo groups were: dry  mouth, insomnia, headache and heartburn.   Reaction   These studies were published in the International Journal of Obesity. &  Prior to publication, experts in the field critically reviewed each paper and  made recommendations to the editor as to the validity of methods, interpretation  of results and scientific importance, a process called peer-review. Subsequent  to publication, there have been attacks on the studies by the media and others.   The public is not well served by suppression of scientific studies. The value of  scientific study does not depend on agreement of outcome with preconceived  expectation. While no study is perfect, these studies were conducted without  pressure from the industry sponsors for a predetermined outcome, as evidenced by  their contractual agreement to publication of results regardless of outcome. The  studies were conducted with impartiality that was assured by the randomized,  double-blind, placebo-controlled design. They were subjected to peer-review and  published in a reputable scientific journal.   Rejection of scientific data in favor of anecdotal stories is inconsistent with  the advancement of knowledge or responsible public health policy. The Rand  Report reviewed approximately 20,000 adverse event reports. They classified  events as ""sentinel"" if they provided three things: 1) documentation  that the event did occur, 2) documentation or toxicological evidence that the  subject had consumed ephedra within 24 hours prior to the adverse event, and 3)  evidence that an adequate investigation had assessed and excluded other  potential causes. Only 21, approximately 1 in 1,000 reports, reached this level  and only two of these were deaths.   One estimate of ephedra consumption in the United States was 12 million people  in 1999. Among such a large number of people, some adverse events would occur  whether or not individuals were taking ephedra. Data from the U.S. Government's  Division of Vital Statistics estimates the death rate from heart disease alone  to be roughly 1 in 5,500 even in young individuals, age 25-44 years. Among the  millions of people consuming ephedra, the background rate of deaths and other  serious adverse events would be in the thousands, many fold higher than the 21  documented sentinel events. That is why the Rand Report states that  ""classification as a sentinel event does not imply a proven cause and  effect relationship.""   While efficacy of ephedra in promoting weight loss is established, it is not my  position that the safety of herbal ephedra is proven for different populations  or with different usage. Additional research would be required to determine  effects in people who are not healthy, or who consume ephedra at levels above  those studied, or for periods longer than six months, or in combination with  prescription or illicit drugs. But, at present, there is no scientific data  proving that consumption of ephedra/caffeine combinations for weight loss are  unsafe, when consumed in accordance with appropriate warning labels.   Additional research on the effects of ephedra on weight loss and in other areas,  such as athletic performance, is clearly needed. I urge those who are  responsible for policy to promote such research and to be guided by its  findings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                Related                 Documents Issues Relating to Ephedra-containing Dietary Supplements.

GX022-53-4947832	"For Release :                  January 31, 2002 Pyramid                 Promoter Settles FTC Charges                   A participant in a pyramid scheme that posed as a multi-level                 marketing business has agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that the scheme                 violated federal law. The settlement bars Robert Waitkus from engaging in illegal                 marketing schemes in the future and requires that he give up $30,000 in ill-gotten gains.                 The settlement also will bar him from making false or unsubstantiated safety or efficacy                 claims for dietary supplements.                   In June 2001, the FTC charged that Waitkus and Streamline                 International, Inc., the firm for which he worked, were operating a fraudulent business                 opportunity whose members purportedly distributed a line of dietary supplements and                 health-care products. Marketing materials claimed participants could earn money quickly                 and easily. But the FTC complaint alleged, ""In reality, the vast majority of                 participants in the Streamline program achieve little or no financial success, or make                 very modest earnings.""                    In addition to claims about earnings, the program promoted                 its health-care products with the claim, ""Our products contain only those ingredients                 that appear on the [FDA's] list of [products] generally recognized as safe."" ""In                 reality,"" the FTC's complaint says, ""a number of dietary supplements sold by the                 defendants contain the herbal ingredient comfrey, which is not included on the Food and                 Drug Administration's list of products generally recognized as safe. In fact, comfrey is                 known to pose a significant risk to humans, including liver damage, when used internally                 or externally on open wounds.""                   The settlement will bar Waitkus from engaging, participating,                 or assisting in any pyramid, Ponzi, or other illegal marketing scheme in the future. In                 any future multi-level marketing enterprises in which he participates, the settlement bars                 him from misrepresenting the income or rewards a participant is likely to earn or the                 income that previous participants earned. If earnings claims are made, the settlement                 requires that he disclose the number and percentage of current program participants who                 have made a profit and the average and median amount of money made by each current program                 participant. It also bars him from providing others with the means and instrumentalities                 to engage in deceptive conduct and bars misrepresentations about dietary supplements.                 Finally, the settlement requires Waitkus will give up $30,000 in ill-gotten gains.                   The Commission vote to file the settlement was 5-0. It was                 filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.

Letter of Transmittal    January 20, 2000    The President  The White House  Washington, DC  20500    Dear Mr. President:    I am pleased to submit the National Council on Disability's (NCD) report From  Privileges to Rights:  People Labeled with Psychiatric Disabilities Speak for Themselves , which is based on the testimony of people with psychiatric disabilities who testified at an NCD hearing in 1998.    All the recommendations in this report emphasize the basic principle that people with psychiatric disabilities are, first and foremost, citizens who have the right to expect that they will be treated according to the principles of law that apply to all other citizens. All laws and policies that restrict the rights of people with psychiatric disabilities simply because of their disabilities are inharmonious with basic principles of law and justice, as well as with such landmark civil rights laws as the Americans with Disabilities Act.    We call on you, Mr. President and Congress, to address the problems described in this report, particularly by ensuring that people with psychiatric disabilities themselves are involved in a major way in making the policy changes that will enable them to claim their full citizenship rights.    We look forward to the day when the label of psychiatric disability has no more effect on people's rights than does the existence of any other disability label. Until that day, NCD believes that people with psychiatric disabilities will remain among the most underprivileged and disadvantaged of American citizens.

NCD generally does its work in a cross-disability manner, emphasizing that people with disabilities should be the ones who make the major decisions about their lives.  NCD endorses and supports the principles of independent living, which has achieved the success it has because it is rooted in two unwavering principles:  self-determination and consumer direction.    People with psychiatric disabilities are routinely deprived of their rights in a way no other disability group has been.  In order to learn more about the problems of psychiatric disability, NCD conducted a hearing specifically on this topic.  At the hearing, held in Albany, New York, in November 1998, NCD heard testimony from mental health professionals, lawyers, advocates, and relatives of people with psychiatric disabilities.  However, unlike most investigations on the topic of psychiatric disability, the primary participants in this hearing were people with psychiatric disabilities themselves, who testified passionately and eloquently both about the mistreatment they had experienced or witnessed, and their proposals for real and viable change.  NCD heard testimony graphically describing how people with psychiatric disabilities have been beaten, shocked, isolated, incarcerated, restricted, raped, deprived of food and bathroom privileges, and physically and psychologically abused in institutions and in their communities. The testimony pointed to the inescapable fact that people with psychiatric disabilities are systematically and routinely deprived of their rights, and treated as less than full citizens or full human beings.           Forced treatment and abuse aren't synonymous with healing.  When      persons are admitted in a general hospital for any other      problems--stroke, cancer, broken hip, X rays, tests--these persons      wouldn't dream of allowing the doctors, nurses, or nursing aides to l      ock them up, shock them up, tie them up, or drug them up, and the      staff wouldn't do it to them.  Those patients are treated with      compassion, caring, respect, and dignity, and persons who have      serious enough emotional/mental problems need to be treated the      same.  (Bernice E. Loschen)         Finally, it is important to realize how cruelly this system      preys on the worst fears and vulnerabilities of people in crisis.      They isolate you from the rest of the world, and they become your      only reference point.  When they accuse someone of being treatment      resistant, they are accusing them of not wanting to change their      lives.  I was told that this was the end of the line for me.  If this      didn't work, nothing would, and if I left, I would very likely kill      myself.  During the entire length of my treatment, they did nothing      constructive for me, and they hurt me deeply.  (Diana Rickard)      Joe Young of the New Jersey P&A testified about abuses he has witnessed in mental institutions.           Among the more egregious concerns:  the administration of      medication, often without consulting the resident, likely without      informed consent, frequently with limited understanding of the likely      effect on this particular individual, including possible long-term      side effects, and often for reasons of control rather than treatment;      the absence not just of regular effective treatment programs, but of      any purposeful activity (residents can still be seen sleeping in      hallways and in the dayroom when bedrooms are locked); the arbitrary      (and often dangerous) application of restraints, seclusion, and      isolation; and the continued warehousing of individuals for months,      if not years, after the expiration of any determination of [danger].  (Joe Young)         Diana Rickard testified about the degrading extent of the denial      of basic human rights while she was institutionalized.      The unit structure is based on privileges and punishments, which      are referred to as consequences, since they maintain these are not      punitive.  [The structure] will not allow any kind of privacy      whatsoever, and everything is a potential treatment issue, including      nail-biting and not making one's bed.  They maintain control through      humiliation and fear of humiliation.  (Diana Rickard)      NCD heard many reports of the routine use and overuse of psychiatric drugs, often against people's will.           When I was in a psychiatric facility, because I questioned      conditions, I was dragged into solitary confinement and held down on      a bare mattress, forcibly injected with powerful psychiatric drugs,      and held in solitary confinement.  And I found since then that this      is routine, that this is happening all over the--all over the      psychiatric system.  Usually forced psychiatric drugging occurs      behind institutional walls, but in the last few years coerced      drugging is now out in the community.  Thirty-six U.S. states and the      District of Columbia have involuntary outpatient commitment laws,      which allow people to be court ordered to take their psychiatric      drugs against their expressed wishes, even if they're living at      home.  (David Oaks)         Even though most people with psychiatric disabilities are capable of      participating in the decisions affecting their own care, they are often      subjected to forced treatment.  Given appropriate supports and full      protection of their civil rights, the great majority of people with      psychiatric disabilities are quite able not only to participate in their      own health care but to become fully productive and creative members of      mainstream society.  But those simple supports and protections are rarely      provided.  Millions of people with psychiatric disabilities exist as      virtual outcasts.  This massive discrimination costs our nation uncounted      billions of dollars in obsolete services and lost productivity.  More      important, in the land of liberty and justice for all, it is morally      intolerable.  (Justin Dart, April 20, 1999)      Based on the testimony it received, NCD has concluded that the manner in which American society treats people with psychiatric disabilities constitutes a national emergency and a national disgrace.  Because people with psychiatric disabilities are routinely deprived of their most fundamental rights, NCD believes that drastic change is necessary in a number of systems that deal with this population.  Changes must be made not only in the mental health system, but in the criminal and civil justice systems, housing, income supports, education, job training, and many others, so that people with psychiatric disabilities are guaranteed their fundamental rights as American citizens.    NCD has also concluded that one of the reasons public policy concerning psychiatric disability is so different from that concerning other disabilities is the systematic exclusion of people with psychiatric disabilities from policymaking.  It is rare that people with psychiatric disabilities are heard in public-policy forums, and when they are, it is usually in token numbers.  NCD's hearing was unique because it focused its attention on the direct experiences of people with psychiatric disabilities themselves, and their calls for fundamental change.    The foremost change that is needed, as referred to by speaker after speaker, is the elimination of coercion from the provision of mental health services.  Involuntary commitment and forced treatment, which often go unquestioned in discussions of mental health policy, were described again and again as being among the most painful and difficult experiences of people's lives.  In addition, coercion was repeatedly noted as being a barrier to seeking out voluntary treatment, since people knew that once they entered the treatment system they could be coerced or involuntarily committed at any point.  At a time when American citizens are being urged to do away with the stigma of mental illness and to voluntarily seek treatment for emotional difficulties, it becomes particularly important to ensure that people are able to do so without surrendering their fundamental rights.    Therefore, NCD recommends that the use of involuntary treatments, such as forced drugging and inpatient and outpatient commitment laws, should be viewed as inherently suspect and as incompatible with the principles of self-determination.  Public policy should be directed toward establishing a totally voluntary mental health system.    NCD also recommends that aversive treatments, which involve the infliction of pain or the restriction of movement for purposes of changing behavior, should be banned, since they are also incompatible with self-determination principles.  Practices that would often be illegal if administered to people without disabilities are routinely used on people with psychiatric disabilities in the name of ""treatment.""  Such practices should shock the consciences of all Americans.    All of the recommendations in NCD's report follow the same basic principles: that people with psychiatric disabilities are, first and foremost, citizens who have the right to expect that they will be treated according to the principles of law that apply to all other citizens.  All laws and policies that restrict the rights of people with psychiatric disabilities solely because of their disabilities are at odds with basic principles of law and justice, as well as with such landmark civil rights laws as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).    NCD calls on the President and Congress to address the problems described in its report, particularly by ensuring that people with psychiatric disabilities themselves are involved in a major way in making the policy changes that will enable them to claim their full citizenship rights.  NCD also calls on the media to address the problems described herein, and to avoid the negative stereotyping that has often typified public discussions of mental illness.    NCD looks forward to the day when the label of psychiatric disability has no more effect on people's rights than does any other disability label.  Until that day, NCD believes that people with psychiatric disabilities will remain among the most underprivileged and disadvantaged of American citizens.    The recommendations that follow center on the importance of self-determination, dignity, and choice as the cornerstone of public policy for people in this highly disempowered population.  As Congress stated when it passed ADA, disability is a natural part of the human experience that in no way should limit the ability of people to make choices, pursue meaningful careers, live independently, and participate fully in all aspects of American society.  NCD believes that these recommendations, if implemented, would help to ensure that the public policy goals articulated in ADA become a reality for people labeled with psychiatric disabilities in the United States.    Core Recommendations    Therefore, NCD has developed 10 core recommendations in this report.  These policy recommendations should be viewed from the context of the larger report, which follows.  These deeply held core beliefs form, however, a dynamic backdrop to highlight the human and civil rights of people who have experienced the mental health system, people who should be viewed as the true experts on their experiences, beliefs, and values, which should be used as a guiding force for changing public policy related to these issues in America.    1.  Laws that allow the use of involuntary treatments such as forced drugging and inpatient and outpatient commitment should be viewed as inherently suspect, because they are incompatible with the principle of self-determination.  Public policy needs to move in the direction of a totally voluntary community-based mental health system that safeguards human dignity and respects individual autonomy.    2.  People labeled with psychiatric disabilities should have a major role in the direction and control of programs and services designed for their benefit.  This central role must be played by people labeled with psychiatric disabilities themselves, and should not be confused with the roles that family members, professional advocates, and others often play when ""consumer"" input is sought.    3.  Mental health treatment should be about healing, not punishment.  Accordingly, the use of aversive treatments, including physical and chemical restraints, seclusion, and similar techniques that restrict freedom of movement, should be banned.  Also, public policy should move toward the elimination of electro-convulsive therapy and psycho surgery as unproven and inherently inhumane procedures.  Effective humane alternatives to these techniques exist now and should be promoted.    4.  Federal research and demonstration resources should place a higher priority on the development of culturally appropriate alternatives to the medical and biochemical approaches to treatment of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities, including self-help, peer support, and other consumer/survivor-driven alternatives to the traditional mental health system.    5.  Eligibility for services in the community should never be contingent on participation in treatment programs.  People labeled with psychiatric disabilities should be able to select from a menu of independently available services and programs, including mental health services, housing, vocational training, and job placement, and should be free to reject any service or program.  Moreover, in part in response to the Supreme Court's decision in  Olmstead v. L C. , State and federal governments should work with people labeled with psychiatric disabilities and others receiving publicly-funded care in institutions to expand culturally appropriate home- and community-based supports so that people are able to leave institutional care and, if they choose, access an effective, flexible, consumer/survivor-driven system of supports and services in the community.    6.  Employment and training and vocational rehabilitation programs must account for the wide range of abilities, skills, knowledge, and experience of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities by administering programs that are highly individualized and responsive to the abilities, preferences, and personal goals of program participants.    7.  Federal income support programs like Supplemental Security Income and Social Security Disability Insurance should provide flexible and work-friendly support options so that people with episodic or unpredictable disabilities are not required to participate in the current ""all or nothing"" federal disability benefit system, often at the expense of pursuing their employment goals.    8.  To assure that parity laws do not make it easier to force people into accepting ""treatments"" they do not want, it is critical that these laws define parity only in terms of voluntary treatments and services.    9.  Government civil rights enforcement agencies and publicly-funded advocacy organizations should work more closely together and with adequate funding to implement effectively critical existing laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act, Fair Housing Act, Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act, and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, giving people labeled with psychiatric disabilities a central role in setting the priorities for enforcement and implementation of these laws.    10.  Federal, state, and local governments, including education, health care, social services, juvenile justice, and civil rights enforcement agencies, must work together to reduce the placement of children and young adults with disabilities, particularly those labeled seriously emotionally disturbed, in correctional facilities and other segregated settings. These placements are often harmful, inconsistent with the federally-protected right to a free and appropriate public education, and unnecessary if timely, coordinated, family-centered supports and services are made available in mainstream settings.           Chapter 1    When Helping Hurts    The independent living movement for people with physical disabilities in the United States and abroad has achieved the success it has because it is rooted in two unwavering principles:  self-determination and consumer direction.  This great civil rights movement has challenged the old assumptions of the medical model--dependency and incompetence--that were used to justify exclusion.  The independent living movement requires that people with disabilities must have maximum control of their lives.    An indispensable element of self-determination is the concept of consumer direction.  Since people with disabilities are the experts on which social priorities hinder or enhance their own progress, the disability rights movement advocates that people with disabilities should control the organizations that serve and/or represent them.  To ensure complete autonomy over their lives, people with disabilities should have ultimate control in allocating resources that support their independence.    The independent living movement has also challenged the role of the medical profession in controlling the lives of people with disabilities.  For too long, medical professionals have assumed the right to make decisions for people with disabilities that go far beyond questions of medical treatment.  People with disabilities have demanded that they be partners with medical professionals concerning their medical care, and that doctors and others should not be involved in deciding nonmedical aspects of their lives, such as where and how they live or work.    In addition to medical professions, many other individuals and groups have claimed the right to make decisions on behalf of people with disabilities.  Family members, educators, legislators, and members of various helping professions have been among the groups that claimed they knew what people with disabilities wanted and needed.  The growth of the independent living movement is based on the overriding concept that it is people with disabilities themselves who must make the decisions about how to live, just as other citizens do.    The wisdom of the philosophy of consumer control is now so widely accepted that federal funding of independent living centers is tied to the requirement that their decision-making boards be composed of a majority of people with disabilities.  However, even with the significant strides the independent living movement has made, people with disabilities still do not control most of the organizations that provide services to them.    Our nation has declared with resounding statements, particularly the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), that the humanity of people with disabilities is to be respected and defended and that they, like all Americans, deserve the freedom and support to go as far as their desires and abilities will take them.  Sadly, our nation has forsaken such ideals for people with psychiatric disabilities.  The disability rights and independent living movements have in most cases failed to defend with equal passion the rights and humanity of people with psychiatric disabilities.  While discrimination and abuse toward people with physical disabilities stirs indignation, at the same time we barely notice that people with psychiatric disabilities endure both on a daily basis.  Unfortunately, like most Americans, the disability rights and independent living movements are still too quick to accept powerful demonizing stereotypes that people with psychiatric disabilities are crazy, dangerous, stupid, and evil.  Recognizing and eliminating these prejudices will empower people with psychiatric disabilities to achieve the same self-determination now available to many of their peers with physical disabilities, and to build a strong, unified cross-disability movement.    Misconceptions about dangerousness are among the justifications that allow the maltreatment and abuse of people with psychiatric disabilities.  With the exception of people with psychiatric disabilities themselves, few people question such routine practices as involuntary commitment, forced drugging, segregation both in institutions and community programs, and the routine use of restraint and seclusion. In order to learn more about the problems of psychiatric disability, the National Council on Disability (NCD) conducted a hearing specifically on this topic.  At the hearing, held in Albany, New York, in November 1998, NCD heard testimony from mental health professionals, lawyers, advocates, and relatives of people with psychiatric disabilities.  However, unlike most investigations on the topic of psychiatric disability, the primary participants in this hearing were people with psychiatric disabilities themselves, who testified passionately and eloquently both about the mistreatment they had experienced or witnessed, and their proposals for real and viable change.  NCD heard testimony graphically describing how people with psychiatric disabilities have been beaten, shocked, isolated, incarcerated, restricted, raped, deprived of access to food and bathroom facilities, and physically and psychologically abused in institutions and in their communities. The testimony pointed to the inescapable fact that people with psychiatric disabilities are systematically and routinely deprived of their rights and treated as less than full citizens or full human beings.    People with psychiatric disabilities are the only Americans who can have their freedom taken away and be institutionalized or incarcerated without being convicted of a crime and with minimal or no respect for their due process rights.  They are the only Americans who can routinely be forced to submit to medical treatments against their will. When people with psychiatric disabilities die in facilities that are supposed to serve and protect them, their deaths are rarely investigated, and even when they are, criminal charges are rarely filed.  This not happening in some Third World country.  This is happening every day in the United States, and such practices are generally ignored or defended by mental health professionals, political leadership, and the media.    Involuntary treatment is extremely rare outside the psychiatric system, allowable only in such cases as unconsciousness or the inability to communicate.  People with psychiatric disabilities, on the other hand, even when they vigorously protest treatments they do not want, are routinely subjected to them anyway, on the justification that they ""lack insight"" or are unable to recognize their need for treatment because of their ""mental illness.""  In practice, ""lack of insight"" becomes disagreement with the treating professional, and people who disagree are labeled ""noncompliant"" or ""uncooperative with treatment.""  After years of contact with a system that routinely does not recognize their preferences or desires, many people with psychiatric disabilities become resigned to their fate and cease to protest openly.  Although this is described in the psychiatric literature as ""compliance,"" it is actually learned helplessness (also known as ""internalized oppression"") that is incompatible with hope and with the possibility of recovery.    Traditionally, involuntary commitment has involved the loss of liberty and confinement in a facility.  However, more recently the concept of involuntary outpatient commitment (IOC) has become more widespread.  IOC laws have been passed in nearly two-thirds of the states, and similar legislation has been introduced in Congress.  IOC involves court-ordered treatment (almost always medication) for people who do not meet the standards for inpatient commitment (physical dangerousness to self or others).  With more states enacting IOC laws, more people with psychiatric disabilities are being forced to take medications and treatments that can be painful and debilitating.  At the same time, the desire of many people labeled with psychiatric disabilities for voluntary services that affect their real-life needs (such as housing, job training, and social support) seldom receive adequate funding.  One of the consequences of IOC laws is that they often take money from voluntary programs that promote independence and redirect it toward ever more restrictive and punitive programs.           Antiquated public policy priorities based on the medical model play      key roles in perpetuating these injustices.  These policies have been      shaped without any meaningful participation by people labeled with      psychiatric disabilities.  America must listen to the eloquent voices of      people who live with psychiatric disabilities, and accept them as the real      experts who can create humane and empowering public policies dedicated to      the ideals of independent living--self-determination and consumer direction.      We are locked up without due process and without knowing how      long our sentence will be....We become physically disabled by the      so-called treatments we are given, such as brain-damaging      electroshock and psychiatric drugs. We are the scapegoats of the      society....If people can say it is our fault and we are the defective      ones, then they don't have to face the issues that are happening in      society that are oppressing people.  (Janet Foner)      Americans with disabilities commonly confront violations of their civil rights.  But the deeply entrenched prejudice, violence, and maltreatment perpetrated against people labeled with psychiatric disabilities extend beyond the realm of civil rights.  Again and again, NCD heard moving and powerful testimony describing the deprivation of basic human rights in the name of treatment.           I spent 15 consecutive months on Unit 5 North.  This was the      single most traumatic experience of my life.  The treatment consisted      of an unrelenting, 24-hour-a-day attack on my personal autonomy and      self-esteem, which I believe only exacerbated my symptoms.  (Diana Rickard)      PAIMI's Challenge    Anyone with a psychiatric disability, in fact anyone deemed by a mental health professional or police officer with little or no training to have such a disability, can be legally deprived of their freedom simply with an order from a judge, law officer, or medical professional.  The due process procedures to challenge those decisions, and the laws and agencies that are supposed to protect and defend the legal rights of people affected by such orders, are often inadequate, ineffective, underfunded, inaccessible, or disregarded.  Even when people are entitled to hearings, these are usually brief, and representation by counsel is often inadequate or nonexistent.  The Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness (PAIMI) program of the federally funded Protection and Advocacy (P&A) system is underfunded and inadequate because of statutory limitations to protect people labeled with psychiatric disabilities from abuse and neglect.  Further, the PAIMI program itself, in common with other elements of the services system for people labeled with psychiatric disabilities, has little input from the people it is supposed to serve, nor do many agencies reach out to people in recovery to seek their input.    Once the system fails them and they are defined as ""mentally ill,"" people labeled with psychiatric disabilities are isolated from and ignored by society.  Joe Young, a legal advocate from New Jersey Protection and Advocacy, testified on the conditions he has observed in institutions:           During the four years that NJP&A has sought to monitor the      conditions in the state-run psychiatric hospitals, we have witnessed      distressing, but I am certain not unusual, conditions that few, if      any, of us would subject ourselves to voluntarily.      Such conditions are not unique to New Jersey.  When Marc Keifer entered East Bay Hospital in Richmond, California, on the evening of February 1, 1993, he was a physically healthy 38-year-old man.  Less than two days later, Keifer, who carried a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, died alone in an isolation room after he was restrained to a bed with leather straps, belts, and cuffs for 18 hours.  A protection and advocacy investigation determined that Keifer likely died from ""the undiagnosed and untreated medical condition of anticholinergic toxicity from psychiatric medications, as well as a prolonged period of improperly monitored seclusion and restraint.""  Such deaths are, unfortunately, not rare.    Because protection and advocacy agencies lack adequate funding and resources, many people are left helpless and defenseless, as the public affairs manager of a California protection and advocacy agency testified:           I am very sad to say that this [investigational] unit is always      extremely busy and cannot keep up with all the requests we receive to      investigate individual cases of abuse and neglect of people with      disabilities in California hospitals and institutions.   (Stacie Hiramoto)      P&As responded to 34,000 complaints regarding abuse and neglect in 1998, and have conducted 5,000 death investigations over the past 20 years.  Cases that come to the attention of P&As represent merely the tip of the iceberg.  The American Journal of Psychiatry reported that as many as 81 percent of women with psychiatric disabilities have been physically or sexually abused in institutions. In the general population, some 1,000 rapes occur each day, but only 300 of them are reported, according to the U.S. Office of Victims Assistance at the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).  Likewise, the numbers of abuse and neglect complaints P&As responded to may be vastly understated as the majority of these incidents perpetrated against people with disabilities also are never reported.           Based on my 20 years of work with the Commission, I believe too      many consumer complaints or suspicions of abuse are buried with the      body.  (Thomas R. Harmon, director of medical review and investigations, New      York State Commission on Quality of Care)      An attorney testified that the statutory eligibility criteria for PAIMI services are too narrowly drawn.  (PAIMI services are available to people labeled with psychiatric disabilities who are in institutions; or in the process of being admitted to or transported to one; or who are in a detention facility, jail, or prison; or with respect to matters that took place within 90 days of discharge from such facilities.)  Since 1986, when the PAIMI law was enacted, there have been profound changes in the mental health delivery system that are not reflected in existing legislation.  Nowadays, when many people labeled with psychiatric disabilities are subjected to outpatient programs that severely curtain their rights, the PAIMI's statutory limitations leave these people without the availability of legal advocacy.  Several years ago, funding of legal services programs for low-income people, including people with disabilities, was severely restricted.  People testifying indicated concern that P&A organizations will be similarly cut.           I wanted to urge you to advocate to preserve that system, to      expand the system, and also to ensure that it does not fall prey to      the kind of destructive limitations...that have happened to the      federal legal services program.  Those sorts of restrictions, if      placed on the P&A system, would absolutely devastate the      effectiveness.   (Cliff Zucker)      Merely increasing the funding for PAIMI programs is not enough.  Vigorous efforts must be made to ensure that PAIMIs are responsive to the people they serve. Current federal law requires that people labeled with psychiatric disabilities or their relatives be a majority on PAIMI advisory councils, but there is no similar requirement for their governing boards.  While some advisory councils are heavily involved in oversight of the PAIMI program, others have minimal roles and may serve as a mere rubber stamp.    Further, there is an inherent conflict of interest in having federal oversight of the PAIMI program located in the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), which is an organization primarily concerned with service delivery and not with legal or rights issues.  It would make far more sense to locate federal oversight of PAIMI programs in the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services, or in the Department of Justice.    Even under the watchful eye of DOJ, people die from abuse and neglect in institutions.  Since 1990, DOJ has been scrutinizing Virginia's state mental hospital system, which encompasses 15 facilities that house some 3,800 people.  In 1994, after the deaths of three people in one year at the Northern Virginia Mental Health Institute, DOJ initiated an investigation, and in 1996 sued the Institute and two other Virginia facilities because of inadequate care.  In 1997, DOJ reached a settlement with the Institute after it agreed to make the required improvements.  But in 1998, two more people died.  John N. Follansbee, the former medical director of the facility, reported in the June 12, 1999, edition of  The Washington Post  that the facility is not likely to meet the improvement goals set by DOJ.    The Fall 1997 issue of a Sacramento, California, P&A newsletter reports that a woman died at the Butte County Inpatient Psychiatric Health Facility when she suffered third-degree burns over 80 percent of her body while showering with hot water.  Although California regulations covered hot water temperatures in other health facilities, they did not cover the water temperature in psychiatric hospitals.  This is just one more example of how people labeled with psychiatric disabilities are denied equal protection of law.           An advocate from the New York State Commission for Quality of Care testified that:      Each year the commission receives, reviews, and, where      necessary, directly investigates about 7,000 reports of abuse and      over 2,000 reports of consumer deaths....We have investigated over      200 deaths where restraint or seclusion was a factor....In our casew      ork, we've seen people die or be abused in restraint because a simple      request for a second cup of coffee was denied; or a request for a      sweater on a very cold day was ignored by staff.   (Thomas R. Harmon)      One sexual abuse survivor, who was forcibly restrained while in a mental institution, continues to relive the horror through nightmares.  In her testimony about the traumatizing incident, she stated:           Eight men jumped on top of me and wrestled me to the floor.      They held me face-down on the floor, restrained me, and then shot me      up [with] Thorazine.  I then waited in restraints for hours until      they thought my behavior was appropriate to be released.  I remember      begging with them like a dog to release me.  I was totally powerless      and at their mercy.  (Marcie Kelley)      For someone who has survived sexual abuse or who is a victim of rape, restraints are especially abusive and traumatizing.  However, many mental health professionals may not recognize this danger.   Victim Empowerment:  Bridging the Systems--Mental Health and Victim Service Providers , a resource manual produced with a grant from DOJ's Office for Victims of Crime, reports that, historically, mental health counselors, psychologists, and psychiatrists have not received extensive training in victimization issues.  At the Erie County Rape Crisis Center in Pennsylvania, for example, approximately 25 percent of clients who were victims of sexual assault/abuse or other crimes were also receiving services at one or more mental health programs.    A 1997 report by the California P&A describes a pattern of improper seclusion and restraint use from 1994 to 1996 at Napa State Hospital (NSH), one of four state hospitals operated by the California Department of Mental Health.  Incidents included:      the death of a deaf man with a physical disability who was improperly      restrained in a chair;    the unlawful restraint of two children with hearing impairments in           their beds; and    the seclusion of a child with a hearing impairment in a closet full of           soiled linens.      For more than a year and a half, one unit at the hospital repeatedly secluded patients.  When the abuse was finally reported by a staff member, the shift leader successfully encouraged other staff to engage in a cover-up, and to lie to management and Napa State Hospital's (NSH's) senior special investigator during the institution's initial internal investigation.  P&A investigators also determined that the facility's primary law enforcement officer responsible for investigating the alleged abuse failed to conduct a minimally adequate investigation into the seclusion practices on the unit.  The report concluded that both felonies and misdemeanors, including assault, battery, false imprisonment, criminal conspiracy, child endangerment, and corporal punishment of a child may have been committed by NSH employees.  But no criminal charges were filed.    Testimony also revealed that the quality of mental and medical services available to people labeled with psychiatric disabilities is questionable.  In fact, many consumers complained that the most commonly offered treatments, such as powerful medications with adverse side effects, actually deter and frighten people labeled with psychiatric disabilities away from seeking treatment.           The so-called side effects of many psychiatric drugs are far      more noticeable than the so-called main effects.  And these drugs      have the potential to cause serious physical illness and even death.      So, it's very logical that many people would refuse them.  (Judi Chamberlin)         I just want to mention a few of the real hazards of psychiatric      drugging. The neuroleptics like Thorazine, Haldol, Mellaril,      Navane--all those I was on--and now there's also Closapine and      Resperdal.  All of these drugs can sometimes kill.  Now, a lot of our      members choose to take these drugs of their own will, and that's      their choice.  But coercion and force are just plain wrong.  In the      long run, psychiatric drugs can cause persistent brain changes,      making it very, very difficult to withdraw.  With the neuroleptics,      it peaks at three months after quitting, you can feel crazier,      so-called, than you did before you started.  This is a brain      disability caused by the drug, keeping these people on for life.   (David Oaks)      Many of the prescription drugs used in treatment programs do have devastating side effects. Particularly in programs that treat people by force, there are few, if any, opportunities for informed consent, discussion of alternatives, or the right to refuse treatment.    Because of the number of adverse drug experiences received from health professionals and consumers, Zoloft, a frequently prescribed antidepressant, is listed as one of the top 10 ranked suspect drugs in the FDA's  1996 Adverse Drug Experience Report .  And Zoloft is only one of a multitude of drugs, all with their own sets of side effects, commonly prescribed to people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.    Much of the testimony concerned people's experiences in institutions with ""treatments"" that involve the administering of powerful psychiatric medications, electroconvulsive therapy, restraints, calming blankets, and isolation that were administered by their ""caregivers.""  The fact that so many people came forward to talk about these experiences is one more indication of the ways in which such information has been excluded from the development of public policy, because NCD, unlike many other forums, specifically encouraged testimony by people labeled with psychiatric disabilities themselves.    Mental health service provider Marcie Kelley has personally experienced the adverse effects of restraints.           As a survivor of sexual abuse, I personally have found the use      of restraints on me more traumatizing than being sexually abused.      Being put in restraints is a much longer, traumatic ordeal than being      raped.   (Marcie Kelley)      In 1997 the Journal of the American Geriatric Society reported that physical restraints used on humans cause severe stress, high rates of serious accidents--including death by asphyxiation--functional decline, psychological distress, increased agitation, circulation impairment, skin breakdown, increased incontinence, decreased mobility, and even irreversible brain damage in postmenopausal women with low estrogen levels.  Yet such methods continue to be used in programs for people with disabilities and are defended by many professionals as legitimate treatments.  Susan Stefan, J.D., a professor of law at the University of Florida, has conducted extensive research among people with psychiatric disabilities.           I have interviewed many, many people with psychiatric      disabilities, and sent a survey to thousands of people, literally,      and received hundreds of surveys back, and what the surveys are      saying and what the interviews are saying are that people are dying,      being injured, and sexually assaulted in institutions.  They're being      ignored and overmedicated.  They're dying and being damaged in      restraints.  When I tried to relate the individual stories that I was      getting to the research and data out in the field, what I discovered      is that there is no research, or that it is terribly, terribly      difficult to put together, or that it is virtually useless. The      voices of people with psychiatric disabilities are silenced.  Their      stories are dismissed as anecdotal, because of choices we      [researchers] make about what information must be gathered and what      information may be systematically ignored.   (Susan Stefan, J.D.)      Professor Stefan testified that restraints are a crutch for understaffed units and untrained staff, and referred to one study that attributed the near absence of violence on a psychiatric unit to never using restraint or seclusion.  She also stated that it is difficult to determine the cause of death and the number of people who die in psychiatric institutions and other psychiatric residential settings because coroners' reports--except for obvious suicides--typically list the cause of death as cardiac arrest, which is questionable since many of the people who die are relatively young and have no previous history of cardiac problems.    In 1994, a 47-year-old grandmother of four was placed face-down in five-point restraints at John George Psychiatric Pavilion in San Leandro, California.  Despite her claims that she could not breathe, she remained restrained face-down.  Staff left her unattended and locked the door of the seclusion room.  When staff returned ten minutes later, she was unresponsive and not breathing.  Efforts to resuscitate her failed.  The coroner determined that the cause of death was suffocation from being restrained face-down.  This was the eighth seclusion or restraint death that the P&A had investigated in three years.           Restraints seemed to be overutilized when psychiatric hospitals      are understaffed and do not have time to deal with crisis situations      in a civilized manner.  I urge the federal government to put stricter      regulations in place for the use of restraints, to investigate this      form of what I consider to be torture...and to hold hospitals      accountable for the murders they commit when using restraints.   (Marcie Kelley)      Kelley also commented on  Deadly Restraints , a series of articles published in  The Hartford Courant  from October 10-15, 1998, investigating the illegal use of restraints and other aversive therapies.           Recent reports by the Courant indicate that between 50 and 150      deaths occur every year across the country due to patients being      restrained.  This statistic is drastically underestimated, since many      deaths from restraints go unreported or are covered up by hospital      staff.   (Marcie Kelley)      Unfortunately, medical examiners rarely connect the circumstances of a death to restraints illegally used by hospital staff, which further complicates investigation and prosecution.  As a result of the  Courant 's series, Congress held hearings and legislation was introduced on the use of restraints.  The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) recently announced new patient protection standards as a condition for participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Psychiatric hospitals are covered by the new standards, which include the right to be free from restraints and seclusion in any form when used as a means of coercion, discipline, convenience, or retaliation. Nonetheless, if past history is any indication, restraints will continue to be used whenever staff members decide they are necessary, and patients will continue to have little recourse, since restraints are still considered a legitimate form of treatment.    The HCFA has regulations restricting restraint use in intermediate care facilities for people with developmental disabilities and in nursing homes, but in testimony before Congress, William J. Scanlon, the director of the General Accounting Office's (GAO) Health Financing and Public Health Issues within the Health, Education, and Human Services Division,  reported that despite such regulations, more than one in four nursing homes nationwide have serious and often repeated deficiencies that result in immediate jeopardy and harm to residents.           In brief, we found that neither complaint investigations nor      enforcement practices are being used effectively to ensure adequate      care for nursing home residents.  As a result, allegations or      incidents of serious problems, such as inadequate prevention of p      ressure sores, failure to prevent accidents, and failure to assess      residents' needs and provide appropriate care, often go      uninvestigated and uncorrected.  Our work in selected states reveals      that, for serious complaints alleging harm to residents, the com      bination of inadequate state practices and limited HCFA guidance and      oversight have resulted in  policies or practices that may limit the      number of complaints filed; serious complaints alleging harmful      situations not being investigated promptly; and incomplete reporting      on nursing homes' compliance history.   (Congressional testimony of William Scanlon, March 22, 1999, Nursing Homes:  Stronger Complaint and Enforcement Needed to Better Assure      Adequate Care, GAO/T-HEHS-99-89, March 22, 1999)      If such abuses can go on in facilities where regulation supposedly exists, it is clear that the lesser regulation of psychiatric facilities results in even more abuse and neglect than exists in nursing homes.Problems with overdrugging and restraints were not the only issues raised by the hearing.  Other attendees testified about the devastating effects of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).  Sharon Frieler, a person with a psychiatric disability and a member of a PAIMI advisory council, spoke of witnessing the toll ECT had taken on others.           You lose parts of your life, your memories. I, myself,      personally, am against ECT treatments because it is only a band-aid      for the person's problems. In many cases, it destroys parts of your      life; it does not enhance life.   (Sharon Frieler)      In March 1998, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released the  Electroconvulsive Therapy Background Paper  prepared by Research-Able, Inc., a Vienna, Virginia, contractor for the U.S. Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), a component of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).  This 17-page background paper commissioned by CMHS summarized current knowledge, consumer and public views, relevant laws, and research priorities regarding ETC.  The report indicated that 43 states regulate the use of ECT, but despite these state laws, ""physicians and facilities comply neither with the letter nor the spirit of the laws, nor with professional guidelines.""  As is typical, people with direct experience of ECT had little opportunity to develop or comment on the report; if they had been given the opportunity for meaningful input, the report would have been far different.  Few subjects within psychiatry arouse such controversy as ECT; the NCD hearing was one of the few opportunities shock recipients have had to testify publicly to a government body about their experiences.    Again and again, NCD heard testimony that graphically illustrated the overall loss of rights experienced by people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.  The Wisconsin Coalition for Advocacy, for example,  conducted in-depth interviews at a psychiatric hospital in Madison and uncovered:      coercion to obtain patients' consent;    failure to honor the requests of people who refused treatment;    failure to provide patients with sufficient information about the           procedure to allow them to make an informed decision; and    absence of consent for a procedure to treat people who were           mentally unable to give consent.      Forced drugging both inside and outside institutions was the source of some of the most painful memories for many speakers.  Steven Schwartz, J.D., the director of the Center for Public Representation in Massachusetts, urged careful scrutiny of the efficacy and advisability of the increased and widespread use of outpatient civil commitment and forced treatment.  He noted that involuntary treatment laws are in response to the handful of individuals with mental disabilities who have committed acts of violence.    Forced drugging does not occur only within the confines of institutions.  Many people testified that involuntary outpatient commitment (IOC) or assertive community treatment (ACT) programs make it possible for people labeled with psychiatric disabilities living in community settings to be required by courts to take medications or risk being institutionalized.  According to testimony, some 36 states and the District of Columbia have enacted outpatient commitment laws.  The overwhelming majority of those who testified are against such forced treatment.    Joseph Walsh, the coordinator for the Broom County, Recipient Affairs Office in  Binghampton, New York, testified that IOC is due to the hysterical reaction to a few very dramatic and highly publicized incidents.  Negative media reports incite public fear of and retribution for millions of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities who are law-abiding citizens.  Walsh stated that anyone in New York with a psychiatric diagnosis is faced with the prospect of compliance with a judge's order, at the behest of a psychiatrist, to take their medicine, or else.    Nor was he the only person to testify as to the negative effects of IOC:           Society is so invested in its search for magic bullet      pharmaceuticals that it ignores the innate ability of the individual      to effect their own recovery from psychological distress.   (Angela M. Cerio)      In contrast, written testimony provided by Mary T. Zdanowicz, Esq., the executive director of the Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC), expressed concern that laws enacted ""to prevent the use of assisted treatment unless individuals present an imminent danger to themselves or others"" have a deadly outcome that is evident in media headlines about ""violent episodes involving individuals with untreated psychiatric disabilities.""  In fact, TAC has compiled a database of 400 such incidents.  TAC promotes programs for assertive community treatment programs and a repeal of the Medicaid Institutions for Mental Illness exclusion, which prevents Medicaid reimbursement for people between the ages of 21 and 64 who are otherwise eligible for inpatient treatment if a facility has 16 or more beds.    TAC's written testimony endorsing the use of assertive community treatment programs also urged that federal funding priorities be rearranged to encourage states to use commitment standards based on severity of psychiatric disability rather than threat of dangerousness, and to  implement outpatient commitment laws.  Rael Jean Isaac, who co-authored  Toward Rational Commitment Laws  with D. J. Jaffe, a board member of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI), wrote, ""I strongly support involuntary intervention in the case of individuals too sick to know they are sick--which comprises a large portion of the seriously mentally ill.""    One mental health administrator described TAC as a well-funded organization that uses double-speak, such as referring to outpatient commitment as ""assisted treatment,"" to appeal to the public's ignorance about people with psychiatric labels.           [TAC] argues that people who reject mental health services are      too ""sick"" to have ""insight"" into our conditions, and thus must be      forced to accept treatment.  For many people [with psychiatric      disabilities], rejecting these services is a rational reaction to      their negative experiences in the mental health system.   (Darby Penney)      Steven Schwartz, J.D., of the Center for Public Representation framed his argument against forced treatment in these terms:           Massive deprivations of liberty to possibly prevent a small      number of incidents should not be countenanced under our system.      Legislatures in states that have rejected abandoning civil liberties      in the name of treatment, the softening of civil commitment s      tandards, and the imposition of more forced treatment are under      pressure to enact laws that make forced treatment easier.  There is      substantial literature from which to argue forced treatment does not      work.   (Steven Schwartz, J.D.)      The overwhelming amount of testimony concerned the harmfulness of involuntary interventions on people's sense of dignity and self-worth, and, further, contended that such interventions were seldom helpful in assisting people either with their immediate problems or with their long-range ability to improve their lives.  NCD heard numerous eloquent pleas for services that were responsive and respectful, and which allowed recipients the same rights and freedoms other citizens take for granted.  It is important to keep in mind that the hearing was one of the rare opportunities for people labeled with psychiatric disabilities themselves to be the major voice in a government-sponsored inquiry into mental health issues.  It is common for mental health policy discussions never to mention words such as ""involuntariness"" or ""force,"" because these topics are seldom addressed except by people who have suffered because of them.  In fact, there seems to be a tacit acceptance among policymakers and the media that people labeled with psychiatric disabilities ""need"" to be forced ""for their own good,"" and the question of whether such force belongs in a system of medical treatment rarely is systematically examined.           I'm executive director of the National Empowerment Center, a      board-certified psychiatrist, and a  person with a history of a      psychiatric disability.  I want to point out, first of all, the      importance of people having choice and having a say in voluntary se      rvices.  As a person who recovered from schizophrenia, I find that      the most important elements are having a trusting relationship with      somebody who cares about you and can understand you and get to know      you, and make it worthwhile for you to return to the community and to      some productive role.  It's also important that people have      resources, have education, jobs, and that these not be under coercive      conditions.   (Daniel Fisher)      The independent living movement's demand for self-determination in crafting policy and making decisions on all levels was also frequently echoed.           It's just really important to be recognized as another group      that is demanding the same thing that people with physical      disabilities are asking for, that racial minorities and ethnic      minorities and sexual minorities are asking for, and it's the right      to speak for ourselves, to represent our own interests, and to be      regarded as credible experts on what it is that we need.   (Judi Chamberlin)         The first point is that we speak for ourselves.   (David Oaks)      The overwhelming majority of those testifying were against forced treatment.  They  echoed feelings of abandonment, helplessness, and vulnerability, and called for a total ban of all involuntary treatment and outpatient commitment laws. They also related many stories showing that involuntary treatments are often used when people are not dangerous to themselves or others but only bothersome to relatives or neighbors.    But the popularity of outpatient commitment and other laws that force treatments on people labeled with psychiatric disabilities both inside and outside institutions shows a growing hostility toward these very real sentiments.  It is essential that Congress and policymakers hear from those who are victimized and view the need for such laws with deep skepticism.  Quite often, forced treatments are the easy way out.  They debilitate people who want to enjoy life and who can be productive if the time is taken to work with them to design proper treatment courses, which usually include assistance with housing, income supports, and other real-life needs.  Forced treatments should have to meet a heavy burden of proof that they are indeed the absolute last resort.  They represent  the worst violations of  the right to self-determination.    Self-determination is vital for more than just symbolic reasons.  Detached, ivory tower policymaking based on input from experts, and that excludes participation from people labeled with psychiatric disabilities themselves, results in wasteful and ineffective one-size-fits-all public policy that doesn't efficiently meet the needs of those it is intended to serve.    NCD has developed and endorsed a wide array of public policy resolutions and recommendations.  Most of them relate to the 10 core recommendations.  Much of the body of the larger report lead to the development of those 10 critical recommendations.      Public Policy Recommendations    Government civil rights enforcement agencies and publicly funded advocacy organizations should work more closely together and with adequate funding to implement effectively critical existing laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, Fair Housing Act, Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act, and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, giving people labeled with psychiatric disabilities a central role in setting the priorities for enforcement and implementation of these laws.    Congress should increase DOJ funding to investigate and monitor institutions under the provisions of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act of 1980 (CRIPA).  When a pattern of abuse and patient rights violations occur, DOJ should promptly investigate and, if warranted, prosecute.  Negotiated agreements to improve conditions are worthless if the provisions of such agreements are not monitored to ensure compliance.    Congress should expand the scope of jurisdiction of protection and advocacy organizations and increase and maintain sufficient funding for P&As.  P&As have a congressional mandate to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect; however, P&As often have difficulty accessing facilities or records, despite their mandate.  Congress should also mandate that people labeled with psychiatric disabilities sit in representative numbers on the governing boards of P&A agencies, not just on advisory councils.  The number of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities should be proportionate to the amount of funding for the PAIMI program within the overall P&A budget.    Incidents of deaths, abuse, and other crimes occurring in institutions should be quickly investigated by local police and expert criminal investigators who are independent of institutions.  In-house investigations conducted by inexperienced personnel can compromise future criminal and civil litigation.    With the elimination of state funding for prison legal service agencies, it is essential that protection and advocacy services are available to people labeled with psychiatric disabilities in correctional facilities.  Congress should increase funding for protection and advocacy organizations to accommodate the increased workload.  Current funding levels do not adequately cover enforcement of laws that protect the rights of people with disabilities.    In March 1999, when he introduced H.R. 1313, the Patient Freedom From Restraint Act, Representative Pete Stark (D-CA) said:           Documentation of these cases is an essential mechanism for      protecting the rights and liberties of the patients.      People testifying who were subjected to aversive treatments, as well as advocates, attorneys, and others, were so compelling and united on this issue that they command credibility. Congress should ban restraints and other ""therapies"" such as wet/cold therapy and calming blankets that restrict people's freedom of movement, by linking their use to withholding Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement to providers using such methods unless their efficacy can be proven through independent research in which people labeled with psychiatric disabilities play a major role. The culture surrounding the use of restraints, isolation, and other aversive therapies must change. Staff should view these methods as treatment failures. Evidence demonstrates that use of restraints and seclusion can be drastically reduced and replaced by effective alternatives when there is a management commitment to do so. Simply restricting the use of restraints may not be sufficient, as systems may simply move to different forms of restraint (such as chemical restraints) or continue their use ""informally.""    Even proponents of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT or shock treatment) admit that it is a highly controversial procedure. Many of those who have been subjected to it consider it to have been extremely physically and emotionally damaging, and many believe that it has had long-lasting adverse effects, particularly on memory. The stories of those who testified as to the harmfulness of ECT in their own lives were heart-rending, especially since many witnesses were given the procedure without full informed consent, including information about the risks of long-term memory loss.    Nonetheless, neither congressional hearings nor other government proceedings have ever heard from shock survivors and other opponents of shock in representative numbers.  More often, the proponents of shock have either authored the reports or had major involvement in writing them, often without disclosing conflicts of interest (such as financial involvement with the manufacturers of shock machines), while opponents of shock treatment have been excluded from the process.    The principles of self-determination dictate that recipients of mental health services should play a major role in the deliberations concerning every issue that impacts their lives.           Chapter 2    Creating New Lives:  Independent Housing, Economic Supports, Meaningful Work    The success of the independent living movement in America is due to the authentic resonance of a philosophy of self-determination, in which people with disabilities find strength, support, inspiration, and expertise among their peers.  People labeled with psychiatric disabilities place an equally high value on self-determination and interaction with their peers; however, they rarely achieve either.           We want to be able to decide for ourselves where we live, how we      spend our time, and if we decide that we need some kind of help or      assistance in our lives, it should be up to us to say...what kind of      assistance we need.  And very often...what people desire is not      psychiatric assistance but peer support--help from other people who      have gone through the same kinds of experience that they have, and      who have a gut-level knowledge of what it's like.   (Judi Chamberlin)      A one-day census of inpatient clients conducted by SAMHSA in 1994 reports 236,110 people labeled with psychiatric disabilities were receiving 24-hour hospital and residential treatment--a marked decrease from the 471,452 people who received services at similar facilities in 1969, when deinstitutionalization of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities first began.  Unfortunately, during the following decades, as more and more people labeled with psychiatric disabilities left institutions or remained in their communities, federal, state, and local governments failed and continue to fail to provide the needed community-based services, and virtually all of the community services that were provided continued the paternalistic practices of the large institutions they replaced.    Mental Health, United States, 1998 , published by the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), estimates between 10 and 13 million people in the entire U.S. adult population had a serious mental illness in 1990--the last year such data were collected.  (These numbers do not reflect people who were homeless or institutionalized.)  Despite such large numbers of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities, the GAO reports that in fiscal year 1996, SAMHSA block grants to state and local governments totaled only $275 million for mental health services (the vast majority of mental health services funding comes from state and country governments).  State and federal funding shortfalls have created gaps and shortages in treatment, housing, and vocational and other services.  Further, only a tiny fraction of these funds has gone toward consumer-controlled, peer-run services.    Because of the very real stigma of a psychiatric label and the discrimination encountered by people labeled with psychiatric disabilities, many people with psychiatric diagnoses prefer to hide their status wherever possible.  Simply by virtue of their diagnosis or label, people labeled with psychiatric disabilities are perceived as second-class citizens, murderers, people to be feared, people too incompetent to make their own decisions, malingerers, and many other stereotypes.           The single greatest need in search of redress is the prejudice      and discrimination suffered by people living with mental illnesses.      We are discovering that prejudice and discrimination exist      everywhere.  They exist in the general society, in our system of      medical care, justice, and prison systems; even in our electoral      system.   (Joseph Glazer)         One of the things I've heard the most from consumers is, ""We      don't want to be schizophrenic or borderline or whatever.  That is a      diagnosis.  That's not me.  I am a human being.  I don't want to be      identified as a borderline.""   (Dennis Morrisey)         In reality, people with mental disabilities are no more violent      than the average citizen.  The MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment      Study, released in 1998, found that, in the absence of alcohol or      substance abuse, people with mental disabilities are ""no more likely      to be violent than were other people living in their neighborhoods.""      Said John Monahan, one of the study's authors:  ""The best      epidemiological evidence indicates that major mental disorder      accounts for, at most, 3 percent of the violence in American society.""   (Treatment by Force Is an Attack on Rights Perspective by Sally Zinman, executive director of the California Network of Mental Health Clients,  San Jose Mercury News , June 20, 1999.)      Debbie Whittle is an example of someone who sought treatment from private sources and never received a label.           I experienced early trauma, to which I had a set of coping      strategies, including disassociation, fantasizing, self-blame,      self-hatred.  I was afraid of confrontation and rage.  I had      difficulty expressing anger, yet I cried very easily.  I had very low      self-esteem, although I looked pretty good and fairly competent on      the outside....I never knew what that diagnosis was, if there was      one.  That is so important.  I can't stress that enough.  I was never      told that my coping strategies were bad or wrong.  I was never given      the feeling that my attempts to seek help were because there was      something wrong with  me .      Whittle reiterates the important distinction of living without a psychiatric label and obtaining help from outside the public health system.           What does this story have to do with a hearing on psychiatric      disabilities?  Everything.  Although I consider myself a trauma      survivor, I do not consider myself a psychiatric survivor.  Why?      Because no one ever labeled me that way.  I can't help but wonder how      different my story would be if I had presented myself to a mental      health center.  My history is not that different from the majority of      folks with psychiatric labels.  I can't help but wonder how different      most of their stories would be if they had never received a      psychiatric label, but were given a chance to heal their losses and      traumas without the shame of pathology.   (Debbie Whittle)      The lack of self-determination for people labeled with psychiatric disabilities is most apparent in the area of treatment, because unlike a person with cancer, an individual with a psychiatric disability is rarely offered treatment choices.  Instead, treatment decisions are made by psychiatrists, social workers, family members, or others without their knowledge or their consent, and they can be deprived of their civil rights at a moment's notice should they not accept the offered treatment ""voluntarily.""           As long as we have involuntary commitment laws and forced      treatment laws, we are not free citizens.  It's really a form of      legalized discrimination, and I see that these laws are ultimately      incompatible with the Americans with Disabilities Act.   (Judi Chamberlin)      Many people testified that forced involuntary treatments, in addition to depriving individuals of their rights, also caused physical and mental injuries, and even death.  Although one advocate and survivor, Darby Penney, last received involuntary drug treatment in an institution more than 20 years ago, she says it still has an impact on her life.  Today, she is very conscious of not doing anything that others would consider ""crazy enough to lock me up.""  She says the psychiatric drugs she received left her with physical disabilities.    According to testimony, people labeled with psychiatric disabilities may be held financially liable for their forced treatment, when insurance refuses to cover it or when they lack insurance.    Penney testified that it is illogical for a system with limited and dwindling resources to force people into treatment.  She stated that forcing services on people who do not want them takes scarce resources away from people who do, and reported on an evaluation conducted at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, which indicated that there is no difference in outcomes between people who were subjected to outpatient commitment and control groups.           If the programs are good, people will come.  It's possible for      states to make people offers that they won't refuse on a voluntary      basis.  In Massachusetts, we have no outpatient commitment.  We have      no involuntary care in our community and are able to provide the      care, particularly when the states are willing to invest in the      support services, on that voluntary basis, in a way that consumers      and psychiatric survivors are willing to participate.   (Steven Schwartz, J.D.)      Because people labeled with psychiatric disabilities encounter shortages of voluntary treatment options, a lack of affordable housing, and insufficient or inappropriate community-based services, many remain in hospitals or jails, or are homeless.  John Rio, a housing advocate from the Corporation for Supportive Housing (CSH) in Manhattan, New York, testified:           One of the things, from my experiences in the field of mental      health, is that a lot of people are in hospitals and in jails and      held there unnecessarily, or released into the community without      adequate community-based services.  At CSH, we think that integrated      services can be provided through supportive housing; and one strategy      is to try to...pose a solution to this kind of a problem.      Unfortunately, we don't have enough, and we need more help with      changing policies that support the growth of supportive housing and      integrated community services.   (John Rio)      People in institutions are particularly vulnerable.  They are isolated from peer support networks and also from legal advocates.           They isolate you and they become your only reference point.   (Diana Rickard)      Once people are institutionalized, they may remain in there long after treatment has ended and they are ready for discharge.  For example, testimony revealed that in New Jersey, of the approximately 2,000 people institutionalized in five state-run psychiatric hospitals, about 45 to 50 percent of them have been determined to no longer meet any standard of dangerousness, but they continue to be confined because not enough community services are available.    In June 1999, the Supreme Court issued an important decision in  Olmstead v. L.C. , which tested the strength of Title II of ADA. The case concerned two women with psychiatric disabilities who asked to receive services in their communities instead of institutions.  The Court ruled that when a professional determines that a person with a disability can live in the community effectively, he or she  must  be offered this choice.  To do otherwise is discrimination. There are several caveats in the Court's decision, however.  Individuals cannot self-determine where they receive services, and they can receive community-based services only if such alternatives exist.  Currently, adequate community-based alternatives simply do not exist in sufficient numbers to allow all people who might qualify under the Olmstead rationale to leave institutions.  This problem may be exacerbated in the future since some states have submitted lawsuits challenging Congress's legal authority to mandate that states comply with Title II of ADA.    A lack of affordable housing is another barrier to the community integration of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.  A federal law some people cited as exacerbating the shortage of housing for people labeled with psychiatric disabilities was the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992.  Among other things, this law allows public housing authorities to designate for use exclusively by elderly people units that were previously available to both elderly people and to younger people with disabilities.  Thus, younger persons with disabilities are no longer eligible to move into these federally funded buildings.  Roy Neville, a housing advocate, testified:           Mentally ill people got cut out of apartments and public housing      projects that the elderly want for their own.  That's discrimination.   (Roy Neville)      Neville testified that HUD has attempted to compensate for these cuts by increasing the number of rent supplement programs that provide vouchers and certificates for people with disabilities to obtain housing, but notes:           The public housing agencies don't apply for [these programs],      because the application process is too complex.   (Roy Neville)      Impact of Designated Public Housing on Persons With Disabilities , a 1998 GAO report, however, concluded that the 1992 law has ""had little impact"" on the availability of public housing for people with disabilities.  But it also noted:           It is too soon to determine the extent to which the Section 8      rental certificates and vouchers set aside for persons with      disabilities have helped meet this population's needs.       (Impact of Designated Public Housing on Persons With Disabilities,      GAO/RCED-98-160, June 1998)      At the time of the GAO review, an Anaheim, California, housing authority had not yet issued any of the 150 vouchers it had received from a mainstream housing program.  The housing authority indicated that it expected that all 150 vouchers eventually would be used, however, and it planned to apply for more vouchers since it had 1,500 persons with disabilities on its waiting list.  Apparently, this problem extends beyond Anaheim, as Neville testified:           Last summer, over 7,000 Section 8 new certificates and vouchers      for people with disabilities were available to communities in New      York State, but public housing authorities [failed] to apply for      them.  We need incentives to make these units available.   (Roy Neville)      Ruth Lowenkran, a legal advocate for the Disability Law Center in Albany, noted that other forces are at work to weaken the protections of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHAA):           There are constant pushes in Congress to eviscerate the      protections of the Fair Housing Act, and to narrow the scope of      persons protected, and narrow it [to] eliminate the protections for      persons with psychiatric disabilities.   (Ruth Lowenkran)      An example is H.R. 3206, the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1998, which, if enacted, would have repealed civil rights protections for people with disabilities and subjected them to renewed discrimination by zoning officials and hostile neighbors.  The bill also would have permitted local governments to completely zone out group homes and other community living arrangements.  Disability advocates succeeded in fending off this threat.  However, there was much testimony indicating that this is a constant battle.    The executive director of the New York State Alliance for the Mentally Ill, Glen Liebman, testified that his organization surveyed its membership on housing.  It found that the majority of adult children living with their parents wanted to leave home, but there were no housing options available for them.           We have 143,000 people in New York state with a serious mental      illness who use some kind of mental health services.  Out of that      number, there are 20,000 in some kind of state-supported housing,      there are about 6,500 people in state psychiatric hospital beds, and      another 11,000 in adult homes.  Even if you acknowledge that there      are 10,000 people with mental illness in the shelter system, this      still means that less than a third of mental health recipients are in      housing outside the family.   (Glen Liebman)      One result of the lack of affordable housing is the prevalence of homelessness among people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.           Where's everyone else?  The bottom line is, either they're      living still at home with their family, they're in prison, they're      homeless, or they're in a shelter.   (Glen Liebman)      The National Resource Center on Homelessness and Mental Illness reports an estimated 600,000 people are homeless in the United States on any given night.  Approximately 200,000 of these individuals have serious mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression, and at least 50 percent of homeless people with serious mental illnesses also abuse alcohol, drugs, or both.  Lucy Kim, who is now the administrative coordinator for the Center for Urban Community Services, received Social Security benefits for seven years and testified about her periods of homelessness during that time.           Two of...the seven years, this last span that I was disabled,      were spent living in a welfare hotel.  And, during that time, I      experienced depression, apathy, fear, substance abuse.   (Lucy Kim)      Several factors are cited as the primary contributors to homelessness in people labeled with psychiatric disabilities, but blatant discrimination is the most prevalent.  Testimony consistently revealed that people labeled with psychiatric disabilities are treated separately and unequally.           In Schenectady, a tenant was being forced out because he made      noise in his apartment, and his behavior bothered another tenant.   (Roy Neville)         People with mental disabilities are being scapegoated as      violent, dangerous [people who] shouldn't be allowed to live in      integrated settings with other people.  Again, [that is] in spite of      the fact that statistically, we're no more likely to commit crimes      than anyone else.   (Judi Chamberlin)      Also, many people labeled with psychiatric disabilities are institutionalized simply because crisis centers, homeless programs, and emergency shelters are inaccessible or ill-equipped to deal with them.  Further, they find it difficult to access permanent housing because of pervasive discrimination.  Even with the current FHAA protections in place, landlords and local officials either are unfamiliar with the antidiscrimination provisions of the law as they apply to people labeled with psychiatric disabilities, or they simply ignore them.           Currently the provisions of the federal Fair Housing Amendments      Act of 1988 provide good protection against housing discrimination      for people with disabilities.  Unfortunately, many local      jurisdictions and local governments are unaware of this law or are t      rying to overturn it.   (Stacie Hiramoto)      Testimony also revealed that mandatory participation in programs and services, such as substance abuse programs or more often ""medication compliance,"" is frequently required by people labeled with psychiatric disabilities as a condition to obtain housing or other services.           There should be an unbundling of treatment from housing.  Many      people choose homelessness rather than submit to psychiatric      treatment in enforced spaces.   (Daniel Fisher)      The confusing array of government programs is difficult for people labeled with psychiatric disabilities to navigate.  In 1996, the GAO reported that all people with disabilities received services through 130 different programs, 19 federal agencies, and a multitude of public and private agencies at the state and local levels, all with varying eligibility criteria.    People labeled with psychiatric disabilities can receive benefits from a variety of federal, state, and private programs such as Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security Disability Income (SSDI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), various veterans benefit programs, food stamps, workers' compensation, unemployment insurance, private disability insurance, and others.    In many existing federally funded income support programs, eligibility requirements differ.  An individual may be eligible for services from one program and ineligible for another, simply because a different definition of disability is applied or because the individual carries a dual diagnosis.  As a result, individuals are required to endure a series of application processes.           One of the most contentious aspects of disability research is      also the most basic--the definition of disability.  Different federal      programs use different operational definitions of disability, as do      researchers, advocacy groups, and other interested parties.         (People with Disabilities:  Federal Programs Could Work Together      More Efficiently to Promote Employment, GAO/HEHS-96-126)      Testimony also revealed that eligibility criteria are frequently confusing and more stringent for people labeled with psychiatric disabilities than for people with other disabilities.  As of December 1997, some 1.1 million people received SSDI benefits, and another 1.2 million received SSI benefits for mental disorders.  However, testimony revealed that when people labeled with psychiatric disabilities apply for SSDI or SSI benefits, they face frequent denials, long waits, or stressful appeals.  They also encounter a higher rate of denial for initial benefits.  In 1997, GAO reported that 39 percent of people with mental illness were initially denied Social Security benefits--a much higher percentage than for other people with disabilities.    Jessica Wolfe testified that her initial claim for Social Security benefits was denied, and she has waited two years for an appeal hearing.  Meanwhile, she has no money for therapy, has depleted the family's savings, and she buys food with credit cards.           I understand that there will be a psychological evaluator at the      hearing to give testimony about whether my symptoms are severe enough      to prevent me from working [at] any job.  You know something?      According to them it doesn't matter that I cannot make a living....My      best hope is getting SSDI, and I am scared I will not get it.  (Jessica Wolfe)         As my consumers and my people get to the point where their      mental illness prevents them from working, the first hurdle they face      is that the applications that they have to fill out for disability      and SSI have nothing to do with mental illness.  (Dennis Morrisey)      According to GAO, differences in assessments of functional capacity, different procedures, and weaknesses in quality reviews contributed to the Social Security Administration's (SSA) inconsistent decisions.  In 1994, SSA began implementation of a disability redesign process that, among other things, will eventually streamline the claims and appeals process.  It is expected to be fully implemented in FY 2001.    Roy Neville expressed concern that many people who have psychiatric disabilities but  do not have a long-standing diagnosis of severe mental illness are ineligible for SSI or have been dropped from SSI rolls, and are left without financial or other supports.           These people drop out of the safety net...and [are] made to get      into the welfare-to-work requirements.  They're being cut out of food      stamps and child care, job training, and emergency food.  And some of      them are mothers with children.  The number of poor people who visit      food pantries in New York is rising rapidly.  And there needs to be a      safety net for these people who have mental disabilities in the      welfare-to-work program.   (Roy Neville)      Employer-sponsored short- and long-term disability insurance plans frequently discriminate against people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.  NCD heard testimony from a  former employee of a Fortune 500 company who received almost six months of short-term disability payments from her employer of three years.  But before she was eligible for long-term disability benefits, she was notified that her benefits would end.  A few days later, her employment was terminated.  She currently receives SSDI, but believes that she would not have been denied long-term disability benefits if her disability were not psychiatric.  She has filed a lawsuit based on discriminatory treatment.  This case is not an isolated example but is typical of long-term disability insurance practice of unequal benefits for psychiatric versus physical disabilities.    People labeled with psychiatric disabilities who attempt to return to work face numerous hurdles.  State-federal vocational rehabilitation (VR) programs, which are directed by the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) and which deliver services through state and privately operated agencies that provide education or training, have not been notably successful in assisting people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.           GAO did find that states purchased more services for clients      with physical than with mental disabilities, more for clients with      severe than with non-severe disabilities, and more for white clients      than for black, Hispanic, or American Indian clients.       (Vocational Rehabilitation:  Evidence for Federal Program's      Effectiveness Is Mixed, GAO, August 1993)      It appears little has changed in the ensuing years.  Bernice Loschen testified to NCD that:           People labeled with psychiatric disabilities need to be given      equal treatment services as everyone else, so they'll have a fair      chance to get the advocacy help that they need to get a job, [the      same] as any other client of [VR], as persons who use wheelchairs,      who are blind, and who are deaf--and this isn't happening now.  These      persons deserve [the same] dignity and respect as anyone else does.       (Bernice Loschen)      John Rio, of the Corporation for Supportive Housing in New York City, testified that new strategies are needed to place people labeled with psychiatric disabilities in worthwhile careers.           Individuals with psychiatric disabilities have a right to      employment opportunities and the services necessary to participate in      America's workforce.  While many areas of the country enjoy a      healthier economy, our clients are not participating to the fullest      extent possible.  We think we need to see more involvement from the      private sector, particularly in employer-based training strategies.      These strategies are important because we need to help clients not      just get an entry-level job but to start on a path of employment that      will lead to livable wage careers.   (John Rio)      Rio testified that seven years ago the National Advisory Mental Health Council, in coordination with the federal Interdepartmental Task Force on Homelessness and Severe Mental Illness, held hearings in Chicago and published its findings and recommendations.  He notes that although some improvements occurred in the service delivery systems, most cases continue to ""fall short of the mark.""  In fact, he stated, a number of recommendations resulting from those hearings still need to be addressed, including:      greater coordination between federal, state, and local programs           serving people labeled with psychiatric disabilities;    expanding anti-stigma activities to dispel harmful misconceptions,           especially among employers; and    creating a wide variety of permanent housing options with           supportive services that include employment opportunities.      Rio noted that the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 offered a provision for states to buy into Medicaid by adding a category for people with disabilities who are working.  He says, however, only Oregon has successfully made this option available, ""but not without great difficulty from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA).""    He testified that he is encouraged, however, that nearly half of SSA's 12 demonstration projects to test effective strategies for coordinating state workforce systems to help people with disabilities return to work and decrease their reliance on public supports have elected to focus their projects on people labeled with psychiatric disabilities, and stated further that other states should consider waiver-based work incentives that are not funded in the SSA demonstration projects.  He did perceive a shortcoming, however.           As you know, the key to these projects is likely to rest in      waiver-based work incentives.  And guess what?  These waivers will      need to be [approved by] HCFA.  We expect this will be an      extraordinary challenge for states...the states need a partner in      HCFA that shares the goal of helping people with disabilities work or      work more.  This is a matter of public policy.   (John Rio)      Many people reported that vocational outcomes are more successful in community programs that offer a number of services, such as housing, training, and health care.  An example is Next Step: Jobs, an employment initiative funded by the Rockefeller Foundation in 1995, in which 21 nonprofit supportive housing agencies partnered with the Corporation for Supportive Housing in New York to increase the rates of employment among people in supportive housing who faced multiple barriers to employment.  The project demonstrated that supportive housing offered a basic, critical ingredient for positive vocational outcomes--that is, continuous case management, permanent housing, and a culture supportive of working tenants.  However, it is important to note that such a model is unacceptable to many people labeled with psychiatric disabilities who want to work but will not attend programs that require them to accept other services they do not want.    In addition, the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) has funded several studies that evaluate model employment programs, such as  Outcomes and Career Achievements of Persons with Professional Qualifications Who Have Severe Psychiatric Disabilities:  The Minnesota Mainstream Experience.   In sharp contrast to the widely held belief that people labeled with psychiatric disabilities cannot work, or can work only at menial jobs, there are a number of program models showing that people labeled with psychiatric disabilities can obtain and retain employment if they have the supports they want.  It is essential that such supports are not ""one size fits all,"" but are individually chosen according to what the individual in question finds helpful.    Peer support is an important component of successful community reintegration; however, it is often unavailable.  Several people testified that a lack of peer support for people labeled with psychiatric disabilities contributes to their isolation from other people labeled with psychiatric disabilities as well as other segments of the disability community.           We need to find a way to have HCFA...fund the extraordinarily      important consumer-run services which play a vital role in helping      people to emerge from the mental health system and not remain a      mental patient for life.  (Daniel Fisher)        Public Policy Recommendations    It is crucial to ensure that people labeled with psychiatric disabilities have control over programs and services that directly affect them.    People labeled with psychiatric disabilities should be fairly represented on boards of all agencies and programs that provide services to this population and that receive federal funds.  In addition, programs that serve all disabilities need to ensure that consumer representation on their boards includes those with psychiatric disabilities.    Congress should establish an oversight group composed of people with disabilities--including significant numbers of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities--to advise SSA and Congress on the effectiveness of SSA policies and procedures, as well as the future of its various programs, including SSDI, SSI, Medicare, and Medicaid.    User-managed peer support programs controlled by people labeled with psychiatric disabilities should be supported with increased federal funding.  Public policy should encourage self-help approaches as the best way to promote self-determination.    Medicare and Medicaid waivers should be expanded to support peer-run programs.  HCFA rules should be revised to provide broad latitude and financial incentives for such services, in line with self-determination approaches for those with physical and cognitive disabilities.    Congress should fund additional community-based programs to eliminate ""warehousing"" of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities in institutions.  The fact that large numbers of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities who want to live in the community are unable to do so because there is insufficient funding for community programs should be considered a policy failure.  The institutional bias in funding must be addressed in ways that encourage community living and self-determination.    People labeled with psychiatric disabilities should be offered a menu of available services and programs to choose from, including mental health services, peer support, housing, vocational training, and employment.  People labeled with psychiatric disabilities should be free to reject any or all services, and should be able to access those that they want without being required to participate in others.    HUD 811 regulations already contain a prohibition against mandatory services for projects supported by these funds.  This should be expanded to cover all federally funded housing programs, including local and private housing programs for people with disabilities that receive federal funds. The responsibilities of tenants with disabilities should be no greater than those of all other public housing tenants--paying rent, maintaining a clean home, and so on.    HUD should increase affordable housing for people labeled with psychiatric disabilities and  combine all of its housing programs for people with disabilities--regardless of disability or chronic health condition.    Using a cross-disability approach to disability would offer efficient and equitable delivery of services.  Finally, segregating people by their disabilities into specific housing and other federal programs is discriminatory, creates barriers to services, and divides the disability community, as well as creating ""disability ghettoes.""    Testimony consistently revealed that homelessness and the lack of affordable housing for people labeled with psychiatric disabilities are major concerns, an indication that existing HUD funding levels do not meet the demand.    Congress, therefore, should increase HUD funding for integrated, community-based housing for people with disabilities to include financial incentives for entities providing supportive services.    While Homeless Assistance Programs (HAP) and Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPA), saw significant increases in funding, HUD's FY 2000 budget provides only $194 million for Section 811 housing for people with disabilities--no increase from HUD's FY 1999 or 1998 budgets.    HUD should exert tighter oversight over the distribution of Section 8 vouchers and certificates to eliminate the backlog of people waiting for housing.    HUD should assign Section 8 voucher certificates to all people who leave institutions, residential facilities, and nursing homes, as well as people eligible for Medicaid home and community-based waivers.    This would eliminate some of the warehousing that was discussed in testimony and offer a safety net for people who are in transition from institutions to communities.    HUD should establish a guaranteed loan program targeted at all people with disabilities so that they can own their own homes.    Funding for such a program could be obtained by eliminating or reducing HUD's 232 program, which provides low-interest loans to owners of nursing homes and assisted-living facilities.    HUD should ensure that priority is given to qualified consumer-run disability organizations, such as independent living centers, to administer the agency's housing programs for people with disabilities.    On March 8, 1999, HUD announced the availability of $48.5 million for new tenant-based rental subsidies for people with disabilities--including people with severe mental illnesses--through the Mainstream Housing Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities Program.  For the first time, this funding was made available to nonprofit disability organizations, as well as to public housing agencies (PHAs) deemed qualified to administer the program.  Qualified agencies operated and controlled by people with disabilities should administer housing programs for people with disabilities.  Nonprofit organizations that are not controlled by people with disabilities should not be eligible.    Congress and the administration should continue to block further attempts to designate elderly-only housing and all attempts to remove or reduce the anti-discrimination protections of the FHAA.    Congress should authorize an independent evaluation of all HUD programs and services for people with disabilities, to ensure compliance with existing laws, as well as efficiency and accessibility of HUD operations and federally funded HUD programs and services.    The evaluation should include recommendations for improvements and equitable methods of service delivery.    One of the few legal recourses left to victims of disability-based discrimination in housing is the FHAA.  Excluding people labeled with psychiatric disabilities from housing is tantamount to endorsing discrimination based on stereotypes that would not be tolerated against any other segment of the population.    Therefore, HUD should launch a comprehensive and sophisticated nationwide audit to test and evaluate disability-based housing discrimination in urban, suburban, and rural communities around the nation, similar to the audit announced by HUD in November 1998 to combat discrimination against other minorities.    HUD should initiate an awareness and training program that educates people with disabilities, as well as local housing officials, landlords, and others receiving federal funds, about the protections afforded people with psychiatric and other disabilities under the provisions of the FHAA.  Recipients of HUD funds, including local housing authorities, should be required to attend mandatory training and demonstrate a minimum level of FHAA-disability-related competency and awareness before HUD funds are released to them.    Also, local independent living centers or similar client-run groups should be contracted to conduct voluntary awareness training for realtors, leasing agents, and others who do not receive federal funds but who would benefit from such training.    DOJ and HUD should enforce vigorously the provisions of both the Rehabilitation Act and FHAA, and aggressively pursue legal action in instances where people with disabilities are denied access to federally funded programs and services or encounter housing discrimination.  These actions would send a message that the laws are strong and that discrimination will not be tolerated.    Increase a wide array of employment opportunities geared to utilize the interests, skills, talents, and expressed wishes of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.    The successful components of employment demonstration programs should be implemented while the identified weaknesses should be addressed.  Information about successful programs should be disseminated and shared among agencies, task forces, committees, and others concerned with employment of people with psychiatric disabilities, and directly with people with disabilities themselves.    HCFA should revise existing regulations to make it easier for states to apply for Medicaid waivers under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 for people with disabilities who return to work.    The employment experiences of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities and their interactions with training providers and the state-federal vocational rehabilitation systems should be included in the development of any employment training programs.    SSA should implement a disability determination policy that is consistent and fair.  Disability determination specialists should receive ongoing training on the new policies and how they may apply to people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.    Congress should mandate that SSA and other federal agencies, as well as state, local, and private agencies receiving federal funds, review applications and other documents to ensure that the information contained in them is applicable, accessible, and does not violate the rights of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.    Congress should allocate additional funding to accelerate implementation of SSA's disability redesign policy and eliminate the existing backlog in SSA appeals.    Congress should enact legislation that ensures that welfare-to-work programs do not deny people with less severe psychiatric disabilities access to income and other supports and should implement a policy that provides short-term income supports.    Congress should enact mental parity laws for short- and long-term public and private disability insurance plans.           Chapter 3    Patients' Rights:  Parity, Alternatives, Inclusion    Because the mental health system has historically been designed and implemented without the participation of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities, there are numerous examples of the ways in which the system does not meet people's self-defined needs.           People labeled with psychiatric disabilities should be at major      policy decision- making meetings.  We are excluded systematically, we      don't have the rich lobbyists, we don't have the pipeline into      Washington.  The policy wonks are the ones that are making all these      decisions about us and for us, and we need to find a way to get our      people represented in a genuine, participatory fashion, in housing      decisions, Social Security decisions, and HCFA health care      decisions.   (Daniel Fisher)      NCD heard a great deal of testimony concerning people's frustrations with a system that consistently forces them to accept services they do not want while denying them access to or coverage for those things they find helpful.           In order to recover, one needs to find peer support, and in      order to do so, one needs to have alternative healing techniques, one      has to have access to those kinds of people and treatments that one      can control oneself, and not perpetually have to be dependent on      medication and doctors, and a psychiatric system that does not      necessarily have our best interests at heart.       (Daniel Fisher)      Parity in insurance coverage for psychiatric disabilities, meaning coverage equivalent to that for physical illness, has been promoted on the state and federal level as a major route toward improving access to mental health care.  According to testimony, the most blatant discrimination may be found in the very health care system that is intended to serve people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.  A lack of mental health benefit parity prevents people labeled with psychiatric disabilities from seeking and obtaining quality, affordable treatment, delays their recovery, and may even exacerbate their disabilities.           It cost the insurance companies and the system a bundle, because      my problems, in fact, were so multiplied rather than diminished by my      entrance into the mental health system.   (Mary Wimberger Auslander)      While many people labeled with psychiatric disabilities are denied even basic treatment options, health care plans cover treatments for physical conditions with far fewer restrictions and exclusions.  Joseph Glazer, president and CEO of the Mental Health Association in New York State, testified about the difficulties this causes for people seeking treatment.           It would be unthinkable for our health care system to tell a      person, ""Yes, you need a kidney transplant, and there is actually one      available right now.  But we're going to make you wait six months,      doing painful treatment and dialysis every day, even though we know      that it will be cheaper and more effective in the long run to do the      transplant now.""  It sounds absurd, but that happens to people living      with mental illnesses every day.   (Joseph Glazer)      Glazer further testified that the inherent structure of the existing system, driven by providers and the insurance industry, is self-limiting because people cannot pursue their own wellness.  He testified that barriers to the most effective treatments exist.  For example, before some insurance companies will approve newer, more effective drugs, people labeled with psychiatric disabilities are required to demonstrate that older, side-effect-laden pharmaceuticals are ineffective or cause adverse reactions.           For a person living with kidney disease, complete and thorough      treatment is always an option.  For a person living with mental      illness, artificial restrictions are imposed nearly every step of the      way.   (Joseph Glazer)      Disproportionately large copayments and deductibles for people labeled with psychiatric disabilities pose barriers to voluntary treatment.  For example, one person with major depression, as well as posttraumatic stress and borderline personality disorders, testified that she receives mental health benefits through her husband's employer.  Although she cannot afford to stop her therapy or her medication, she reports the financial burden may soon leave her no other choice, since her existing mental health benefits are limited and her out-of-pocket expenses are high.  She also cannot obtain affordable supplemental mental health insurance to help defray some of the cost of treatment.  While a plethora of supplemental insurance plans exist to cover physical conditions, company policies offering supplemental insurance for mental conditions are almost nonexistent.  When supplemental health insurance policies do cover mental health benefits, the annual limits may be as low as $500--much lower than supplemental benefits covering physical health conditions.           The lack of mental health parity laws add up to nothing less      than societally sanctioned torture.   (Joseph Glazer)      As a result of the limits imposed by restricted mental health benefits, people labeled with psychiatric disabilities cannot control their own lives, are denied the opportunity to make informed choices about treatment, and are forced into unwanted treatments.    There is, however, another side to the question of parity, one that has seldom been aired in the public policy discussions on this issue.           Another issue are  the so-called insurance parity laws, which      promote only one kind of parity.  Parity means equality, and if we      want to promote equality on the payment side, it's got to come      hand-in-hand with equality on the rights side.  So, any so-called      parity laws are not really equal unless they say that the medical      treatment should be offered on the same basis for these diagnoses as      anything else, where you cannot be forced.  A diagnosis of cancer or      heart disease or anything else doesn't carry with it the power to      commit and force treatment and neither should any mental health      treatment, and if insurance parity as currently written goes into      effect, it's just going to be a cover for a lot more forced      treatment.   (Judi Chamberlin)         We believe that healing and recovery are possible only in an      atmosphere in which we control our own lives and make free and      informed choices about treatment.   (Darby Penney)      The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) of 1996 (P.L. 104-204) required that, beginning in 1998, limited mental health parity--elimination of annual and lifetime dollar limits for mental health care--be made available for all U.S. group health plans that already offer mental health benefits and serve more than 50 employees.  However, the law has flaws.  The law exempts employers with 50 or fewer employees and those who can demonstrate an increase of 1 percent or greater in total annual health premium costs as a result of mental health parity.  Under MHPA, the ""sunset"" provision mandates that the requirements of the law will cease to apply to benefits for services furnished by an employer on or after September 31, 2001.  This law overrides the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) exclusions that had exempted from state-level parity legislation at least one-third of the population covered by self-insured employers.    According to testimony, one of New York State's largest managed care insurers responded to the parity law by simply eliminating dollar caps on mental health services and replacing them with annual and lifetime visit caps.  A mental health administrator testified that this benefit limitation is additionally grievous to youths between the ages of 18 and 21, who are most commonly diagnosed with schizophrenia and many forms of depression during this time of their lives.           They just did the math and circumvented the law.   (Joseph Glazer)      But because the public policy debate on parity has not involved people labeled with psychiatric disabilities in meaningful ways, the question of forced treatment has not been addressed in existing or proposed mental health parity laws.  Using the cover of mental health parity to pay for treatments that are not sought or wanted by their recipients will simply make such laws a vehicle to further legitimize and fund involuntary treatment, which is incompatible with self-determination principles.  In addition, mental health parity laws could lead to even greater medicalizing of people's problems, because they would fund drugs, electroshock, and hospitalization, when what is often needed are such nonmedical services as improved housing and peer support.    States that have instituted parity laws are turning to managed mental health care to save money.  According to  Parity in Financing Mental Health Services:  Managed Care Effects on Cost, Access, and Quality , a 1998 report by the National Advisory Mental Health Council (NAMHC), implementing parity in systems already using managed care results in an increase of less than 1 percent in total health care costs during a one-year period.  NAMHC also reports that in systems not using managed care, introducing parity with managed care results in a 30 to 50 percent reduction in total mental health costs.  The report notes, however, that considerable variability has been observed in access and other measures of quality across managed behavioral health plans, raising concern about the quality and outcome of mental health care in some plans.  In some instances, managed mental health services also have resulted in limited mental health access, decreased work performance, increased absenteeism, and greater use of medical services.  Despite its cost-effectiveness, NAMHC reports that only 15 states had enacted mental health parity laws in 1998.    It is important to note that this report, typical of public policy discussion in this area, does not even mention involuntary treatment, despite the emphasis put on forced treatment in much of the testimony heard by NCD.           The results of a major survey of employer-provided health plans      was published in 1998 by the Hay Group, an independent benefits      consulting firm.  The Hay Report showed a major decline in benefits      in the past decade: Employer-provided mental health benefits      decreased 54 percent, while benefits for general health decreased      only 7 percent.  Even before this erosion occurred, mental health      benefits made up only 6 percent of total medical benefits paid by      employers.  Today, that has been cut in half--it is down to 3      percent.  The number of plans restricting hospitalization for mental      disorders increased by 20 percent.       (Senator Paul Wellstone (D-MN), Congressional Record, April 14, 1999.)      On June 7, 1999, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) notified all of its 285 participating health plans that they must offer full mental health and substance abuse parity to continue to participate.  OPM surveys revealed that health benefit parity would add minimal cost to existing premiums and would increase employee productivity.    Testimony also pointed to problems faced by people labeled with psychiatric disabilities when they return to work and need continued insurance coverage.  At the time of the hearings, people labeled with psychiatric disabilities who received Medicaid lost those health benefits if they returned to the workforce, but benefits to Medicare recipients continued for three years after they returned to work.  Medicare recipients also have restrictions placed on mental health benefits.  Inpatient mental health benefits, for example, have a lifetime cap of 190 days.  Beneficiaries also are responsible for 20 percent of the inpatient hospital charge, as well as the deductible for each stay.  Medicare coverage for outpatient mental health services is limited to 50 percent of the Medicare allowable charge; however, there is no lifetime cap for outpatient therapy.  Medicaid mental health benefits vary from state to state.    The President signed into law the work incentives legislation that includes provisions that allow people to continue Medicaid and Medicare benefits for a period of six years after they return to work.  An employer who offers health care benefits should include mental health parity.  Unless mental health parity legislation for voluntary treatment is enacted nationwide, at the end of six years many people labeled with psychiatric disabilities will face the same dilemma they face today--a lack of coverage for voluntary treatment and a disincentive to work.    Furthermore, parity alone does not guarantee access to mental health care.  With limited available health care dollars, many providers are turning to managed care organizations (MCOs) to provide cost-effective mental health services.  Unfortunately, this move is often at the expense of, and detrimental to, the well-being of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.  As an example, an MCO may require ""treatment"" by a psychiatrist when a client needs and wants therapy or consulting by a non-psychiatric mental health professional.    Arthur Springer developed an anxiety disorder secondary to his physical disability, but he did not obtain competent treatment for his psychiatric disability until six years later, and only after numerous agencies denied him or created insurmountable barriers.  He testified that the long process aggravated both his physical and his mental health conditions, and is concerned that it will become more difficult for others to obtain preventive services if Medicaid continues to shift to compulsory managed care.           I have been in two widely publicized Medicaid managed care plans      since 1991, and it is because of that personal experience,      corroborated over and over again by the experiences of many other      people that I have met, that I am against managed care for people      with chronic, disabling, or rare conditions, until the federal      government and the health insurance and HMO industry can explain to      me how managed care is safe and effective for me and all others like      me.  The second issue is the deeply disturbing doctrine of so-called      special needs as a rationale for preferential status and services in      Medicaid managed care for a few providers.  In New York, the state      and HCFA  propose to create so-called special needs plans for people      with HIV/AIDS and serious and persistent mental illness.  No one      disagrees with the idea that both these groups need a variety of      services from people who are qualified to serve them.  The issue is      the government's refusal to guarantee equitable services,      proportionate to need, for all other Medicaid recipients with acute,      chronic, disabling, or rare conditions that require something other      than so-called primary care.   (Arthur Springer)         The most eye-opening discrimination is that found in the very      health care system that is intended to serve people living with      mental illnesses.  The inherent structure of our system, driven by      providers and the insurance industry, starts by steering us away from      nonmedical options for treatment.  By design, it is self-limiting in      the kinds of things people can pursue in seeking their own wellness.      In practice, under managed care, it has become even more limited,      particularly on the mental health side of the managed cost ledger.      We know that restrictions on access to the best and most successful      medications is practiced, based on cost, and that benefits for      nondrug therapies are greatly limited.   (Joseph Glazer)      The director of the Mental Health Legal Advisors Committee (MHLAC), an agency of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, testified that more states are contracting with private MCOs to provide Medicaid services because of financial incentives inherent in a for-profit, capitated, closed-network system.           In Massachusetts, services are cut based on financial, not      clinical, considerations.  The amount of therapy each individual      receives has been slashed, and greater reliance has been placed on      medication services (medications are not paid for by the managed care      company).  A 15-minute medication session once a month is much less      expensive than weekly therapy.   (Frank Laski)      Laski further testified that the quality of care is also affected since managed care has put financial pressures on providers, who have cut staffing or employed less educated staff and foregone staff training.           Hurried interaction and even human rights abuses are facilitated      by a system with too few staff who can take the time to listen to a      client's needs and respond appropriately.   (Frank Laski)      According to MHLAC, although some providers in closed, managed care networks would like to, they cannot directly or indirectly criticize the treatment decisions made by MCOs.  If providers disagree with the treatment decisions imposed by MCOs, few appeal because they fear retribution, in the form of cuts in referrals or other limitations on services.  Providers also are cautious about recommending too many services for their clients.           Under a managed care system, it is very difficult--very, very      difficult--for persons with mental illness to look to clinicians or      others who are caring for them to be their advocates for their      service needs, because they're caught up in the same issues.       (Frank Laski)      Unfortunately, many MCOs are operating with little or no oversight.  Testimony from Laski illustrated the problems in Massachusetts, one of the states that has gone furthest in turning Medicaid-funded mental health services over to MCOs.  He testified that Massachusetts has been unwilling or unable to effectively monitor the impact of privately managed care.  One MCO operating in Massachusetts, for example, received an award for keeping seven-day recidivism rates at or below 5 percent.  MHLAC reports further investigation revealed that recidivism rates were not measured by readmissions for the same diagnosis, and doctors admitted changing diagnoses to reflect lower recidivism rates.           In this age of public scrutiny as to how tax dollars are spent,      it is befuddling how little the Commonwealth knows about the      performance of its Medicare contractors.   (Frank Laski)      Laski referred to an independent study of the privatization of Massachusetts Medicaid mental health management performed in 1993 in Massachusetts that failed to fully address such basic issues as access to services.  The absence of this information precipitated the Massachusetts legislature to require quarterly reports from the state's Division of Medical Assistance (DMA).  However, no consumer satisfaction survey has ever been performed.  MHLAC also reports that the Commonwealth had to increase bonuses because it reduced the amount of money the company could retain if it cut services.           The result is that services continue to be cut--no private      company would risk loss or forego the opportunity to make two million      dollars--and the Commonwealth awards the MCO for performing already      promised services.   (Frank Laski)      Glen Liebman, the executive director of New York State National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, testified that he consistently hears from members of his organization that Medicaid managed care plans lack coordination and accountability.  His greatest fear is that many of these ""special needs"" plans ""cherry-pick"" by only treating healthier people and dropping people with more severe conditions.    Ann Mathes testified that fighting for benefits adds additional stress to the lives of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.  She was surprised when the Medicare carrier for Minnesota changed its policy and informed her psychologist that services exceeding 20 sessions during 1997 would be denied.  After much stress and many letters and telephone calls to the local Medicare carrier and HCFA, her therapy sessions were finally covered.    Mary Wimberger Auslander, a psychiatric survivor and mental health professional, testified that she was involuntarily committed to institutions for seven or eight months over a period of nine years.  These intermittent hospitalizations only lasted as long as her insurance benefits covered them, and were both expensive and ineffective.  As a result, she testified that the months in the institutions cost her at least an entire decade of her life.           I learned primarily that the last place you can go to have a      nervous breakdown is a psychiatric ward.   (Mary Wimberger Auslander)      Auslander also testified that because our society has a complete lack of tolerance for difference and staunchly denies the effects of poverty, the mental health system has become the repository for the victims of these attitudes.  She also stated that as long as such attitudes prevail and their shortcomings and the consequences are ignored, a coercive, destructive, discriminatory, and lethal system of mental health care will continue.  She testified that although more humane treatments are coming to the fore, the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is increasing because it is one of the treatments some insurance companies will reimburse.    Sharon Frieler, a member of the South Dakota PAIMI advisory council, testified about the effect on her cousin of ECT treatment.           My own cousin in Nebraska  underwent many, many different      treatments of ECT over a period of time.  And what happens, in many      cases, you lose parts of your life, your memories.  And today, after      years of treatments and being with psychiatrists, she is still      depressed.  She is still looking for those lost years.       (Sharon Frieler)           Further, ECT continues to be given against the expressed wishes of individuals.           The Center for Mental Health Services of the Federal Government      did a review on the subject of electroshock human rights violations.      It acknowledges that there are instances of illegal, forced      electroshock against the expressed wishes of the subject.  And we      feel that's a real litmus test about empowerment.  If the Federal      Government is for empowerment of people with psychiatric labels, it      will ban forced electroshock.   (David Oaks)      One method of increasing self-determination in psychiatric care is the use of advance directives (sometimes known as ""living wills"").  Through an advance directive, people can specify in advance what kinds of care they want, or don't want, at some future time in which they may be deemed incompetent to make treatment decisions.  While originally envisioned as applying primarily to end-of-life care, advance directives also have applicability to people labeled with psychiatric disabilities, who are usually legally competent but who may experience periods when they are considered not to be.  Xenia Williams, a mental health advocate from Vermont, testified concerning the use of advance directives for psychiatric care and the problems that she had experienced in attempting to implement the provisions of an advance directive in which she was named the substitute decision maker.           Since 1995, I have been an agent under a durable power of      attorney for health care in the state of Vermont for [my friend].      She has not had her durable power of attorney honored by Vermont      State Hospital or the Brattleborough Retreat, both of which receive      federal monies.  This is contrary to the Vermont statute for durable      powers of attorney for health care and the federal Patients'      Self-Determination Act, and it's discriminatory under ADA.  People      labeled with psychiatric disabilities should have their advance      directives respected, the same as people who have lost capacity to      make their own health care decisions because they were in a car crash      and are in a coma.  If you execute an advance directive, you should      have the same rights to have it honored if your loss of capacity to      make your own decisions is due to psychiatric situations as well as      for other reasons of losing capacity.  I'm a co-plaintiff with my      friend in a lawsuit against Vermont State Hospital, to try to get      enforcement of her advance directive.  She has been discriminated      against in being barred from having visitors at times.  I have not      been consulted about her care.  They won't consult me; they just      throw her back in the hospital, and then they feed her all kinds of      drugs that are not good for her.  They won't respect her wishes about      which drugs she wants to take, and when, and other things that      greatly affect her care.  So, she's not getting her rights respected      there.   (Xenia Williams)      Advance directives cannot necessarily prevent the administration of treatments people may choose not to have.  A person may write an advance directive explicitly rejecting any form of psychiatric treatment, yet in every state such an individual can still be involuntarily committed.    People labeled with psychiatric disabilities often have other health problems that, when ignored, can lead to permanent disability and even death.  William Brooks, the supervising attorney of the Mental Disability Law Clinic at Toro Law Center on Long Island, testified about an elderly woman who was left unattended in the bathroom of a state institution.  When she fell off the toilet, the attendants did not believe that she was in pain, hoisted her up, and put her back into bed.  After crying in pain all night, she was finally moved to a general medical hospital where an X ray revealed a broken hip.  Since then, she has lost her ability to walk.    Anna Clege, a licensed practical nurse with 18 years of surgical experience and a native of Haiti, did not survive her stay in an institution.  For Clege, language posed one barrier to her treatment.  But a more dangerous barrier resulted in her death:  Medical personnel ignored her physical symptoms.  According to testimony from her sister, no one could communicate with Clege because no one on staff spoke her native language.  On the morning following her admission, after staff heard a loud crash coming from her room, they found Clege on the floor.  Although she was nonresponsive, lacked a radial pulse, and her blood pressure was inaudible, staff took no emergency measures.  In fact, it was not until almost one hour after she collapsed that an EKG was administered and revealed that Clege had suffered a heart attack.  Then, one hour and 10 minutes after she had collapsed, Clege was finally moved to medical emergency services, where she died 27 minutes later.           In her community, in addition to giving professional services,      she always showed great generosity and hospitality to the ones in      need.  Our beloved sister was always there for all of us in our      family.  Her death created a tremendous hole in our family that      leaves us with a lot of anger and frustration.   (Marie Clege)        Public Policy Recommendations    Congress should enact legislation that provides health insurance parity for voluntary mental health services for people labeled with psychiatric disabilities to the same extent that voluntary physical health treatment is provided.  Involuntary treatment should not be covered in insurance parity legislation, since insurance coverage for physical health conditions does not mandate involuntary treatment.  Legislation also should incorporate the following provisions:      Prohibit limits on the number of covered hospital days and outpatient visits.    Eliminate copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles that are inconsistent with physical health portions of all policies.    Eliminate provisions in Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 that protect managed care organizations from liability.    Amend the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 to eliminate coverage for involuntary care and to eliminate the sunset provision.    Eliminate the 50-employee threshold in the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996.    Establish time limits for processing appeals of denied claims.    Prohibit all forms of capitation and risk-sharing that induce managed care organizations and providers to cut services.    Prohibit discrimination in supplemental health insurance policies.      Institute closer oversight and monitoring of MCOs, Medicare, and Medicaid.    Congress should pursue legislative initiatives and regulatory changes that provide closer monitoring of MCOs.  These initiatives should include uniform methods for maintaining expenditure data so that managed care company performance can be compared over time and between companies.  Expenditures and other critical data should be made available to the public.    Congress should initiate independent evaluations of privately managed care that analyze the number of persons using each service and the amount of services each person receives--as well as analysis of administrative versus service expenditures, expenditure trends, and consumer satisfaction.    Congress should fund research to monitor the impact of MCOs in Medicare and Medicaid mental health plans and the relationship between public and private mental health systems under diverse types of funding.    HCFA should exercise greater oversight and stricter enforcement of existing regulations to ensure coordination and accountability by its Medicare and Medicaid providers, as well as equity in the Medicaid program by eliminating discriminatory ""special needs"" plans that penalize people with severe disabilities and chronic conditions.    Proactive protection of patients' rights.    Congress should conduct public hearings on the experiences of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities with existing treatments.    Congress should enact a comprehensive patients' bill of rights that protects patients in all areas of health care but especially addresses the specific issues of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.    Congress should mandate that, prior to receiving treatment, patients' advance directives are adhered to and informed consent forms clearly state due process rights in understandable terms.    Congress also should mandate that people labeled with psychiatric disabilities receive complete and current information concerning their diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis in terms that they can understand, and that these documents are signed without coercion prior to receiving any treatment for a psychiatric condition at any facility that receives federal funds.    Congress also should establish a mandatory reporting system for this process and impose stiff penalties on facilities that fail to comply with these provisions.    Congress should further mandate that services be provided in a culturally competent manner that respects the ethnic and racial backgrounds of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.    Considering the number of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities, current research funding for psychiatric conditions is inadequate.  Significantly more federal research dollars are spent on health conditions that affect fewer people, due in part to powerful lobbying groups that exert significant influence over how federal research money is allocated.    Congress should allocate funding for research into safe alternative treatments for people labeled with psychiatric disabilities and ensure that people labeled with psychiatric disabilities are included in any review boards or policymaking decisions that result from research.    Congress also should fund a nationwide study on the status of mental health in the United States.    With the relaxing of FDA approval for new drugs, many drugs have received approval and have later been recalled by the FDA because of adverse reactions.  In addition, much of today's drug testing is performed on adult male research subjects; therefore, it is difficult to determine the effects of such drugs on women and children.  Drug testing standards should be revised to ensure that new drugs on the market are safe for use by women and children, minorities, and others.    DOJ should enforce existing provisions of ADA to remove barriers that prevent people labeled with psychiatric disabilities from communicating with their physicians, therapists, and service providers.    Congress should amend Medicaid and Medicare laws to ensure that health care professionals can communicate in a language that their clients understand.    Emergency medical training should be required for all staff who have direct contact with people labeled with psychiatric disabilities in institutions, residential treatment centers, and group homes that receive federal funds.    Medical and psychiatric personnel should receive training in addressing both physical and psychiatric conditions in people with disabilities.    The lack of culturally competent mental health services was also addressed by Sharon Frieler, a member of the South Dakota PAIMI advisory council.           The reality is not having readily available, culturally      sensitive mental health services for the Native American, the largest      minority group in our state.  The reality is stigma that is      exceptionally difficult to deal with, in an environment where the leas      t bit of attention drawn to yourself, or forced up, let alone being      associated with particular programs, will single you out, and say,      ""You are crazy.""  So, please don't lose the sense of these shared      experiences you've heard here today.  Deliberate on them.  Think      before you make your recommendations.   (Sharon Frieler)             Chapter 4    Criminal Justice    Neither law enforcement agencies nor the judicial and correctional systems have programs and policies in place to address the particular needs of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities while at the same time ensuring that they receive equal justice under law.  When they are the victims of crime, testimony revealed that people labeled with psychiatric disabilities cannot rely on law enforcement agencies to protect them.  The judicial system also fails them.  Studies have found that rates of incarceration for people labeled with psychiatric disabilities are almost double the comparable rates in the general population.  While it is often assumed that people labeled with psychiatric disabilities are in prison because they are particularly violent and dangerous, in fact, large numbers of prisoners with psychiatric disabilities are in prison for crimes that would not normally result in incarceration for nondisabled people. Inmates with psychiatric disabilities serve longer sentences than other prisoners and are less likely to receive voluntary treatment for their disabilities.  Treatment in penal settings almost always consists of drugs, most often without any meaningful informed consent.  In fact, imprisonment may actually exacerbate the symptoms of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.           Law enforcement personnel often presume us to be without      credibility in our complaints but assume us dangerous when complained      against.  Either way, our lives are held at very little worth.   (Laura Ziegler)      The Police Executive Research Forum (PERF), a national organization composed of chief executives from municipal, county, and state law enforcement agencies, offers a training curriculum and model policy that addresses police response to people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.  PERF's trainer's guide,  Police Response to People with Mental Illness , also covers the ADA and community policing approaches, including the voluntary and involuntary commitment process, arresting, and interviewing people with mental illness.  However, as is typical of such training procedures, these materials were developed without input from people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.  The training guide notes, ""It is not the role of the police officer to make the determination that a person should be committed.""  Testimony revealed, however, that police do not always adhere to this policy.           One woman described being locked out by her landlord.  When she      called the police, he told them, ""It's just some nut who didn't pay      her rent.""  And they took her to a psychiatric ward.   (Laura Ziegler)      When a person with a psychiatric disability is a victim of crime or has witnessed a crime, police should provide the same services they provide to all victims and witnesses.  Unfortunately, this is not the case, according to Ziegler, a person with a psychiatric disability who has worked as a legal advocate in several states.  She testified that the management of a building where she lived routinely broke into and entered apartments of tenants, many of whom had psychiatric histories.  When she complained at the local precinct, she testified that the police clearly did not consider this an issue, since the perpetrator was a mental health agency and the victims were people labeled with psychiatric disabilities, who were not to be believed.  When she consulted a legal agency, she was told it was a ""gray area.""  She says the law is clear, but invoking the disability of the victims somehow made it gray.  As a result, she says, people labeled with psychiatric disabilities who lived on this New York City block, which served as a crack and heroin supermarket and where occasional gunfire could be heard at night, could not expect the ordinary level of control and safety that comes with a locked door.    The PERF training model confirms that police are frequently unclear about the rights of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities:           Frequently, officers believe that only two dispositions are      available:  arrest or involuntary emergency evaluation.  Although      these are two formal dispositions, a number of informal dispositions      also exist.   (Police Response to People with Mental Illness)      Ziegler recalled another incident in which one of her clients, who lived in an apartment run by a mental health agency, was attacked by a man who had threatened to kill her (the client) with a knife.  He was not charged with any crime, an example of how people labeled with psychiatric disabilities are frequently victimized both by criminals and by the criminal justice system that is supposed to protect them.  When this same client, however, objected to the policy of the building's management of entering her apartment without her permission and stated that someone would get ""knocked on their ass"" the next time it happened, a staff person arranged for her to be psychiatrically committed because she was ""violent.""    Ziegler also testified about a family who called the police because they thought their son was having a psychiatric crisis.           When the police came, he was hit with a Tazer gun by an      officer.  What was he doing that invoked this response?  He was      crying.   (Laura Ziegler)      Betsy Pansa testified that when she called police to report her keys stolen, the policeman refused to take a report and made fun of her.  When she asked him to leave her home, she was handcuffed and transported in the police car for a psychiatric evaluation.    Luz Marquez, associate director for outreach at the New York State Coalition Against Sexual Assault, testified that victims with disabilities are subject to unfair reporting requirements.           There is a New York state law that requires people who have      cognitive disabilities to have a third person witness the actual      assault.   (Luz Marquez)      Ziegler graphically depicted the vulnerability of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities in institutions.           When I was an advocate with the Long Island Protection and      Advocacy Office, a client institutionalized at a state psychiatric      center quoted a staff person as telling her, ""You can't dial 911 in      here.""  What would have happened if she had?  The county police told      me a staff person's verification would be required if a complaint      came from a psychiatric ward.  They did not explain how this would      work if the alleged perpetrator was a staff person.  On another      occasion, at a conference on sexual assault and retraumatization, I      questioned a panelist from the Queens D.A.'s office as to how they      responded to complaints of a sexual assault emanating from DD or      psychiatric centers.  She replied that she couldn't answer my      question because they didn't have a psychiatrist on the panel.  This      kind of discriminatory law enforcement effectively denies basic      security to people who are extremely vulnerable to crimes of      violence, including violence that is called ""treatment.""       (Laura Ziegler)      Roy Neville, the president of the Alliance for the Mentally Ill of Schenectady, testified that jails and prison, rather than hospitals, are the new institutions for caring for mentally ill persons.           Bail is available to mentally ill defendants less often than      other defendants.  More mentally ill defendants spend longer in jail      detention than other prisoners.  Mentally ill prisoners spend a      larger portion of their sentence in prison than other prisoners, on      average.  They are more often denied parole than the others.       (Roy Neville)      The Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) reports ""the sheer magnitude of people with serious psychiatric disorders in jails is staggering.""  In July 1998, the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) reported that an estimated 284,800 mentally ill offenders were held in the nation's state and federal prisons and local jails in mid-1998.  Another 547,800 mentally ill people were on probation in the community.    CMHS reports that on an average day, 9 percent of men and 18.5 percent of women entering local jails have a history of serious mental illness--rates two to three times higher than the general population.  An estimated 700,000 new admissions annually to jails are individuals with acute and severe mental illness, compared with 731,510 people who are admitted annually to inpatient psychiatric facilities.           The local jail persistently remains one of the community      settings where people labeled with psychiatric disabilities reside,      however briefly, during the course of their long illness.  Most      often, these are people whose only crimes are minor offenses--public      nuisances associated with homelessness (in Los Angeles, over 70      percent of people with mental illness have been arrested), or      confusion, often mistaken for public drunkenness.       (Mental Health, United States, 1998, CMHS)      CMHS estimates the prevalence of serious mental illness (SMI) to be as high as 57 percent among the 1.1 million adult residents of correctional institutions.  In some communities, arrests may constitute ""mercy bookings"" to remove people from the streets because the mental health services they need are inaccessible or unavailable because of scarce resources.  Whether the people so arrested consider it an act of mercy is questionable.    BJS's Mental Health and Treatment of Inmates and Probationers reports that, on average, inmates with psychiatric disabilities were expected to serve 103 months in state prisons before their release--15 months longer than other inmates.    The trauma of incarceration, regardless of the length of time, may exacerbate their symptoms and put people labeled with psychiatric disabilities at risk for suicide.  Between 75 and 95 percent of people who commit suicide in jails or in prisons have a mental disability, according to information provided in Mental Health, United States, 1998.           In criminal courts, mentally ill persons don't receive fair      treatment in this era of ""let's get tough on crime.""  They receive an      uneven defense in court from public defenders who may not understand      mental illness...and are too overworked to deal with each case      sufficiently.  Plea bargains and trials result in jail and prison      terms more severe on the average than for other defendants.         (Roy Neville)      In correctional facilities, services differ from locality to locality.  In 1997, for example, the Cook County, Illinois, jail provided services to only 37 percent of men and 23.5 percent of women who needed them.  Such services usually consist of administration of psychiatric drugs rather than counseling or therapy.    Cliff Zucker, the executive director of Disability Advocates, Inc., an Albany, New York, P&A organization, cited the example of a prisoner who went for days without treatment because his medical records did not accompany him when he was transferred from one correctional facility to another.  It took the intervention of the P&A before the inmate received his medication.  In the past, prisoners with mental illness received help from prisoners' legal services, but federal funding was eliminated for this program.    The problems in the criminal justice system need to be addressed systematically in ways that include the views of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities and their advocates.  Excluding these viewpoints will perpetuate many of the mistakes of the past.      Public Policy Recommendations    Institute mandatory training for all personnel who work in law enforcement; the judicial, penal, parole, and probation systems; and victim assistance programs on the requirements of ADA and other laws that protect the civil and human rights of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.    Mandatory training should be required for all law enforcement, criminal justice, and correctional personnel, including prison guards and probation officers, as well as people working in victim assistance programs.  Training should be coordinated with PERF, DOJ's Office of Victims of Crime, and the National GAINS Center.    The latter, established in September 1995, provides technical assistance to states, localities, and criminal justice and provider organizations that are in the process of developing or implementing services to people with co-occurring psychiatric disabilities and substance abuse disorders at all stages of the justice system--law enforcement, jails, prisons, probation, and parole.    DOJ should ensure that these organizations remove all physical and attitudinal barriers and that the programs are accessible to people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.    People labeled with psychiatric disabilities should be included in all policy and program development, decision making, and service delivery from the time of the crime through case disposition and beyond.    In addition, people labeled with psychiatric disabilities should be recruited and trained to become volunteers and paid staff members in criminal justice programs, especially in system-based or private victim assistance programs.    Increase involvement in protecting the rights of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities who are defendants in courts and inmates of state and local corrections systems.    People labeled with psychiatric disabilities should be an integral part of all policymaking that addresses prevention of crimes by people labeled with psychiatric disabilities and how to best meet the needs of offenders.           Chapter 5    I Had to Give My Child Away Because She Has a Disability    While only a few witnesses addressed the question of children with psychiatric disabilities, it is clear from testimony that many of the same problems affecting the adult mental health system carry over into the children's system as well.  Witnesses testified to a lack of parental involvement in treatment decisions; the requirement that, in many cases, parents relinquish custody to the state in order to obtain services; poor interface between the educational and mental health systems; problems with obtaining and retaining SSI benefits; and a host of other difficulties.    The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) reports that 1 in 10 children and adolescents have an emotional disturbance severe enough to cause some level of impairment.  In 1996, suicide was the third leading cause of death among 15- to 24-year-olds, and the fourth leading cause of death in 10- to 14-year-olds.  (It should be noted that ""severe emotional disturbance"" is the term used by the Federal Government for those under 18; people over 18 are designated as ""mentally ill."")    The number of children receiving services in private residential treatment facilities more than doubled between 1969 and 1994.  Children with psychiatric disabilities are more likely than all other children with disabilities to receive educational services in residential settings or separate classrooms.  They fail more courses, earn lower grade point averages, miss more days of school, and are retained at grade more than students with other disabilities.  Fifty-five percent leave school before graduating.    Because eligibility for Medicaid and other public health programs differs from state to state, many children with psychiatric disabilities never receive appropriate treatment.  In response, some parents even relinquish custody of their children, hoping that as wards of the state, they will receive better services and treatment.  But frequently, treatment for these children--and all children with psychiatric disabilities--is provided in state and privately operated institutions, or even juvenile correctional facilities, where they may endure pain, abuse, and torture.  The recent emphasis on sending juvenile offenders to ""boot camp"" programs has resulted in several underpublicized deaths in the past year alone.    BJS reports that offenders with severe emotional disorders who were incarcerated or on probation reported higher rates of prior physical and sexual abuse and higher rates of alcohol and drug abuse by a parent or guardian while they were growing up.  More than 40 percent of inmates with psychiatric disabilities said their parents had abused alcohol or drugs.  More than half said a parent, brother, or sister had also been in prison or jail.    At school and in their communities, children with severe emotional disturbance suffer the anguish and pain that come with the stigma of living with a psychiatric disability.  For a child, this can be especially damaging.    Families of children with severe emotional disturbances often lack the financial resources to provide adequate treatment, and for parents with their own psychiatric disabilities, this can be even more difficult.  Susan Mikolik testified that she, her husband, and two of their children have psychiatric disabilities.  Both she and her husband are professionals who work full-time.  However, Mikolik states:           The impact that this overwhelming volume of afflictions creates      on our family's functioning is devastating.  The two primary areas      that create additional burdens for us to deal with are      financial/insurance issues and school issues.  (Susan Mikolik)      Mikolik also testified that although her son is medically qualified, he has been denied SSI benefits because of the family's income, since the formula for calculating assets does not include expenses, which can at times amount to $500 a week for psychiatric treatment for her family.    Carol Wilson of Family Voices, a national grassroots organization that speaks on behalf of children with special health care needs, and the parent of a child with severe emotional disturbances, testified that children with severe emotional disturbances were unfairly singled out when stricter eligibility criteria were required for SSI benefits for children with disabilities.           Children receiving SSI and Medicaid were cut, and all benefits      ceased, and the large portion of those were children with serious      emotional disturbances, because there's not a test you can run at a      local hospital that's going to show you what this child has.   (Carol Wilson)      The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, commonly referred to as Welfare Reform, made eligibility for childhood SSI more restrictive.  After the law was enacted, SSA reviewed the existing eligibility of some 288,000 children against the new standards.  In response to numerous complaints that children would be hurt by these cuts, SSA reduced the number of cases it would review and agreed to reevaluate the entire process.    SSA estimates that approximately 100,000 children eventually will lose SSI benefits as a result of Welfare Reform.  Although many children lost SSI, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 included a provision that ensured that those children would continue to remain eligible for Medicaid.           The issues that you've heard today about managed care taking      over, insurance discrimination [is] a big part of it.  Managed care      [is] taking over.  Medicaid is a concern because managed care does      not understand the early and periodic screening, diagnosis, and      treatment portion, which is a mandatory Medicaid provision for      children, and that these services must be provided if they're      medically necessary.   (Carol Wilson)      Wilson contends that MCOs do not understand how Medicaid provisions apply to children with psychiatric disabilities.  The result is a very fragmented delivery of treatment, and children with psychiatric disabilities frequently do not receive what they need.    Wilson testified, and studies confirm, that, overall, children have lost insurance at a much higher rate than adults.  To offset this, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 also created the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) under Title XXI of the Social Security Act.  SCHIP enables all states, the District of Columbia, and five territories to initiate and expand health insurance coverage for uninsured children.  In FY 1998, Congress allocated $4.275 billion for the program.           Unfortunately, not one single state has implemented mental      health parity in their state children's health insurance program.      And that's a concern.  What happens?  What is the result?  Families      such as mine are told to give up custody of their children to the      states in order to receive mental health treatments and services, and      those services usually aren't provided.  The children are put in      foster care; they fall through the cracks.  The other option      presented is to declare your child an ungovernable child and have      them put in the juvenile justice system.  (Carol Wilson)      According to the GAO, as of April 1, 1999, HCFA had approved 51 state plans for SCHIP; 2 were under review; and 3 had not been submitted.  Some 982,000 children were enrolled in the new program.  Under SCHIP, a state has the choice of expanding Medicaid; establishing a separate stand-alone program that can include cost-sharing and allows the state to adopt a benefit package that meets one of several employer-based benchmarks; or combining these two approaches.  To date, most states have chosen to expand their Medicaid programs.    For its report, GAO sampled 15 states.  In eight states with the SCHIP stand-alone component, mental health, prescription drugs, vision, hearing, and dental coverage were optional benefits that, with the exception of prescription drugs, placed limits on the duration of treatment allowed or on the amount of services covered.  In those eight states, optional mental health benefits place limits on the number of days for inpatient treatment and the number of outpatient visits.           For the majority of children, such benefit limitations are not      likely to result in inadequate diagnosis and treatment.  Children      with special needs, however, may not receive the full range of      services that their conditions might warrant.       (Children's Health Insurance Program:  State Implementation      Approaches Are Evolving, GAO May 1999.)      Susan Mikolik testified that school issues for families with young children with psychiatric disabilities ""are tremendous.""  She asserted that children with severe emotional disturbance (SED) and those with severe behavior handicaps (SBH) are being placed in combined classes to save money. Mikolik acknowledges that some children may carry dual diagnoses, but she believes it is inappropriate to place a SED child--with little or no SBH tendencies--into an SBH class.  She states that  all  children falling into this category are not receiving a free, appropriate public education as required by law.    The 20th Annual Report to Congress  submitted by the U.S. Department of Education in 1998 reports that some 447,426 children with emotional disturbances ages six and older were served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) during the 1996-97 school year.  Over the past five years, the overall number of children served under IDEA has increased, but the number of certified special education teachers has not.  Convincing evidence now exists that there is a substantial, chronic national shortage of special education teachers who are fully certified in their positions.    The IDEA Amendments of 1997 strengthened IDEA to include an appropriate evaluation, development of an individualized education program (IEP), education provided in the least restrictive environment (LRE), parent and student participation in decision making, and procedural safeguards to protect the rights of parents and their child with a disability.  The law now specifically requires that a free, appropriate public education also must be made available to children who are suspended or expelled.    According to  The 20th Annual Report , the majority of students with emotional disturbances, however, continue to be served in separate classes from other students.  Even when they are placed in regular classes, research suggests that many of these students and their teachers do not currently receive the supports that they need to succeed.    Testimony revealed that their issues are generally ignored, because children with psychiatric disabilities are dealt with as discipline problems.  When treatment and services are not available, some parents are left with no choice but to relinquish custody of their children to the state.    In 1994, SAMHSA reports that 26,493 children received treatment at residential centers for emotionally disturbed children--a number that more than doubled since 1969, when only 13,489 children were treated in such facilities.  In fact, Department of Education data, based on a December 1, 1995, survey and updated on September 1, 1997, indicated that children with emotional disturbances were almost twice as likely to receive services under IDEA in public or private residential facilities than any other group of children with disabilities.    Once institutionalized, children with psychiatric disabilities are subjected to the same abuses as their adult peers.  Isolated in institutions, children are unwilling or unable to report abuse, and in some instances the staff may cover up incidents as previously reported.    If children don't receive treatment in residential facilities, they may end up in jail.  As many as 14,904 received IDEA services in correctional facilities during the 1995-96 school year.  Wilson asserts that approximately 60 percent of the children in the juvenile justice system have serious emotional disturbances but do not receive adequate treatment.  Some children who enter a juvenile correctional facility never leave alive, as has happened in some boot camp programs.    According to a report in the May 21, 1999, issue of The Washington Post, 16-year-old Wallace Wesley Dandridge, who was described in the article as ""an emotionally turbulent, mentally retarded youth,"" was found in respiratory distress, lying face-down on a steel bunk in his cell at the Oak Ridge Juvenile Correctional Center in suburban Richmond, Virginia.  His hands were in standard-issue leather restraints and his pulse was nearly gone when a state trooper arrived to charge the young man with assaulting an officer at the juvenile facility.  Unfortunately, an emergency tracheotomy that failed to save his life also may have destroyed any evidence that he was possibly choked or strangled.    On a happier note, Carol Wilson's son obtained employment through vocational rehabilitation and has been out of the hospital for 11 months, which is the longest time he has ever been able to stay out in the past four years.           He's happy, he's in the community, and he is doing well.  But it      was a hard-fought battle, and 86 percent of the children in my state      aren't receiving any services. We have to look at these children.      Putting them in juvenile justice is not the answer.  And parents      giving up custody of their children is not an answer.  It's a      violation of my civil rights that I have to give my child away      because he has a disability.   (Carol Wilson)        Public Policy Recommendations    Many children are given drugs that have serious and long-lasting damaging side effects, including other types of mental illness.  Safer treatments must be developed.  Particular attention should be paid to dramatic increases in the past five years in the number of children given Ritalin and other stimulant drugs for ""hyperactivity.""    Ensure that SSA's clinical study directed at evaluating the most effective approach for assessing functioning in some SSI children applicants addresses the unique needs of children with severe emotional disturbances.  SSA benefit eligibility rules should be amended to include all extenuating financial and other circumstances that may have an impact on a determination of SSI benefits involving people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.    HCFA should enforce Medicaid's existing early and periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment provisions.  HCFA should issue a policy statement to state Medicaid officials emphasizing that Medicaid provisions apply to children with severe emotional disturbances, and that denial or failure to provide these services will result in loss of Medicaid funding.    In coordination with the Health Resources and Services Administration and other federal agencies, HCFA should closely monitor SCHIP to ensure that children with severe emotional disturbances are receiving services through the program.  Federal funding should be withheld from states that exclude or limit SCHIP mental health services.    The hearings should identify barriers to treatment, explore how children are used in research, and why so many children with severe emotional disturbances are receiving services under IDEA in separate classes or in residential facilities.    The U.S. Department of Education should monitor and enforce existing provisions of IDEA and ensure that children with severe emotional disturbances are receiving their education in the most appropriate, integrated settings.    Congress should fund aggressive education and outreach programs about the rights of  children with severe emotional disturbances under IDEA, other laws, and available services and resources. Congress should earmark funds for additional fully certified special education teachers to eliminate the current and projected shortage.    Federally funded programs providing treatment and services should require parents and/or caretakers to sign informed consent forms that clearly state the available treatment, potential risks, and alternatives.  Stiff penalties should be levied against service providers who use coercion or provide inaccurate information or fail to obtain signed informed consent forms.    Congress should appropriate funding for additional psychologists and social workers to work in schools with children with severe emotional disturbances.  Services provided in schools also should be expanded to include early intervention and treatment for children at risk and to provide appropriate services to children with severe emotional disturbances and/or substance abuse and behavioral problems.  This funding could also provide in-school peer support groups for children with severe emotional disturbances and those recovering from substance abuse.    Congress should appropriate funding for community- and home-based treatment for children with severe emotional disturbances and their parents.    Multi-systemic therapy (MST), for example, is a mental health service that focuses on changing how youth function in their natural settings--at home, in school, and in their neighborhood.  It is designed to promote positive social behavior while decreasing negative behaviors, including delinquency and substance abuse.  Therapists work in the home to strengthen the ability of parents or caretakers to raise children with complex problems.  In a series of random trials, NIMH reports that MTS has proven effective in reducing long-term rates of rearrests by serious juvenile offenders by 20 to 70 percent.           Chapter 6    A Zillion Forms and Still No Civil Rights    People labeled with psychiatric disabilities have little or no control over existing federal programs and policies that directly affect their lives, because their opinions are not valued or are ignored.  For example, the June 7, 1999, White House Conference on Mental Health was dominated by people without psychiatric disabilities, nonconsumer-controlled mental health organizations, and the pharmaceutical industry.  By virtue of their exclusion, the voices of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities were silenced when they should have had the most impact, especially when national attention was focused on policy that directly affects them.           I admire my peers who struggle valiantly to recover what they      have lost, to resume normal lives in the face of psychiatric      labeling.  Their very being has been invalidated by psychiatric      diagnosis.  In many cases, their physical existence is now dependent      upon the mental illness industry.   (Angela Cerio)         I believe that the label of mental illness is the beginning of      human rights violations.   (Debbie Whittle)      George Ebert, an advocate with the Mental Patients Liberation Alliance in Syracuse, New York, testified that when he was labeled a paranoid schizophrenic, ""It gave them the right to actually disable me with involuntary confinement--solitary confinement, forced drugging, and shock treatments.""    Daniel Fisher, a psychiatrist, testified that some states, such as Massachusetts, had to pass legislation to ensure the human rights of people in institutions who are labeled with psychiatric disabilities, such as the right to make a phone call or have visitors, legislation that would not be necessary if people labeled with psychiatric disabilities did not lose their ordinary citizenship rights.  It is important to note that both in institutions and in community facilities, rights are referred to as ""privileges"" that must be earned, generally by compliance with treatment.  Such so-called ""privileges"" as using the telephone or having access to fresh air must be recognized as basic rights that may not be infringed.  Just as it would be intolerable and unacceptable for people to lose their rights when they enter a hospital for medical treatment or surgery, such policies should be similarly unacceptable in psychiatric facilities.    Many of the federal programs available to people labeled with psychiatric disabilities work against self-determination and wellness.  All people with disabilities who want to return to the workforce face barriers--many of them were addressed in Removing Barriers to Work, NCD's 1997 report.  People labeled with psychiatric disabilities, however, encounter some unique barriers, and the stigma associated with their disabilities is the most egregious.  Testimony revealed that many people labeled with psychiatric disabilities also are homeless and cannot access vocational services, and that people who are employed and acquire psychiatric disabilities often are refused accommodations.  Worse, a provision in one federal law allows some people labeled with psychiatric disabilities to work for little or no compensation, when such work is part of a ""therapeutic program.""           Patients are routinely coerced into forfeiting their rights in      the name of treatment, and, in general, the system is structured to      render consent meaningless.  The hospital has a canteen overseen by      therapeutic activity staff that sells light meals and beverages.  If      it was recommended that you work there, you could not refuse.      Refusing to participate in any treatment recommendation immediately      halted your privileges, including passes.  We were not paid for      working at the canteen, although it made money.  It was considered      hostile to mention the similarity between this and indentured      servitude.   (Diana Rickard)      When people labeled with psychiatric disabilities attempt to work and apply for employment, they frequently encounter discrimination or are offered low-paying positions even if they have extensive work histories at responsible jobs.  Further,  SSA regulations limit the number of hours they can work before losing benefits and medical coverage.           The truth is that my success is not a miracle but a lot of hard      work--harder than it needs to be.  The work incentives in place now      rarely produce a person like me.  My brothers and sisters struggle      daily.  They want to be productive, but they're stuck.  Why?  Because      no one knows how to gradually get out of the system.   (Vicki Smith)      Bernice Loschen testified about another barrier facing people labeled with psychiatric disabilities when they seek employment.           Because when you work, if you have a co-pay...you have to pay a      co-pay on your medicines.  You don't make enough to pay for your      medicines.  You don't make enough to pay for your medical care.         (Bernice Loschen)      Effective July 1, 1999, people with some disabilities who receive SSDI now can earn as much as $700 without losing benefits.  This is the first increase in 10 years.  But people who are blind can earn as much as $1,100 each month before losing their benefits.  Several people testified that this inequality is unfair.           Return-to-work and employment programs contain disincentives      that force persons willing to work to remain on entitlement      programs.   (Sharon Frieler)      People who receive SSI are penalized for anything that they earn over $65 in one month.  NCD heard numerous calls for reforms of SSA and welfare regulations to promote, enhance, and support employment for people with disabilities.    Lucy Kim, the administrative coordinator at the Center for Urban Community Services in New York, who herself successfully transitioned from SSI/SSDI to work, recommended that health benefits continue until an individual obtains employment that provides full medical coverage, adding that the length of time could vary, depending on how long it takes to acquire medical benefits.  Kim also recommended that employment and vocational services be conveniently located in shelters and community-based programs where other services are provided, noting that she was inspired to seek employment by a sign she read in a homeless shelter.  She also testified that day treatment should focus more on employment and meaningful activity, and noted the many barriers that prevent people labeled with psychiatric disabilities from returning to work successfully.           The internal obstacles are low self-esteem, lack of work      experience, fear of maintaining psychiatric stability while under an      enormous amount of stress starting a new job, and fear of losing      benefits.  Some of the external obstacles are losing Medicaid, which      enabled me to function.  And, I had to lie, basically, to keep my      Medicaid benefits in the transitional period.  And also, I feel the      SSI two-for-one earning scale is a disincentive.   (Lucy Kim)      People who are both homeless and mentally ill face numerous barriers in obtaining services that help them obtain permanent housing and work.  The Task Force on Homelessness described barriers to services in its 1992 report:           People who are severely mentally ill and homeless require an      extremely broad array of resources and services--including housing,      food, clothing, health and mental health care, treatment of alcohol      and other drug abuse, and psychosocial and vocational rehabi      litation.  Yet in more communities of any size, they must negotiate      an extraordinarily complex and disconnected set of bureaucracies to      obtain access to these services.  (Outcasts on Main Street:  Report of the Federal Task Force on Homelessness and Severe Mental Illness, DHHS, 1992.)      The Task Force recommends that service providers break traditional molds of providing services by meeting and engaging homeless people on their own terms and on their own turf.    Despite the many barriers, however, some people persevere and succeed.           I filled out a zillion forms, and so did my boss, and so did my      former mental health providers, but I'm completely off the system, and      glad to be.   (Xenia Williams)      Ellen Lawson, a P&A attorney in Buffalo, testified that the current body of work incentives and other rules governing how employment affects Social Security benefits is so complex that very few SSA personnel truly understand them.  Lawson recommended rules that are easier for SSA personnel to administer and easily understood by recipients and service providers.  She also suggested that Social Security and SSI rules be made uniform.           There should be a parallel set of rules for both Social Security      and SSI.  Often, in reading through the provisions, I wonder why      there are such profound differences, and that provisions are so much      more liberal in some cases for SSI, a poverty-based program.  The      rules should apply equally regardless of disability, apply equally to      applicants and recipients, and apply equally regardless of what state      a person resides in.  Uniformity would eliminate much of the current      complexity.   (Ellen Lawson)      One advocate questioned why only 243 Plans for Achieving Self Sufficiency (PASS), a Social Security work incentive program, were written in the entire country in 1997.  A PASS allows people with disabilities who are SSI recipients to set aside income and/or resources for a specified period of time to achieve a work goal. Because writing a plan is so complex, and many providers and Social Security workers are unfamiliar with them, PASS remains an extremely underutilized method of helping people return to work.    Discrimination in hiring against people labeled with psychiatric disabilities continues to be a pervasive problem.  On June 4, 1999, President Clinton directed OPM to ensure that the Federal Government has the same hiring and promotion standards for people labeled with psychiatric disabilities as it has for people with other disabilities.  Although this directive was a step in the right direction, it does not guarantee that the numbers of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities in the federal workforce will increase.  In general, federal employment of people with disabilities has never achieved employment objectives.    Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (P.L. 93-112, as amended by P.L. 99-5061) requires agencies, departments, and instrumentalities of the executive branch of the Federal Government to submit to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) annual accomplishment reports and affirmative action program plan updates for the hiring, placement, and advancement of people with disabilities.  The Federal Government defines targeted disabilities as ""deafness, blindness, missing extremities, partial paralysis, convulsive disorders, mental retardation, mental illness, and distortion of limbs and/or spine.""  In FY 1997, EEOC reports that people with severe disabilities represented only 1.16 percent of the total federal workforce--a figure far below the estimated 5.95 percent availability of people in the United States with targeted disabilities who were of workforce age and seeking employment.    Pam Olson, a mental health professional who also has experienced recurrent mental illness, testified that she naively expected ADA to protect her when she became ill.  At the time she informed her employer about her depression, she had more than 20 years experience as a school psychologist and a classroom teacher and had always received positive evaluations.  Olson testified that she allowed her employer to contact her therapist, assuming this would help her obtain the accommodations she needed.  Instead, she was subjected to harassment, falsely accused of dishonesty, stalking, and intimidating others--none of which occurred.  Her employer had rated her unsatisfactory in many areas, which were actually symptoms of her illness.    When her internal complaints of discrimination were ignored, Olsen filed suit in 1995.  The court determined that she was not disabled and that she did not qualify for protection under ADA, because she was still able to perform her job--despite her unsatisfactory rating.  The court also determined that ADA did not apply, because she could perform other jobs in a number of other areas.  She states ADA provides little to no protection for those with psychiatric conditions, and that employers and the courts are unfamiliar with the law.           I believe the courts, at this time, are perpetuating the stigmas      and misunderstandings of mental illness rather than combating them.      The burden of proof that must be met to prove mental disability under      ADA sets an impossible standard.   (Pam Olson)      There is also a continuing problem of people who are forced to work with little or no  compensation.  In all 50 states, many institutions use patient workers to perform tasks for no salary or at a salary below the minimum wage.  Sheltered workshops in the community also routinely pay less than minimum wage.  The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) simply requires an employer to obtain a subminimum wage certificate from the regional office of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) Wage and Hour Division.  Data obtained from DOL on June 21, 1999, reveal that some 511 public and private institutions obtained certificates to use 27,395 people as patient workers--a marked increase since 1996, when only 374 institutions used 14,482 patient workers.  This increase may be attributed to the fact that institutions no longer are required to report the total number of hours worked by patient workers, or financial information such as wages.  As a result, it is difficult for DOL to monitor FLSA violations.    Sheltered workshops, transitional employment programs, programs that use job coaches, and similar programs commonly treat people labeled with psychiatric disabilities differently from other workers, particularly in the area of wages.  Real work, in integrated settings with the same wages and benefits as nondisabled workers, remains tantalizingly out of reach for many participants in ""work readiness"" programs.    Perhaps the most egregious violations against people labeled with psychiatric disabilities occur in the area of civil rights.  Despite the provisions of ADA and other civil rights laws and the protections afforded under the due process and equal protection clauses of the U.S. Constitution, people testifying describe incident after incident in which the civil rights of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities were repeatedly violated or disregarded.           Right now, in this country and virtually every country in the      world...by virtue of our diagnosis, by virtue of our label, we don't      have the same rights that other people have.  We can be put into      institutions because a doctor says we need to be there.  There's      usually some sort of court procedure, but it's not real due process.      And until that changes, we're going to continue to be second-class      citizens.   (Judi Chamberlin)      Several laws address various aspects of civil rights protections for people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.  CRIPA authorizes the U.S. Attorney General to investigate conditions of confinement at state and local government institutions such as prisons, jails, pretrial detention centers, juvenile correctional facilities, and publicly operated nursing homes, as well as institutions for people with psychiatric and developmental disabilities.  This law covers systemic conditions that could seriously jeopardize the health and safety of residents in institutions.  Isolated incidents of abuse cannot be investigated under CRIPA.    The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 1975 (the DD Act) and the Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act of 1986 (PAIMI) were enacted to protect the human and civil rights of people with disabilities in institutions.  The DD Act and PAIMI provide a congressionally mandated nationwide network of protection and advocacy services.  In 1994, Congress provided full funding for the Protection and Advocacy for Individual Rights (PAIR) program, which was established in 1978 but never funded under the Rehabilitation Act.  The PAIR program provides P&A services to all people with disabilities who are not in institutions.  However, many PAIMI programs have not aggressively pursued their original mandate.  One such program, for example, claimed to have ""served"" 66 persons in a six-month period (the mere providing of a program brochure being counted as providing a service).  The level of activism of P&A programs continues to vary dramatically among the states.    Unlike other Americans, many people labeled with psychiatric disabilities are denied their civil rights because federal laws fail to protect them.  Involuntary commitment to a mental health facility can be ordered by a court, a physician, or a legally authorized mental health practitioner, depending on local laws, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  Police are often called upon to pick up people labeled with psychiatric disabilities for involuntary commitment.  This is seen by many people labeled with psychiatric disabilities as a denial of their basic citizenship rights.           I knew she and I did not live in the United States, and we're      not citizens of that country.  We lived in the gray area where we      could be arrested and incarcerated in all but name for being      dangerous.   (Laura Ziegler)         Because of a few dramatic episodes sometimes involving persons      with a psychiatric diagnosis, all of us who have a diagnosis are made      to face forfeit of our civil liberties.   (Joseph Walsh)      Joe Young testified that when one of his institutionalized clients called 911 for help, he was promptly moved from a cottage and full grounds privileges into a locked ward and involuntarily administered Lithium.  When deaths and incidents of abuse occur in institutions, P&A organizations have difficulty accessing records about the incidents.  Essentially, many institutions self-investigate crimes and may even compromise evidence that could be used in criminal proceedings.           These are some of the reasons that these institutions have to be      monitored, and the Federal Government should stop subsidizing the      unnecessary confinement of persons in the institutions.  (Joe Young)      According to information provided by DOJ, as of June 15, 1999, DOJ's Special Litigation Section is investigating mental health services in 65 health care and correctional facilities.  It is also monitoring remedial settlements involving mental health services in 128 health care and correction facilities and hundreds of community placements from facilities under court orders.  DOJ states that since 1993 the Section has investigated mental health services and monitored remedial settlements to improve mental health services in over 300 health care and correctional facilities in more than 42 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Territory of Guam.         As a result of the Section's efforts, tens of thousands of      persons with mental illness are now receiving adequate services. (Special Litigation Section, U.S. Department of Justice, June 25, 1999.)    Nonetheless, NCD heard again and again how helpless and powerless people felt in treatment settings.           Patients are routinely coerced into forfeiting their rights in      the name of treatment and, in general, the system is structured to      render consent meaningless.   (Diana Rickard)      Walsh testified that inpatient commitment in New York State is achieved with the systematic participation of New York State Mental Hygiene Legal Services (MHLS).           MHLS, originally intended as a legal advocacy service, has      become a rubber stamp for doctors' orders for involuntary      commitment.  First, the doctor requests a judge to impose an      involuntary commitment order.  Invariably, a judge grants the      doctor's request.  When advocacy is requested by the subject of the      commitment order, MHLS responds that they cannot or will not      challenge the judge's order.  The judge won't challenge the doctor;      MHLS won't challenge the judge.  Doctors' orders for commitment [are]      facilitated with the appearance of due process.  The state has      therefore created an apparatus to create the illusion of due process.       (Joseph Walsh)      Like other elements of the mental health system, advocacy services and rights protection are also implemented without major participation by people labeled with psychiatric disabilities themselves, leading to an often paternalistic attitude of ""best interests"" rather than paying attention to what people want for themselves.  Advocacy services need to become accountable to the people they serve.    Virtually nothing has been done at the local or federal level to protect people with disabilities who are victimized in institutions and in their communities.           Until recently, the crime victims' movement has not worked      systematically to identify issues and challenges involved in      responding more effectively to victims with disabilities.  Improving      service delivery to people with disabilities must become a priority,      because the crime victims' rights movement is founded on the premise      that every crime victim deserves fundamental justice and      comprehensive, quality services.  (U.S. DOJ Office for Victims of Crime, OVC  Bulletin:  Working with Victims of Crime with Disabilities, September 1998.)      The  OVC Bulletin  cites a survey by Dick Sobsey, R.N., Ed.D., indicating that 48.1 percent of the perpetrators of sexual abuse against people with disabilities had gained access to their victims through disability services.   OVC Bulletin  notes that people who are victimized are vulnerable to exacerbated suffering.  Also, most victims will experience a sense of shock, disbelief, or denial that the crime occurred, often followed by cataclysmic emotions, including fear, anger, confusion, guilt, humiliation, and grief.  People with disabilities, however, may have intensified reactions because they may already feel stigmatized and often have low self-esteem due to societal attitudes.    Unlike most  OVC Bulletins  focusing on special categories of victims,  Working with Victims of Crime with Disabilities  offers no authoritative ""census"" describing the numbers and characteristics of the victim population under review, because--again--no authoritative data currently exist.  The  Bulletin  does cite several studies, including one published in the  American Journal of Psychiatry , that revealed that 81 percent of psychiatric inpatients had been physically or sexually assaulted at some point in their lives.  The Colorado Department of Health estimates that upward of 85 percent of women with disabilities are victims of domestic abuse, in comparison with, on average, 25 to 50 percent of the general population.  These statistics, which have been replicated in many states, call into question the ""brain disease"" model of mental illness, indicating that trauma, not disordered brain chemistry, explains many emotional reactions.    Tina Minckowitz, a representative of the Brooklyn Mental Hygiene Court Monitoring Project, expressed concern that due process hearings prior to involuntary commitment do not protect people's rights.           In New York, as in probably most other states now, they have      to--they're supposed to--go through a court hearing before they can      drug you by force, unless they consider it an emergency.  And      basically 90 percent of the time--99 percent of the time--the psychia      trists get to do what they want.  So the hearings are not giving      people protection against forced drugging.   (Tina Minckowitz)      Minckowitz testified that emergency forced drugging is extremely abused and that people are force-drugged in institutions because they speak up for their rights or because they speak up when they see another patient or inmate being abused.    According to testimony, funding and resource limitations are leaving vulnerable people labeled with psychiatric disabilities unprotected.  Lawson, who has worked in the PAIMI program for 12 years, testified that more people are eligible for PAIMI services, but current funding levels prohibit this.  As a part-time attorney who is assisted by two other part-time staff, she must cover a 15-county region in western New York, encompassing two cities and a number of rural areas.  Because of such staffing and funding limitations, Lawson stated that a three-hour drive to interview one client is not unusual.  If funding were higher, she testified, they could move quickly and expediently to protect the rights of their clients.    Psychiatrist and psychiatric survivor Daniel Fisher testified that the label of mental illness should not deprive people of their fundamental constitutional rights.           What happens in a country, as it happened in Nazi Germany, when      people who are labeled as fundamentally different and flawed, as our      biological psychiatry model does, the next step can be the      deprivation of rights, forced treatment, and gradual extermination.      I hope that we recognize that it could happen in any country.  We      should make sure that there's due process of law protection, so if      somebody is hospitalized or in the psychiatric system, they have      access to legal advocates.   (Daniel Fisher)      People labeled with psychiatric disabilities can be subjected to research with little legal oversight. Written testimony submitted by Cliff Zucker, the executive director of Disability Advocates, Incorporated (DAI), which provides P&A services for persons with psychiatric disabilities in New York State, outlined his agency's court challenges to nontherapeutic and risky experiments conducted in state psychiatric facilities on those incapable of giving informed consent.  The result has been an invalidation by the courts of research regulations of the state Office of Mental Health and a move by the state Department of Health to convene an advisory committee to devise new guidelines for non-federally funded psychiatric research.    Zucker reported that institutional review boards (IRBs) that oversee and approve medical experiments are under pressure to sanction risky research on those who cannot give informed consent and that it is unlikely that many who fully understand the risks would agree to participate without seeing a direct, personal medical benefit.           Leading psychiatrists and a high-ranking official at the state      Psychiatric Institute in Manhattan, the state clearinghouse for drug      research on kids and adults, have been lining their pockets with      hefty drug-company speaking fees, consulting deals, board m      emberships, and subsidized international trips, state records show.      Two members of the Psychiatric Institute in-house panel directly      responsible for protecting the rights of mentally ill patients have      financial ties to drug mega-firms like Eli Lilly, Glaxo Wellcome, and      Bristol-Myers Squibb.  The drug makers, while enriching the      psychiatrists, are also picking up the tab for research at the      Psychiatric Institute, where their products are tested for treatment      of such ailments as depression, hyperactivity, and schizophrenia.      Drug-company-funded studies are often led by the same researchers who      have private money deals with the firms.       (Analyze This:  Docs Get Drug Company $$ by Gregg Birnbaum and      Douglas Montero, The New York Post, February 28, 1999.)      Zucker also cautioned that people from minority communities are especially vulnerable to becoming research subjects.  In the infamous experiments conducted in New York, in which young boys were given doses of fenfluramine, a procedure without any potential therapeutic benefit, he notes that all of the subjects were either African Americans or Latino Americans.    The understaffed and underfunded federal Office of Protection from Research Risks (OPRR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services investigates federally funded research programs involving human research subjects to ensure compliance with the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (also known as the Common Rule).  However, the Common Rule only applies to subjects in research regulated by the FDA and to subjects in research sponsored by some federal other agencies.  Privately funded research is not covered by the Common Rule, so there are no protections for human beings who participate in this research.    Joseph Glazer, of the Mental Health Association in New York State, summarized discrimination against people labeled with psychiatric disabilities and violations of their civil liberties.           Having laws on the books that say people can't vote if they are      mentally incompetent--or, in some states, ""lunatics""--is discrimination.  Having laws on the books that say a diagnosis of mental illness is sufficient grounds to take your children away in a family court proceeding is discrimination.  Having laws sweeping across the country that say that it's okay to put violent sexual predators in state psychiatric hospitals with vulnerable people, who have in many cases already been victimized by such predators, is discrimination.   (Joseph Glazer)      Glazer concluded that mental health advocates must fight discrimination everywhere they find it.    Ziegler testified graphically as to the way in which the lives of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities are devalued.           A friend of my family had a child with Prader-Willi syndrome      [which causes an uncontrollable desire to eat] who was      institutionalized.  She was struck and killed by a car while crossing      [a highway] in search of food.  When I asked him how his damages actio      n was progressing, he said it wasn't.  He said all the lawyers had      told him that her life had no value.  That was the term the Nazis      used to justify the killing of people with disabilities.  It seems we      have not come very far after all.   (Laura Ziegler)           Debbie Whittle testified to the power of perception and labels in defining the reality and experience of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.  She grew up in a family with two active alcoholics--a chaotic, unstable, unsafe environment that was marked by abuse and neglect.  As a teenager, she experienced incest for several years and at age 17 left home, thinking she could just simply walk away and create a new life for herself.  She did not realize, however, that the abuse and neglect had traumatized her so badly that she had disconnected from her own body, knowledge, wisdom, truth, and her capacity to self-heal.           There is a high correlation between trauma histories and the      experience of being psychiatrically labeled.  There are some common      responses to trauma.  It is common, when experiencing trauma, for a      person to become numb, leave their body.  Disassociate.  It is      incredible to me that these very coping strategies that kept folks      alive are then called a disorder.  It is absolutely amazing to me      that our psyche has the ability to have us leave our bodies when our      bodies are being tortured.  That seems rather sane to me.  Who would      choose to stay in their body and experience that?  And then, the      first thing that happens when those folks show up for help is,      they're called--they're told that they have disassociative disorder,      instead of saying, ""You have this wonderful capacity that has kept      you sane and whole and alive.""  I would just like to suggest that we      move away from a pathology-based mental health system that seems kind      of like an oxymoron to me.  I believe that the label of mental      illness is the beginning of human rights violations.  Healing is hard      enough work without it being pathologized.   (Debbie Whittle)      ADA has been of only limited benefit to people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.  Although all people with disabilities have experienced some backlash as a result of ADA (which is viewed by some not as a civil rights law but as an entitlement law), in general, some progress has been made over the past few years.  However, people labeled with psychiatric disabilities have seen little improvement.  In fact, widely publicized reports of violent crimes by people labeled with psychiatric disabilities, although they are statistically rare, have precipitated stronger and more prevalent prejudice, which extends to the vast majority of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities who are nonviolent and law-abiding.    Negative stereotypes about people labeled with psychiatric disabilities are widely perpetuated by the media, which frequently seize on crimes involving people labeled with psychiatric disabilities and overreact.  Unfortunately, such media reports harm and stigmatize the millions of other people labeled with psychiatric disabilities who do not commit crimes.           Because of a few dramatic episodes sometimes involving persons      with a psychiatric diagnosis, all of us who have a diagnosis are made      to face forfeiture of our civil liberties.   (Joseph Walsh)      Patrick Smellie's research for his report on the news media's coverage of mental illness revealed crime reporters fall into the trap of ignorance in portraying suspects.  Feeding Stereotypes was published in the March/April 1999 issue of Quill, the publication of the Society of Professional Journalists.  Although Smellie found mainstream American news reports involving mental illness restrained compared with those in Australia and Britain, he cautions that he is not endorsing the American news media coverage.           Rather, it suggests something subtler:  that the relentless      framing of mental illness in the context of violence and criminality      is amplifying, sustaining, and legitimizing a largely false picture      of mental ill-health.   (Mental Illness Coverage:  Feeding Stereotypes by Patrick Smellie, Quill, March/April 1999.)      George Ebert of the Mental Patients Liberation Alliance in New York State echoed the opinions of most people who testified.           I would just like to offer our working platform.  The first      point is that we speak for ourselves.  Next is, we seek an end to      forced treatment of any kind.  We seek full access to community      support, advocates, and legal assistants in all involvement with the      mental health system.  We call for access to holistic alternatives to      the medical model monopoly of mental health services.  We seek an end      to destructive psychiatric labels, and we demand accountability from      the psychiatric system.   (George Ebert)        Public Policy Recommendations    Reinventing Social Security.    Simplify SSA disability regulations.  SSA's redesign process should include uniform standards for SSI and SSDI program disability determinations, work incentives, and equitable earning amounts during trial work periods, regardless of program eligibility or disability.    SSA should provide ongoing training for its agency personnel, as well as beneficiaries and service providers, on available work incentive programs, including how to write a PASS plan.    Social Security establishes earnings limits for people with disabilities, except for people with visual impairments whose earnings limits are established by law, and at a much higher rate than for other people with disabilities.  When federal law permits such discrimination, it is egregious.    Congress should enact legislation that makes earnings limits equal--regardless of disability.    HCFA should revise existing regulations to simplify the Medicaid waiver application process for states.    Many people indicate that a lack of affordable health care is a major disincentive to returning to work.    Federal law should be changed to allow continuation of Medicaid and Medicare coverage until equal or better health benefits--including voluntary mental health parity and prescription drug coverage--are available through an employer.    The Federal Government should ensure greater coordination at the federal, state, and local levels in the delivery of services to people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.    Congress should amend the FLSA and eliminate the provision for patient workers and other provisions that allow people with disabilities to work without compensation or at below the minimum wage.    DOL should revise applications for certificates of exemption and all other reporting documents to request such information as the number of hours each individual worked, number of people who worked, and the hourly wage paid to each person.    Without this information it is impossible to monitor these programs.    Information about successful model employment programs should be quickly disseminated and shared among agencies, task forces, committees, and others concerned with employment of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.    In addition, Congress should fund additional demonstration projects that investigate employment of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.    The Federal Government should strive to be the model employer of people with disabilities.  Congress should investigate why the Federal Government has consistently failed to recruit, retain, and promote more people with disabilities.    This investigation should identify existing barriers and make recommendations on the employment and promotion of people with disabilities in all branches of the Federal Government, including Congress. Federal forms should be screened to ensure that questions pertaining to psychiatric disabilities do not violate existing laws.    EEOC should penalize federal agencies that discriminate or fail to comply with existing provisions of all federal laws, including reporting requirements. Congress should increase funding for EEOC and DOJ ADA-related training for employers and the judicial system.    ADA employment-related technical assistance and training for employers and also the judicial system are essential to ensure that people labeled with psychiatric disabilities are not discriminated against in the workplace or when they take employment cases to the court.    Human research subjects should be protected.    The National Animal Welfare Act of 1966 protects animals who are used in research, but no federal law extends those same rights to people who are decisionally incapacitated.  In early 1999, the National Institute of Mental Health halted several research projects because they failed to give adequate protection to their human subjects.    Congress should enact strong federal laws that protect all human research subjects--especially people who are incapacitated and children--involved in federally as well as privately funded research.  These laws should require, prior to participation in research programs, signed informed consent forms that are obtained without coercion and clearly state any possible adverse events that could result from participation in the research.  The law should provide strict penalties for research facilities that fail to comply.    Protect the civil rights of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.    Congressional hearings should be held on civil rights violations against people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.    Prosecute persons, institutions, or entities that violate due process, durable power of attorney, advance directives, and informed consent rights of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.    Vigorous federal enforcement of civil rights laws such as ADA and other laws that protect the rights of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities is essential.    In addition, Congress should increase funding for federal technical assistance programs and to ensure enforcement of existing laws.    Congress should increase funding for protection and advocacy organizations to accommodate the increased workload.    Current funding levels do not adequately cover enforcement of laws that protect the civil rights of people with disabilities.  With the elimination of state funding for prison legal service agencies, it is essential that P&A services are available to people labeled with psychiatric disabilities in correctional facilities.  However, P&A organizations must be held accountable to their constituencies and meaningfully involve people labeled with psychiatric disabilities in programs and policymaking and as paid staff, including in management positions.    Establish local, accessible, 24-hour emergency assistance networks for people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.    Such networks could be operated using existing victim assistance programs that have trained staff and volunteers or that have significant numbers of people with a variety of disabilities on staff or as volunteers.    People labeled with psychiatric disabilities should not be denied their constitutional right to vote simply because of their disability or the type of facility in which they are receiving treatment.    Therefore, Congress should enact a federal law protecting the voting rights of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.    Federal research and demonstration resources should place a higher priority on the development of culturally appropriate alternatives to the medical and biochemical approaches to treatment of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities, including self-help, peer support, and other consumer/survivor-driven alternatives to the traditional mental health system.    Currently, federal funding for psychiatric research is concentrated almost entirely on medical and biochemical approaches.  Only a tiny fraction of research funding is directed toward programs of community support, and even less is directed toward peer support and other self-help approaches.  This imbalance is only one of the reasons that such approaches receive less funding and are often funded only as time-limited demonstration projects, despite their considerable record of success and despite the fact that they tend to be favored by people labeled with psychiatric disabilities themselves.    Further, Congress should amend statutes regarding the review of grant applications for psychiatric research to ensure that people labeled with psychiatric disabilities are included in meaningful ways in the review process.    Employment and training and vocational rehabilitation programs must account for the wide range of abilities, skills, knowledge, and experience of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities by administering programs that are highly individualized and responsive to the abilities, preferences, and personal goals of program participants.    The successful components of employment demonstration programs should be implemented while identified weakness should be strengthened.  Also, information about successful programs should be disseminated and shared among agencies, task forces, committees, and others concerned with employment of people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.    HCFA should revise existing regulations to make it easier for states to apply for Medicaid waivers under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 for people with disabilities who return to work.    People labeled with psychiatric disabilities must be included in significant numbers in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of employment programs.  It is essential that employment and training programs span the full range of employment options, rather than segregating people labeled with psychiatric disabilities in low-wage positions with few opportunities for advancement, or in segregated ""make-work"" programs.    Currently, many people labeled with psychiatric disabilities who already have advanced degrees or considerable high-level employment experience are actively discouraged from returning to their previous type and level of employment, and are shunted into programs far below their level of interest or skill.           In Conclusion    Americans with psychiatric disabilities believe--and this report confirms--that they are denied the self-determination necessary to control their own lives.  Currently, politically and financially powerful forces oppose any consumer/survivor change to the existing mental health system.  However, the system  must  change, and America must respond.  Deprivation of human and civil rights cannot be tolerated in a country that was founded on the premise that everyone is created equal.  The term ""liberty and justice for all"" must be underscored and applied for people labeled with psychiatric disabilities.

The overall purpose of NCD is to promote policies, programs, practices, and procedures that guarantee equal opportunity for all individuals with disabilities, regardless of the nature or severity of the disability; and to empower individuals with disabilities to achieve economic self-sufficiency, independent living, and inclusion and integration into all aspects of society.    Specific Duties    The current statutory mandate of NCD includes the following:      Reviewing and evaluating, on a continuing basis, policies, programs,        practices, and procedures concerning individuals with disabilities        conducted or assisted by federal departments and agencies, including        programs established or assisted under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,        as amended, or under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill        of Rights Act; as well as all statutes and regulations pertaining to        federal programs that assist such individuals with disabilities, in        order to assess the effectiveness of such policies, programs,        practices, procedures, statutes, and regulations in meeting the needs        of individuals with disabilities.    Reviewing and evaluating, on a continuing basis, new and emerging        disability policy issues affecting individuals with disabilities at the        federal, state, and local levels and in the private sector, including        the need for and coordination of adult services, access to personal        assistance services, school reform efforts and the impact of such        efforts on individuals with disabilities, access to health care, and        policies that act as disincentives for individuals to seek and retain        employment.    Making recommendations to the President, Congress, the secretary of        education, the director of the National Institute on Disability and        Rehabilitation Research, and other officials of federal agencies about        ways to better promote equal opportunity, economic self-sufficiency,        independent living, and inclusion and integration into all aspects of        society for Americans with disabilities.    Providing Congress, on a continuing basis, with advice,        recommendations, legislative proposals, and any additional information        that NCD or Congress deems appropriate.    Gathering information about the implementation, effectiveness, and        impact of the  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101        et seq.).    Advising the President, Congress, the commissioner of the        Rehabilitation Services Administration, the assistant secretary for        Special Education and Rehabilitative Services within the Department of        Education, and the director of the National Institute on Disability and        Rehabilitation Research on the development of the programs to be        carried out under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.    Providing advice to the commissioner with respect to the policies and        conduct of the Rehabilitation Services Administration.    Making recommendations to the director of the National Institute on        Disability and Rehabilitation Research on ways to improve research;        service; administration, and the collection, dissemination, and        implementation of research findings affecting persons with disabilities.    Providing advice regarding priorities for the activities of the        Interagency Disability Coordinating Council and reviewing the        recommendations of this council for legislative and administrative        changes to ensure that such recommendations are consistent with NCD's        purpose of  promoting the full integration, independence, and        productivity of individuals with disabilities.    Preparing and submitting to the President and Congress an annual        report titled National Disability Policy:  A Progress Report.      International    In 1995, NCD was designated by the Department of State to be the U.S. government's official contact point for disability issues.  Specifically, NCD interacts with the special rapporteur of the United Nations Commission for Social Development on disability matters.    Consumers Served and Current Activities    While many government agencies deal with issues and programs affecting people with disabilities, NCD is the only federal agency charged with addressing, analyzing, and making recommendations on issues of public policy that affect people with disabilities regardless of age, disability type, perceived employment potential, economic need, specific functional ability, status as a veteran, or other individual circumstance.  NCD recognizes its unique opportunity to facilitate independent living, community integration, and employment opportunities for people with disabilities by ensuring an informed and coordinated approach to addressing the concerns of persons with disabilities and eliminating barriers to their active participation in community and family life.    NCD plays a major role in developing disability policy in America.  In fact, it was NCD that originally proposed what eventually became the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  NCD's present list of key issues includes improving personal assistance services, promoting health care reform, including students with disabilities in high-quality programs in typical neighborhood schools, promoting equal employment and community housing opportunities, monitoring the implementation of ADA, improving assistive technology, and ensuring that persons with disabilities who are members of minority groups fully participate in society.    Statutory History    NCD was initially established in 1978 as an advisory board within the Department of Education (Public Law 95-602).  The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1984 (Public Law 98-221) transformed NCD into an independent agency.

GX246-69-1172582	Libraries         Passed     HB465         Libraries; terms of local library boards.  Provides that a local governing body may alter the composition of its library board to create staggered terms of service in which the same number of terms expire annually. The bill provides the mechanism to achieve this goal if desired by a local governing body.     Patron - Davies     HB822         State Librarian.  Changes the title of State Librarian to Librarian of Virginia. Appointed by the Library Board, the Librarian appoints assistants, approves the appointments of other employees, requests appropriations, and approves expenditures of funds of The Library of Virginia.     Patron - Murphy          Carried  Over     HB348         Public libraries; information infrastructure access; penalties.  Places limitations on public library patron access to the Internet and other components of the electronic information infrastructure. It is not applicable to libraries in public or private elementary or secondary schools. The bill requires juveniles to be accompanied by (i) parents or guardians, or (ii) a responsible adult, teacher or librarian with the express permission of such juveniles' parents or guardians, when using public library computers furnishing unrestricted access to the information infrastructure. Additionally, library computers with such unrestricted access must be placed in restricted library areas physically separate from areas in which juveniles are permitted unaccompanied by adults. The bill further stipulates that libraries with computers furnishing unrestricted information infrastructure access must also provide juveniles access to separate computers providing information infrastructure access, but limiting that access to resources and sites free (to extent technically feasible) from materials harmful to juveniles, child pornography, and obscene materials. The bill also prohibits the access, display or reproduction by library patrons, via the information infrastructure, of materials harmful to juveniles, obscene materials or child pornography in any library area from which juveniles are not excluded. Additionally, library patrons are prohibited from accessing, displaying or reproducing obscene materials or child pornography via the information infrastructure in any library area. Violations of these provisions are punishable as (i) Class 1 misdemeanors if the materials obtained are materials harmful to juveniles or obscene materials, or (ii) Class 5 felonies if the materials obtained constitute child pornography. Public libraries receiving any state funding are required by this bill to obtain computer hardware and software inhibiting library patron access via library computers to obscene materials and child pornography. All public libraries are required to develop guidelines designed to prevent potential sexual harassment of library employees via a hostile workplace created by library patron access, display or reproduction of sexually explicit materials on library premises. Public libraries are also required by this bill to develop and implement guidelines for library patron information infrastructure access via library computers designed to (i) inhibit library patron access to obscene materials and child pornography, (ii) ensure patron compliance with the provisions of this bill, and (iii) ensure prompt reporting to law-enforcement authorities of patron violations of this bill's criminal provisions. The guidelines must be implemented not later than January 1, 1999, for existing libraries, and within six months of their establishment for any new library facilities opened thereafter. Finally, the bill provides civil and criminal immunity to library staff furnishing information about library patron violations of this provisions of this act, when such reports are made in good faith and upon reasonable belief.

Preliminary Statement This case challenges an act of Congress that makes the use of filtering software by publiclibraries a condition of the receipt of federal funding. The Internet, as is well known,isa vast, interactive medium based on a decentralized network of computers aroundtheworld. Its most familiar feature is the World Wide Web (the ""Web""), a networkof computers known as servers that provide content to users. The Internet provideseasy access to anyone who wishes to provide or distribute information to a worldwideaudience; it is used by more than 143 million Americans. Indeed, much of the world'sknowledge accumulated over centuries is available to Internet users almost instantly. Approximately 10% of the Americans who use the Internet access it at public libraries. And approximately 95% of all public libraries in the United States provide publicaccess to the Internet. While the beneficial effect of the Internet in expanding the amount of information availableto its users is self-evident, its low entry barriers have also led to a perverse resultfacilitation of the widespread dissemination of hardcore pornography within the easy reach not only of adults who have every right to access it (so long as it is not legally obsceneorchild pornography), but also of children and adolescents to whom it may be quiteharmful. The volume of pornography on the Internet is huge, and the record before usdemonstrates that public library patrons of all ages, many from ages 11 to 15, have regularly sought to access it in public library settings. There are more than 100,000  4   pornographic Web sites that can beaccessed for free and without providing any registration information, and tens of thousands of Web sites contain child pornography. Libraries have reacted to this situation by utilizing a number of means designed to insurethat patrons avoid illegal (and unwanted) content while also enabling patrons to findthecontent they desire. Some libraries have trained patrons in how to use the Internetwhile avoiding illegal content, or have directed their patrons to ""preferred"" Web sitesthatlibrarians have reviewed. Other libraries have utilized such devices as recessing thecomputer monitors, installing privacy screens, and monitoring implemented by a ""tap ontheshoulder"" of patrons perceived to be offending library policy. Still others, viewing theforegoing approaches as inadequate or uncomfortable (some librarians do not wish to confrontpatrons), have purchased commercially available software that blocks certain categoriesof material deemed by the library board as unsuitable for use in their facilities. Indeed,7% of American public libraries use blocking software for adults. Although such programsare somewhat effective in blocking large quantities of pornography, they are bluntinstruments that not only ""underblock,"" i.e., fail to block access to substantial amountsof content that the library boards wish to exclude, but also, central to this litigation,""overblock,"" i.e., block access to large quantities of material that library boards donotwish to exclude and that is constitutionally protected. Most of the libraries that use filtering software seek to block sexually explicit speech. While most libraries include in their physical collection copies of volumes such  5   as TheJoyof Sex and The Joy of Gay Sex, which contain quite explicit photographs and descriptions, filtering software blocks large quantities of other, comparable information abouthealth and sexuality that adults and teenagers seek on the Web. One teenager testifiedthat the Internet access in a public library was the only venue in which she could obtaininformation important to her about her own sexuality. Another library patron witnessdescribed using the Internet to research breast cancer and reconstructive surgery forhismother who had breast surgery. Even though some filtering programs contain exceptionsfor health and education, the exceptions do not solve the problem of overblocking constitutionally protected material. Moreover, as we explain below, the filteringsoftware on which the parties presented evidence in this case overblocks not only information relating to health and sexuality that might be mistaken for pornography or erotica,but also vast numbers of Web pages and sites that could not even arguably be construedas harmful or inappropriate for adults or minors. The Congress, sharing the concerns of many library boards, enacted the Children's InternetProtection Act (""CIPA""), Pub. L. No. 106-554, which makes the use of filters by apubliclibrary a condition of its receipt of two kinds of subsidies that are important (or evencritical) to the budgets of many public libraries  grants under the Library Services andTechnology Act, 20 U.S.C.  9101 et seq. (""LSTA""), and so-called ""E-rate discounts"" forInternet access and support under the Telecommunications Act, 47 U.S.C.  254. LSTAgrant funds are awarded, inter alia, in order to: (1) assist libraries in accessing  6   information through electronic networks, and (2) provide targeted library and information servicesto persons having difficulty using a library and to underserved and rural communities, including children from families with incomes below the poverty line. Eratediscounts serve the similar purpose of extending Internet access to schools and librariesin low-income communities. CIPA requires that libraries, in order to receive LSTAfunds or E-rate discounts, certify that they are using a ""technology protection measure""that prevents patrons from accessing ""visual depictions"" that are ""obscene,"" ""childpornography,"" or in the caseof minors, ""harmful to minors."" 20 U.S.C.  9134(f)(1)(A) (LSTA); 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(B) & (C) (E-rate). The plaintiffs, a group of libraries, library associations, library patrons, and Web sitepublishers, brought this suit against the United States and others alleging that CIPA is facially unconstitutional because: (1) it induces public libraries to violate their patrons' FirstAmendment rights contrary to the requirements of South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203(1987); and (2) it requires libraries to relinquish their First Amendment rights as a conditionon the receipt of federal funds and is therefore impermissible under the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions. In arguing that CIPA will induce public libraries to  violate the First Amendment, the plaintiffs contend that given the limits of the filtering technology, CIPA's conditions effectively require libraries to impose content-based restrictions on their patrons' access to constitutionally protected speech. According to the plaintiffs, these content-based restrictions are subject to strict scrutiny under public  7   forum doctrine, see Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 837 (1995), and are therefore permissible only if they are narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest and no less restrictive alternatives would further that interest, see Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 874 (1997).1 The government responds that CIPA will not induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment, since it is possible for at least some public libraries to constitutionally comply with CIPA's conditions. Even if some libraries' use of filters might violate the First Amendment, the government submits that CIPA can be facially invalidated only if it is impossible for any public library to comply with its conditions without violating the First Amendment. Pursuant to CIPA, a three-judge Court was convened to try the issues. Pub. L. No. 106-554. Following an intensive period of discovery on an expedited schedule to allow publiclibraries to know whether they need to certify compliance with CIPA by July 1, 2002,toreceive subsidies for the upcoming year, the Court conducted an eight-day trial at whichweheard 20 witnesses, and received numerous depositions, stipulations and Plaintiffs advance three other alternative, independent grounds for holding CIPA facially invalid. First, they submit that even if CIPA will not induce public libraries to violatethe First Amendment, CIPA nonetheless imposes an unconstitutional condition on publiclibraries by requiring them to relinquish their own First Amendment rights to provideunfiltered Internet access as a condition on their receipt of federal funds. See infra n.36. Second, plaintiffs contend that CIPA is facially invalid because it effectsan impermissible prior restraint on speech by granting filtering companies and library staff unfettereddiscretion to suppress speech before it has been received by library patrons and beforeithas been subject to a judicial determination that it is unprotected under the First Amendment. See Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546, 558 (1975). Finally,plaintiffs submit that CIPAis unconstitutionally vague. See City of Chicagov. Morales,527 U.S. 41 (1999). 8 1   documents. The principal focus of the trial was on the capacity of currently available filteringsoftware. The plaintiffs adduced substantial evidence not only that filtering programsbar access to a substantial amount of speech on the Internet that is clearly constitutionally protected for adults and minors, but also that these programs are intrinsically unable to block only illegal Internet content while simultaneously allowing accesstoall protected speech. Asour extensive findings of fact reflect, the plaintiffs demonstrated that thousands of Webpages containing protected speech are wrongly blocked by the four leading filteringprograms, and these pagesrepresent only a fraction of Web pages wrongly blockedby the programs. The plaintiffs' evidence explained that the problems facedby themanufacturers and vendors of filtering software are legion. The Web is extremely dynamic,with an estimated 1.5 million new pages added every day and the contents of existingWeb pages changing very rapidly. The category lists maintained by the blocking programsare considered to be proprietary information, and hence are unavailable to customersor the general public for review, so that public libraries that select categories whenimplementing filtering software do not really know what they are blocking. There are many reasons why filtering software suffers from extensive over- and underblocking, which we will explain below in great detail. They center on the limitationson filtering companies' ability to: (1) accurately collect Web pages that potentially fall into a blocked category (e.g., pornography); (2) review and categorize  9   Webpages that they have collected; and (3) engage in regular re-review of Web pages thatthey have previously reviewed. These failures spring from constraints on the technology of automated classification systems, and the limitations inherent in human review,including error, misjudgment, and scarce resources, which we describe in detail infra at58-74. One failure of critical importance is that the automated systems that filteringcompanies use to collect Web pages for classification are able to search only text,notimages. This is crippling to filtering companies' ability to collect pages containing ""visual depictions"" that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors, asCIPArequires. As will appear, we find that it is currently impossible, given the Internet'ssize, rate of growth, rate of change, and architecture, and given the state of the artof automated classification systems, to develop a filter that neither underblocks nor overblocksa substantial amount of speech. The government, while acknowledging that the filtering software is imperfect, maintainsthat it is nonetheless quite effective, and that it successfully blocks the vast majority of the Web pages that meet filtering companies' category definitions (e.g., pornography). The government contends that no more is required. In its view, so long as thefiltering software selected by the libraries screens out the bulk of the Web pages proscribedby CIPA, the libraries have made a reasonable choice which suffices, under theapplicable legal principles, to pass constitutional muster in the context of a facial challenge. Central to the government's position is the analogy it advances between  10   Internetfiltering and the initial decision of a library to determine which materials to purchasefor its print collection. Public libraries have finite budgets and must make choicesasto whether to purchase, for example, books on gardening or books on golf. Suchcontent-based decisions, eventhe plaintiffs concede, are subject to rational basis reviewand not a stricter form of First Amendment scrutiny. In the government's view, thefactthat the Internet reverses the acquisition process and requires the libraries to, in effect,purchase the entire Internet, some of which (e.g., hardcore pornography) it does notwant,should not mean that it ischargeable with censorship when it filters out offendingmaterial. The legal context in which this extensive factual record is set is complex, implicating a number of constitutional doctrines, including the constitutional limitations onCongress's spending clause power, the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, and subsidiary to these issues, the First Amendment doctrines of prior restraint, vagueness, andoverbreadth. There are a number of potential entry points into the analysis, but the mostlogical is the spending clause jurisprudence in which the seminal case is South Dakotav.Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987). Dole outlines four categories of constraints on Congress's exercise of its power under the Spending Clause, but the only Dole condition disputedhere is the fourth and last, i.e., whether CIPA requires libraries that receive LSTAfunds or E-rate discounts to violate the constitutional rights of their patrons. As willappear, the question is not a simple one, and turns on the level of scrutiny applicable  11   toapubliclibrary's content-based restrictions on patrons' Internet access. Whether such restrictions are subject to strict scrutiny, as plaintiffs contend, or only rational basis review,asthe government contends, depends on public forum doctrine. The government argues that,in providing Internet access, public libraries do not createapublic forum, since public libraries may reserve the right to exclude certain speakersfrom availing themselves of the forum. Accordingly, the government contends thatpublic libraries' restrictions on patrons' Internet access are subject only to rational basisreview. Plaintiffs respond that the government's ability to restrict speech on its own property,as in the case of restrictions on Internet access in public libraries, is not unlimited, and that the more widely the state facilitates the dissemination of private  speech in a given forum, the more vulnerable the state's decision is to restrict access to speech in that forum. We agree with the plaintiffs that public libraries' content-based restrictions on their patrons' Internet access are subject to strict scrutiny. In providing evenfiltered Internet access, publiclibraries create a public forum open to any speaker aroundthe world to communicate with library patrons via the Internet on a virtually unlimitednumber of topics. Where the state provides access to a ""vast democratic  forum[],"" Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 868 (1997), open to any member of the public to speak on subjects ""as diverse as human thought,"" id. at 870 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), the state's decision selectively to exclude from the forum speech whose  12   content the state disfavors is subject to strict scrutiny, as such exclusions risk distorting the marketplace of ideas that the state has facilitated. Application of strict scrutiny finds further support in the extent to which public libraries' provision of Internet access uniquely promotes First Amendment values in a manner analogous to traditional public fora such as streets, sidewalks, and parks, in which content-based restrictions are always subject to strict scrutiny. Under strict scrutiny, a public library's use of filtering software is permissible only if itisnarrowly tailored to further a compelling government interest and no less restrictive alternativewould serve that interest. We acknowledge that use of filtering software furtherspublic libraries' legitimate interests in preventing patrons from accessing visual depictionsof obscenity, child pornography, or in the case of minors, material harmful to minors. Moreover, use of filters also helps prevent patrons from being unwillingly exposedto patently offensive, sexually explicit content on the Internet. We are sympathetic to the position of the government, believing that it would be desirableif there were a means to ensure that public library patrons could share in the informational bonanza of the Internet while being insulated from materials that meet CIPA'sdefinitions, that is, visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or in the caseof minors, harmful to minors. Unfortunately this outcome, devoutly to be wished, is notavailable in this less than best of all possible worlds. No category definition used by theblocking programs is identical to the legal definitions of obscenity, child pornography,  13   ormaterial harmful to minors, and, at all events, filtering programs fail to block access to asubstantial amount of content on the Internet that falls into the categories defined by CIPA. Aswill appear, we credit the testimony of plaintiffs' expert Dr. Geoffrey Nunberg thattheblocking software is (at least for the foreseeable future) incapable of effectively blockingthe majority of materials in the categories defined by CIPA without overblocking a substantial amount of materials. Nunberg's analysis was supported by extensiverecord evidence. As noted above, this inability to prevent both substantial amountsof underblocking and overblocking stems from several sources, including limitations on the technology that software filtering companies use to gather and review Webpages, limitations on resources for human review of Web pages, and the necessary errorthatresults from human review processes. Because the filtering software mandated by CIPA will block access to substantial amountsof constitutionally protected speech whose suppression serves no legitimate government interest, we are persuaded that a public library's use of software filters is not narrowly tailored to further any of these interests. Moreover, less restrictive alternatives existthatfurther the government's legitimate interest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity,child pornography, and material harmful to minors, and in preventing patrons from being unwillingly exposed to patently offensive, sexually explicit content. To preventpatrons from accessing visual depictions that are obscene and child pornography, publiclibraries may enforce Internet use policies that make clear to patrons that the  14   library'sInternet terminals may not be used to access illegal speech. Libraries may then imposepenalties on patrons who violate these policies, ranging from a warning to notification of law enforcement, in the appropriate case. Less restrictive alternatives to filteringthat further libraries' interest in preventing minors from exposure to visual depictionsthat are harmful to minors include requiring parental consent to or presence duringunfiltered access, or restricting minors' unfiltered access to terminals within view of library staff. Finally, optional filtering, privacy screens, recessed monitors, and placementof unfiltered Internet terminals outside of sight-lines provide less restrictive alternatives for libraries to prevent patrons from being unwillingly exposed to sexually explicitcontent on the Internet. Inan effort to avoid the potentially fatal legal implications of the overblocking problem,the government falls back on the ability of the libraries, under CIPA's disabling provisions, see CIPA  1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C.  9134(f)(3)), CIPA 1721(b) (codifiedat 47 U.S.C.  254(h)(6)(D)), to unblock a site that is patently proper yet improperly blocked. The evidence reflects that libraries can and do unblock the filters whenapatron so requests. But it also reflects that requiring library patrons to ask for a Websiteto be unblocked will determany patrons because they are embarrassed, or desire toprotecttheir privacy or remain anonymous. Moreover, the unblocking may take days, andmay be unavailable, especially in branch libraries, which are often less well staffed thanmainlibraries. Accordingly, CIPA's disabling provisions do not cure the  15   constitutional deficiencies in publiclibraries' use of Internet filters. Under these circumstances we are constrained to conclude that the library plaintiffsmust prevail in their contention that CIPA requires them to violate the First Amendment rights of their patrons, and accordingly is facially invalid, even under the standardurged on us by the government, which would permit us to facially invalidate CIPAonly if it is impossible for a single public library to comply with CIPA's conditions withoutviolating the First Amendment. In view of the limitations inherent in the filtering technology mandated by CIPA, any public library that adheres to CIPA's conditions will necessarily restrict patrons' access to a substantial amount of protected speech, in violationof the First Amendment. Given this conclusion, we need not reach plaintiffs' argumentsthat CIPA effects a priorrestraint on speech and is unconstitutionally vague. Nordowe decide their cognate unconstitutional conditions theory, though for reasons explained infra at note 36, we discuss the issues raised by that claim at some length. For these reasons, we will enter an Order declaring Sections 1712(a)(2) and 1721(b)of the Children's Internet Protection Act, codified at 20 U.S.C.  9134(f) and 47 U.S.C.254(h)(6), respectively, to be facially invalid under the First Amendment and permanently enjoining the defendants from enforcing those provisions.II. Findings of Fact A. Statutory Framework 1. Nature and Operation of the E-rate and LSTA Programs  16   Inthe Telecommunications Act of 1996 (""1996 Act""), Congress directed the FederalCommunications Commission (""FCC"") to take the steps necessary to establish a system of support mechanisms to ensure the delivery of affordable telecommunications servicetoall Americans. This system, referred to as ""universal service,"" is codified in section254 of the CommunicationsAct of 1934, as amended by the 1996 Act. See 47 U.S.C.254. Congress specified several groups as beneficiaries of the universal service supportmechanism, including consumers in high-cost areas, low-income consumers, schoolsand libraries, and rural health care providers. See 47 U.S.C.  254(h)(1). The extensionof universal service to schools and libraries in section 254(h) is commonly referredto as the Schools and Libraries Program, or ""E-rate"" Program. Under the E-rate Program, ""[a]ll telecommunications carriers serving a geographic areashall,upon a bona fide requestfor any of its services that are within the definition of universalservice . . ., provide such services to elementary schools, secondary schools, and librariesfor educational purposes at rates less than the amounts charged for similar servicestoother parties."" 47 U.S.C.  254(h)(1)(B). Under FCC regulations, providers of ""interstate telecommunications"" (with certain exceptions, see 47 C.F.R.  54.706(d)), mustcontribute a portion of their revenue for disbursement among eligible carriers that areproviding services to those groups or areas specified by Congress in section 254. To beeligible for the discounts, a library must: (1) be eligible for assistance from a State library administrative agency underthe Library Services and Technology Act, see infra;  17   (2)befunded as an independent entity, completely separate from any schools; and (3) not beoperating as a for-profit business. See 47 C.F.R.  54.501(c). Discounts on services foreligible libraries are set as a percentage of the pre-discount price, and range from 20% to90%,depending on a library's level of economic disadvantage and its location in an urbanorrural area. See 47 C.F.R.  54.505. Currently, a library's level of economic disadvantage is based on the percentage of students eligible for the national school lunch program in the school district in which the library is located. TheLibrary Services and Technology Act (""LSTA""), Subchapter II of the Museum andLibrary Services Act, 20 U.S.C.  9101 et seq., was enacted by Congress in 1996 as partof theOmnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 104-208. The LSTAestablishes three grant programs to achieve the goal of improving library services acrossthenation. Under the Grants to States Program, LSTA grant funds are awarded, interalia,in order to assist libraries in accessing information through electronic networks andpay for the costs of acquiring or sharing computer systems and telecommunications technologies. See 20 U.S.C.  9141(a). Through the Grants to States program, LSTA fundshave been used to acquire and pay costs associated with Internet-accessible computerslocated in libraries. 2. CIPA TheChildren's Internet Protection Act (""CIPA"") was enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001, which consolidated and enacted several  18   appropriations bills, including the Miscellaneous Appropriations Act, of which CIPA was apart. See Pub. L. No. 106-554. CIPA addresses three distinct types of federal funding programs:(1) aid to elementary and secondary schools pursuant to Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, see CIPA  1711 (amending Title 20 toadd3601); (2) LSTA grants to states for support of libraries, see CIPA  1712 (amendingthe Museum and Library Services Act, 20 U.S.C.  9134); and (3) discounts undertheE-rate program, see CIPA  1721(a) & (b) (both amending the Communications Actof 1934, 47 U.S.C.  254(h)). Only sections 1712 and 1721(b) of CIPA, which apply tolibraries, are at issue in this case. Asexplained in more detail below, CIPA requires libraries that participate in the LSTAand E-rate programs to certify that they are using software filters on their computersto protect against visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or in thecaseof minors, harmful to minors. CIPA permits library officials to disable the filters forpatrons for bona fide research or other lawful purposes, but disabling is not permitted forminorpatrons if the library receives E-rate discounts. a. CIPA's Amendments to the E-rate Program Section 1721(b) of CIPA imposes conditions on a library's participation in the Erateprogram. A library ""having one or more computers with Internet access may not receiveservices at discount rates,"" CIPA  1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C.  254(h)(6)(A)(i)), unless the library certifies that it is ""enforcing a policy of Internet safety  19   thatincludes the operation of a technology protection measure with respect to any of its computerswith Internet access thatprotects against access through such computers to visualdepictions that are  (I) obscene; (II) child pornography; or (III) harmful to minors,""and that it is ""enforcing the operation of such technology protection measure duringany use of such computers by minors."" CIPA  1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C.  254(h)(6)(B)).2 CIPA defines a ""technology protection measure"" as ""a specific CIPAdefines ""[m]inor"" as ""any individual who has not attained the age of 17 years."" CIPA1721(c) (codified at 47 U.S.C.  254(h)(7)(D)). CIPA further provides that ""[o]bscene"" has the meaning given in 18 U.S.C.  1460, and ""child pornography"" has the meaninggiven in 18 U.S.C.  2256. CIPA  1721(c) (codified at 47 U.S.C.  254(h)(7)(E) & (F)). CIPA definesmaterial that is ""harmful to minors"" as: any picture, image, graphic image file, or other visual depiction that  (i) taken as a whole and with respect to minors, appeals to a prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion; (ii) depicts, describes, or represents, in a patently offensive way with respect to what is suitable for minors, an actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact, actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual acts, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals; and (iii) taken as awhole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value as to minors. CIPA1721(c) (codified at 47 U.S.C.  254(h)(7)(G)). CIPA prohibits federal interference in local determinations regarding what Internet contentisappropriate for minors: Adetermination regarding what matter is appropriate for minors shall be made by the school board, local educational agency, library or other authority responsible for making the determination. No agency or instrumentality of the United States Government may  (A) establish criteria for making such determination; (B) review the determination made by the certifying [entity] . . . ; or (C) consider the criteria employed by the certifying [entity] . . . in the administration of subsection (h)(1)(B). CIPA1732 (codified at 47 U.S.C.  254(l)(2)). 20 2   technology that blocks or filters access to visual depictions that are obscene, . . . child pornography, . . . or harmful to minors."" CIPA  1703(b)(1) (codified at 47 U.S.C.  254(h)(7)(I)). Toreceive E-rate discounts, a library must also certify that filtering software is in operationduring adult use of the Internet. More specifically, with respect to adults, a library must certify that it is ""enforcing a policy of Internet safety that includes the operationof a technology protection measure with respect to any of its computers with Internetaccess that protects against access through such computers to visual depictions thatare(I) obscene; or (II) child pornography,"" and that it is ""enforcing the operation of suchtechnology protection measure during any use of such computers."" CIPA  1721(b) (codifiedat 47 U.S.C.  254(h)(6)(C)). Interpreting the statutory terms ""any use,"" the FCChasconcluded that ""CIPA makes no distinction between computers used only by staff andthose accessible to the public."" In re Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service:Children's Internet Protection Act, CC Docket No. 96-45, Report and Order, FCC01-120,  30 (Apr. 5, 2001). With respect to libraries receiving E-rate discounts, CIPA further specifies that ""[a]nadministrator, supervisor, or other person authorized by the certifying authority . . . may disable the technology protection measure concerned, during use by an adult, to enableaccess for bona fide research or other lawful purpose."" CIPA 1721(b) (codified at47U.S.C.  254(h)(6)(D)).  21   b. CIPA's Amendments to the LSTA Program Section 1712 of CIPA amends the Museum and Library Services Act (20 U.S.C.  9134(f))toprovide that no funds made available under the Act ""may be used to purchase computers used to access the Internet, or to pay for direct costs associated with accessing theInternet,"" unless such library ""has in place"" and is enforcing ""a policy of Internet safety thatincludes the operation of a technology protection measure with respect to any of itscomputers with Internet access that protects against access through such computers tovisualdepictions"" that are ""obscene"" or ""child pornography,"" and, when the computers areinuseby minors, also protects against access to visual depictions that are ""harmful to minors."" CIPA  1712 (codified at20 U.S.C.  9134(f)(1)). Section 1712 contains definitionsof ""technology protection measure,"" ""obscene,"" ""child pornography,"" and ""harmfulto minors,"" that are substantially similar to those found in the provisions governingthe E-rate program. CIPA  1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C.  9134(f)(7)); see also supra note 2. Asunder the E-rate program, ""an administrator, supervisor or other authority may disableatechnology protection measure . . . to enable access for bona fide research or otherlawful purposes."" CIPA  1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C.  9134(f)(3)). Whereas CIPA'samendments to the E-rate program permit disabling for bona fide research or otherlawful purposes only during adult use, the LSTA provision permits disabling for bothadults and minors.  22   B. Identity of the Plaintiffs 1. Library and Library Association Plaintiffs Plaintiffs American Library Association, Alaska Library Association, California Library Association, Connecticut Library Association, Freedom to Read Foundation, MaineLibrary Association, New England Library Association, New York Library Association, and Wisconsin Library Association are non-profit organizations whose membersinclude public libraries that receive either E-rate discounts or LSTA funds for theprovision of Internet access. Because it is a prerequisite to associational standing, we notethatthe interests that these organizations seek to protect in this litigation are central totheir raison d'tre. Plaintiffs Fort Vancouver Regional Library District, in southwest Washington state;Multnomah County Public Library, in Multnomah County, Oregon; Norfolk Public Library System, in Norfolk, Virginia; Santa Cruz Public Library Joint Powers Authority, inSantaCruz, California; South Central Library System (""SCLS""), centered in Madison, Wisconsin; and the Westchester Library System, in Westchester County, New York, are publiclibrary systems with branch offices in their respective localities that provide Internetaccess to their patrons. TheFort Vancouver Regional Library District, for over three years from 19992001,received $135,000 in LSTA grants and $19,500 in E-rate discounts for Internet access. The Multnomah County Public Library received $70,000 in E-rate discountsfor  23   Internetaccess this year, and has applied for $100,000 in E-rate discounts for the upcomingyear. The Norfolk Public Library System received $90,000 in E-rate discounts forInternet access this year, and has received a $200,000 LSTA grant to put computer labsineight of its libraries. The Santa Cruz Public Library Joint Powers Authority received$20,560 in E-rate discounts for Internet access in 2001-02. The SCLS received between$3,000 and $5,000 this year in E-rate discounts for Internet access. The Fort Vancouver Regional Library District Board is a public board whose membersare appointed by elected county commissioners. The Multnomah County Library isa county department, whose board is appointed by the county chair and confirmedby the other commissioners. The SCLS is an aggregation of 51 independently governedstatutory member public libraries, whose relationship to SCLS is defined by statelaw. The governing body of the SCLS is the Library Board of Trustees, which consistsof 20 members nominated by county executives and ratified by county boards of supervisors. 2. Patron and Patron Association Plaintiffs Plaintiffs Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, Friends of thePhiladelphia City Institute Library, and the Pennsylvania Alliance for Democracy are nonprofitorganizations whose members include individuals who access the Internet at publiclibraries that receive E-rate discounts or LSTA funds for the provision of public Internetaccess. We note for the purpose of associational standing that the interests that  24   theseorganizations seek to protect in this litigation are germane to their purposes. Plaintiffs Emmalyn Rood, Mark Brown, Elizabeth Hrenda, C. Donald Weinberg, SherronDixon, by her father and next friend Gordon Dixon, James Geringer, Marnique TyneshaOverby, by her next friend Carolyn C. Williams, William J. Rosenbaum, Carolyn C.Williams, and Quiana Williams, by her mother and next friend Sharon Bernard, are adultsandminors who use the Internet at public libraries that, to the best of their knowledge, do not filter patrons' access to the Internet. Several of these plaintiffs do not haveInternet access from home. Emmalyn Rood is a sixteen-year-old who uses the Multnomah County Public Library. When she was 13, she used the Internet at the Multnomah County Public Library toresearch issues relating to her sexual identity. Ms. Rood did not use her home or schoolcomputer for this research, in part because she wished her searching to be private. Althoughthe library offered patrons the option of using filtering software, Ms. Rood did notusethat option because she had had previous experience with such programs blocking information that was valuable to her, including information relating to gay and lesbian issues. Plaintiff Mark Brown used the Internet at the Philadelphia Free Library to research breastcancer and reconstructive surgery for his mother who had breast surgery. Mr. Brown'sresearch at the library provided him and his mother with essential information abouthismother's medical condition and potential treatments.  25   3. W eb Publisher Plaintiffs Plaintiff Afraid to Ask, Inc.,based in Saunderstown, Rhode Island, publishes a healtheducation Web site, www.AfraidtoAsk.com. Dr. Jonathan Bertman, the president andmedical director of Afraid to Ask, is a family practice physician in rural Rhode Island andaclinical assistant professor of family medicine at Brown University. AfraidtoAsk.com's mission is to provide detailed information on sensitive health issues, oftenof asexual nature, such as sexually transmitted diseases, male and female genitalia, andbirthcontrol, sought by people of all ages who would prefer to learn about sensitive healthissues anonymously, i.e., they are ""afraid to ask."" As part of its educational mission,AfraidtoAsk.com often uses graphic images of sexual anatomy to convey information. Its primary audience is teens and young adults. Based on survey data collectedon the site, half of the people visiting the site are under 24 years old and a quarterare under 18. AfraidtoAsk.com is blocked by several leading blocking products ascontaining sexually explicit content. Plaintiff Alan Guttmacher Institute has a Web site that contains information about itsactivities and objectives, including its mission to protect the reproductive choices of womenand men. Plaintiff Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. (""Planned Parenthood"") is a national voluntary organization in the field of reproductive health care. PlannedParenthood owns and operates several Web sites that provide a range of information about reproductive health, from contraception to prevention of sexually  26   transmitted diseases, to finding an abortion provider, and to information about the drug Mifepristone. Plaintiff Safersex.org is a Web site that offers free educational information onhowtopractice safer sex. Plaintiff Ethan Interactive, Inc., d/b/a Out In America, is an online content providerthat owns and operates 64 free Web sites for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered persons worldwide. Plaintiff PlanetOut Corporation is an online content providerfor gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered persons. Plaintiff the Naturist ActionCommittee (""NAC"") is the nonprofit political arm of the Naturist Society, a privateorganization that promotes a way of life characterized by the practice of nudity. TheNACWeb site provides information about Naturist Society activities and about state andlocallaws that may affect the rights of Naturists or their ability to practice Naturism, andincludes nude photographs of its members. Plaintiff Wayne L. Parker was the Libertarian candidate in the 2000 U.S. Congressional election for the FifthDistrict of Mississippi (and is running again in 2002). Hepublishes a Web site that communicates information about his campaign and that providesinformation about his political views and the Libertarian Party to the public. Plaintiff Jeffrey Pollock was the Republican candidate in the 2000 U.S. Congressional electionfor the Third District of Oregon. He operates a Web site that is now promoting hiscandidacy for Congress in 2002. 3 3  Thegovernment challenges the standing of several of the plaintiffs and the ripeness of theirclaims. These include all of the Web site publishers and all of the individual 27   C. The Internet 1. Background Aswe noted at the outset, the Internet is a vast, interactive medium consistingof a decentralized network of computers around the world. The Internet presents low entry barrierstoanyone who wishes to provide or distribute information. Unlike television, cable,radio, newspapers, magazines or books, the Internet provides an opportunity for thosewithaccess to it to communicate with a worldwide audience at little cost. At least 400million people use the Internet worldwide, and approximately 143 million Americans wereusing the Internet as of September 2001. Nat'l Telecomm. & Info. Admin., A NationOnline: How Americans Are Expanding Their Use of the Internet (February 2002), available at http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/dn/. The World Wide Web is a part of the Internet that consists of a network of computers, called ""Web servers,"" that host ""pages"" of content accessible via the HypertextTransfer Protocol or ""HTTP."" Anyone with a computer connected to the Internetcan search for and retrieve information stored on Web servers located around the library patrons. Notwithstanding these objections, we are confident that the ""case or controversy"" requirement of Article III,  2 of the Constitution is met by the existence of theplaintiff libraries that qualify for LSTA and E-rate funding and the library associations whose members qualify for such funding. These plaintiffs are faced with the impendingchoice of either certifying compliance with CIPA by July 1, 2002, or foregoingsubsidies under the LSTA and E-rate programs, and therefore clearly have standingto challenge the constitutionality of the conditions to which they will be subject shouldthey accept the subsidies. We also note that the presence of the Web site publishersand individual library patrons does not affect our legal analysis or disposition of thecase. 28   world. Computer users typically access the Web by running a program called a ""browser"" ontheircomputers. The browser displays, as individual pages on the computer screen, thevarious types of content found on the Web and lets the user follow the connections builtintoWeb pages  called ""hypertext links,"" ""hyperlinks,"" or ""links""  to additional content. Two popular browsers are Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator. A""Web page"" is one or more files a browser graphically assembles to make a viewablewhole when a user requests content over the Internet. A Web page may contain avariety of different elements, including text, images, buttons, form fields that the user canfillin,and links to other Web pages. A ""Web site"" is a term that can be used in severaldifferent ways. It may refer to all of the pages and resources available on a particularWeb server. It may also refer to all the pages and resources associated with a particularorganization, company or person, even if these are located on different servers, orinasubdirectory on a single server shared with other, unrelated sites. Typically, aWeb sitehasasan intended point of entry, a ""home page,"" which includes links to other pages onthesame Web site or to pages on other sites. Online discussion groups and chat rooms relatingtoa variety of subjects are available through many Web sites. Users may find content on the Web using engines that search for requested keywords. In response to a keyword request, a search engine will display a list of Web sitesthatmay contain relevant content and provide links to those sites. Search engines anddirectories often return a limited number of sites in their search results (e.g., the  29   Googlesearch engine will return only 2,000 sites in response to a search, even if it has found,forexample, 530,000 sites in its index that meet the search criteria). Auser may also access content on the Web by typing a URL (Uniform Resource Locator)into the address line of the browser. A URL is an address that points to some resourcelocated on a Web server that is accessible over the Internet. This resource may beaWebsite, a Web page, an image, a sound or video file, or other resource. A URL canbeeither a numeric Internet Protocol or ""IP"" address, or an alphanumeric ""domain name""address. Every Web server connected to the Internet is assigned an IP address. A typicalIPaddress looks like ""13.1.64.14."" Typing the URL ""http://13.1.64.14/"" intoa browserwill bring the user to the Web server that corresponds to that address. For convenience, most Web servers have alphanumeric domain name addresses in addition to IPaddresses. For example, typing in ""http://www.paed.uscourts.gov"" will bring the user tothesame Web server as typing in""http://204.170.64.143."" Every time a user attempts to access material located on a Web server by entering a domainname address into a Web browser, a request is made to a Domain Name Server, whichisadirectory of domain names and IP addresses, to ""resolve,"" or translate, the domainname address into an IP address. That IP address is then used to locate the Web serverfrom which content is being requested. A Web site may be accessed by using eitheritsdomain name address or its IP address. Adomain name address typically consists of several parts. For example, the  30   alphanumeric URL http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents/opinions can be broken downintothree parts. The first part is the transfer protocol the computer will use in accessingthe content (e.g., ""http"" for Hypertext Transfer Protocol); next is the name of thehostserver on which the information is stored (e.g., www.paed.uscourts.gov); and thenthename of the particular file or directory on that server (e.g., /documents/opinions). Asingle Web page may be associated with more than one URL. For example, the URLs http://www.newyorktimes.com and http://www.nytimes.com will both take the user tothe New York Times home page. The topmost directory in a Web site is often referred toasthatWeb site's root directory or root URL. For example, in http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents, the root URL is http://www.paed.uscourts.gov. Theremay be hundreds or thousands of pages under a single root URL, or there may be oneoronly a few. There are a number of Web hosting companies that maintain Web sites for other businesses and individuals, which can lead to vast amounts of diverse content being locatedatthe same IP address. Hosting services are offered either for a fee, or in some cases,forfree, allowing any individual with Internet access to create a Web site. Some hostingservices are provided through the process of ""IP-based hosting,"" where each domainname is assigned a unique IP number. For example, www.baseball.com might maptotheIP address ""10.3.5.9"" and www.XXX.com might map to the IP address ""10.0.42.5."" Other hosting services are provided through the process of ""name-based  31   hosting,""where multiple domain name addresses are mapped to a single IP address. If thehosting company were using this method, both www.baseball.com and www.XXX.com could map to a single IP address, e.g., ""10.3.5.9."" As a result of the ""name-based hosting"" process, up to tens of thousands of pages with heterogeneous contentmay share a single IP address. 2. The Index able W eb, the ""Deep W eb""; Their Size and Rates of G row th and Change Theuniverse of content on the Web that could be indexed, in theory, by standard searchengines is known as the ""publicly indexable Web."" The publicly indexable Web is limitedtothose pages that are accessible by following a link from another Web page that isrecognized by a search engine. This limitation exists because online indexing techniquesused by popular search engines and directories such as Yahoo, Lycos and AltaVista,are based on ""spidering"" technology, which finds sites to index by following linksfrom site to site in a continuous search for new content. If a Web page or site is not linkedby others, then spidering will not discover that page or site. Furthermore, many larger Web sites contain instructions, through software, that preventspiders from investigating that site, and therefore the contents of such sites also cannotbeindexed using spidering technology. Because of the vast size and decentralized structureof the Web, no search engine or directory indexes all of the content on the publicly indexable Web. We credit current estimates that no more than 50% of the contentcurrently on the publicly indexable Web has been indexed by all search engines 32   anddirectories combined. No currently available method or combination of methods for collectingURLs can collect the addresses of all URLs on the Web. The portion of the Web that is not theoretically indexable through the use of ""spidering"" technology, because other Web pages do not link to it, is called the ""Deep Web."" Such sites or pages can stillbe made publicly accessible without being made publicly indexable by, for example,using individual or mass emailings (also known as ""spam"")to distribute the URL to potential readers or customers, or by using types of Web linksthatcannot be found by spiders but can be seen and used by readers. ""Spamming"" is acommonmethod of distributing to potential customers links to sexually explicit content thatisnotindexable. Because the Web is decentralized, it is impossible to say exactly how large it is. A 2000study estimated a total of 7.1 million unique Web sites, which at the Web's historicalrate of growth, would have increased to 11 million unique sites as of September 2001. Estimates of the total number of Web pages vary, but a figure of 2 billion is a reasonableestimate of the number of Web pages that can be reached, in theory, by standardsearch engines. We need not make a specific finding as to a figure, for by any measurethe Web is extremely vast, and it is constantly growing. The indexable Web is growingata rate of approximately 1.5 million pages per day. The size of the unindexableWeb, or the ""Deep Web,"" while impossible to determine precisely, is estimated tobetwoto ten times that of the publicly indexable Web.  33   Inaddition to growing rapidly, Web pages and sites are constantly being removed, orchanging their content. Web sites or pages can change content without changing their domainname addresses or IP addresses. Individual Web pages have an average life span of approximately 90 days. 3. The Amount of Sexually Explicit Material on the Web There is a vast amount of sexually explicit material available via the Internet and theWeb. Sexually explicit material on the Internet is easy to access using any public searchengine, such as, for example, Google or AltaVista. Although much of the sexually explicitmaterial available on the Web is posted on commercial sites that require viewers topay inorder to gain access to thesite, a large number of sexually explicit sites may be accessedfor free and without providing any registration information. Most importantly, someWebsites that contain sexually explicit content have innocuous domain names and thereforecan be reached accidentally. A commonly cited example is http://www.whitehouse.com. Other innocent-sounding URLs that retrieve graphic, sexually explicit depictions include http://www.boys.com, http://www.girls.com, http://www.coffeebeansupply.com, and http://www.BookstoreUSA.com. Moreover, commercial Web sites that contain sexually explicit material often use a technique of attachingpop-up windows to their sites, which open new windows advertising other sexually explicit sites without any prompting by the user. This technique makes it difficultfor a user quickly to exit all of the pages containing sexually explicit material,  34   whetherhe or she initially accessedsuch material intentionally or not. The percentage of Web pages on the indexed Web containing sexually explicit contentisrelatively small. Recent estimates indicate that no more than 1-2% of the contentonthe Web is pornographic or sexually explicit. However, the absolute number of Websites offering free sexually explicit material is extremely large, approximately 100,000sites. D. American Public Libraries The more than 9,000 public libraries in the United States are typically funded (at leastinlarge part) by state or local governments. They are frequently overseen by a board of directors that is either elected or is appointed by an elected official or a body of elected officials. We heard testimony from librarians and library board members working in eightpublic library systems in different communities across the country, some of whom arealsoplaintiffs in this case. They hailed from the following library systems: Fort Vancouver, Washington; Fulton County, Indiana; Greenville, South Carolina; a regional consortium of libraries centered in Madison, Wisconsin; Multnomah County, Oregon; Norfolk,Virginia; Tacoma, Washington; and Westerville, Ohio. The parties also took depositions from several other librarians and library board members who did not testify duringthetrial, and submitted a number of other documents regarding individual libraries'policies. 1. The M ission of Public Libraries, and Their Reference and Collection Development Practices 35   American public libraries operate in a wide variety of communities, and it is not surprisingthat they do not all view their mission identically. Nor are their practices uniform. Nevertheless, they generally share a common mission  to provide patrons with awiderange of information and ideas. Public libraries across the country have endorsed the American Library Association's (""ALA"") ""Library Bill of Rights"" and/or ""Freedom to Read Statement,"" includingevery library testifying on behalf of the defendants in this case. The ""Library Billof Rights,"" first adopted by theALA in 1948, provides, among other things, that ""[b]ooksand other library resources should be provided for the interest, information,and enlightenment of all people of the community the library serves."" It also states that libraries""should provide materials and information presenting all points of view on currentand historical issues"" and that library materials ""should not be proscribed or removedbecause of partisan or doctrinal disapproval."" TheALA's ""Freedom to Read"" statement, adopted in 1953 and most recently updatedin July 2000, states, amongother things, that ""[i]t is in the public interest for publishersand librarians to make available the widest diversity of views and expressions, includingthose that are unorthodox or unpopular with the majority."" It also states that ""[i]tistheresponsibility of . . . librarians . . . to contest encroachments upon th[e] freedom [to read] by individuals or groups seeking to impose their own standards or tastes uponthecommunity at large."" 36   Public libraries provide information not only for educational purposes, but also for recreational, professional, and other purposes. For example, Ginnie Cooper, Director of theMultnomah County Library, testified that some of the library's most popular items includevideo tapes of the British Broadcasting Corporation's ""Fawlty Towers"" series, andalsoprint and ""books on tape"" versions of science fiction, romance, and mystery novels. Many public libraries include sexually explicit materials in their print collection, suchas The Joy of Sex and The Joy of Gay Sex. Very few public libraries, however, collectmore graphic sexually explicit materials, such as XXX-rated videos, or Hustler magazine. 4  Themission of public librarians is to provide their patrons with a wide array of information, and they surely do so. Reference librarians across America answer more than7million questions weekly. If a patron has a specialized need for information not availablein the public library, the professional librarian will use a reference interview to findoutwhat information is needed to help the user, including the purpose for whichan item willbe used. Reference librarians are trained to assist patrons without judging the patron'spurpose in seeking information, or the content of the information that the patron isseeking.  TheOCLC database, a cooperative cataloging service established to facilitate interlibrary loan requests, includes 40 million catalog records from approximately 48,000 librariesof all types worldwide. Slightly more than 400 of the libraries in the OCLC databaseare listed as carrying Playboy in their collections, while only eight subscribe to Hustler. 37  4   Many public libraries routinely provide patrons with access to materials not in their collections through the use of bibliographic access tools and interlibrary loan programs. Publiclibraries typically will assist patrons in obtaining access to all materials except thosethatare illegal, even if they do not collect those materials in their physical collection. In order to provide this access, a librarian may attempt to find material not includedin the library's own collection in other libraries in the system, through interlibrary loan, or through a referral, perhaps to a government agency or a commercial bookstore. Interlibrary loan is expensive, however, and is therefore used infrequently. Public librarians also apply professional standards to their collection development practices. Public libraries generally make material selection decisions and frame policies governingcollection development at the local level. Collection development is a key subjectinthe curricula of Masters of Library Science programs and is defined by certain practices. In general, professional standards guide public librarians to build, developand createcollections that have certain characteristics, such as balance in its coverage and requisiteand appropriate quality. To this end, the goal of library collections is not universalcoverage, but rather to find those materials that would be of the greatest direct benefitorinterest to the community. In making selection decisions, librarians consider criteriaincluding the content of thematerial, its accuracy, the title's niche in relationto therestof the collection, the authority of the author, the publisher, the work's presentation, and how it compares with other material available in the same genre or on  38   thesamesubject. Inpursuing the goal of achieving a balanced collection that serves the needs and interestsof their patrons, librarians generally have a fair amount of autonomy, but may alsobeguided by a library's collection development policy. These collection development policies are often drawn up in conjunction with the libraries' governing boardsand with representatives from the community, and may be the result of public hearings,discussions and other input. Although many librarians use selection aids, such as review journals and bibliographies, as a guide to the quality of potential acquisitions, they do not generally delegatetheir selection decisions toparties outside of the public library or its governing body. One limited exception is the use of third-party vendors or approval plans to acquire printandvideo resources. In such arrangements, third-party vendors provide materials basedonthe library's description of its collection development criteria. The vendor sends materialsto the library, and the library retains the materials that meet its collection development needs and returns the materials that do not. Even in this arrangement, however,the librarians still retain ultimate control over their collection development and reviewallof the materials that enter their library's collection. 2. The Internet in Public Libraries Thevast majority of public libraries offer Internet access to their patrons. According to a recent report by the U.S. National Commission on Libraries and  39   Information Science, approximately 95% of all public libraries provide public accessto theInternet. John C. Bertot & Charles R. McClure, Public Libraries and the Internet 2000:Summary Findings and DataTables, Report to National Commission on Libraries andInformation Science, at 3. The Internet vastly expands the amount of information availableto patrons of public libraries. The widespread availability of Internet access in publiclibraries is due, in part, to the availability of public funding, including state and localfunding and the federal funding programs regulated by CIPA. Many libraries face a large amount of patron demand for their Internet services. Atsomelibraries, patron demand for Internet access during a given day exceeds the supply of computer terminals with access to the Internet. These libraries use sign-in and timelimitprocedures and/or establish rules regarding the allowable uses of the terminals, inaneffort to ration their computer resources. For example, some of the libraries whose librarianstestified at trial prohibit the use of email and chat functions on their public Internetterminals. Public libraries play an important role in providing Internet access to citizens who wouldnototherwise possess it. Of the 143 million Americans using the Internet, approximately 10%, or 14.3 million people, access the Internet at a public library. Internetaccess at public libraries is more often used by those with lower incomes than thosewithhigher incomes. About 20.3% of Internet users with household family income of lessthan $15,000 per year use public libraries for Internet access. Approximately 70%  40   of librariesserving communities with poverty levels in excess of 40% receive E-rate discounts. a. Internet Use Policies in Public Libraries Approximately 95% of libraries with public Internet access have some form of ""acceptable use"" policy or ""Internet use"" policy governing patrons' use of the Internet. Thesepolicies set forth the conditions under which patrons are permitted to access and usethelibrary's Internet resources. These policies vary widely. Some of the less restrictivepolicies, like those held by Multnomah County Library and Fort Vancouver RegionalLibrary, do not prohibit adult patrons from viewing sexually explicit materials ontheWeb, as long as they do so at terminals with privacy screens or recessed monitors, whicharedesigned to prevent other patrons from seeing the material that they are viewing,and as long as it does not violate state or federal law to do so. Other libraries prohibittheir patrons from viewing all ""sexually explicit"" or ""sexually graphic"" materials. Some libraries prohibit the viewing of materials that are not necessarily sexual, suchasWeb pages that are ""harmful to minors,"" ""offensive to the public,"" ""objectionable,"" ""racially offensive,"" or simply ""inappropriate."" Other libraries restrict accesstoWeb sites that the library just does not want to provide, even though the sites are notnecessarily offensive. For example, the Fulton County Public Library restricts access totheWebsites of dating services. Similarly, the Tacoma Public Library's policy does notallowpatrons to use the library's Internet terminals for personal email, for onlinechat,  41   orforplaying games. Insome cases, libraries instituted Internet use policies after having experienced specificproblems, whereas in other cases, libraries developed detailed Internet use policiesand regulatory measures (such as using filtering software) before ever offering publicInternet access. Essentially four interests motivate libraries to institute Internet use policiesand to apply the methods described above to regulate their patrons' use of the Internet. First, libraries have sought to protect patrons (especially children) and staff membersfrom accidentally viewing sexually explicit images, or other Web pages containing content deemed harmful, that other patrons are viewing on the Internet. For example,some librarians who testified described situations in which patrons left sexually explicitimages minimized on an Internet terminal so that the next patron would see them whenthey began using it, or in which patrons printed sexually explicit images from a Websiteand left them at a public printer. Second, libraries have attempted to protect patrons from unwittingly or accidentally accessing Web pages that they do not wish to see while they are using the Internet. For example, the Memphis-Shelby County (Tennessee) Public Library's Internet usepolicy states that the library ""employs filtering technology to reduce the possibility thatcustomers may encounter objectionable content in the form of depictions of full nudity and sexual acts.""  42   Third, libraries have sought to keep patrons (again, especially children) from intentionally accessing sexually explicit materials or other materials that the library deems inappropriate. For example, a study of the Tacoma Public Library's Internet use logs for theyear2000 showed that users between the ages of 11 and 15 accounted for 41% of the filterblocks that occurred on library computers. The study, which we credit, concluded thatchildren and young teens were actively seeking to access sexually explicit images in thelibrary. The Greenville Library's Board of Directors was particularly concerned that patronswere accessing obscene materials in the public library in violation of South Carolina'sobscenity statute. Finally, some libraries have regulated patrons' Internet use to attempt to control patrons'inappropriate (or illegal) behavior that is thought to stem from viewing Web pagesthatcontain sexually explicitmaterials or content that is otherwise deemed unacceptable. We recognize the concerns that led several of the public libraries whose librarians andboardmembers testified in thiscase to start using Internet filtering software. The testimony of the Chairman of the Board of the Greenville Public Library is illustrative. In December1999, there was considerable local press coverage in Greenville concerning adultpatrons who routinely used the library to surf the Web for pornography. In response topublicoutcry stemming from the newspaper report, the Board of Trustees held a specialboard meeting to obtain information and to communicate with the public  43   concerning the library's provision of Internet access. At this meeting, the Board learned forthefirst time of complaints about children being exposed to pornography that was displayedon the library's Internet terminals. Inlate January to early February of 2000, the library installed privacy screens and recessedterminals in an effort to restrict the display of sexually explicit Web sites at the library. InFebruary, 2000, the Board informed the library staff that they were expected to befamiliar with the South Carolinaobscenity statute and to enforce the policy prohibition onaccessto obscene materials, child pornography, or other materials prohibited under applicablelocal, state, and federal laws. Staff were told that they were to enforce the policy by means of a ""tap on the shoulder."" Prior to adopting its current Internet Use Policy,theBoard adopted an ""Addendum to Current Internet Use Policy."" Under the policy,the Board temporarily instituted a two-hour time limit per day for Internet use; reducedsubstantially the number of computers with Internet access in the library; reconfigured the location of the computers so that librarians had visual contact with all Internet-accessible terminals; and removed the privacy screens from terminals with Internetaccess. Even after the Board implemented the privacy screens and later the ""tap-on-theshoulder""policy combined with placing terminals in view of librarians, the library experienced a high turnover rate among reference librarians who worked in view of Internetterminals. Finding that the policies that it had tried did not prevent the viewing  44   of sexually explicit materials in the library, the Board at one point considered discontinuing Internet access in thelibrary. The Board finally concluded that the methods thatithadused to regulate Internet use were not sufficient to stem the behavioral problemsthat it thought were linked to the availability of pornographic materials in the library. As a result, it implemented a mandatory filtering policy. Wenote, however, that none of the libraries proffered by the defendants presented any systematic records or quantitative comparison of the amount of criminal or otherwise inappropriate behavior that occurred in their libraries before they began using Internet filteringsoftware compared to the amount that happened after they installed the software. Theplaintiffs' witnesses also testified that because public libraries are public places, incidentsinvolving inappropriate behavior in libraries (sexual and otherwise) existed long beforelibraries provided access to the Internet. b. M ethods for Regulating Internet Use Themethods that public libraries use to regulate Internet use vary greatly. They canbeorganized into four categories: (1) channeling patrons' Internet use; (2) separating patronssothat they will not see what other patrons are viewing; (3) placing Internet terminalsin public view and having librarians observe patrons to make sure that they are complyingwith the library's Internet use policy; and (4) using Internet filtering software. Thefirst category  channeling patrons' Internet use  frequently includes offering trainingtopatrons on how to use the Internet, including how to access the information  45   thatthey want and to avoid the materials that they do not want. Another technique that somepublic libraries use to direct their patrons to pages that the libraries have determined tobeaccurate and valuable is to establish links to ""recommended Web sites"" from the publiclibrary's home page (i.e., the page that appears when patrons begin a session at one of thelibrary's public Internet terminals). Librarians select these recommended Web sites by usingcriteria similar to those employed in traditional collection development. However,unless the library determines otherwise, selection of these specific sites does notpreclude patrons from attempting to access other Internet Web sites. Libraries may extend the ""recommended Web sites"" method further by limiting patrons'access to only those Web sites that are reviewed and selected by the library's staff. Forexample, in 1996, the Westerville, Ohio Library offered Internet access to childrenthrough a service called the ""Library Channel."" This service was intended to be ameansby which the library could organize the Internet in some fashion for presentation topatrons. Through the Library Channel, the computers in the children's section of the library were restricted to 2,000 to 3,000 sites selected by librarians. After three years, Westerville stopped using the Library Channel system because it overly constrained the children'sability to access materials on the Internet, and because the library experienced severaltechnical problems with thesystem. Public libraries also use several different techniques to separate patrons during Internetsessions so that they will not see what other patrons are viewing. The simplest  46   way toachieve this result is to position the library's public Internet terminals so that they arelocated away from traffic patterns in the library (and from other terminals), for example,by placing them so that they face a wall. This method is obviously constrained by libraries' space limitations and physical layout. Some libraries have also installed privacy screens on their public Internet terminals. These screens make a monitor appear blankunless the viewer is looking at it head-on.5 Although the Multnomah and Fort VancouverLibraries submitted records showing that they have received few complaints regardingpatrons' unwilling exposure to materials on the Internet, privacy screens do not alwaysprevent library patrons or employees from inadvertently seeing the materials that anotherpatron is viewing when passing directly behind a terminal. They also have the drawbackof making it difficult for patrons to work together at a single terminal, or for librariansto assist patrons at terminals, because it is difficult for two people to stand side by sideand view a screen at the same time. Some library patrons also find privacy screenstobe a hindrance and have attempted to remove them in order to improve the brightnessof the screen or to make the view better. Another method that libraries use to prevent patrons from seeing what other  FortVancouver Regional Library, for example, combines the methods of strategically placing terminals in low traffic areas and using privacy screens. A section headed""Confidentiality and Privacy"" on the library's home page states: ""in order to protecttheprivacy of the user and the interests of other library patrons, the library will attempttominimize unintentional viewing of the Internet. This will be done by use of privacy screens, and by judicious placement of the terminals and other appropriate means."" 47  5   patronsare viewing on their terminals is the installation of ""recessed monitors."" Recessedmonitors are computer screens that sit below the level of a desk top and are viewedfrom above. Although recessed monitors, especially when combined with privacy screens,eliminate almost all of the possibility of a patron accidentally viewing the contentson another patron's screen, they suffer from the same drawbacks as privacy screens,that is, they make it difficult for patrons to work together or with a librarian at a singleterminal. Some librarians also testified that recessed monitors are costly, but did notindicate how expensive they are compared to privacy screens or filtering software. A relatedtechnique that some public libraries use is to create a separate children's Internet viewingarea, where no adults except those accompanying children in their care may use theInternet terminals. This serves the objective of keeping children from inadvertently viewingmaterials appropriate only for adults that adults may be viewing on nearby terminals. Athird set of techniques that public libraries have used to enforce their Internet usepolicies takes the opposite tackfrom the privacy screens/recessed monitors approach by placing all of the library's public Internet terminals in prominent and visible locations, suchasnear the library's reference desk. This approach allows librarians to enforce their library'sInternet use policy by observing what patrons are viewing and employing the tap-on-the-shoulder policy. Under this approach, when patrons are viewing materials that areinconsistent with the library's policies, a library staff member approaches them and  48   asksthem to view something else, or may ask them to end their Internet session. A patron whodoesnot comply with these requests, or who repeatedly views materials not permittedunder the library's Internet use policy, may have his or her Internet or library privilegessuspended or revoked. But many librarians are uncomfortable with approaching patrons who are viewing sexually explicit images, finding confrontation unpleasant. Hence some libraries are reluctant to apply the tap-on-the-shoulder policy. The fourth category of methods that public libraries employ to enforce their Internetuse policies, and the one that gives rise to this case, is the use of Internet filtering software. According to the June 2000 Survey of Internet Access Management in Public Libraries,approximately 7% of libraries with public Internet access had mandated the use of blocking programs by adult patrons. Some public libraries provide patrons with the optionof using a blocking program, allowing patrons to decide whether to engage the program when they or their children access the Internet. Other public libraries require theirchildpatrons to use filtering software, but not their adult patrons. Filtering software vendors sell their products on a subscription basis. The cost of a subscription varies with the number of computers on which the filtering software will be used. In2001, the cost of the Cyber Patrol filtering software was $1,950 for 100 terminal licenses. The Greenville County Library System pays $2,500 per year for the N2H2 filteringsoftware, and a subscription to the Websense filter costs Westerville Public Library approximately $1,200 per year.  49   Noevidence was presented on the cost of privacy screens, recessed monitors, and thetap-on-the-shoulder policy, relative to the costs of filtering software. Nor did any of thelibraries proffered by the government present any quantitative evidence on the relative effectiveness of use of privacy screens to prevent patrons from being unwillingly exposed tosexually explicit material, and the use of filters, discussed below. No evidence was presented,for example, comparing the number of patron complaints in those libraries that havetriedboth methods. Thelibrarians who testified at trial whose libraries use Internet filtering software allprovide methods by which their patrons may ask the library to unblock specific Web sitesorpages. Of these, only the Tacoma Public Library allows patrons to request that a URLbeunblocked without providing any identifying information; Tacoma allows patrons torequesta URL by sending an email from the Internet terminal that the patron is using thatdoesnot contain a return emailaddress for the user. David Biek, the head librarian at theTacoma Library's main branch,testified at trial that the library keeps records that wouldenable it to know which patrons made unblocking requests, but does not use that information to connect users with their requests. Biek also testified that he periodically scansthelibrary's Internet use logs to search for: (1) URLs that were erroneously blocked,so that he may unblock them; or (2) URLs that should have been blocked, but werenot,in order to add them to a blocked category list. In the course of scanning the uselogs, Biek has also found what looked like attempts to access child pornography. In  50   twocases,he communicated his findings to law enforcement and turned over the logs in responseto a subpoena. Atall events, it takes time for librarians to make decisions about whether to honor patrons'requests to unblock Web pages. In the libraries proffered by the defendants, unblocking decisions sometimes take between 24 hours and a week. Moreover, none of theselibraries allows unrestricted access to the Internet pending a determination of the validity of a Web site blocked by the blocking programs. A few of the defendants' profferedlibraries represented that individual librarians would have the discretion to allowapatron to have full Internet access on a staff computer upon request, but none claimedthat allowing such access was mandatory, and patron access is supervised in every instance. None of these libraries makes differential unblocking decisions based on thepatrons' age. Unblocking decisions are usually made identically for adults and minors. Unblocking decisions even for adults are usually based on suitability of the Web siteforminors. Itisapparent that many patrons are reluctant or unwilling to ask librarians to unblockWeb pages or sites that contain only materials that might be deemed personal or embarrassing, even if they are not sexually explicit or pornographic. We credit the testimony of Emmalyn Rood, discussed above, that she would have been unwilling as a youngteento ask a librarian to disable filtering software so that she could view materials concerning gay and lesbian issues. We also credit the testimony of Mark Brown, who  51   statedthathe would have been too embarrassed to ask a librarian to disable filtering softwareif it had impeded his ability to research treatments and cosmetic surgery options forhismother when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. The pattern of patron requests to unblock specific URLs in the various libraries involvedin this case also confirms our finding that patrons are largely unwilling to make unblocking requests unless they arepermitted to do so anonymously. For example, the FultonCounty Library receives only about 6 unblocking requests each year, the Greenville Public Library has received only 28 unblocking requests since August 21, 2000,andthe Westerville, Ohio Library has received fewer than 10 unblocking requests since1999. In light of the fact thata substantial amount of overblocking occurs in these very libraries, see infra Subsection II.E.4, we find that the lack of unblocking requests in theselibraries does not reflect the effectiveness of the filters, but rather reflects patrons' reluctanceto ask librarians to unblock sites. E. Internet Filtering Technology 1. W hat Is Filtering Softw are, W ho M akes It, and W hat Does It Do? Commercially available products that can be configured to block or filter access to certainmaterial on the Internet are among the ""technology protection measures"" that may beusedtoattempt to comply with CIPA. There are numerous filtering software products availablecommercially. Three network-based filtering products  SurfControl's Cyber Patrol,N2H2's Bess/i2100, and Secure Computing's SmartFilter  currently have the  52   lion'sshare of the public library market. The parties in this case deposed representatives from these three companies. Websense, another network-based blocking product, is also currently used in the public library market, and was discussed at trial. Filtering software may be installed either on an individual computer or on a computernetwork. Network-based filtering software products are designed for use on a networkof computers and funnel requests for Internet content through a centralized networkdevice. Of the various commercially available blocking products, networkbasedproducts are the ones generally marketed to institutions, such as public libraries, thatprovide Internet access through multiple terminals. Filtering programs function in a fairly simple way. When an Internet user requests accesstoacertain Web site or page, either by entering a domain name or IP address into a Webbrowser, or by clicking on a link, the filtering software checks that domain name or IPaddressagainst a previously compiled ""control list"" that may contain up to hundreds of thousandsof URLs. The three companies deposed in this case have control lists containing between 200,000 and 600,000 URLs. These lists determine which URLs will beblocked. Filtering software companies divide their control lists into multiple categoriesfor whichthey have created unique definitions. SurfControl uses 40 such categories, N2H2 uses35categories (and seven ""exception"" categories), Websense uses 30 categories,and SecureComputing uses 30 categories. Filtering software customers choose which  53   categoriesof URLs they wish to enable. A user ""enables"" a category in a filtering program by configuring the program to block all of the Web pages listed in that category. The following is a list of thecategories offered by each of these four filtering programs. SurfControl's Cyber Patrol offers the following categories: Adult/Sexually Explicit;Advertisements; Arts & Entertainment; Chat; Computing & Internet; Criminal Skills;Drugs, Alcohol & Tobacco; Education; Finance & Investment; Food & Drink; Gambling;Games; Glamour & Intimate Apparel; Government & Politics; Hacking; Hate Speech;Health & Medicine; Hobbies & Recreation; Hosting Sites; Job Search & Career Development; Kids' Sites; Lifestyle & Culture; Motor Vehicles; News; Personals & Dating;Photo Searches; Real Estate; Reference; Religion; Remote Proxies; Sex Education;Search Engines; Shopping; Sports; Streaming Media; Travel; Usenet News; Violence;Weapons; and Web-based Email. N2H2 offers the following categories: Adults Only; Alcohol; Auction; Chat; Drugs;Electronic Commerce; Employment Search; Free Mail; Free Pages; Gambling; Games;Hate/Discrimination; Illegal; Jokes; Lingerie; Message/Bulletin Boards; Murder/Suicide; News; Nudity; Personal Information; Personals; Pornography; Profanity; Recreation/Entertainment; School Cheating Information; Search Engines; Search Terms; Sex;Sports; Stocks; Swimsuits; Tasteless/Gross; Tobacco; Violence; and Weapons. The ""Nudity""category purports to block only ""non-pornographic"" images. The ""Sex"" category isintended to block only those depictions of sexual activity that are not intended  54   toarouse. The ""Tasteless/Gross"" category includes contents such as ""tasteless humor"" and""graphic medical or accident scene photos."" Additionally, N2H2 offers seven ""exceptioncategories."" These exception categories include Education, Filtered Search Engine,For Kids, History, Medical, Moderated, and Text/Spoken Only. When an exceptioncategory is enabled, access to any Web site or page via a URL associated with bothacategory and an exception, for example, both ""Sex"" and ""Education,"" will be allowed,even if the customer has enabled the product to otherwise block the category ""Sex."" Asof November 15, 2001, of those Web sites categorized by N2H2 as ""Sex,"" 3.6%werealso categorized as ""Education,"" 2.9% as ""Medical,"" and 1.6% as ""History."" Websense offers the following categories: Abortion Advocacy; Advocacy Groups; AdultMaterial; Business & Economy; Drugs; Education; Entertainment; Gambling; Games;Government; Health; Illegal/Questionable; Information Technology; Internet Communication; Job Search; Militancy/Extremist; News & Media; Productivity Management; Bandwidth Management; Racism/Hate; Religion; Shopping; Society & Lifestyle;Special Events; Sports; Tasteless; Travel; Vehicles; Violence; and Weapons. The""Adult"" category includes ""full or partial nudity of individuals,"" as well as sites offering""light adult humor and literature"" and ""[s]exually explicit language."" The ""Sexuality/Pornography"" category includes, inter alia, ""hard-core adult humor and literature""and ""[s]exually explicit language."" The ""Tasteless"" category includes ""hardto-stomach sites, including offensive, worthless or useless sites, grotesque or lurid  55   depictionsof bodily harm."" The ""Hacking"" category blocks ""sites providing information onorpromoting illegal or questionable access to or use of communications equipment and/orsoftware."" SmartFilter offers the following categories: Anonymizers/Translators; Art & Culture;Chat; Criminal Skills; Cults/Occult; Dating; Drugs; Entertainment; Extreme/Obscene/Violence; Gambling; Games; General News; Hate Speech; Humor; Investing;Job Search; Lifestyle; Mature; MP3 Sites; Nudity; On-line Sales; Personal Pages;Politics, Opinion & Religion; Portal Sites; Self-Help/Health; Sex; Sports; Travel; UsenetNews; and Webmail. Most importantly, no category definition used by filtering software companies is identicalto CIPA's definitions of visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, orharmfulto minors. And category definitions and categorization decisions are made withoutreference to local community standards. Moreover, there is no judicial involvement in the creation of filtering software companies' category definitions andno judicialdetermination is made before these companies categorize a Web page or site. Each filtering software company associates each URL in its control list with a ""tag""orother identifier that indicates the company's evaluation of whether the content or featuresof the Web site or page accessed via that URL meets one or more of its category definitions. If a user attempts to access a Web site or page that is blocked by the filter, theuserisimmediately presented with a screen that indicates that a block has occurred as  56   aresultof the operation of the filtering software. These ""denial screens"" appear only at thepointthat a user attempts to access a site or page in an enabled category. Allfour of the filtering programs on which evidence was presented allow users to customizethe category lists that exist on their own PCs or servers by adding or removing specificURLs. For example, if a public librarian charged with administering a library's Internetterminals comes across a Web site that he or she finds objectionable that is not blockedby the filtering program that his or her library is using, then the librarian may add thatURLto a category list that exists only on the library's network, and it would thereafterbe blocked under that category. Similarly, a customer may remove individual URLsfrom category lists. Importantly, however, no one but the filtering companies has accesstothe complete list of URLsin any category. The actual URLs or IP addresses of theWebsites or pages contained in filtering software vendors' category lists are considered to be proprietary information, and are unavailable for review by customers or thegeneral public, including the proprietors of Web sites that are blocked by filtering software.6 Filtering software companies do not generally notify the proprietors of Web sites whenthey block their sites. The only way to discover which URLs are blocked and whicharenot blocked by any particular filtering company is by testing individual URLs  Indeed, we granted leave for N2H2's counsel to intervene in order to object to testimony that would potentially reveal N2H2's trade secrets, which he did on several occasions. 57  6   withfiltering software, or by entering URLs one by one into the ""URL checker"" thatmost filteringsoftware companies provide on their Web sites. Filtering software companies willentertain requests for recategorization from proprietors of Web sites that discover theirsitesare blocked. Because new pages are constantly being added to the Web, filteringcompanies provide their customers with periodic updates of category lists. Once aparticular Web page or site is categorized, however, filtering companies generally do notre-review the contents of that page or site unless they receive a request to do so, even thoughthecontent on individual Web pages and sites changes frequently. 2. The Methods that Filtering Companies Use to Compile Category Lists While the way in which filtering programs operate is conceptually straightforward by comparing a requested URL to a previously compiled list of URLs and blocking accesstothe content at that URL if it appears on the list  accurately compiling and categorizing URLs to form the category lists is a more complex process that is impossible toconductwith any high degree of accuracy. The specific methods that filtering software companiesuse to compile and categorize control lists are, like the lists themselves, proprietary information. We will therefore set forth only general information on the varioustypes of methods that all filtering companies deposed in this case use, and the sourcesof error that are at once inherent in those methods and unavoidable given the currentarchitecture of the Internet and the current state of the art in automated classification systems. We base our understanding of these methods largely on the  58   detailedtestimony and expert report of Dr. Geoffrey Nunberg, which we credit. The plaintiffsoffered, and the Court qualified, Nunberg as an expert witness on automated classification systems.7 When compiling and categorizing URLs for their category lists, filtering software companies go through two distinct phases. First, they must collect or ""harvest"" the relevantURLs from the vast number of sites that exist on the Web. Second, they must sortthrough the URLs they have collected to determine under which of the company's self-defined categories (if any), they should be classified. These tasks necessarily result inatradeoff between overblocking (i.e., the blocking of content that does not meet the category definitions established by CIPA or by the filtering software companies), and underblocking (i.e., leaving off of acontrol list a URL that contains content that would meetthecategory definitions defined by CIPA or the filtering software companies). a. The ""H arvesting"" Phase Filtering software companies, given their limited resources, do not attempt to indexorclassify all of the billions of pages that exist on the Web. Instead, the set of pagesthatthey attempt to examine and classify is restricted to a small portion of the Web.  Geoffrey Nunberg (Ph.D., Linguistics, C.U.N.Y. 1977) is a researcher at the Center fortheStudy of Language and Information at Stanford University and a Consulting Full Professorof Linguistics at Stanford University. Until 2001, he was also a principal scientistat the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. His research centers on automated classification systems, with a focuson classifying documents on the Web with respect to theirlinguistic properties. He has published his research in numerous professional journals,including peer-reviewed journals. 59  7   Thecompanies use a variety of automated and manual methods to identify a universe of Websitesand pages to ""harvest"" for classification. These methods include: entering certainkey words into search engines; following links from a variety of online directories (e.g.,generalized directories like Yahoo or various specialized directories, such as those thatprovide links to sexually explicit content); reviewing lists of newly-registered domain names;buying or licensing lists of URLs from third parties; ""mining"" access logs maintained by their customers; and reviewing other submissions from customers andthe public. The goal of each of these methods is to identify as many URLs as possible that arelikely to contain content that falls within the filtering companies' category definitions. The first method, entering certain keywords into commercial search engines, suffersfrom several limitations. First, the Web pages that may be ""harvested"" through thismethod are limited to those pages that search engines have already identified. However,as noted above, a substantial portion of the Web is not even theoretically indexable(because it is not linked to by any previously known page), and only approximately 50% of the pages that are theoretically indexable have actually been indexedby search engines. We aresatisfied that the remainder of the indexable Web, and thevast""Deep Web,"" which cannot currently be indexed, includes materials that meet CIPA'scategories of visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, and harmful tominors. These portions of the Web cannot presently be harvested through the methods thatfiltering software companies use (except through reporting by customers or by  60   observingusers' log files), becausethey are not linked to other known pages. A usercan, however,gain access to a Web site in the unindexed Web or the Deep Web if the Web site'sproprietor or some other thirdparty informs the user of the site's URL. Some Web sites,forexample, send out mass email advertisements containing the site's URL, the spammingprocess we have described above. Second, the search engines that software companies use for harvesting are able to searchtextonly, not images. This is of critical importance, because CIPA, by its own terms,covers only ""visual depictions."" 20 U.S.C.  9134(f)(1)(A)(i); 47 U.S.C.  254(h)(5)(B)(i). Image recognition technology is immature, ineffective, and unlikely to improvesubstantially in the near future. None of the filtering software companies deposedinthis case employs imagerecognition technology when harvesting or categorizing URLs. Due to the reliance on automated text analysis and the absence of imagerecognition technology, a Web page with sexually explicit images and no text cannotbeharvested using a search engine. This problem is complicated by the fact that Websitepublishers may use image files rather than text to represent words, i.e., they may useafilethat computers understand to be a picture, like a photograph of a printed word, ratherthan regular text, making automated review of their textual content impossible. For example,if the Playboy Web site displays its name using a logo rather than regular text, a searchengine would not see or recognize the Playboy name in that logo. Inaddition to collecting URLs through search engines and Web directories  61   (particularly those specializing in sexually explicit sites or other categories relevant to one of thefiltering companies' category definitions), and by mining user logs and collecting URLssubmitted by users, the filtering companies expand their list of harvested URLs by using""spidering"" software that can""crawl"" the lists of pages produced by the previous fourmethods, following their links downward to bring back the pages to which they link (andthepages to which those pages link, and so on, but usually down only a few levels). Thisspidering software uses the same type of technology that commercial Web search enginesuse. While useful in expanding the number of relevant URLs, the ability to retrieve additionalpages through this approach is limited by the architectural feature of the Web thatpage-to-page links tend to converge rather than diverge. That means that the more pagesfrom which one spiders downward through links, the smaller the proportion of new sitesonewill uncover; if spidering the links of 1000 sites retrieved through a search engineorWeb directory turns up 500 additional distinct adult sites, spidering an additional1000 sites may turn up, for example, only 250 additional distinct sites, and the proportionof new sites uncovered will continue to diminish as more pages are spidered. These limitations on the technology used to harvest a set of URLs for review will necessarily lead to substantial underblocking of material with respect to both the category definitionsemployed by filtering software companies and CIPA's definitions of visual depictionsthat are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors.  62   b. The ""W innow ing"" or Categorization Phase Once the URLs have been harvested, some filtering software companies use automatedkey word analysis tools to evaluate the content and/or features of Web sites or pagesaccessed via a particular URL and to tentatively prioritize or categorize them. This processmay be characterized as ""winnowing"" the harvested URLs. Automated systems currently used by filtering software vendors to prioritize, and to categorize or tentatively categorizethe content and/or features of a Web site or page accessed via a particular URL operateby means of (1) simple key word searching, and (2) the use of statistical algorithmsthat rely on the frequency and structure of various linguistic features in a Web page'stext. The automated systems used to categorize pages do not include image recognition technology. All of the filtering companies deposed in the case also employ humanreview of some or all collected Web pages at some point during the process of categorizing Web pages. As with the harvesting process, each technique employed in the winnowing process is subject to limitations that can result in both overblocking and underblocking. First, simple key-word-based filters are subject to the obvious limitation that no stringof words can identify all sites that contain sexually explicit content, and most stringsof words are likely to appear in Web sites that are not properly classified as containingsexually explicit content. As noted above, filtering software companies also usemoresophisticated automated classification systems for the statistical classification of  63   texts. These systems assign weights to words or other textual features and use algorithms todetermine whether a text belongs to a certain category. These algorithms sometimes makereference to the position of a word within a text or its relative proximity to other words. The weights are usually determined by machine learning methods (often describedas ""artificial intelligence""). In this procedure, which resembles an automated form of trial and error, a system is given a ""training set"" consisting of documents preclassified into two or more groups, along with a set of features that might be potentially useful in classifying the sets. The system then ""learns"" rules that assign weightstothose features accordingto how well they work in classification, and assigns eachnewdocument to a category with a certain probability. Notwithstanding their ""artificial intelligence"" description, automated text classification systems are unable to grasp many distinctions between types of contentthat wouldbeobvious to a human. And of critical importance, no presently conceivable technology can make the judgments necessary to determine whether a visual depiction fits thelegaldefinitions of obscenity, child pornography, or harmful to minors. Finally, all the filtering software companies deposed in this case use some form of humanreview in their process of winnowing and categorizing Web pages, although one company admitted to categorizing some Web pages without any human review. SmartFilter states that ""the final categorization of every Web site is done by a human reviewer."" Another filtering company asserts that of the 10,000 to 30,000 Web pages that  64   enterthe""work queue"" to be categorized each day, two to three percent of those are automatically categorized by their PornByRef system (which only applies to materials classifiedin the pornography category), and the remainder are categorized by human review. SurfControl also states that no URL is ever added to its database without human review. Human review of Web pages has the advantage of allowing more nuanced, if not moreaccurate, interpretations than automated classification systems are capable of making,but suffers from its own sources of error. The filtering software companies involvedhere have limited staff, of between eight and a few dozen people, available for handreviewing Web pages. The reviewers that are employed by these companies base theircategorization decisions on both the text and the visual depictions that appear on the sitesorpages they are assigned to review. Human reviewers generally focus on English languageWeb sites, and are generally not required to be multi-lingual. Given the speed at which human reviewers must work to keep up with even a fractionof the approximately 1.5 million pages added to the publicly indexable Web each day,human error is inevitable. Errors are likely to result from boredom or lack of attentiveness, overzealousness, or adesire to ""err on the side of caution"" by screening out materialthat might be offensive to some customers, even if it does not fit within any of thecompany's category definitions. None of the filtering companies trains its reviewers inthelegal definitions concerning what is obscene, child pornography, or harmful to  65   minors,and none instructs reviewers to take community standards into account when makingcategorization decisions. Perhaps because of limitations on the number of human reviewers and because of thelargenumber of new pages that are added to the Web every day, filtering companies alsowidely engage in the practice of categorizing entire Web sites at the ""root URL,"" ratherthan engaging in a more fine-grained analysis of the individual pages within a Web site. Forexample, the filtering software companies deposed in this case all categorize the entirePlayboy Web site as Adult, Sexually Explicit, or Pornography. They do not differentiate between pages within the site containing sexually explicit images or text, and forexample, pages containing no sexually explicit content, such as the text of interviews of celebrities or politicians. If the ""root"" or ""top-level"" URL of a Web site is given a category tag, then access to all content on that Web site will be blocked if the assigned category is enabled by a customer. Insome cases, whole Web sites are blocked because the filtering companies focus only onthe content of the home page that is accessed by entering the root URL. Entire Websitescontaining multiple Web pages are commonly categorized without human reviewof each individual page on that site. Web sites that may contain multiple Web pagesandthat require authentication or payment for access are commonly categorized basedsolely on a human reviewer's evaluation of the pages that may be viewed prior to reachingthe authentication or payment page.  66   Because there may be hundreds or thousands of pages under a root URL, filtering companies make it their primary mission to categorize the root URL, and categorize subsidiary pages if the need arises or if there is time. This form of overblocking is called ""inheritance,"" because lower-level pages inherit the categorization of the root URL withoutregard to their specific content. In some cases, ""reverse inheritance"" also occurs, i.e.,parent sites inherit the classification of pages in a lower level of the site. This might happenwhen pages with sexual content appear in a Web site that is devoted primarily to non-sexual content. For example, N2H2's Bess filtering product classifies every page in theSalon.com Web site, which contains a wide range of news and cultural commentary, as""Sex,Profanity,"" based on the fact that the site includes a regular column that deals withsexual issues. Blocking by both domain name and IP address is another practice in which filteringcompanies engage that is afunction both of the architecture of the Web and of theexigencies of dealing with the rapidly expanding number of Web pages. The category listsmaintained by filtering software companies can include URLs in either their humanreadabledomain name address form, their numeric IP address form, or both. Through ""virtualhosting"" services, hundreds of thousands of Web sites with distinct domain namesmay share a single numeric IP address. To the extent that filtering companies blocktheIP addresses of virtual hosting services, they will necessarily block a substantial amountof content without reviewing it, and will likely overblock a substantial amount of  67   content. Another technique that filtering companies use in order to deal with a structural featureof the Internet is blocking the root level URLs of so-called ""loophole"" Web sites. TheseareWeb sites that provide access to a particular Web page, but display in the user's browseraURL that is different from the URL with which the particular page is usually associated. Because of this feature,they provide a ""loophole"" that can be used to get aroundfiltering software, i.e., they display a URL that is different from the one that appearson the filtering company's control list. ""Loophole"" Web sites include caches of Webpages that have been removedfrom their original location, ""anonymizer"" sites, and translationsites. Caches are archived copies that some search engines, such as Google, keep of the Webpages they index. The cachedcopy stored by Google will have a URL that is differentfrom the original URL. Because Web sites often change rapidly, caches are the only way to access pages that have been taken down, revised, or have changed their URLs forsomereason. For example, a magazine might place its current stories under a given URL,andreplace them monthly with new stories. If a user wanted to find an article publishedsix months ago, he or she would be unable to access it if not for Google's cachedversion. Some sites on the Web serve as a proxy or intermediary between a user and anotherWeb page. When using a proxy server, a user does not access the page from its  68   originalURL, but rather from the URL of the proxy server. One type of proxy service is an""anonymizer."" Users may access Web sites indirectly via an anonymizer when they do notwantthe Web site they are visiting to be able to determine the IP address from which they areaccessing the site, or to leave ""cookies"" on their browser.8 Some proxy servers canbeused to attempt to translate Web page content from one language to another. Ratherthan directly accessing the original Web page in its original language, users can insteadindirectly access the page via a proxy server offering translation features. Asnoted above, filtering companies often block loophole sites, such as caches, anonymizers, and translation sites. The practice of blocking loophole sites necessarily resultsina significant amount of overblocking, because the vast majority of the pages thatarecached, for example, do not contain content that would match a filtering company'scategory definitions. Filters that do not block these loophole sites, however, may enable users to access any URL on the Web via the loophole site, thus resulting in substantial underblocking. c. The Process for ""Re-Review ing"" W eb Pages After Their Initial Categorization Most filtering software companies do not engage in subsequent reviews of categorized sites or pages on a scheduled basis. Priority is placed on reviewing and  A""cookie"" is ""a small file or part of a file stored on a World Wide Web user's computer,created and subsequently read by a Web site server, and containing personal information (as a user identification code, customized preferences, or a record of pages visited)."" Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, available at http://www.mw.com/dictionary.htm. 69  8   categorizing new sites and pages, rather than on re-reviewing already categorized sites andpages. Typically, a filtering software vendor's previous categorization of a Website isnotre-reviewed for accuracy when new pages are added to the Web site. To the extent theWebsite was previously categorized as a whole, the new pages added to the site usually share the categorization assigned by the blocking product vendor. This necessarily results in both over- and underblocking, because, as noted above, the content of Webpages and Web sites changes relatively rapidly. Inaddition to the content onWeb sites or pages changing rapidly, Web sites themselves may disappear and be replaced by sites with entirely different content. If an IPaddressassociated with a particular Web site is blocked under a particular category and theWebsite goes out of existence, then the IP address likely would be reassigned to a differentWeb site, either by an Internet service provider or by a registration organization, suchastheAmerican Registry for Internet Numbers, see http://www.arin.net. In that case,thesite that received the reassigned IP address would likely be miscategorized. Becausefiltering companies do not engage in systematic re-review of their category lists, suchasitewould likely remain miscategorized unless someone submitted it to the filteringcompany for re-review, increasing the incidence of over- and underblocking. This failure to re-review Web pages primarily increases a filtering company'srate of overblocking. However, if a filtering company does not re-review Web pages after it determines that they do not fall intoany of its blocking categories, then that would result  70   inunderblocking (because, for example, a page might add sexually explicit content). 3. The Inherent Tradeoff Betw een O verblocking and Underblocking There is an inherent tradeoff between any filter's rate of overblocking (which information scientists also call ""precision"") and its rate of underblocking (which is also referredtoas ""recall""). The rate of overblocking or precision is measured by the proportionof the things a classification system assigns to a certain category that are appropriately classified. The plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Nunberg, provided the hypothetical exampleof a classification system that is asked to pick out pictures of dogs from a databaseconsisting of 1000 pictures of animals, of which 80 were actually dogs. If it returned100 hits, of which 80 were in fact pictures of dogs, and the remaining 20 were picturesof cats, horses, and deer, we would say that the system identified dog pictures withaprecision of 80%. This would be analogous to a filter that overblocked at a rate of 20%. The recall measure involves determining what proportion of the actual members of acategory the classification system has been able to identify. For example, if the hypothetical animal-picture database contained a total of 200 pictures of dogs, and the system identified 80 of them and failed to identify 120, it would have performed with a recallof 40%. This would be analogous to a filter that underblocked 60% of the material inacategory.  In automated classification systems, there is always a tradeoff between precision  71   and recall. In the animal-picture example, the recall could be improved by using a looser set of criteria to identify the dog pictures in the set, such as any animal with four legs, and all the dogs would be identified, but cats and other animals would also be included, with a resulting loss of precision. The same tradeoff exists between rates of overblocking and underblocking in filtering systems that use automated classification systems. For example, an automated system that classifies any Web page that contains the word ""sex"" as sexually explicit will underblock much less, but overblock much more, than a system that classifies any Web page containing the phrase ""free pictures of people having sex"" as sexually explicit. This tradeoff between overblocking and underblocking also applies not just to automated classification systems, but also to filters that use only human review. Given the approximately two billion pages that exist on the Web, the 1.5 million new pages that are added daily, and the rate at which content on existing pages changes, if a filtering company blocks only those Web pages that have been reviewed by humans, it will be impossible, as a practical matter, to avoid vast amounts of underblocking. Techniques used by human reviewers such as blocking at the IP address level, domain name level, or directory level reduce the rates of underblocking, but necessarily increase the rates of overblocking, as discussed above. To use a simple example, it would be easy to design a filter intended to block sexually explicit speech that completely avoids overblocking. Such a filter would have  72   only a single sexually explicit Web site on its control list, which could be re-reviewed daily to ensure that its content does not change. While there would be no overblocking problem with such a filter, such a filter would have a severe underblocking problem, as it would fail to block all the sexually explicit speech on the Web other than the one site on its control list. Similarly, it would also be easy to design a filter intended to block sexually explicit speech that completely avoids underblocking. Such a filter would operate by permitting users to view only a single Web site, e.g., the Sesame Street Web site. While there would be no underblocking problem with such a filter, it would have a severe overblocking problem, as it would block access to millions of non-sexually explicit sites on the Web other than the Sesame Street site. While it is thus quite simple to design a filter that does not overblock, and equally simple to design a filter that does not underblock, it is currently impossible, given the Internet's size, rate of growth, rate of change, and architecture, and given the state of the art of automated classification systems, to develop a filter that neither underblocks nor overblocks a substantial amount of speech. The more effective a filter is at blocking Web sites in a given category, the more the filter will necessarily overblock. Any filter that is reasonably effective in preventing users from accessing sexually explicit content on the Web will necessarily block substantial amounts of non-sexually explicit speech. 4. Attempts to Quantify Filtering Programs' Rates of Over- and Underblocking The government presented three studies, two from expert witnesses, and one from  73   alibrarianfact witness who conducted a study using Internet use logs from his own library,that attempt to quantify the over- and underblocking rates of five different filteringprograms. The plaintiffs presented one expert witness who attempted to quantify theratesof over- and underblocking for various programs. Each of these attempts to quantify rates of over- and underblocking suffers from various methodological flaws. The fundamental problem with calculating over- and underblocking rates is selectinga universe of Web sites or Web pages to serve as the set to be tested. The studiesthat the parties submitted in this case took two different approaches to this problem. Two of the studies, one prepared by the plaintiffs' expert witness Chris Hunter, agraduatestudent at the University of Pennsylvania, and the other prepared by the defendants' expert, Chris Lemmons of eTesting Laboratories, in Research Triangle Park, NorthCarolina, approached this problem by compiling two separate lists of Web sites, oneof URLs that they deemed should be blocked according to the filters' criteria, and anotherof URLs that they deemed should not be blocked according to the filters' criteria. They compiled these lists by choosing Web sites from the results of certain key word searches.9 The problem with this selection method is that it is neither random, nor does it Hunter drew three different ""samples"" for his test. The first consisted of ""50 randomly generated Web pages from the Webcrawler search engine."" The ""second sampleof 50 Web pages was drawn from searches for the terms `yahoo, warez, hotmail, sex,andMP3,' using the AltaVista.com search engine."" And the ""final sample of 100 Websiteswas drawn from the sitesof organizations who filed amicus briefs in support of theACLU's challenges to the Community [sic] Decency Act (CDA) and COPA [the Children's Online Protection Act], and from Internet portals, political Web sites, feminist Websites,hate speech sites, gambling sites, religious sites, gay pride/homosexual sites, 74 9   necessarily approximate the universe of Web pages that library patrons visit. The two other studies, one by David Biek, head librarian at the Tacoma Public Library'smain branch, and one by Cory Finnell of Certus Consulting Group, of Seattle, Washington, chose actual logs of Web pages visited by library patrons during specific timeperiods as the universe of Web pages to analyze. This method, while surely notas accurateas a truly random sample of the indexed Web would be (assuming it would be possibletotake such a sample), hasthe virtue of using the actual Web sites that library patronsvisited during a specific period. Because library patrons selected the universe of Websitesthat Biek and Finnell's studies analyzed, this removes the possibility of bias resultingfrom the study author's selection of the universe of sites to be reviewed. We findthatthe Lemmons and Hunter studies are of little probative value because of the methodology used to select the sample universe of Web sites to be tested. We will alcohol,tobacco, and drug sites, pornography sites, new sites, violent game sites, safe sex sites,andpro and anti-abortion sites listed on the popular Web directory, Yahoo.com."" Lemmons testified that he compiled the list of sexually explicit sites that should havebeenblocked by entering the terms ""free adult sex, anal sex, oral sex, fisting lesbians,gay sex, interracial sex, big tits, blow job, shaved pussy, and bondage"" into the Googlesearch engine and then ""surfing"" through links from pages generated by the list of sitesthatthe search engine returned. Using this method, he compiled a list of 197 sites thathedetermined should be blocked according to the filtering programs' category definitions. Lemmons also attempted to compile a list of ""sensitive"" Web sites that, althoughthey should not have been blocked according to the filtering programs' category definitions, might have been mistakenly blocked. In order to do this, he used the same methodof entering terms into the Google search engine and surfing through the results. Heusedthe following terms to compile this list: ""breast feeding, bondages, fetishes, ebony,gay issues, women's health,lesbian, homosexual, vagina, vaginal dryness, pain, analcancer, teen issues, safe sex, penis, pregnant, interracial, sex education, penis enlargement, breast enlargement, . . . and shave."" 75   thereforefocus on the studies conducted by Finnell and Biek in trying to ascertain estimatesof the rates of over- and underblocking that takes place when filters are used in publiclibraries. The government hired expert witness Cory Finnell to study the Internet logs compiledby the public libraries systems in Tacoma, Washington; Westerville, Ohio;and Greenville, South Carolina. Each of these libraries uses filtering software that keeps a log of information about individual Web site requests made by library patrons. Finnell, whoseconsulting firm specializes in data analysis, has substantial experience evaluating Internetaccess logs generated on networked systems. He spent more than a year developing a reporting tool for N2H2, and, in the course of that work, acquired a familiarity with the design and operation of Internet filtering products. The Tacoma library uses Cyber Patrol filtering software, and logs information only onsitesthat were blocked. Finnell worked from a list of all sites that were blocked in the Tacomapublic library in the monthof August 2001. The Westerville library uses the Websensefiltering product, and logs information on both blocked sites and non-blocked sites. When the logs reach a certain size, they are overwritten by new usage logs. Becauseof this overwriting feature, logs were available to Finnell only for the relatively shortperiod from October 1, 2001 to October 3, 2001. The Greenville library uses N2H2'sfiltering product and logs both blocked sites and sites that patrons accessed. The logscontain more than 500,000 records per day. Because of the volume of the records,  76   Finnellrestricted his analysis to the period from August 2, 2001 to August 15, 2001. Finnell calculated an overblocking rate for each of the three libraries by examining thehostWeb site containing each of the blocked pages. He did not employ a sampling technique,but instead examined each blocked Web site. If the contents of a host Web site orthepages within the Web site were consistent with the filtering product's definition of thecategory under which the site was blocked, Finnell considered it to be an accurate block. Finnell and three others, two of whom were temporary employees, examined the Websitesto determine whether they were consistent with the filtering companies' category definitions. Their review was, of course, necessarily limited by: (1) the clarity of thefiltering companies' category definitions; (2) Finnell's and his employees' interpretations of the definitions; and (3) human error. The study's reliability is also undercutby the fact that Finnell failed to archive the blocked Web pages as they existed eitheratthe point that a patron in one of the three libraries was denied access or when Finnelland his team reviewed the pages. It is therefore impossible for anyone to check theaccuracy and consistency of Finnell's review team, or to know whether the pages containedthe same content when the block occurred as they did when Finnell's team reviewedthem. This is a key flaw, because the results of the study depend on individual determinations as to overblocking and underblocking, in which Finnell and his team were requiredto compare what they saw on the Web pages that they reviewed with standard definitionsprovided by the filtering company.  77   Tacoma library's Cyber Patrol software blocked 836 unique Web sites during the monthof August. Finnell determined that 783 of those blocks were accurate and that 53 wereinaccurate. 10  The error rate for Cyber Patrol was therefore estimated to be 6.34%,  andthetrue error rate was estimated with 95% confidence to lie within the range of 4.69%to7.99%. 11  Finnell and his team reviewed 185 unique Web sites that were blocked  by Westerville Library's Websensefilter during the logged period and determined that 158of them were accurate and that 27 of them were inaccurate. He therefore estimated theWebsense filter's overblocking rate at 14.59% with a 95% confidence interval of 9.51%to19.68%. Additionally, Finnell examined 1,674 unique Web sites that were blockedby the Greenville Library's N2H2 filter during the relevant period and determined that 1,520 were accurate and that 87 were inaccurate. This yields an estimatedoverblocking rate of 5.41% and a 95% confidence interval of 4.33% to 6.55%. Finnell's methodology was materially flawed in that it understates the rate of overblocking for the following reasons. First, patrons from the three libraries knew that If separate patrons attempted to reach the same Web site, or one or more patrons attemptedto access more than one page on a single Web site, Finnell counted these attemptsas a single block. For example, the total number of blocked requests for Web pagesatTacoma Library during the logged period was 2,812, but Finnell counted this as only 895blocks of unique Web sites. Of the 895 unique blocked sites, Finnell was unable toaccess59, yielding 836 unique blocked sites for his team to review. Theconfidence intervals that Finnell calculated represent the range of percentages withinwhich we can be 95% confident that the actual rate of overblocking in that particularlibrary falls. We note that these confidence intervals assume that the time periodforwhich the study assessed the library's internet logs constitutes a random and representative sample. 78 11 10   thefilterswere operating, and may have been deterred from attempting to access Web sitesthatthey perceived to be ""borderline"" sites, i.e., those that may or may not have been appropriately filtered according to the filtering companies' category definitions. Second, intheircross-examination of Finnell, the plaintiffs offered screen shots of a number of Websitesthat, according to Finnell, had been appropriately blocked, but that Finnell admittedcontained only benign materials. Finnell's explanation was that the Web sites musthavechanged between the time when he conducted the study and the time of the trial,butbecause he did not archive the images as they existed when his team reviewed them forthe study, there is no way to verify this. Third, because of the way in which Finnellcounted blocked Web sites  i.e., if separate patrons attempted to reach the same Website,or one or more patrons attempted to access more than one page on a single Web site,Finnell counted these attempts as a single block, see supra note 10  his results necessarily understate the number of times that patrons were erroneously denied access to information. Atall events, there is no doubt that Finnell's estimated rates of overblocking, whicharebased on the filtering companies' own category definitions, significantly understatethe rate of overblocking with respect to CIPA's category definitions for filteringfor adults. The filters used in the Tacoma, Westerville, and Greenville libraries wereconfigured to block, among other things, images of full nudity and sexually explicit materials. There is no dispute, however, that these categories are far broader than CIPA's  79   categoriesof visual depictions that are obscene, or child pornography, the two categories of material that libraries subject to CIPA must certify that they filter during adults' use of theInternet. Finnell's study also calculated underblocking rates with respect to the Westerville andGreenville Libraries (both of which logged not only their blocked sites, but all sites visitedby their patrons), by taking random samples of URLs from the list of sites that werenotblocked. The study used a sample of 159 sites that were accessed by Westerville patronsand determined that only one of them should have been blocked under the software's category definitions, yielding an underblocking rate of 0.6%. Given the size of thesample, the 95% confidence interval is 0% to 1.86%. The study examined a sample of 254Websites accessed by patrons in Greenville and found that three of them should have beenblocked under the filtering software's category definitions. This results in an estimatedunderblocking rate of 1.2% with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 0% to 2.51%. Wedo not credit Finnell's estimates of the rates of underblocking in the Westerville and Greenville public libraries for several reasons. First, Finnell's estimates likely understate the actual rate of underblocking because patrons, who knew that filtering programswere operating in the Greenville and Westerville Libraries, may have refrained from attempting to access sites with sexually explicit materials, or other contents that they knewwould probably meet a filtering program's blocked categories. Second, and most  80   importantly, we think that the formula that Finnell used to calculate the rate of underblocking in these two libraries is not as meaningful as the formula that information scientiststypically use to calculate a rate of recall, which we describe above in Subsection II.E.3. AsDr. Nunberg explained, the standard method that information scientists use to calculatearate of recall is to sort a set of items into two groups, those that fall into a particularcategory (e.g., those that should have been blocked by a filter) and those that do not. Therate of recall is then calculated by dividing the number of items that the system correctly identified as belonging to the category by the total number of items in the category. Inthe example above, we discussed a database that contained 1000 photographs. Assumethat 200 of these photographs were pictures of dogs. If, for example, a classification system designed to identify pictures of dogs identified 80 of the dog picturesand failed to identify 120, it would have performed with a recall rate of 40%. Thiswould be analogous to a filter that underblocked at a rate of 60%. To calculate the recallrateof the filters in the Westerville and Greenville public libraries in accordance withthestandard method described above, Finnell should have taken a sample of sites from thelibraries' Internet use logs(including both sites that were blocked and sites that werenot),and divided the number of sites in the sample that the filter incorrectly failed to blockby the total number of sites in the sample that should have been blocked. What Finnelldidinstead was to take a sample of sites that were not blocked, and divide the  81   totalnumber of sites in this sample by the number of sites in the sample that should have beenblocked. This made the denominator that Finnell used much larger than it would havebeenhad he used the standardmethod for calculating recall, consequently making theunderblocking rate that he calculated much lower than it would have been under the standardmethod. 12  Moreover, despite the relatively low rates of underblocking that Finnell's study found,librarians from several of the libraries proffered by defendants that use blocking products,including Greenville, Tacoma, and Westerville, testified that there are instances of underblocking in their libraries. No quantitative evidence was presented comparing theeffectiveness of filters and other alternative methods used by libraries to prevent patronsfrom accessing visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or in the caseof minors, harmful to minors. Biek undertook a similar study of the overblocking rates that result from the TacomaLibrary's use of the Cyber Patrol software. He began with the 3,733 individual  Toillustrate the two different methods, consider a random sample of 1010 web sites takenfrom a library's Internet use log, 10 of which fall within the category that a filter is intendedto block (e.g., pornography), and suppose that the filter incorrectly failed to block2of the 10 sites that it should have blocked and did not block any sites that should nothavebeen blocked. The standard method of quantifying the rate of underblocking woulddivide the number of sites inthe sample that the filter incorrectly failed to block by thenumber of sites in the sample that the filter should have blocked, yielding an underblocking rate in this example of 20%. Finnell's study, however, calculated the underblocking rate by dividing the number of sites that the filter incorrectly failed to blockby the total number of sites in the sample that were not blocked (whether correctly orincorrectly) yielding an underblocking rate in this example of only .2%. 82  12   blocksthat occurred in the TacomaLibrary in October 2000 and drew from this data set a random sample of 786 URLs. He calculated two rates of overblocking, one with respect totheTacoma Library's policy on Internet use  that the pictorial content of the site may notinclude ""graphic materials depicting full nudity and sexual acts which are portrayed obviously and exclusively for sensational or pornographic purposes""  and the other with respecttoCyber Patrol's own category definitions. He estimated that Cyber Patrol overblocked 4% of all Web pages in October 2000 with respect to the definitions of the TacomaLibrary's Internet Policy and 2% of all pages with respect to Cyber Patrol's own category definitions. 13  Itis difficult to determine how reliable Biek's conclusions are, because he didnot keeprecords of the raw data that heused in his study; nor did he archive images of the Webpages as they looked when he made the determination whether they were properly classifiedby the Cyber Patrol program. Without this information, it is impossible to verify hisconclusions (or to undermine them). And Biek's study certainly understates CyberPatrol's overblocking rate for some of the same reasons that Finnell's study likely understates the true rates of overblocking used in the libraries that he studied. We also note that Finnell's study, which analyzed a set of Internet logs from the TacomaLibrary during which the same filtering program was operating with the same set of blocking categories enabled, found a significantly higher rate of overblocking than the According to Biek, the sample size that he used yielded a 95% confidence interval of plusorminus 3.11%. 83 13   Biekstudy did. Biek found a rate of overblocking of approximately 2% while the Finnell study estimated a 6.34% rate of overblocking. At all events, the category definitions employedby CIPA, at least with respect to adult use  visual depictions that are obscene orchildpornography  are narrower than the materials prohibited by the Tacoma Library policy,and therefore Biek's study understates the rate of overblocking with respect to CIPA'sdefinitions for adults. Insum, we think that Finnell's study, while we do not credit its estimates of underblocking, is useful because it states lower bounds with respect to the rates of overblocking that occurred when the Cyber Patrol, Websense, and N2H2 filters were operatingin public libraries. While these rates are substantial  between nearly 6% and 15%wethink, for the reasons stated above, that they greatly understate the actual rates of overblocking that occurs, and therefore cannot be considered as anything more than minimum estimates of the rates of overblocking that happens in all filtering programs. 5. Methods of Obtaining Examples of Erroneously Blocked Web Sites The plaintiffs assembled a list of several thousand Web sites that they contend were,atthe time of the study, likely to have been erroneously blocked by one or more of fourmajorcommercial filtering programs: SurfControl Cyber Patrol 6.0.1.47, N2H2 InternetFiltering 2.0, Secure Computing SmartFilter 3.0.0.01, and Websense Enterprise 4.3.0. They compiled this list using a two-step process. First, Benjamin Edelman, an expertwitness who testified before us, compiled a list of more than 500,000 URLs and  84   devisedaprogram to feed them through all four filtering programs in order to compile a listof URLs that might have been erroneously blocked by one or more of the programs. Second,Edelman forwarded subsets of the list that he compiled to librarians and professorsof library science whom the plaintiffs had hired to review the blocked sites for suitability in the public library context. Edelman assembled the list of URLs by compiling Web pages that were blocked by thefollowing categories in the four programs: Cyber Patrol: Adult/Sexually Explicit; N2H2:Adults Only, Nudity, Pornography, and Sex, with ""exceptions"" engaged in the categoriesof Education, For Kids, History, Medical, Moderated, and Text/Spoken Only; SmartFilter: Sex, Nudity, Mature, and Extreme; Websense: Adult Content, Nudity, and Sex. Edelman then assembled a database of Web sites for possible testing. He derived thislistby automatically compiling URLs from the Yahoo index of Web sites, taking them from categories from the Yahoo index that differed significantly from the classifications that he had enabled in each of the blocking programs (taking, for example, Websitesfrom Yahoo's ""Government"" category). He then expanded this list by entering URLstaken from the Yahoo index into the Google search engine's ""related"" search function,which provides the user with a list of similar sites. Edelman also included and Edelman is a Harvard University student and a systems administrator and multimedia specialist at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School. Despite Edelman's young age, he has been doing consulting work on Internetrelatedissues for nine years, since he was in junior high school. 85 14 14   excludedspecific Web sites at the request of the plaintiffs' counsel. Taking the list of more than 500,000 URLs that he had compiled, Edelman used an automated system that he had developed to test whether particular URLs were blocked by eachof the four filtering programs. This testing took place between February and October2001. He recorded the specific dates on which particular sites were blockedby particularprograms, and, using commercial archiving software, archived the contents of thehomepage of the blocked Web sites (and in some instances the pages linked to from thehomepage) as it existed when it was blocked. 15  Through this process, Edelman,  whosetestimony we credit, compiled a list of 6,777 URLs that were blocked by one or moreof the four programs. Because these sites were chosen from categories from the Yahoodirectory that were unrelated to the filtering categories that were enabled during thetest(i.e., ""Government"" vs. ""Nudity""), he reasoned that they were likely erroneously blocked. As explained in the margin, Edelman repeated his testing and discovered that CyberPatrol had unblocked most of the pages on the list of 6,777 after he had published thelistonhis Web site. His records indicate that an employee of SurfControl (the company that produces Cyber Patrol software) accessed his site and presumably checked outtheURLs on the list, thus confirming Edelman's judgment that the majority of URLs  Thearchiving process in some cases took up to 48 hours from when the page was blocked. 86  15   onthelistwere erroneously blocked.  16  Edelman forwarded the list of blocked sites to Dr. Joseph Janes, an Assistant Professorin the Information School of the University of Washington who also testified at trialasanexpert witness. Janes reviewed the sites that Edelman compiled to determine whetherthey are consistent with library collection development, i.e., whether they are sitestowhich a reference librarian would, consistent with professional standards, direct a patronasasource of information. 16 17  InOctober 2001, Edelman published the results of his initial testing on his Web site. InFebruary and March 2002 he repeated his testing of the 6,777 URLs originally foundtobe blocked by at least one of the blocking products, in order to determine whetherand to what extent the blocking product vendors had corrected the mistakes that hepublicized. Of those URLs blocked by N2H2 in the October 2001 testing, 55.10% remainedblocked when tested by Edelman in March 2002. Of those URLs blocked by Websensein the October 2001 testing, 76.28% remained blocked when tested by Edelmanin February 2002. Of those URLs blocked by SurfControl's Cyber Patrol product,only 7.16% remained blocked, i.e., Cyber Patrol had unblocked almost 93% of theWebpages originally blocked. Because the results posted to his Web site were accessedby an employee of SurfControl (as evidenced by Edelman's records of who was accessinghis Web site), we infer that Cyber Patrol had determined that 93% of all 6,777 pages,or6,302 Web pages, were originally wrongly blocked by the product. Twoother expert witnesses reviewed subsets of the list of Web pages that Edelman compiled. Dr. Michael T. Ryan, Director of the Rare Book and Manuscript Library and of theCenter for Electronic Text and Image at the University of Pennsylvania, reviewed a listof 204sites that Edelman forwarded to him in order to determine their appropriateness andusefulness in the library setting. Because the sites that Ryan reviewed were not selectedrandomly (i.e., they were chosen by plaintiffs' counsel), his study says little aboutthecharacter of the set of 6,777 sites that Edelman compiled, or the total amount of overblocking by the four filtering programs that Edelman used. Anne Lipow, a practicing librarian for more than 30 years and the director of a library consulting firm, also reviewed the same list of 204 URLs from the set that Edelmanhad collected for their appropriateness for a library's collection. She categorized sites in four different levels according to their appropriateness for a public 87 17   Edelman forwarded Janes a list of 6,775 Web sites, almost the entire list of blockedsites that he collected, from which Janes took a random sample of 859 usingthe SPSSstatistical software package. Janes indicated that he chose a sample size of 859 becauseitwould yield a 95% confidence interval of plus or minus 2.5%. Janes recruited agroupof 16 reviewers, most of whom were current or former students at the University of Washington's Information School, to help him identify which sites were appropriate forlibrary use. We describe the process that he used in the margin. 18  Due to  library'scollection. Again, becausethese URLs were not selected randomly, Lipow's study isnot particularly relevant to the total set that Edelman compiled, or to the total amountof overblocking by the fourfiltering programs that Edelman used. Although the methodology used to select the list of Web pages that was forwarded toRyanand Lipow is problematic, Ryan's and Lipow's testimony established that many of theerroneously blocked sites that Edelman identified would be useful and appropriate sourcesof information for library patrons. Allof the reviewers that Janes recruited had some relevant experience in library referenceservices or library collection development. Janes divided the reviewers into two groups,agroup of 11 less experienced reviewers, and a group of five more experienced reviewers. Janes assigned the less experienced group to do a first-round review with the purposeof identifying the most obviously overblocked sites. The more experienced groupwasto review the remaining sites (i.e., those that were not obviously overblocked) andtomake final decisions regarding these sites. Inthe first round, each person evaluated two sets of around 80 sites, and each groupwasevaluated by two different people. Each set of sites included the following instructions: Lookcarefully at each of the Web sites on the list. Please make a notation of any site that appearstomeet any of the following criteria: a.Contains information similar to that already found in libraries, or 88 18   theinability of a member of Janes's review team to complete the reviewing process, Janes hadtocut157 Web sites out of the sample, but because the Web sites were randomly assignedto reviewers, it is unlikely that these sites differed significantly from the rest of thesample. That left the sample size at 699, which widened the 95% confidence interval toplusorminus 2.8%. Of the total 699 sites reviewed, Janes's team concluded that 165 of them, or 23.6% percentof the sample, were not of any value in the library context (i.e., no librarian b.Contains information a librarian would want in the library if s/he had unlimited funds to purchase information and unlimited shelf space, or c.You would be willing to refer a patron (of any age) to the site if the patron appeared at a reference desk seeking information about the subject of thesite. For this last criterion, we recognize that you might not refer a young child to a Calculus site just because it would not be useful to that child, but you should ignore that factor. Informational sites, such as a Calculus site, should be noted. A site that is purely erotica should not be noted. Sitesthatreceived ""Yes"" votes from both reviewers were determined to be of sufficient interestina library context and removed from further analysis. Sites receiving one or two ""No""votes would go to the next round. In the first round, 243 sites received ""Yes"" votes from bothreviewers, while 456 sites received one or more ""No"" votes or could not be found. These 456 sites were sent forward to the second round of judging. Theinstructions for the second-round reviewers were the same as those given to thefirst-round reviewers, except that in section c, the following sentence was added: ""Sitesthathave a commercial purpose should be included here if they might be of use or interesttosomeone wishing to buy the product or service or doing research on commercial behavior on the Internet, much as most libraries include the Yellow Pages in theircollections."" The second round of review produced the following results: 60 sites couldnotbe found (due to broken links, 404 ""not found"" errors, domain for sale messages,etc.), 231 sites were judged ""Yes,"" and 165 judged ""No."" 89   would,consistent with professional standards, refer a patron to these sites as a source of information). They were unable to find 60 of the Web sites, or 8.6% of the sample. Therefore,they concluded that the remaining 474 Web sites, or 67.8% of the sample, wereexamples of overblocking with respect to materials that are appropriate sourcesof information in public libraries. Applying a 95% confidence interval of plus or minus 2.8%,thestudy concluded that we can be 95% confident that the actual percentage of sitesinthelist of 6,775 sites that are appropriate for use in public libraries is somewhere between65.0% and 70.6%. In other words, we can be 95% certain that the actual number of sitesout of the 6,775 that Edelman forwarded to Janes that are appropriate for use in publiclibraries (under Janes's standard) is somewhere between 4,403 and 4,783. The government raised some valid criticisms of Janes's methodology, attacking in particularthe fact that, while sites that received two ""yes"" votes in the first round of votingwere determined to be of sufficient interest in a library context to be removedfrom furtheranalysis, sites receiving oneor two ""no"" votes were sent to the next round. The government also correctly points out that results of Janes's study can be generalized only tothepopulation of 6,775 sites thatEdelman forwarded to Janes. Even taking these criticismsinto account, and discounting Janes's numbers appropriately, we credit Janes's study asconfirming that Edelman'sset of 6,775 Web sites contains at least a few thousandURLs that were erroneously blocked by one or more of the four filtering programsthat he used, whether judged against CIPA's definitions, the filters' own  90   category criteria, or against the standard that the Janes study used. Edelman tested only 500,000unique URLs out of the 4000 times that many, or two billion, that are estimated toexistinthe indexable Web. Even assuming that Edelman chose the URLs that were mostlikely to be erroneously blocked by commercial filtering programs, we conclude that many times the number of pages that Edelman identified are erroneously blocked by one ormoreof the filtering programs that he tested. Edelman's and Janes's studies provide numerous specific examples of Web pages thatwereerroneously blocked by one or more filtering programs. The Web pages that wereerroneously blocked by one or more of the filtering programs do not fall into any neatpatterns; they range widely in subject matter, and it is difficult to tell why they may havebeenoverblocked. The list that Edelman compiled, for example, contains Web pagesrelating to religion, politics and government, health, careers, education, travel, sports,andmany other topics. In the next section, we provide examples from each of thesecategories. 6. Examples of Erroneously Blocked Web Sites Several of the erroneously blocked Web sites had content relating to churches, religiousorders, religious charities, and religious fellowship organizations. These includedthe following Web sites: the Knights of Columbus Council 4828, a Catholic men'sgroup associated with St. Patrick's Church in Fallon, Nevada, http://msnhomepages.talkcity.com/SpiritSt/kofc4828, which was blocked by Cyber Patrol  91   inthe""Adult/Sexually Explicit"" category; the Agape Church of Searcy, Arkansas, http://www.agapechurch.com, which was blocked by Websense as ""Adult Content""; the homepageof the Lesbian and Gay Havurah of the Long Beach, California Jewish Community Center, http://www.compupix.com/gay/havurah.htm, which was blocked by N2H2as""Adults Only, Pornography,"" by Smartfilter as ""Sex,"" and by Websense as ""Sex"";Orphanage Emmanuel, a Christian orphanage in Honduras that houses 225 children, http://home8.inet.tele.dk/rfb_viva, which was blocked by Cyber Patrol in the ""Adult/Sexually Explicit"" category; Vision Art Online, which sells wooden wall hangings forthehome that contain prayers, passages from the Bible, and images of the Star of David, http://www.visionartonline.com, which was blocked in Websense's ""Sex"" category;and the home page of Tenzin Palmo, a Buddhist nun, which contained a description of her project to build a Buddhist nunnery and international retreat centerfor women, http://www.tenzinpalmo.com, which was categorized as ""Nudity"" by N2H2. Several blocked sites also contained information about governmental entities or specificpolitical candidates, or contained political commentary. These included: theWeb siteforKelley Ross, a Libertarian candidate for the California State Assembly, http://www.friesian.com/ross/ca40, which N2H2 blocked as ""Nudity""; the Web site for BobCoughlin, a town selectman inDedham, Massachusetts, http://www.bobcoughlin.org, which was blocked under N2H2's ""Nudity"" category; alist of Websites containing information about government and politics in Adams County,  92   Pennsylvania, http://www.geocities.com/adamscopa, which was blocked by Websense as ""Sex"";theWeb site for Wisconsin Right to Life, http://www.wrtl.org, which N2H2 blockedas ""Nudity""; a Web site that promotes federalism in Uganda, http://federo.com, whichN2H2 blocked as ""Adults Only, Pornography""; ""Fight the Death Penalty in the USA,""aDanish Web site dedicated to criticizing the American system of capital punishment, http://www.fdp.dk, which N2H2 blocked as ""Pornography""; and ""Dumb Laws,""ahumor Web site that makes fun of outmoded laws, http://www.dumblaws.com, whichN2H2 blocked under its ""Sex"" category. Erroneously blocked Web sites relating to health issues included the following: a guidetoallergies, http://www.x-sitez.com/allergy, which was categorized as ""Adults Only,Pornography"" by N2H2; a health question and answer site sponsored by Columbia University, http://www.goaskalice.com.columbia.edu, which was blocked as ""Sex"" by N2H2,andas ""Mature"" by Smartfilter; the Western Amputee Support Alliance Home Page, http://www.usinter.net/wasa, which was blocked by N2H2 as ""Pornography""; the Websiteof the Willis-Knighton Cancer Center, a Shreveport, Louisiana cancer treatment facility, http://cancerftr.wkmc.com,which was blocked by Websense under the ""Sex"" category;and a site dealing with halitosis, http://www.dreamcastle.com/tungs, whichwas blockedby N2H2 as ""Adults, Pornography,"" by Smartfilter as ""Sex,"" by Cyber Patrol as ""Adult/Sexually Explicit,"" and by Websense as ""Adult Content."" The filtering programs also erroneously blocked several Web sites having to do  93   witheducation and careers. The filtering programs blocked two sites that provide information on home schooling. ""HomEduStation  the Internet Source for Home Education,"" http://www.perigee.net/~mcmullen/homedustation/, was categorized by CyberPatrol as ""Adult/Sexually Explicit."" Smartfilter blocked ""Apricot: A Web site madeby and for home schoolers,"" http://apricotpie.com, as ""Sex."" The programs also miscategorized several career-related sites. ""Social Work Search,"" http://www.socialworksearch.com/, is a directory for social workers that Cyber Patrol placedinits ""Adult/Sexually Explicit"" category. The ""Gay and Lesbian Chamber of SouthernNevada,"" http://www.lambdalv.com, ""a forum for the business community to developrelationships within the Las Vegas lesbian, gay, transsexual, and bisexual community"" was blocked by N2H2as ""Adults Only, Pornography."" A site for aspiring dentists, http://www.vvm.com/~bond/home.htm, was blocked by Cyber Patrol in its ""Adult/Sexually Explicit"" category. The filtering programs erroneously blocked many travel Web sites, including: the Websitefor the Allen Farmhouse Bed & Breakfast of Alleghany County, North Carolina, http://planet-nc.com/Beth/index.html, which Websense blocked as ""Adult Content""; OdysseusGay Travel, a travel company serving gay men, http://www.odyusa.com, which N2H2categorized as ""Adults Only, Pornography""; Southern Alberta Fly Fishing Outfitters, http://albertaflyfish.com, which N2H2 blocked as ""Pornography""; and ""Nature andCulture Conscious Travel,"" a tour operator in Namibia, http://www.trans-namibia-  94   tours.com,which was categorized as ""Pornography"" by N2H2. The filtering programs also miscategorized a large number of sports Web sites. Theseincluded: a site devoted to Willie O'Ree, the first African-American player in the NationalHockey League, http://www.missioncreep.com/mw/oree.html, which Websense blockedunder its ""Nudity"" category; the home page of the Sydney University Australian FootballClub, http://www.tek.com.au/suafc, which N2H2 blocked as ""Adults Only, Pornography,"" Smartfilter blocked as ""Sex,"" Cyber Patrol blocked as ""Adult/Sexually Explicit""and Websense blocked as ""Sex""; and a fan's page devoted to the Toronto Maple Leafshockey team, http://www.torontomapleleafs.atmypage.com, which N2H2 blocked underthe""Pornography"" category. 7. Conclusion: The Effectiveness of Filtering Programs Public libraries have adopted a variety of means of dealing with problems created by theprovision of Internet access. The large amount of sexually explicit speech that is freely available on the Internet has,to varying degrees, led to patron complaints about suchmatters as unsought exposure to offensive material, incidents of staff and patron harassment by individuals viewing sexually explicit content on the Internet, and the use of library computers to access illegal material, such as child pornography. In some libraries, youthfullibrary patrons have persistently attempted to use the Internet to access hardcore pornography. Those public libraries that have responded to these problems by using software  95   filtershave found such filters to provide a relatively effective means of preventing patronsfrom accessing sexually explicit material on the Internet. Nonetheless, out of the entireuniverse of speech on the Internet falling within the filtering products' category definitions, the filters will incorrectly fail to block a substantial amount of speech. Thus, softwarefilters have not completely eliminated the problems that public libraries have soughttoaddress by using the filters, as evidenced by frequent instances of underblocking. Nor is there any quantitative evidence of the relative effectiveness of filtersandthe alternatives to filters that are also intended to prevent patrons from accessingillegal content on the Internet. Even more importantly (for this case), although software filters provide a relatively cheapandeffective, albeit imperfect, means for public libraries to prevent patrons from accessingspeech that falls within the filters' category definitions, we find that commercially available filtering programs erroneously block a huge amount of speech thatisprotected by the First Amendment. Any currently available filtering product that is reasonably effective in preventing users from accessing content within the filter's category definitions will necessarily block countless thousands of Web pages, the content of whichdoes not match the filtering company's category definitions, much less the legal definitionsof obscenity, child pornography, or harmful to minors. Even Finnell, an expertwitness for the defendants, found that between 6% and 15% of the blocked Web sitesinthepublic libraries that he analyzed did not contain content that meets even the  96   filteringproducts' own definitions of sexually explicit content, let alone CIPA's definitions. This phenomenon occurs fora number of reasons explicated in the more detailed findingsof fact supra. These include limitations on filtering companies' ability to: (1) harvestWeb pages for review; (2) review and categorize the Web pages that they have harvested;and (3) engage in regular re-review of the Web pages that they have previously reviewed. The primary limitations on filtering companies' ability to harvest Web pages forreview is that a substantial majority of pages on the Web are not indexable using the spideringtechnology that Web search engines use, and that together, search engines have indexedonly around half of the Web pages that are theoretically indexable. The fastrate of growthin the number of Web pages also limits filtering companies' ability to harvest pagesforreview. These shortcomings necessarily result in significant underblocking. Several limitations on filtering companies' ability to review and categorize the Webpages that they have harvested also contribute to over- and underblocking. First, automatedreview processes, even those based on ""artificial intelligence,"" are unable with any consistency to distinguish accurately material that falls within a category definition from material that does not. Moreover, human review of URLs is hampered by filtering companies' limited staff sizes, and by human error or misjudgment. In order to deal with thevastsize of the Web and its rapid rates of growth and change, filtering companies engageinseveral practices that are necessary to reduce underblocking, but inevitably  97   resultinoverblocking. These include: (1) blocking whole Web sites even when only a smallminority of their pages contain material that would fit under one of the filtering company'scategories (e.g., blocking the Salon.com site because it contains a sex column);(2) blocking by IP address (because a single IP address may contain many differentWeb sites and many thousands of pages of heterogenous content); and (3) blockingloophole sites such as translator sites and cache sites, which archive Web pages thathavebeen removed from the Web by their original publisher. Finally, filtering companies'failure to engage in regular re-review of Web pages thatthey have already categorized (or that they have determined do not fall into any category)results in a substantial amount of over- and underblocking. For example, Web publisherschange the contents of Web pages frequently. The problem also arises when a Websitegoes out of existence and its domain name or IP address is reassigned to a new Websitepublisher. In that case, a filtering company's previous categorization of the IP addressordomain name would likely be incorrect, potentially resulting in the over- or underblocking of many thousands of pages. The inaccuracies that result from these limitations of filtering technology are quite substantial. At least tens of thousands of pages of the indexable Web are overblocked by eachof the filtering programs evaluated by experts in this case, even when considered againstthe filtering companies' own category definitions. Many erroneously blocked pagescontain content that is completely innocuous for both adults and minors, and that no  98   rationalperson could conclude matches the filtering companies' category definitions, suchas""pornography"" or ""sex."" The number of overblocked sites is of course much higher with respect to the definitionsof obscenity and child pornography that CIPA employs for adults, since the filteringproducts' category definitions, such as ""sex"" and ""nudity,"" encompass vast amountsof Web pages that are neither child pornography nor obscene. Thus, the number of pagesof constitutionally protected speech blocked by filtering products far exceeds the many thousands of pages that are overblocked by reference to the filtering products' category definitions. Nopresently conceivable technology can make the judgments necessary to determinewhether a visual depiction fits the legal definitions of obscenity, child pornography, or harmful to minors. Given the state of the art in filtering and image recognition technology, and the rapidly changing and expanding nature of the Web, we findthatfiltering products' shortcomings will not be solved through a technical solution intheforeseeable future. 19 19  In sum,filtering products are currently unable to block only  Although it was not proffered as evidence in this trial, (and hence we do not rely on ittoinform our findings), we note that Youth, Pornography, and the Internet, a congressionally commissioned study by the National Research Council, a division of the NationalAcademies of Science, see Pub. L. 105-314, Title X, Sec. 901, comes to a conclusionsimilar to the one that we reach regarding the effectiveness of Internet filters. Thecommission concludes that: Allfiltersthose of today and for the foreseeable futuresuffer (and will suffer) from some degree of overblocking (blocking content that should be allowed through) and some degree of underblocking (passing content that 99   visualdepictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors (or, only contentmatching a filtering product's category definitions) while simultaneously allowingaccess to all protected speech (or, all content not matching the blocking product'scategory definitions). Any software filter that is reasonably effective in blockingaccess to Web pages that fall within its category definitions will necessarily erroneously block a substantial number of Web pages that do not fall within its category definitions. III. Analytic Framework for the Opinion: The Centrality of Dole and the Role of the Facial Challenge Both the plaintiffs and the government agree that, because this case involves a challengeto the constitutionality of the conditions that Congress has set on state actors' receiptof federal funds, the Supreme Court's decision in South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203(1987), supplies the proper threshold analytic framework. The constitutional source of Congress's spending power is Article I,  8, cl. 1, which provides that ""Congress shall havePower . . . to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfareof the United States."" In Dole, the Court upheld the constitutionality of a federal should not be allowed through). While the extent of overblocking and underblocking will vary with the product (and may improve over time), underblocking and overblocking result from numerous sources, including thevariability in the perspectives that humans bring to the task of judging content. Youth,Pornography, and the Internet (Dick Thornburgh & Herbert S. Lin, eds., 2002), availableat http://bob.nap.edu/html/youth_internet/. 100   statuterequiring the withholding of federal highway funds from any state with a drinking agebelow21. Id. at 211-12. In sustaining the provision's constitutionality, Dole articulated four general constitutional limitations on Congress's exercise of the spending power. First, ""the exercise of the spending power must be in pursuit of `the general welfare.'"" Id. at 207. Second, any conditions that Congress sets on states' receipt of federalfunds must be sufficiently clear to enable recipients ""to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of their participation."" Id. (internal quotation marksandcitation omitted). Third, the conditions on the receipt of federal funds must bearsomerelation to the purpose of the funding program. Id. And finally, ""other constitutional provisions may provide an independent bar to the conditional grant of federalfunds."" Id. at 208. In particular, the spending power ""may not be used to induce theStatesto engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional. Thus, for example,agrant of federal funds conditioned on invidiously discriminatory state action or theinfliction of cruel and unusual punishment would be an illegitimate exercise of the Congress'broad spending power."" Id. at 210. Plaintiffs do not contend that CIPA runs afoul of the first three limitations. However,they do allege that CIPA is unconstitutional under the fourth prong of Dole becauseitwill induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment. 20 20  Plaintiffs  Because we find that the plaintiff public libraries are funded and controlled by state andlocalgovernments, they are state actors, subject to the constraints of the First 101   thereforesubmit that the First Amendment ""provide[s] an independent bar to the conditional grant of federal funds"" created by CIPA. Id. at 208. More specifically, they arguethatby conditioning public libraries' receipt of federal funds on the use of software filters,CIPA will induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment rights of Internet content-providers to disseminate constitutionally protected speech to library patrons via theInternet, and the correlative First Amendment rights of public library patrons to receiveconstitutionally protected speech on the Internet. 21  Thegovernment concedes that under the Dole framework, CIPA is facially invalid if itsconditions will induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment. The government and the plaintiffs disagree, however, on the meaning of Dole's ""inducement"" requirement in the context of a First Amendment facial challenge to the conditions that Congressplaces on state actors' receipt of federal funds. The government contends that becauseplaintiffs are bringing a facial challenge, they must show that under no circumstances is it possible for a public library to comply with CIPA's conditions without  Amendment, as incorporated by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. TheSupreme Court has recognized that the First Amendment encompasses not only therighttospeak, but also the right to receive information. See Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844,874(1997) (invalidating a statute because it ""effectively suppresses a large amount of speechthat adults have a constitutional right to receive and to address to one another""); Stanleyv.Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 564 (1969) (""[The] right to receive information and ideas,regardless of their social worth . . . is fundamental to our free society.""); see also Bd.ofEduc. v. Pico, 457 U.S. 853, 867-68 (1982) (plurality opinion) (""[T]he right to receiveideas follows ineluctably from the sender's First Amendment right to send them.""). 102 21   violatingthe First Amendment. The plaintiffs respond that even if it is possible for some publiclibraries to comply with CIPA without violating the First Amendment, CIPA is facially invalid if it ""will result in the impermissible suppression of a substantial amount of protected speech."" Because it was clear in Dole that the states could comply with the challenged conditionsthat Congress attached to the receipt of federal funds without violating the Constitution, the Dole Court did not have occasion to explain fully what it means for Congressto use the spending power to ""induce [recipients] to engage in activities that wouldthemselves be unconstitutional."" Dole, 483 U.S. at 210; see id. at 211 (""Were SouthDakota to succumb to the blandishments offered by Congress and raise its drinking ageto21,the State's action in so doing would not violate the constitutional rights of anyone.""). Although the proposition that Congress may not pay state actors to violate citizens'First Amendment rights is unexceptionable when stated in the abstract, it is unclearwhat exactly a litigant must establish to facially invalidate an exercise of Congress's spending power on this ground. Ingeneral, it is well-established that a court may sustain a facial challenge to a statuteonly if the plaintiff demonstrates that the statute admits of no constitutional application. See United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987) (""A facial challenge toalegislative Act is, of course, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since thechallenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act  103   wouldbevalid.""); see also Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 612 (1988) (""It has not been theCourt's practice, in consideringfacial challenges to statutes of this kind, to strike them down in anticipation that particular applications may result in unconstitutional use of funds."") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). First Amendment overbreadth doctrine creates a limited exception to this ruleby permittingfacial invalidation of a statute that burdens a substantial amount of protected speech,even if the statute may be constitutionally applied in particular circumstances. ""TheConstitution gives significant protection from overbroad laws that chill speech withintheFirst Amendment's vast and privileged sphere. Under this principle, [a law] is unconstitutional on its face if it prohibits a substantial amount of protected expression."" Ashcroftv.Free Speech Coalition, 122 S. Ct. 1389, 1399 (2002); see also Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 612 (1973). This more liberal test of a statute's facial validity undertheFirst Amendment stems from the recognition that where a statute's reach contemplates a number of both constitutional and unconstitutional applications, the law's sanctionsmay deter individuals from challenging the law's validity by engaging in constitutionally protected speech that may nonetheless be proscribed by the law. Without anoverbreadth doctrine, ""the contours of regulation would have to be hammered outcase by caseand tested only by those hardy enough to risk criminal prosecution to determine theproperscope of regulation."" Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 487 (1965); see also Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491, 503 (1985) (""[A]n individual  104   whoseown speech or expressive conduct may validly be prohibited or sanctioned is permittedto challenge a statute on its face because it also threatens others not beforethe courtthose who desire to engage in legally protected expression but who may refrain from doing so rather than risk prosecution or undertake to have the law declared partially invalid.""). Plaintiffs argue that the overbreadth doctrine is applicable here, since CIPA ""threatensto chill free speech  because it will censor a substantial amount of protected speech,because it is vague, and because the law creates a prior restraint . . . ."" Unlike the statutestypically challenged as facially overbroad, however, CIPA does not impose criminalpenalties on those who violate its conditions. Cf. Freedom of Speech Coalition, 122S.Ct.at 1398 (""With these severe penalties in force, few legitimate movie producers orbookpublishers, or few other speakers in any capacity, would risk distributing images inornearthe uncertain reach of this law.""). Thus, the rationale for permitting facial challenges to laws that may be constitutionally applied in some instances is less compelling in cases such as this, which involve challenges to Congress's exercise of the spendingpower, than in challenges to criminal statutes. Nonetheless, ""even minor punishments can chill protected speech,"" id., and absent theability to challenge CIPA on itsface, public libraries that depend on federal funds may decide to comply with CIPA's terms, thereby denying patrons access to substantial amountsof constitutionally protected speech, rather than refusing to comply with CIPA's  105   termsandconsequently losing the benefits of federal funds. See 47 C.F.R.  54.520(e)(1) (""Aschoolor library that knowingly fails to ensure the use of computers in accordance withthecertifications required by this section, must reimburse any funds and discounts receivedunder the federal universal support service support mechanism for schools and librariesfor the period in which there was noncompliance.""). Even in cases where the only penalty for failure to comply with a statute is the withholding of federal funds, the Courthassustained facial challenges to Congress's exercise of the spending power. See, e.g., LegalServs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533 (2001) (declaring unconstitutional on itsfaceafederal statute restricting the ability of legal services providers who receive federalfunds to engage in activity protected by the First Amendment). The Court's unconstitutional conditions cases, such as Velazquez, are not strictly controlling, since they do not require a showing that recipients who comply with the conditions attached to federal funding will, as state actors, violate others' constitutional rights,asis the case under the fourth prong of Dole. However, they are highly instructive. The Supreme Court's pronouncements in the unconstitutional conditions cases on whatisnecessary for a plaintiff to mount a successful First Amendment facial challenge toanexercise of Congress's spending power have not produced a seamless web. For example,in Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991), the Court rejected a First Amendment facialchallenge to federal regulations prohibiting federally funded healthcare clinics from  106   providingcounseling concerning the use of abortion as a method of family planning, explaining that: Petitioners are challenging the facial validity of the regulations. Thus, we areconcerned only with the question whether, on their face, the regulations areboth authorized by the Act and can be construed in such a manner that they can be applied to a set of individuals without infringing upon constitutionally protected rights. Petitioners face a heavy burden in seeking tohave the regulations invalidated as facially unconstitutional. . . . The fact thatthe regulations might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render them wholly invalid. Id. at183(internal quotation marks, alterations, and citation omitted). In contrast, NEA v. Finley,524 U.S. 569 (1998), which also involved a facial First Amendment challenge to anexercise of Congress's spending power, articulated a somewhat more liberal test of facialvalidity than Rust, explaining that ""[t]o prevail, respondents must demonstrate a substantialrisk that application of the provision will lead to the suppression of speech."" Id. at580. Against this background, it is unclear to us whether, to succeed in facially invalidating CIPA on the grounds that it will ""induce the States to engage in activities that wouldthemselves be unconstitutional,"" Dole, 483 U.S. at 210, plaintiffs must show that it isimpossible for public libraries to comply with CIPA's conditions without violating the FirstAmendment, or rather simply that CIPA will effectively restrict library patrons' accesstosubstantial amounts of constitutionally protected speech, therefore causing many librariestoviolate the First Amendment. However, we need not resolve this issue.  107   Rather,we may assume without deciding, for purposes of this case, that a facial challenge toCIPArequires plaintiffs to show that any public library that complies with CIPA's conditionswill necessarily violate the First Amendment and, as explained in detail below, webelievethat CIPA's constitutionality fails even under this more restrictive test of facialvalidity urged on us by the government. Because of the inherent limitations in filteringtechnology, public libraries can never comply with CIPA without blocking accesstoasubstantial amount of speech that is both constitutionally protected and fails to meeteventhe filtering companies' own blocking criteria. We turn first to the governing legalprinciples to be applied to thefacts in order to determine whether the First Amendment permits a library to use the filtering technology mandated by CIPA. IV. Level of Scrutiny Applicable to Content-based Restrictions on Internet Access in Public Libraries Inanalyzing the constitutionality of a public library's use of Internet filtering software,we must first identify the appropriate level of scrutiny to apply to this restriction onpatrons' access to speech. While plaintiffs argue that a public library's use of such filtersissubject to strict scrutiny, the government maintains that the applicable standard is rationalbasis review. If strict scrutiny applies, the government must show that the challengedrestriction on speech is narrowly tailored to promote a compelling government interestand that no less restrictive alternative would further that interest. United States v. PlayboyEntm't Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000). In contrast, under rational basis review,the challenged restriction need only be reasonable; the government interest that 108   therestriction serves need not be compelling; the restriction need not be narrowly tailored toservethat interest; and the restriction ""need not be the most reasonable or the only reasonablelimitation."" Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 808 (1985). Software filters, by definition, block access to speech on the basis of its content, andcontent-based restrictions on speech are generally subject to strict scrutiny. See Playboy,529 U.S. at 813 (""[A] content-based speech restriction . . . can stand only if it satisfiesstrict scrutiny.""). Strict scrutiny does not necessarily apply to content-based restrictions on speech, however, where the restrictions apply only to speech on government property, such as public libraries. ""[I]t is . . . well settled that the government neednotpermit all forms of speechon property that it owns and controls."" Int'l Soc'y for KrishnaConsciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 678 (1992). We perforce turn to a discussionof public forum doctrine. A. O verview of Public Forum Doctrine The government's power to restrict speech on its own property is not unlimited. Rather,under public forum doctrine, the extent to which the First Amendment permits the government to restrict speech on its own property depends on the character of the forum thatthegovernment has created. See Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, Inc., 473U.S.788 (1985). Thus, the First Amendment affords greater deference to restrictions onspeechin those areas consideredless amenable to free expression, such as military  109   bases, see Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S.828 (1976), jail grounds, see Adderley v. Florida, 385 U.S.39(1966), or public airport terminals, see Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc.v.Lee, 505 U.S. 672 (1992), than to restrictions on speech in state universities, see Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819 (1995), or streets,  sidewalks and public parks, see Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474 (1988); Hague v. CIO, 307 U.S. 496 (1939). The Supreme Court has identified three types of fora for purposes of identifying the level of First Amendment scrutiny applicable to content-based restrictions on speech on government property: traditional public fora, designated public fora, and nonpublic fora. Traditional public fora include sidewalks, squares, and public parks: [S]treets and parks . . . have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions. Such use of the streets and public places has, from ancient times, been a part of the privileges, immunities, rights, and liberties of citizens. Hague, 307 U.S. at 515. ""In these quintessential public forums, . . . [f]or the State to enforce a content-based exclusion it must show that its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end."" Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educs. Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983); see also Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, 505 U.S. at 678 (""[R]egulation of speech on government property that has traditionally been available for public expression is subject to the highest scrutiny.""); Frisby, 487 U.S. at 480 (""[W]e have repeatedly referred to public  110   streets as the archetype of a traditional public forum.""). A second category of fora, known as designated (or limited) public fora, ""consists of public property which the State has opened for use by the public as a place for expressive activity."" Perry, 460 U.S. at 46. Whereas any content-based restriction on the use of traditional public fora is subject to strict scrutiny, the state is generally permitted, as long as it does not discriminate on the basis of viewpoint, to limit a designated public forum to certain speakers or the discussion of certain subjects. See Perry, 460 U.S. at 45 n.7. Once it has defined the limits of a designated public forum, however, ""[r]egulation of such property is subject to the same limitations as that governing a traditional public forum."" Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, 505 U.S. at 678. Examples of designated fora include university meeting facilities, see Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981), school board meetings, see City of Madison Joint School Dist. v. Wisc. Employment Relations Comm'n, 429 U.S. 167 (1976), and municipal theaters, see Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546 (1975). The third category, nonpublic fora, consists of all remaining public property. ""Limitations on expressive activity conducted on this last category of property must survive only a much more limited review. The challenged regulation need only be reasonable, as long as the regulation is not an effort to suppress the speaker's activity due to disagreement with the speaker's view."" Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, 505 U.S. at 679.  111   B. Contours of the Relevant Forum: the Library's Collection as a Whole or the Provision of Internet Access? To apply public forum doctrine to this case, we must first determine whether the appropriate forum for analysis is the library's collection as a whole, which includes both print and electronic resources, or the library's provision of Internet access. Where a plaintiff seeks limited access, for expressive purposes, to governmentally controlled property, the Supreme Court has held that the relevant forum is defined not by the physical limits of the government property at issue, but rather by the specific access that the plaintiff seeks: Although . . . as an initial matter a speaker must seek access to public property or to private property dedicated to public use to evoke First Amendment concerns, forum analysis is not completed merely by identifying the government property at issue. Rather, in defining the forum we have focused on the access sought by the speaker. When speakers seek general access to public property, the forum encompasses that property. In cases in which limited access is sought, our cases have taken a more tailored approach to ascertaining the perimeters of a forum within the confines of the government property. Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 801 (1985). Thus, in Cornelius, where the plaintiffs were legal defense and political advocacy groups seeking to participate in the Combined Federal Campaign charity drive, the Court held that the relevant forum, for First Amendment purposes, was not the entire federal workplace, but rather the charity drive itself. Id. at 801. Similarly, in Perry Education Association v. Perry Local Educators' Association, 460 U.S. 37 (1983), which addressed a union's right to access a public school's internal mail system and teachers' mailboxes, 112   the Court identified the relevant forum as the school's mail system, not the public school as a whole. In Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981), in which a student group challenged a state university's restrictions on use of its meeting facilities, the Court identified the relevant forum as the meeting facilities to which the plaintiffs sought access, not the state university generally. And in Christ's Bride Ministries, Inc. v. SEPTA, 148 F.3d 242 (3d Cir. 1998), involving a First Amendment challenge to the removal of advertisements from subway and commuter rail stations, the Third Circuit noted that the forum at issue was not the rail and subway stations as a whole, but rather the advertising space within the stations. Id. at 248. Although these cases dealt with the problem of identifying the relevant forum where speakers are claiming a right of access, we believe that the same approach applies to identifying the relevant forum where the parties seeking access are listeners or readers. In this case, the patron plaintiffs are not asserting a First Amendment right to compel public libraries to acquire certain books or magazines for their print collections. Nor are the Web site plaintiffs claiming a First Amendment right to compel public libraries to carry print materials that they publish. Rather, the right at issue in this case is the specific right of library patrons to access information on the Internet, and the specific right of Web publishers to provide library patrons with information via the Internet. Thus, the relevant forum for analysis is not the library's entire collection, which includes both print and electronic media, such as the Internet, but rather the specific forum created  113   when the library provides its patrons with Internet access. Although a public library's provision of Internet access does not resemble the conventional notion of a forum as a well-defined physical space, the same First Amendment standards apply. See Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 830 (1995) (holding that a state university's student activities fund ""is a forum more in a metaphysical than a spatial or geographic sense, but the same principles are applicable""); see also Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 801 (identifying the Combined Federal Campaign charity drive as the relevant unit of analysis for application of public forum doctrine). C. Content-based Restrictions in Designated Public Fora Unlike nonpublic fora such as airport terminals, see Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672 (1992), military bases, see Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828 (1976), jail grounds, see Adderley v. Florida, 385 U.S. 39 (1966), the federal workplace, see Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 805 (1985), and public transit vehicles, see Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298 (1974), the purpose of a public library in general, and the provision of Internet access within a public library in particular, is ""for use by the public . . . for expressive activity,"" Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educs. Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983), namely, the dissemination and receipt by the public of a wide range of information. We are satisfied that when the government provides Internet access in a public library, it has created a  114   designated public forum. See Mainstream Loudoun v. Bd. of Trustees of the Loudoun County Library, 24 F. Supp. 2d 552, 563 (E.D. Va. 1998); cf. Kreimer v. Bureau of Police, 958 F.2d 1242, 1259 (3d Cir. 1992) (holding that a public library is a limited public forum). Relying on those cases that have recognized that government has leeway, under the First Amendment, to limit use of a designated public forum to narrowly specified purposes, and that content-based restrictions on speech that are consistent with those purposes are subject only to rational basis review, the government argues for application of rational basis review to public libraries' decisions about which content to make available to their patrons via the Internet. See Rosenberger, 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995) (""The necessities of confining a forum to the limited and legitimate purposes for which it was created may justify the State in reserving it for certain groups or for the discussion of certain topics.""); Perry, 460 U.S. at 46 n.7 (1983) (""A public forum may be created for a limited purpose such as use by certain groups . . . or for the discussion of certain subjects.""). In particular, the government forcefully argues that a public library's decision to limit the content of its digital offerings on the Internet should be subject to no stricter scrutiny than its decisions about what content to make available to its patrons through the library's print collection. According to the government, just as a public library may choose to acquire books about gardening but not golf, without having to show that this  115   content-based restriction on patrons' access to speech is narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest, so may a public library make content-based decisions about which speech to make available on the Internet, without having to show that such a restriction satisfies strict scrutiny. Plaintiffs respond that the government's ability to restrict the content of speech in a designated public forum by restricting the purpose of the designated public forum that it creates is not unlimited. Cf. Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 547 (2001) (""Congress cannot recast a condition on funding as a mere definition of its program in every case, lest the First Amendment be reduced to a simple semantic exercise.""). As Justice Kennedy has explained: If Government has a freer hand to draw content-based distinctions in limiting a forum than in excluding someone from it, the First Amendment would be a dead letter in designated public forums; every exclusion could be recast as a limitation. . . . The power to limit or redefine forums for a specific legitimate purpose does not allow the government to exclude certain speech or speakers from them for any reason at all. Denver Area Telecomm. Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U.S. 727, 801 (1996) (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment). Although we agree with plaintiffs that the First Amendment imposes some limits on the state's ability to adopt content-based restrictions in defining the purpose of a public forum, precisely what those limits are is unclear, and presents a difficult problem in First Amendment jurisprudence. The Supreme Court's ""cases have not yet determined . . . that government's decision to dedicate a public forum to one type of content or 116   another is necessarily subject to the highest level of scrutiny. Must a local government, for example, show a compelling state interest if it builds a band shell in the park and dedicates it solely to classical music (but not to jazz)? The answer is not obvious."" Denver, 518 U.S. at 750 (plurality opinion); see also Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546, 572-73 (1975) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (""May an opera house limit its productions to operas, or must it also show rock musicals? May a municipal theater devote an entire season to Shakespeare, or is it required to book any potential producer on a first come, first served basis?""). We believe, however, that certain principles emerge from the Supreme Court's jurisprudence on this question. In particular, and perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, the more narrow the range of speech that the government chooses to subsidize (whether directly, through government grants or other funding, or indirectly, through the creation of a public forum) the more deference the First Amendment accords the government in drawing content-based distinctions. At one extreme lies the government's decision to fund a particular message that the government seeks to disseminate. In this context, content-based restrictions on the speech that government chooses to subsidize are clearly subject to at most rational basis review, and even viewpoint discrimination is permissible. For example, ""[w]hen Congress established a National Endowment for Democracy to encourage other countries to adopt democratic principles, 22 U.S.C.  4411(b), it was not constitutionally required  117   to fund a program to encourage competing lines of political philosophy such as communism and fascism."" Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 194 (1991); see also Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 541 (""[V]iewpoint-based funding decisions can be sustained in instances in which the government is itself the speaker, or in instances, like Rust, in which the government used private speakers to transmit information pertaining to its own program."") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although not strictly controlling, the Supreme Court's unconstitutional conditions cases, such as Rust and Velazquez, are instructive for purposes of analyzing contentbased restrictions on the use of public fora. This is because the limitations that government places on the use of a public forum can be conceptualized as conditions that the government attaches to the receipt of a benefit that it offers, namely, the use of government property. Public forum cases thus resemble those unconstitutional conditions cases involving First Amendment challenges to the conditions that the state places on the receipt of a government benefit. See Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 544 (""As this suit involves a subsidy, limited forum cases . . . may not be controlling in the strict sense, yet they do provide some instruction.""). Even when the government does not fund the dissemination of a particular government message, the First Amendment generally permits government, subject to the constraints of viewpoint neutrality, to create public institutions such as art museums and state universities, dedicated to facilitating the dissemination of private speech that the  118   government believes to have particular merit. Thus, in NEA v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569 (1998), the Court upheld the use of content-based restrictions in a federal program awarding grants to artists on the basis of, inter alia, artistic excellence. ""The very assumption of the NEA is that grants will be awarded according to the artistic worth of competing applications, and absolute neutrality is simply inconceivable."" Id. at 585 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Similarly, as Justice Stevens explained in his concurring opinion in Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981), the First Amendment does not necessarily subject to strict scrutiny a state university's use of content-based means of allocating scarce resources, including limited public fora such as its meeting facilities: Because every university's resources are limited, an educational institution must routinely make decisions concerning the use of the time and space that is available for extracurricular activities. In my judgment, it is both necessary and appropriate for those decisions to evaluate the content of a proposed student activity. I should think it obvious, for example, that if two groups of 25 students requested the use of a room at a particular time  one to view Mickey Mouse cartoons and the other to rehearse an amateur performance of Hamlet  the First Amendment would not require that the room be reserved for the group that submitted its application first. Nor do I see why a university should have to establish a ""compelling state interest"" to defend its decision to permit one group to use the facility and not the other. Id. at 278 (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment).2 22 2  Indeed, if the First Amendment subjected to strict scrutiny the government's decisionto dedicate a forum to speech whose content the government judges to be particularly valuable, many of our public institutions of culture would cease to exist in theircurrent form: 119   The more broadly the government facilitates private speech, however, the less deference the First Amendment accords to the government's content-based restrictions on the speech that it facilitates. Thus, where the government creates a designated public forum to facilitate private speech representing a diverse range of viewpoints, the government's decision selectively to single out particular viewpoints for exclusion is subject to strict scrutiny. Compare Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 834 (applying heightened First Amendment scrutiny to viewpoint-based restrictions on the use of a limited public forum where the government ""does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers""), with Finley, 524 U.S. at 586 (""In the context of arts funding, in contrast to many other subsidies, the Government does not indiscriminately encourage a diversity of From here on out, the National Gallery in Washington, D.C., for example, would be required to display the art of all would-be artists on a first-comefirst-served basis and wouldnot be able to exercise any content control over itscollection through evaluations of quality. Such a conclusion, of course, strikes us as absurd, but thatis only because we feel that the government should be free to establish public cultural institutions guided by standards such as ""quality."" ... While the First Amendment articulates a deep fear of government intervention in the marketplace of ideas (because of the risk of distortion), it also seems prepared to permit state-sponsored and -supported cultural institutions that exercise considerable control over which art to fund, which pictures to hang, and which courses to teach. That these choices necessarily involve judgments about favored and disfavored content  judgments clearly prohibited in the realm of censorship  is indisputable. LeeC.Bollinger, Public Institutions of Culture and the First Amendment: The New Frontier,63 U. Cin. L. Rev. 1103, 1110-15 (1995). 120   views from private speakers."") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Similarly, although the government may create a designated public forum limited to speech on a particular topic, if the government opens the forum to members of the general public to speak on that topic while selectively singling out for exclusion particular speakers on the basis of the content of their speech, that restriction is subject to strict scrutiny. For instance, in City of Madison Joint School District No. 8 v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, 429 U.S. 167 (1976), the Court held that where a school board opens its meetings for public participation, it may not, consistent with the First Amendment, prohibit teachers other than union representatives from speaking on the subject of pending collective-bargaining negotiations. See id. at 175 (noting that the state ""has opened a forum for direct citizen involvement""); see also Ark. Educ. Television Comm'n v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666, 680 (1998) (distinguishing, for purposes of determining the appropriate level of First Amendment scrutiny, a televised debate in which a public broadcasting station exercises editorial discretion in selecting participating candidates from a debate that has ""an open-microphone format""). Finally, content-based restrictions on speech in a designated public forum are most clearly subject to strict scrutiny when the government opens a forum for virtually unrestricted use by the general public for speech on a virtually unrestricted range of topics, while selectively excluding particular speech whose content it disfavors. Thus, in Conrad, the Court held that a local government violated the First Amendment when it  121   denied a group seeking to perform the rock musical ""Hair"" access to a general-purpose municipal theater open for the public at large to use for performances. See also Denver, 518 U.S. at 802 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment) (suggesting that strict scrutiny would not apply to a local government's decision to ""build[] a band shell in the park and dedicate[] it solely to classical music (but not jazz),"" but would apply to ""the Government's creation of a band shell in which all types of music might be performed except for rap music""). Similarly, in FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U.S. 364 (1984), the Court subjected to heightened scrutiny a federal program that funded a wide range of public broadcasting stations that disseminated speech on a wide range of subjects, where the federal program singled out for exclusion speech whose content amounted to editorializing. As the Court later explained: In FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U.S. 364 (1984) the Court was instructed by its understanding of the dynamics of the broadcast industry in holding that prohibitions against editorializing by public radio networks were an impermissible restriction, even though the Government enacted the restriction to control the use of public funds. The First Amendment forbade the Government from using the forum in an unconventional way to suppress speech inherent in the nature of the medium. Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 543. In sum, the more widely the state opens a forum for members of the public to speak on a variety of subjects and viewpoints, the more vulnerable is the state's decision selectively to exclude certain speech on the basis of its disfavored content, as such  122   exclusions distort the marketplace of ideas that the state has created in establishing the forum. Cf. Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 544 (""Restricting LSC attorneys in advising their clients and in presenting arguments and analyses to the courts distorts the legal system by altering the traditional role of the attorneys in much the same way broadcast systems or student publication networks were changed in the limited forum cases . . . .""). Thus, we believe that where the state designates a forum for expressive activity and opens the forum for speech by the public at large on a wide range of topics, strict scrutiny applies to restrictions that single out for exclusion from the forum particular speech whose content is disfavored. ""Laws designed or intended to suppress or restrict the expression of specific speakers contradict basic First Amendment principles."" United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 812 (2000); see also Denver, 518 U.S. at 782 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment) (noting the flaw in a law that ""singles out one sort of speech for vulnerability to private censorship in a context where content-based discrimination is not otherwise permitted""). Compare Forbes, 523 U.S. at 679 (holding that the state does not create a public forum when it ""allows selective access for individual speakers rather than general access for a class of speakers"") (emphasis added), with Police Dep't of the City of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 96 (1972) (""Selective exclusions from a public forum may not be based on content alone, and may not be justified by reference to content alone."") (emphasis added). We note further that to the extent that the government creates a public forum  123   expressly designed to facilitate the dissemination of private speech, opens the forum to any member of the public to speak on any virtually any topic, and then selectively targets certain speech for exclusion based on its content, the government is singling out speech in a manner that resembles the discriminatory taxes on the press that the Supreme Court subjected to heightened First Amendment scrutiny in Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221 (1987), and Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue, 460 U.S. 575 (1983), which we explain in the margin.2 D. Reasons for Applying Strict Scrutiny 1. Selective Exclusion From a ""Vast Democratic Forum"" Applying these principles to public libraries, we agree with the government that generally the First Amendment subjects libraries' content-based decisions about which print materials to acquire for their collections to only rational review. In making these decisions, public libraries are generally free to adopt collection development criteria that Inboth of these cases, the taxation scheme at issue effectively subsidized a vast rangeof publications, and singled out for penalty only a handful of speakers. See Arkansas Writers' Project, 460U.S. at 228-29 (noting that ""selective taxation of the press... [by] targeting individual members of the press  poses a particular danger of abuseby the State"" and explaining that ""this case involves a more disturbing use of selectivetaxation than MinneapolisStar, because the basis on which Arkansas differentiates between magazines isparticularly repugnant to First Amendment principles: amagazine's tax status depends entirely on its content""); Minneapolis Star, 460 U.S.at 591(""Minnesota's ink and paper tax violates the First Amendment not only because it singlesoutthe press, but also because it targets a small group of newspapers.""); see also TurnerBroad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 660 (1994) (""The taxes invalidated in Minneapolis Star and Arkansas Writers' Project . . . targeted a small number of speakers, andthusthreatened to distort the market for ideas."") (internal quotation marks and citationomitted). 124 23 3   reflect not simply patrons' demand for certain material, but also the library's evaluation of the material's quality. See Bernard W. Bell, Filth, Filtering, and the First Amendment: Ruminations on Public Libraries' Use of Internet Filtering Software, 53 Fed. Comm. L.J. 191, 225 (2001) (""Librarians should have the discretion to decide that the library is committed to intellectual inquiry, not to the satisfaction of the full range of human desires.""). Thus, a public library's decision to use the last $100 of its budget to purchase the complete works of Shakespeare even though more of its patrons would prefer the library to use the same amount to purchase the complete works of John Grisham, is not, in our view, subject to strict scrutiny. Cf. NEA v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569 (1998) (subjecting only to rational basis review the government's decision to award NEA grants on the basis of, inter alia, artistic excellence). Nonetheless, we disagree with the government's argument that public libraries' use of Internet filters is no different, for First Amendment purposes, from the editorial discretion that they exercise when they choose to acquire certain books on the basis of librarians' evaluation of their quality. The central difference, in our view, is that by providing patrons with even filtered Internet access, the library permits patrons to receive speech on a virtually unlimited number of topics, from a virtually unlimited number of speakers, without attempting to restrict patrons' access to speech that the library, in the exercise of its professional judgment, determines to be particularly valuable. Cf. Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 834 (1995) (applying  125   strict scrutiny to viewpoint-based restrictions where the state ""does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers""). See generally supra Section IV.C. In those cases upholding the government's exercise of editorial discretion in selecting certain speech for subsidization or inclusion in a state-created forum, the state actor exercising the editorial discretion has at least reviewed the content of the speech that the forum facilitates. Thus, in Finley the NEA examined the content of those works of art that it chose to subsidize, and in Arkansas Educational Television Commission v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666 (1998), the public broadcaster specifically reviewed and approved each speaker permitted to participate in the debate. See id. at 673 (""In the case of television broadcasting, . . . broad rights of access for outside speakers would be antithetical, as a general rule, to the discretion that stations and their editorial staff must exercise to fulfill their journalistic purpose and statutory obligations.""); Finley, 524 U.S. at 586 (""The NEA's mandate is to make esthetic judgments, and the inherently contentbased `excellence' threshold for NEA support sets it apart from the subsidy at issue in Rosenberger  which was available to all student organizations that were `related to the educational purpose of the University . . . .'"") (quoting Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 824); see also Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 804 (1985) (""The Government's consistent policy has been to limit participation in the [Combined Federal Campaign] to `appropriate' voluntary agencies and to require agencies seeking admission  126   to obtain permission from federal and local Campaign officials. . . . [T]here is no evidence suggesting that the granting of the requisite permission is merely ministerial.""). The essence of editorial discretion requires the exercise of professional judgment in examining the content that the government singles out as speech of particular value. This exercise of editorial discretion is evident in a library's decision to acquire certain books for its collection. As the government's experts in library science testified, in selecting a book for a library's collection, librarians evaluate the book's quality by reference to a variety of criteria such as its accuracy, the title's niche in relation to the rest of thecollection, the authority of the author, the publisher, the work's presentation, and howitcompares with other material available in the same genre or on the same subject.  Thus, the content of every book that a library acquires has been reviewed by the library's collection development staff or someone to whom they have delegated the task, and has been judged to meet the criteria that form the basis for the library's collection development policy. Although some public libraries use ""approval plans"" to delegate the collection development to third-party vendors which provide the library with recommended materials that the library is then free to retain or return to the vendor, the same principle nonetheless attains. In contrast, in providing patrons with even filtered Internet access, a public library invites patrons to access speech whose content has never been reviewed and recommended as particularly valuable by either a librarian or a third party to whom the  127   library has delegated collection development decisions. Although several of the government's librarian witnesses who testified at trial purport to apply the same standards that govern the library's acquisition of print materials to the library's provision of Internet access to patrons, when public libraries provide their patrons with Internet access, they intentionally open their doors to vast amounts of speech that clearly lacks sufficient quality to ever be considered for the library's print collection. Unless a library allows access to only those sites that have been preselected as having particular value, a method that, as noted above, was tried and rejected by the Westerville Ohio Public Library, see supra at 46-47, even a library that uses software filters has opened its Internet collection ""for indiscriminate use by the general public."" Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educs. Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 47 (1983). ""[M]ost Internet forums  including chat rooms, newsgroups, mail exploders, and the Web  are open to all comers."" Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 880 (1997). The fundamental difference between a library's print collection and its provision of Internet access is illustrated by comparing the extent to which the library opens its print collection to members of the public to speak on a given topic and the extent to which it opens its Internet terminals to members of the public to speak on a given topic. When a public library chooses to carry books on a selected topic, e.g. chemistry, it does not open its print collection to any member of the public who wishes to write about chemistry. Rather, out of the myriad of books that have ever been written on chemistry,  128   each book on chemistry that the library carries has been reviewed and selected because the person reviewing the book, in the exercise of his or her professional judgment, has deemed its content to be particularly valuable. In contrast, when a public library provides Internet access, even filtered Internet access, it has created a forum open to any member of the public who writes about chemistry on the Internet, regardless of how unscientific the author's methods or of how patently false the author's conclusions are, regardless of the author's reputation or grammar, and regardless of the reviews of the scientific community. Notwithstanding protestations in CIPA's legislative history to the contrary,2 4  members of the general public do define the content that public libraries make available to their patrons through the Internet. Any member of the public with Internet access could, through the free Web hosting services available on the Internet, tonight jot down a few musings on any subject under the sun, and tomorrow those musings would become part of public libraries' online offerings and be available to any library patron who seeks them out.  24  [P]atrons at a library do nothave the right to make editorial decisions regarding the availability of certain material. It is the exclusive authority of thelibrary to make affirmative decisions regarding what books, magazines, orother material is placed on library shelves, or otherwise made available to patrons. Libraries impose many restrictions on the use of their systems which demonstrate that the content of the library's offerings are not determined by the general public.  S.Rep.No. 106-141, at 8-9 (1999). 129   In providing its patrons with Internet access, a public library creates a forum for the facilitation of speech, almost none of which either the library's collection development staff or even the filtering companies have ever reviewed. Although filtering companies review a portion of the Web in classifying particular sites, the portion of the Web that the filtering companies actually review is quite small in relation to the Web as a whole. The filtering companies' harvesting process, described in our findings of fact, is intended to identify only a small fraction of Web sites for the filtering companies to review. Put simply, the state cannot be said to be exercising editorial discretion permitted under the First Amendment when it indiscriminately facilitates private speech whose content it makes no effort to examine. Cf. Bell, supra, at 226 (""[C]ourts should take a much more jaundiced view of library policies that block Internet access to a very limited array of subjects than they take of library policies that reserve Internet terminals for very limited use.""). While the First Amendment permits the government to exercise editorial discretion in singling out particularly favored speech for subsidization or inclusion in a state-created forum, we believe that where the state provides access to a ""vast democratic forum[],"" Reno, 521 U.S. at 868, open to any member of the public to speak on subjects ""as diverse as human thought,"" id. at 870, and then selectively excludes from the forum certain speech on the basis of its content, such exclusions are subject to strict scrutiny. These exclusions risk fundamentally distorting the unique marketplace of ideas that  130   public libraries create when they open their collections, via the Internet, to the speech of millions of individuals around the world on a virtually limitless number of subjects.2 A public library's content-based restrictions on patrons' Internet access thus resemble the content-based restrictions on speech subsidized by the government, whether through direct funding or through the creation of a designated public forum, that the Supreme Court has subjected to strict scrutiny, as discussed above in Section IV.C. Although the government may subsidize a particular message representing the Indistinguishing restrictions on public libraries' print collections from restrictions ontheprovision of Internet access, we do not rely on the rationale adopted in Mainstream Loudounv. Board of Trustees of the Loudoun County Library, 2 F. Supp. 2d 783 (E.D. Va.1998). The Loudoun Court reasoned that a library's decision to block certain Web sitesfundamentally differs from itsdecision to carry certain books but not others, in that unlikethemoney and shelf space consumed by the library's provision of print materials, ""noappreciable expenditure of library time or resources is required to make a particular Internetpublication available"" once the library has acquired Internet access. Id. at 79394. Wedisagree. Nearly every librarian who testified at trial stated that patrons' demandfor Internet access exceeds the library's supply of Internet terminals. Undersuch circumstances, every time library patrons visit a Web site, they deny other patrons waiting tousetheterminal access to other Web sites. Just as the scarcity of a library's budget and shelf space constrains a library's ability to provide its patrons with unrestricted access to printmaterials, the scarcity of time at Internet terminals constrains libraries' ability to providepatrons with unrestricted Internet access: The same budget concerns constraining the number of books that libraries can offer also limits the number of terminals, Internet accounts, and speed of access links that can be purchased, and thus the number of Web pages thatpatrons can view. This is clear to anyone who has been denied access toa Website because no terminal was unoccupied. MarkS.Nadel, The First Amendment's Limitations on the Use of Internet Filtering in PublicandSchool Libraries: What Content Can Libraries Exclude?, 78 Tex. L. Rev. 1117,1128 (2000). 131 25 5   government's viewpoint without having to satisfy strict scrutiny, see Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991), strict scrutiny applies to restrictions that selectively exclude particular viewpoints from a public forum designed to facilitate a wide range of viewpoints, see Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819 (1995). Similarly, although the state's exercise of editorial discretion in selecting particular speakers for participation in a state-sponsored forum is subject to rational basis review, see Ark. Educ. Television Comm'n v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666 (1998), selective exclusions of particular speakers from a forum otherwise open to any member of the public to speak are subject to strict scrutiny, see City of Madison Joint School Dist. No. 8 v. Wis. Employment Relations Comm'n, 429 U.S. 167 (1976). And while the government may, subject only to rational basis review, make content-based decisions in selecting works of artistic excellence to subsidize, see NEA v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569 (1998), the Supreme Court has applied heightened scrutiny where the government opens a general-purpose municipal theater for use by the public, but selectively excludes disfavored content, see Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546 (1975), where the government facilitates the speech of public broadcasters on a virtually limitless number of topics, but prohibits editorializing, see FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U.S. 364 (1984), and where the government funds a wide range of legal services but restricts funding recipients from challenging welfare laws, see Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533 (2001). Similarly, where a public library  132   opens a forum to an unlimited number of speakers around the world to speak on an unlimited number of topics, strict scrutiny applies to the library's selective exclusions of particular speech whose content the library disfavors. 2. Analogy to Traditional Public Fora Application of strict scrutiny to public libraries' use of software filters, in our view, finds further support in the extent to which public libraries' provision of Internet access promotes First Amendment values in an analogous manner to traditional public fora, such as sidewalks and parks, in which content-based restrictions on speech are always subject to strict scrutiny. The public library, by its very nature, is ""designed for freewheeling inquiry."" Bd. of Education v. Pico, 457 U.S. 853, 915 (1982) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). As such, the library is a ""mighty resource in the free marketplace of ideas,"" Minarcini v. Strongsville City Sch. Dist., 541 F.2d 577, 582 (6th Cir. 1976), and represents a ""quintessential locus of the receipt of information."" Kreimer v. Bureau of Police for Morristown, 958 F.2d 1242, 1255 (3d Cir. 1992); see also Sund v. City of Wichita Falls, 121 F. Supp. 2d 530, 547 (N.D. Tex. 2000) (""The right to receive information is vigorously enforced in the context of a public library . . . .""); cf. Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 681 (1992) (""[A] traditional public forum is property that has as `a principal purpose . . . the free exchange of ideas.'"") (quoting Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 800 (1985)). We acknowledge that the provision of Internet access in a public library does not  133   enjoy the historical pedigree of streets, sidewalks, and parks as a vehicle of free expression. Nonetheless, we believe that it shares many of the characteristics of these traditional public fora that uniquely promote First Amendment values and accordingly warrant application of strict scrutiny to any content-based restriction on speech in these fora. Regulation of speech in streets, sidewalks, and parks is subject to the highest scrutiny not simply by virtue of history and tradition, but also because the speechfacilitating character of sidewalks and parks makes them distinctly deserving of First Amendment protection. Many of these same speech-promoting features of the traditional public forum appear in public libraries' provision of Internet access. First, public libraries, like sidewalks and parks, are generally open to any member of the public who wishes to receive the speech that these fora facilitate, subject only to narrow limitations. See Kreimer, 958 F.2d at 1260 (noting that a public library does not retainunfettered discretion ""to choose whom it will permit to enter the Library,"" but upholdingthe library's right to exclude patrons who harass patrons or whose offensive personalhygiene precludes the library's use by other patrons). Moreover, like traditional  public fora, public libraries are funded by taxpayers and therefore do not charge members of the public each time they use the forum. The only direct cost to library patrons who wish to receive information, whether via the Internet or the library's print collection, is the time spent reading. By providing Internet access to millions of Americans to whom such access would  134   otherwise be unavailable, public libraries play a critical role in bridging the digital divide separating those with access to new information technologies from those that lack access. See generally National Telecommunications and Information Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Falling Through the Net: Defining the Digital Divide (1999), available at http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fttn99/contents.html. Cf. Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 546 (invalidating a content-based restriction on the speech of federally funded legal services corporations and noting that given the financial hardship of legal services corporations' clients, ""[t]he restriction on speech is even more problematic because in cases where the attorney withdraws from a representation, the client is unlikely to find other counsel""). Public libraries that provide Internet access greatly expand the educational opportunities for millions of Americans who, as explained in the margin, would otherwise be deprived of the benefits of this new medium.2 6  Just as important as the openness of a forum to listeners is its openness to speakers. Parks and sidewalks are paradigmatic loci of First Amendment values in large part because they permit speakers to communicate with a wide audience at low cost. One can address members of the public in a park for little more than the cost of a soapbox, Wehave found that approximately 14.3 million Americans access the Internet at a publiclibrary, and Internet access at public libraries is more often used by those with lowerincomes than those with higher incomes. We found that about 20.3% of Internet userswithhousehold family income of less than $15,000 per year use public libraries for Internetaccess, and approximately 70% of libraries serving communities with poverty levelsinexcess of 40% receive E-rate discounts. The widespread availability of Internet accessinpublic libraries is due, in part, to the availability of public funding, including stateandlocal funding and the federal funding programs regulated by CIPA. 135 26   and one can distribute handbills on the sidewalk for little more than the cost of a pen, paper, and some photocopies. See Martin v. City of Struthers, 319 U.S. 141, 146 (1943) (""Door to door distribution of circulars is essential to the poorly financed causes of little people.""); Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law  12-24 at 987 (2d ed. 1988) (""The `public forum' doctrine holds that restrictions on speech should be subject to higher scrutiny when, all other things being equal, that speech occurs in areas playing a vital role in communication  such as in those places historically associated with first amendment activities, such as streets, sidewalks, and parks  especially because of how indispensable communication in these places is to people who lack access to more elaborate (and more costly) channels.""); Daniel A. Farber, Free Speech without Romance: Public Choice and the First Amendment, 105 Harv. L. Rev. 554, 574 n.86 (1991) (noting that traditional public fora ""are often the only place where less affluent groups and individuals can effectively express their message""); Harry Kalven, Jr., The Concept of the Public Forum: Cox v. Louisiana, 1965 Sup. Ct. Rev. 1, 30 (""[T]he parade, the picket, the leaflet, the sound truck, have been the media of communication exploited by those with little access to the more genteel means of communication.""). Similarly, given the existence of message boards and free Web hosting services, a speaker can, via the Internet, address the public, including patrons of public libraries, for little more than the cost of Internet access. As the Supreme Court explained in Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844 (1997), ""the Internet can hardly be considered a `scarce' expressive  136   commodity. It provides relatively unlimited, low-cost capacity for communication of all kinds."" Id. at 870. Although the cost of a home computer and Internet access considerably exceeds the cost of a soapbox or a few hundred photocopies, speakers wishing to avail themselves of the Internet may gain free access in schools, workplaces, or the public library. As Professor Lessig has explained: The ""press"" in 1791 was not the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal. It did not comprise large organizations of private interests, with millions of readers associated with each organization. Rather, the press then was much like the Internet today. The cost of a printing press was low, the readership was slight, and anyone (within reason) could become a publisher  and in fact an extraordinary number did. When the Constitution speaks of the rights of the ""press,"" the architecture it has in mind is the architecture of the Internet. Lawrence Lessig, Code 183 (1999). While public libraries' provision of Internet access shares many of the speechpromoting qualities of traditional public fora, it also facilitates speech in ways that traditional public fora cannot.27 In particular, whereas the architecture of real space Weacknowledge that traditional public fora have characteristics that promote First Amendment values in ways that the provision of Internet access in public libraries does not. Forexample, a significant virtue of traditional public fora is their facilitation of faceto-facecommunication. ""In a face-to-face encounter there is a greater opportunity for the exchangeof ideas and the propagation of views . . . ."" Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 798. Faceto-faceexchanges also permit speakers to confront listeners who would otherwise not actively seek out the information that the speaker has to offer. In contrast, the Internet operateslargely by providing individuals with only that information that they actively seekout. Although the Internet does not permit face-to-face communication in the same way thattraditional public fora do, the Internet, as a medium of expression, is significantly more interactive than the broadcast media and the press. ""[T]he Web makes itpossibleto establish two-way linkages with potential sympathizers. Unlike the unidirectional nature of most mass media, websites, bulletin boards, chatrooms, and email 137 27   limits the audience of a pamphleteer or soapbox orator to people within the speaker's immediate vicinity, the Internet renders the geography of speaker and listener irrelevant: Through the use of chat rooms, any person with a phone line can become a town crier with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox. Through the use of Web pages, mail exploders, and newsgroups, the same individual can become a pamphleteer. Reno, 521 U.S. at 870 . By providing patrons with Internet access, public libraries in effect open their doors to an unlimited number of potential speakers around the world, inviting the speech of any member of the public who wishes to communicate with library patrons via the Internet. Due to the low costs for speakers and the irrelevance of geography, the volume of speech available to library patrons on the Internet is enormous and far exceeds the volume of speech available to audiences in traditional public fora. See id. at 868 (referring to ""the vast democratic forums of the Internet""). Indeed, as noted in our findings of fact, the Web is estimated to contain over one billion pages, and is said to be growing at a rate of over 1.5 million pages per day. See id. at 885 (noting ""[t]he dramatic expansion of this new marketplace of ideas""). This staggering volume of content on the Internet ""is as diverse as human thought,"" id. at 870, and ""is thus comparable, from the reader's viewpoint, to . . . a vast library including millions of readily available and indexed publications,"" id. at 853. As a result of the Internet's unique speech-facilitating arepotentially interactive."" Seth F. Kreimer, Technologies of Protest: Insurgent Social Movements and the First Amendment in the Era of the Internet, 150 U. Pa. L. Rev. 119, 130(2001). 138   qualities, ""it is hard to find an aspiring social movement, new or old, of left, right, or center, without a website, a bulletin board, and an email list."" Kreimer, supra n.27, at 125. ""[T]he growth of the Internet has been and continues to be phenomenal."" Reno, 521 U.S. at 885. This extraordinary growth of the Internet illustrates the extent to which the Internet promotes First Amendment values in the same way that the historical use of traditional public fora for speaking, handbilling, and protesting testifies to their effectiveness as vehicles for free speech. Cf. Martin, 319 U.S. at 145 (""The widespread use of this method of communication [door-to-door distribution of leaflets] by many groups espousing various causes attests its major importance.""); Schneider v. State, 308 U.S. 147, 164 (1939) (""[P]amphlets have proved most effective instruments in the dissemination of opinion.""). The provision of Internet access in public libraries, in addition to sharing the speech-enhancing qualities of fora such as streets, sidewalks, and parks, also supplies many of the speech-enhancing properties of the postal service, which is open to the public at large as both speakers and recipients of information, and provides a relatively low-cost means of disseminating information to a geographically dispersed audience. See Lamont v. Postmaster Gen., 381 U.S. 301 (1965) (invalidating a content-based prior restraint on the use of the mails); see also Blount v. Rizzi, 400 U.S. 410 (1971) (same). Indeed, the Supreme Court's description of the postal system in Lamont seems equally  139   apt as a description of the Internet today: ""the postal system . . . is now the main artery through which the business, social, and personal affairs of the people are conducted . . . ."" 381 U.S. at 305 n.3. In short, public libraries, by providing their patrons with access to the Internet, have created a public forum that provides any member of the public free access to information from millions of speakers around the world. The unique speech-enhancing character of Internet use in public libraries derives from the openness of the public library to any member of the public seeking to receive information, and the openness of the Internet to any member of the public who wishes to speak. In particular, speakers on the Internet enjoy low barriers to entry and the ability to reach a mass audience, unhindered by the constraints of geography.28 Moreover, just as the development of new media ""presents unique problems, which inform our assessment of the interests at stake, and which may justify restrictions that would be unacceptable in other contexts,"" United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000), the development of new media, such as the Internet, also presents unique possibilities for promoting First  Weacknowledge that the Internet's architecture is a human creation, and is therefore subjecttochange. The foregoing analysis of the unique speech-enhancing qualities of the Internetislimited to the Internet as currently constructed. Indeed, the characteristics of theInternet that we believe render it uniquely suited to promote First Amendment values may change as the Internet's architecture evolves. See Lawrence Lessig, Reading the Constitution in Cyberspace, 45 Emory L.J. 869, 888 (1996) (""Cyberspace has no permanent nature, save the nature of a place of unlimited plasticity. We don't find cyberspace, we build it.""); see also Lawrence Lessig, The Death of Cyberspace, 57 Wash. &LeeL.Rev. 337 (2000). 140  28   Amendment values, which also inform our assessment of the interests at stake, and which we believe, in the context of the provision of Internet access in public libraries, justify the application of heightened scrutiny to content-based restrictions that might be subject to only rational review in other contexts, such as the development of the library's print collection. Cf. id. at 818 (""Technology expands the capacity to choose; and it denies the potential of this revolution if we assume the Government is best positioned to make these choices for us.""). A faithful translation of First Amendment values from the context of traditional public fora such as sidewalks and parks to the distinctly non-traditional public forum of Internet access in public libraries requires, in our view, that content-based restrictions on Internet access in public libraries be subject to the same exacting standards of First Amendment scrutiny as content-based restrictions on speech in traditional public fora such as sidewalks, town squares, and parks: The architecture of the Internet, as it is right now, is perhaps the most important model of free speech since the founding. . . . Two hundred years after the framers ratified the Constitution, the Net has taught us what the First Amendment means. . . . The model for speech that the framers embraced was the model of the Internet  distributed, noncentralized, fully free and diverse. Lessig, Code, at 167, 185. Indeed, ""[m]inds are not changed in streets and parks as they once were. To an increasing degree, the more significant interchanges of ideas and shaping of public consciousness occur in mass and electronic media."" Denver Area Educ. Telecomms. Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U.S. 727, 802-03 (1996) (Kennedy, J., 141   concurring in the judgment). In providing patrons with even filtered Internet access, a public library is not exercising editorial discretion in selecting only speech of particular quality for inclusion in its collection, as it may do when it decides to acquire print materials. By providing its patrons with Internet access, public libraries create a forum in which any member of the public may receive speech from anyone around the world who wishes to disseminate information over the Internet. Within this ""vast democratic forum[],"" Reno, 521 U.S. at 868, which facilitates speech that is ""as diverse as human thought,"" id. at 870, software filters single out for exclusion particular speech on the basis of its disfavored content. We hold that these content-based restrictions on patrons' access to speech are subject to strict scrutiny. V. Application of Strict Scrutiny Having concluded that strict scrutiny applies to public libraries' content-based restrictions on patrons' access to speech on the Internet, we must next determine whether a public library's use of Internet software filters can survive strict scrutiny. To survive strict scrutiny, a restriction on speech ""must be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling Government interest. If a less restrictive alternative would serve the Government's purpose, the legislature must use that alternative."" United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000) (citation omitted); see also Fabulous Assocs., Inc. v. Pa. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 896 F.2d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 1990)  142   (holding that a content-based burden on speech is permissible ""only if [the government] shows that the restriction serves a compelling interest and that there are no less restrictive alternatives""). The application of strict scrutiny to a public library's use of filtering products thus requires three distinct inquiries. First, we must identify those compelling government interests that the use of filtering software promotes. It is then necessary to analyze whether the use of software filters is narrowly tailored to further those interests. Finally, we must determine whether less restrictive alternatives exist that would promote the state interest. A. State Interests We begin by identifying those legitimate state interests that a public library's use of software filters promotes. 1. Preventing the Dissemination of Obscenity, Child Pornography, and Material Harmful to Minors  On its face, CIPA is clearly intended to prevent public libraries' Internet terminals from being used to disseminate to library patrons visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or in the case of minors, harmful to minors. See CIPA  1712 (codified at 20U.S.C. 9134(f)(1)(A) & (B)),  1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C.  254(h)(6)(B) & (C)) (requiringany library that receives E-rate discounts to certify that it is enforcing ""a policy of Internetsafety that includes the operation of a technology protection measure with respecttoany of its computers withInternet access that protects against access through 143   suchcomputers to visual depictions"" that are ""obscene"" or ""child pornography,"" and, whenthecomputers are in use by minors, also protects against access to visual depictions thatare""harmful to minors""). The government's interest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity, child pornography, or, in the case of minors, material harmful to minors, is well-established. Speechthat is obscene, under the legal definition of obscenity set forth in the margin, is unprotected under the First Amendment, and accordingly the state has a compelling interestinpreventing its distribution.29 See Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 18 (1973) (""ThisCourt has recognized that the States have a legitimate interest in prohibiting dissemination or exhibition of obscene material.""); Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 563 (1969)(""[T]he First and Fourteenth Amendments recognize a valid governmental interest indealingwith the problem of obscenity.""); Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 485 (1957)(""We hold that obscenity is not within the area of constitutionally protected speech of press."").  The First Amendment also permits the state to prohibit the distribution to minors of material that, while not obscene with respect to adults, is obscene with respect to minors. See Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 637 (1968) (holding that it is constitutionally permissible ""to accord minors under 17 a more restricted right than that ForFirst Amendment purposes, obscenity is ""limited to works which, taken as a whole,appeal to the prurient interest in sex, which portray sexual conduct in a patently offensiveway, and which, taken as a whole, do not have serious literary, artistic, political, orscientific value."" Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24 (1973). 144 29   assured to adults to judge and determine for themselves what sex material they may read or see""). Proscribing the distribution of such material to minors is constitutionally justified by the government's well-recognized interest in safeguarding minors' wellbeing. See Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 869-70 (1997) (""[T]here is a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors which extend[s] to shielding them from indecent messages that are not obscene by adult standards . . . ."") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 756-57 (1982) (""It is evident beyond the need for elaboration that a State's interest in safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of a minor is compelling."") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 640 (""The State . . . has an independent interest in the well-being of its youth.""). The government's compelling interest in protecting the well-being of its youth justifies laws that criminalize not only the distribution to minors of material that is harmful to minors, but also the possession and distribution of child pornography. See Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 111 (1990) (holding that a state ""may constitutionally proscribe the possession and viewing of child pornography""); Ferber, 458 U.S. at 757, 763 (noting that ""[t]he prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of children constitutes a government objective of surpassing importance,"" and holding that ""child pornography [is] a category of material outside the protection of the First Amendment"").  145   Thus, a public library's use of software filters survives strict scrutiny if it is narrowly tailored to further the state's well-recognized interest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity and child pornography, and in preventing minors from being exposed to material harmful to their well-being. 2. Protecting the Unwilling Viewer Several of the libraries that use filters assert that filters serve the libraries' interest in preventing patrons from being unwillingly exposed to sexually explicit speech that the patrons find offensive. Nearly every library proffered by either the government or the plaintiffs received complaints, in varying degrees of frequency, from library patrons who saw other patrons accessing sexually explicit material on the library's Internet terminals. In general, First Amendment jurisprudence is reluctant to recognize a legitimate state interest in protecting the unwilling viewer from speech that is constitutionally protected. ""Where the designed benefit of a content-based speech restriction is to shield the sensibilities of listeners, the general rule is that the right of expression prevails, even where no less restrictive alternative exists. We are expected to protect our own sensibilities simply by averting our eyes."" Playboy, 529 U.S. at 813 (2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 209 (1975) (""[W]hen the government, acting as censor, undertakes selectively to shield the public from some kinds of speech on the ground that they are more offensive than others, the First Amendment strictly limits its power."").  146   For example, in Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971), the Supreme Court reversed defendant's conviction for wearing, in a municipal courthouse, a jacket bearing the inscription ""Fuck the Draft."" The Court noted that ""much has been made of the claim that Cohen's distasteful mode of expression was thrust upon unwilling or unsuspecting viewers, and that the State might therefore legitimately act as it did in order to protect the sensitive from otherwise unavoidable exposure to appellant's crude form of protest."" Id. at 21. This justification for suppressing speech failed, however, because it ""would effectively empower a majority to silence dissidents simply as a matter of personal predilections."" Id. The Court concluded that ""[t]hose in the Los Angeles courthouse could effectively avoid further bombardment of their sensibilities simply by averting their eyes."" Id. Similarly, in Erznoznik, the Court invalidated on its face a municipal ordinance prohibiting drive-in movie theaters from showing films containing nudity if they were visible from a public street or place. The city's ""primary argument [was] that it may protect its citizens against unwilling exposure to materials that may be offensive."" 422 U.S. at 208. The Court soundly rejected this interest in shielding the unwilling viewer: The plain, if at times disquieting, truth is that in our pluralistic society, constantly proliferating new and ingenious forms of expression, we are inescapably captive audiences for many purposes. Much that we encounter offends our esthetic, if not our political and moral, sensibilities. Nevertheless, the Constitution does not permit government to decide which types of otherwise protected speech are sufficiently offensive to require protection for the unwilling listener or viewer. Rather, absent . . . narrow circumstances . . . the burden normally falls upon the viewer to avoid 147   further bombardment of his sensibilities simply by averting his eyes. 422 U.S. at 210-11 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The state's interest in protecting unwilling viewers from exposure to patently offensive material is accounted for, to some degree, by obscenity doctrine, which originated in part to permit the state to shield the unwilling viewer. ""The Miller standard, like its predecessors, was an accommodation between the State's interests in protecting the sensibilities of unwilling recipients from exposure to pornographic material and the dangers of censorship inherent in unabashedly content-based laws."" Ferber, 458 U.S. at 756 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Miller, 413 U.S. at 18-19 (""This Court has recognized that the States have a legitimate interest in prohibiting dissemination or exhibition of obscene material when the mode of dissemination carries with it a significant danger of offending the sensibilities of unwilling recipients or of exposure to juveniles."") (citation omitted). To the extent that speech has serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value, and therefore is not obscene under the Miller test of obscenity, the state's interest in shielding unwilling viewers from such speech is tenuous. Nonetheless, the Court has recognized that in certain limited circumstances, the state has a legitimate interest in protecting the public from unwilling exposure to speech that is not obscene. This interest has justified restrictions on speech ""when the speaker intrudes on the privacy of the home, or the degree of captivity makes it impractical for  148   the unwilling viewer or auditor to avoid exposure."" Erznoznik 422 U.S. at 209 (citations , omitted). Thus, in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978), the Court relied on the state's interest in shielding viewers' sensibilities to uphold a prohibition against profanity in radio broadcasts: Patently offensive, indecent material presented over the airwaves confronts the citizen, not only in public, but also in the privacy of the home, where the individual's right to be left alone plainly outweighs the First Amendment rights of an intruder. Because the broadcast audience is constantly tuning in and out, prior warnings cannot completely protect the listener or viewer from unexpected program content. Id. at 748 (citation omitted); accord Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 485 (1988) (""Although in many locations, we expect individuals simply to avoid speech they do not want to hear, the home is different.""); see also Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298, 302 (1974) (plurality opinion) (upholding a content-based restriction on the sale of advertising space in public transit vehicles and noting that ""[t]he streetcar audience is a captive audience""). Although neither the Supreme Court nor the Third Circuit has recognized a compelling state interest in shielding the sensibilities of unwilling viewers, beyond laws intended to preserve the privacy of individuals' homes or to protect captive audiences, we do not read the case law as categorically foreclosing recognition, in the public library setting, of the state's interest in protecting unwilling viewers. See Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 749 n.27 (""Outside the home, the balance between the offensive speaker and the unwilling audience may sometimes tip in favor of the speaker, requiring the offended 149   listener to turn away."") (emphasis added). Under certain circumstances, therefore a public library might have a compelling interest in protecting library patrons and staff from unwilling exposure to sexually explicit speech that, although not obscene, is patently offensive. 3. Preventing Unlawful or Inappropriate Conduct Several of the librarians proffered by the government testified that unfiltered Internet access had led to occurrences of criminal or otherwise inappropriate conduct by library patrons, such as public masturbation, and harassment of library staff and patrons, sometimes rising to the level of physical assault. As in the case with patron complaints, however,the government adduced no quantitative data comparing the frequency of criminalor otherwise inappropriatepatron conduct before the library's use of filters and afterthelibrary's use of filters. The sporadic anecdotal accounts of the government's library witnesses were countered by anecdotal accounts by the plaintiffs' library witnesses,that incidents of offensive patron behavior in public libraries have long predatedthe advent of Internet access. Aside from a public library's interest in preventing patrons from using the library's Internetterminals to receive obscenity or child pornography, which constitutes criminal conduct,we are constrained to reject any compelling state interest in regulating patrons' conductasa justification for content-based restrictions on patrons' Internet access. ""[T]heCourt's First Amendment cases draw vital distinctions between words and deeds,  150   betweenideas and conduct."" Ashcroft, 122 S. Ct. at 1403. First Amendment jurisprudence makes clear that speech may not be restricted on the ground that restricting  speech will reduce crime or other undesirable behavior that the speech is thought to cause, subject to only a narrow exception for speech that ""is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action."" Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 447 (1969) (per curiam). ""The mere tendency of speech to encourage unlawful acts is insufficient reason for banning it."" Ashcroft, 122 S. Ct. at 1403. Outside of the narrow ""incitement"" exception, the appropriate method of deterring unlawful or otherwise undesirable behavior is not to suppress the speech that induces such behavior, but to attach sanctions to the behavior itself. ""Among free men, the deterrents ordinarily to be applied to prevent crime are education and punishment for violations of the law, not abridgement of the rights of free speech."" Kingsley Int'l Pictures Corp. v. Regents of the Univ. of the State of New York, 360 U.S. 684, 689 (1959) (quoting Whitney v. Cal., 274 U.S. 357, 378 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring)); see also Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. 514, 529 (2001) (""The normal method of deterring unlawful conduct is to impose an appropriate punishment on the person who engages in it.""). 4. Summary In sum, we reject a public library's interest in preventing unlawful or otherwise  151   inappropriate patron conduct as a basis for restricting patrons' access to speech on the Internet. The proper method for a library to deter unlawful or inappropriate patron conduct, such as harassment or assault of other patrons, is to impose sanctions on such conduct, such as either removing the patron from the library, revoking the patron's library privileges, or, in the appropriate case, calling the police. We believe, however, that the state interests in preventing the dissemination of obscenity, child pornography, or in the case of minors, material harmful to minors, and in protecting library patrons from being unwillingly exposed to offensive, sexually explicit material, could all justify, for First Amendment purposes, a public library's use of Internet filters, provided that use of such filters is narrowly tailored to further those interests, and that no less restrictive means of promoting those interests exist. Accordingly, we turn to the narrow tailoring question. B. Narrow Tailoring Having identified the relevant state interests that could justify content-based restrictions on public libraries' provision of Internet access, we must determine whether a public library's use of software filters is narrowly tailored to further those interests. ""It is not enough to show that the Government's ends are compelling; the means must be carefully tailored to achieve those ends."" Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989). ""[M]anifest imprecision of [a] ban . . . reveals that its proscription is not sufficiently tailored to the harms it seeks to prevent to justify . . .  152   substantial interference with . . . speech."" FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U.S. 364, 392 (1984). The commercially available filters on which evidence was presented at trial all block many thousands of Web pages that are clearly not harmful to minors, and many thousands more pages that, while possibly harmful to minors, are neither obscene nor child pornography. See supra, Subsection II.E.7. Even the defendants' own expert, after analyzing filtering products' performance in public libraries, concluded that of the blocked Web pages to which library patrons sought access, between 6% and 15% containedno content that meets even the filtering products' own definitions of sexually explicitcontent, let alone the legal definitions of obscenity or child pornography, which noneof the filtering companies thatwere studied use as the basis for their blocking decisions. Moreover, in light of the flaws in these studies, discussed in detail in our findingsof fact above, these percentages significantly underestimate the amount of speechthat filters erroneously block, and at best provide a rough lower bound on the filters'rates of overblocking. Given the substantial amount of constitutionally protected speechblocked by the filters studied, we conclude that use of such filters is not narrowly tailoredwith respect to the government's interest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity,child pornography, and material harmful to minors. Tobe sure, the quantitative estimates of the rates of overblocking apply only to thosefourcommercially a"

Preliminary Statement This case challenges an act of Congress that makes the use of filtering software by publiclibraries a condition of the receipt of federal funding. The Internet, as is well known,isa vast, interactive medium based on a decentralized network of computers aroundtheworld. Its most familiar feature is the World Wide Web (the ""Web""), a networkof computers known as servers that provide content to users. The Internet provideseasy access to anyone who wishes to provide or distribute information to a worldwideaudience; it is used by more than 143 million Americans. Indeed, much of the world'sknowledge accumulated over centuries is available to Internet users almost instantly. Approximately 10% of the Americans who use the Internet access it at public libraries. And approximately 95% of all public libraries in the United States provide publicaccess to the Internet. While the beneficial effect of the Internet in expanding the amount of information availableto its users is self-evident, its low entry barriers have also led to a perverse resultfacilitation of the widespread dissemination of hardcore pornography within the easy reach not only of adults who have every right to access it (so long as it is not legally obsceneorchild pornography), but also of children and adolescents to whom it may be quiteharmful. The volume of pornography on the Internet is huge, and the record before usdemonstrates that public library patrons of all ages, many from ages 11 to 15, have regularly sought to access it in public library settings. There are more than 100,000  4   pornographic Web sites that can beaccessed for free and without providing any registration information, and tens of thousands of Web sites contain child pornography. Libraries have reacted to this situation by utilizing a number of means designed to insurethat patrons avoid illegal (and unwanted) content while also enabling patrons to findthecontent they desire. Some libraries have trained patrons in how to use the Internetwhile avoiding illegal content, or have directed their patrons to ""preferred"" Web sitesthatlibrarians have reviewed. Other libraries have utilized such devices as recessing thecomputer monitors, installing privacy screens, and monitoring implemented by a ""tap ontheshoulder"" of patrons perceived to be offending library policy. Still others, viewing theforegoing approaches as inadequate or uncomfortable (some librarians do not wish to confrontpatrons), have purchased commercially available software that blocks certain categoriesof material deemed by the library board as unsuitable for use in their facilities. Indeed,7% of American public libraries use blocking software for adults. Although such programsare somewhat effective in blocking large quantities of pornography, they are bluntinstruments that not only ""underblock,"" i.e., fail to block access to substantial amountsof content that the library boards wish to exclude, but also, central to this litigation,""overblock,"" i.e., block access to large quantities of material that library boards donotwish to exclude and that is constitutionally protected. Most of the libraries that use filtering software seek to block sexually explicit speech. While most libraries include in their physical collection copies of volumes such  5   as TheJoyof Sex and The Joy of Gay Sex, which contain quite explicit photographs and descriptions, filtering software blocks large quantities of other, comparable information abouthealth and sexuality that adults and teenagers seek on the Web. One teenager testifiedthat the Internet access in a public library was the only venue in which she could obtaininformation important to her about her own sexuality. Another library patron witnessdescribed using the Internet to research breast cancer and reconstructive surgery forhismother who had breast surgery. Even though some filtering programs contain exceptionsfor health and education, the exceptions do not solve the problem of overblocking constitutionally protected material. Moreover, as we explain below, the filteringsoftware on which the parties presented evidence in this case overblocks not only information relating to health and sexuality that might be mistaken for pornography or erotica,but also vast numbers of Web pages and sites that could not even arguably be construedas harmful or inappropriate for adults or minors. The Congress, sharing the concerns of many library boards, enacted the Children's InternetProtection Act (""CIPA""), Pub. L. No. 106-554, which makes the use of filters by apubliclibrary a condition of its receipt of two kinds of subsidies that are important (or evencritical) to the budgets of many public libraries  grants under the Library Services andTechnology Act, 20 U.S.C.  9101 et seq. (""LSTA""), and so-called ""E-rate discounts"" forInternet access and support under the Telecommunications Act, 47 U.S.C.  254. LSTAgrant funds are awarded, inter alia, in order to: (1) assist libraries in accessing  6   information through electronic networks, and (2) provide targeted library and information servicesto persons having difficulty using a library and to underserved and rural communities, including children from families with incomes below the poverty line. Eratediscounts serve the similar purpose of extending Internet access to schools and librariesin low-income communities. CIPA requires that libraries, in order to receive LSTAfunds or E-rate discounts, certify that they are using a ""technology protection measure""that prevents patrons from accessing ""visual depictions"" that are ""obscene,"" ""childpornography,"" or in the caseof minors, ""harmful to minors."" 20 U.S.C.  9134(f)(1)(A) (LSTA); 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(B) & (C) (E-rate). The plaintiffs, a group of libraries, library associations, library patrons, and Web sitepublishers, brought this suit against the United States and others alleging that CIPA is facially unconstitutional because: (1) it induces public libraries to violate their patrons' FirstAmendment rights contrary to the requirements of South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203(1987); and (2) it requires libraries to relinquish their First Amendment rights as a conditionon the receipt of federal funds and is therefore impermissible under the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions. In arguing that CIPA will induce public libraries to  violate the First Amendment, the plaintiffs contend that given the limits of the filtering technology, CIPA's conditions effectively require libraries to impose content-based restrictions on their patrons' access to constitutionally protected speech. According to the plaintiffs, these content-based restrictions are subject to strict scrutiny under public  7   forum doctrine, see Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 837 (1995), and are therefore permissible only if they are narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest and no less restrictive alternatives would further that interest, see Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 874 (1997).1 The government responds that CIPA will not induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment, since it is possible for at least some public libraries to constitutionally comply with CIPA's conditions. Even if some libraries' use of filters might violate the First Amendment, the government submits that CIPA can be facially invalidated only if it is impossible for any public library to comply with its conditions without violating the First Amendment. Pursuant to CIPA, a three-judge Court was convened to try the issues. Pub. L. No. 106-554. Following an intensive period of discovery on an expedited schedule to allow publiclibraries to know whether they need to certify compliance with CIPA by July 1, 2002,toreceive subsidies for the upcoming year, the Court conducted an eight-day trial at whichweheard 20 witnesses, and received numerous depositions, stipulations and Plaintiffs advance three other alternative, independent grounds for holding CIPA facially invalid. First, they submit that even if CIPA will not induce public libraries to violatethe First Amendment, CIPA nonetheless imposes an unconstitutional condition on publiclibraries by requiring them to relinquish their own First Amendment rights to provideunfiltered Internet access as a condition on their receipt of federal funds. See infra n.36. Second, plaintiffs contend that CIPA is facially invalid because it effectsan impermissible prior restraint on speech by granting filtering companies and library staff unfettereddiscretion to suppress speech before it has been received by library patrons and beforeithas been subject to a judicial determination that it is unprotected under the First Amendment. See Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546, 558 (1975). Finally,plaintiffs submit that CIPAis unconstitutionally vague. See City of Chicagov. Morales,527 U.S. 41 (1999). 8 1   documents. The principal focus of the trial was on the capacity of currently available filteringsoftware. The plaintiffs adduced substantial evidence not only that filtering programsbar access to a substantial amount of speech on the Internet that is clearly constitutionally protected for adults and minors, but also that these programs are intrinsically unable to block only illegal Internet content while simultaneously allowing accesstoall protected speech. Asour extensive findings of fact reflect, the plaintiffs demonstrated that thousands of Webpages containing protected speech are wrongly blocked by the four leading filteringprograms, and these pagesrepresent only a fraction of Web pages wrongly blockedby the programs. The plaintiffs' evidence explained that the problems facedby themanufacturers and vendors of filtering software are legion. The Web is extremely dynamic,with an estimated 1.5 million new pages added every day and the contents of existingWeb pages changing very rapidly. The category lists maintained by the blocking programsare considered to be proprietary information, and hence are unavailable to customersor the general public for review, so that public libraries that select categories whenimplementing filtering software do not really know what they are blocking. There are many reasons why filtering software suffers from extensive over- and underblocking, which we will explain below in great detail. They center on the limitationson filtering companies' ability to: (1) accurately collect Web pages that potentially fall into a blocked category (e.g., pornography); (2) review and categorize  9   Webpages that they have collected; and (3) engage in regular re-review of Web pages thatthey have previously reviewed. These failures spring from constraints on the technology of automated classification systems, and the limitations inherent in human review,including error, misjudgment, and scarce resources, which we describe in detail infra at58-74. One failure of critical importance is that the automated systems that filteringcompanies use to collect Web pages for classification are able to search only text,notimages. This is crippling to filtering companies' ability to collect pages containing ""visual depictions"" that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors, asCIPArequires. As will appear, we find that it is currently impossible, given the Internet'ssize, rate of growth, rate of change, and architecture, and given the state of the artof automated classification systems, to develop a filter that neither underblocks nor overblocksa substantial amount of speech. The government, while acknowledging that the filtering software is imperfect, maintainsthat it is nonetheless quite effective, and that it successfully blocks the vast majority of the Web pages that meet filtering companies' category definitions (e.g., pornography). The government contends that no more is required. In its view, so long as thefiltering software selected by the libraries screens out the bulk of the Web pages proscribedby CIPA, the libraries have made a reasonable choice which suffices, under theapplicable legal principles, to pass constitutional muster in the context of a facial challenge. Central to the government's position is the analogy it advances between  10   Internetfiltering and the initial decision of a library to determine which materials to purchasefor its print collection. Public libraries have finite budgets and must make choicesasto whether to purchase, for example, books on gardening or books on golf. Suchcontent-based decisions, eventhe plaintiffs concede, are subject to rational basis reviewand not a stricter form of First Amendment scrutiny. In the government's view, thefactthat the Internet reverses the acquisition process and requires the libraries to, in effect,purchase the entire Internet, some of which (e.g., hardcore pornography) it does notwant,should not mean that it ischargeable with censorship when it filters out offendingmaterial. The legal context in which this extensive factual record is set is complex, implicating a number of constitutional doctrines, including the constitutional limitations onCongress's spending clause power, the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, and subsidiary to these issues, the First Amendment doctrines of prior restraint, vagueness, andoverbreadth. There are a number of potential entry points into the analysis, but the mostlogical is the spending clause jurisprudence in which the seminal case is South Dakotav.Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987). Dole outlines four categories of constraints on Congress's exercise of its power under the Spending Clause, but the only Dole condition disputedhere is the fourth and last, i.e., whether CIPA requires libraries that receive LSTAfunds or E-rate discounts to violate the constitutional rights of their patrons. As willappear, the question is not a simple one, and turns on the level of scrutiny applicable  11   toapubliclibrary's content-based restrictions on patrons' Internet access. Whether such restrictions are subject to strict scrutiny, as plaintiffs contend, or only rational basis review,asthe government contends, depends on public forum doctrine. The government argues that,in providing Internet access, public libraries do not createapublic forum, since public libraries may reserve the right to exclude certain speakersfrom availing themselves of the forum. Accordingly, the government contends thatpublic libraries' restrictions on patrons' Internet access are subject only to rational basisreview. Plaintiffs respond that the government's ability to restrict speech on its own property,as in the case of restrictions on Internet access in public libraries, is not unlimited, and that the more widely the state facilitates the dissemination of private  speech in a given forum, the more vulnerable the state's decision is to restrict access to speech in that forum. We agree with the plaintiffs that public libraries' content-based restrictions on their patrons' Internet access are subject to strict scrutiny. In providing evenfiltered Internet access, publiclibraries create a public forum open to any speaker aroundthe world to communicate with library patrons via the Internet on a virtually unlimitednumber of topics. Where the state provides access to a ""vast democratic  forum[],"" Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 868 (1997), open to any member of the public to speak on subjects ""as diverse as human thought,"" id. at 870 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), the state's decision selectively to exclude from the forum speech whose  12   content the state disfavors is subject to strict scrutiny, as such exclusions risk distorting the marketplace of ideas that the state has facilitated. Application of strict scrutiny finds further support in the extent to which public libraries' provision of Internet access uniquely promotes First Amendment values in a manner analogous to traditional public fora such as streets, sidewalks, and parks, in which content-based restrictions are always subject to strict scrutiny. Under strict scrutiny, a public library's use of filtering software is permissible only if itisnarrowly tailored to further a compelling government interest and no less restrictive alternativewould serve that interest. We acknowledge that use of filtering software furtherspublic libraries' legitimate interests in preventing patrons from accessing visual depictionsof obscenity, child pornography, or in the case of minors, material harmful to minors. Moreover, use of filters also helps prevent patrons from being unwillingly exposedto patently offensive, sexually explicit content on the Internet. We are sympathetic to the position of the government, believing that it would be desirableif there were a means to ensure that public library patrons could share in the informational bonanza of the Internet while being insulated from materials that meet CIPA'sdefinitions, that is, visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or in the caseof minors, harmful to minors. Unfortunately this outcome, devoutly to be wished, is notavailable in this less than best of all possible worlds. No category definition used by theblocking programs is identical to the legal definitions of obscenity, child pornography,  13   ormaterial harmful to minors, and, at all events, filtering programs fail to block access to asubstantial amount of content on the Internet that falls into the categories defined by CIPA. Aswill appear, we credit the testimony of plaintiffs' expert Dr. Geoffrey Nunberg thattheblocking software is (at least for the foreseeable future) incapable of effectively blockingthe majority of materials in the categories defined by CIPA without overblocking a substantial amount of materials. Nunberg's analysis was supported by extensiverecord evidence. As noted above, this inability to prevent both substantial amountsof underblocking and overblocking stems from several sources, including limitations on the technology that software filtering companies use to gather and review Webpages, limitations on resources for human review of Web pages, and the necessary errorthatresults from human review processes. Because the filtering software mandated by CIPA will block access to substantial amountsof constitutionally protected speech whose suppression serves no legitimate government interest, we are persuaded that a public library's use of software filters is not narrowly tailored to further any of these interests. Moreover, less restrictive alternatives existthatfurther the government's legitimate interest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity,child pornography, and material harmful to minors, and in preventing patrons from being unwillingly exposed to patently offensive, sexually explicit content. To preventpatrons from accessing visual depictions that are obscene and child pornography, publiclibraries may enforce Internet use policies that make clear to patrons that the  14   library'sInternet terminals may not be used to access illegal speech. Libraries may then imposepenalties on patrons who violate these policies, ranging from a warning to notification of law enforcement, in the appropriate case. Less restrictive alternatives to filteringthat further libraries' interest in preventing minors from exposure to visual depictionsthat are harmful to minors include requiring parental consent to or presence duringunfiltered access, or restricting minors' unfiltered access to terminals within view of library staff. Finally, optional filtering, privacy screens, recessed monitors, and placementof unfiltered Internet terminals outside of sight-lines provide less restrictive alternatives for libraries to prevent patrons from being unwillingly exposed to sexually explicitcontent on the Internet. Inan effort to avoid the potentially fatal legal implications of the overblocking problem,the government falls back on the ability of the libraries, under CIPA's disabling provisions, see CIPA  1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C.  9134(f)(3)), CIPA 1721(b) (codifiedat 47 U.S.C.  254(h)(6)(D)), to unblock a site that is patently proper yet improperly blocked. The evidence reflects that libraries can and do unblock the filters whenapatron so requests. But it also reflects that requiring library patrons to ask for a Websiteto be unblocked will determany patrons because they are embarrassed, or desire toprotecttheir privacy or remain anonymous. Moreover, the unblocking may take days, andmay be unavailable, especially in branch libraries, which are often less well staffed thanmainlibraries. Accordingly, CIPA's disabling provisions do not cure the  15   constitutional deficiencies in publiclibraries' use of Internet filters. Under these circumstances we are constrained to conclude that the library plaintiffsmust prevail in their contention that CIPA requires them to violate the First Amendment rights of their patrons, and accordingly is facially invalid, even under the standardurged on us by the government, which would permit us to facially invalidate CIPAonly if it is impossible for a single public library to comply with CIPA's conditions withoutviolating the First Amendment. In view of the limitations inherent in the filtering technology mandated by CIPA, any public library that adheres to CIPA's conditions will necessarily restrict patrons' access to a substantial amount of protected speech, in violationof the First Amendment. Given this conclusion, we need not reach plaintiffs' argumentsthat CIPA effects a priorrestraint on speech and is unconstitutionally vague. Nordowe decide their cognate unconstitutional conditions theory, though for reasons explained infra at note 36, we discuss the issues raised by that claim at some length. For these reasons, we will enter an Order declaring Sections 1712(a)(2) and 1721(b)of the Children's Internet Protection Act, codified at 20 U.S.C.  9134(f) and 47 U.S.C.254(h)(6), respectively, to be facially invalid under the First Amendment and permanently enjoining the defendants from enforcing those provisions.II. Findings of Fact A. Statutory Framework 1. Nature and Operation of the E-rate and LSTA Programs  16   Inthe Telecommunications Act of 1996 (""1996 Act""), Congress directed the FederalCommunications Commission (""FCC"") to take the steps necessary to establish a system of support mechanisms to ensure the delivery of affordable telecommunications servicetoall Americans. This system, referred to as ""universal service,"" is codified in section254 of the CommunicationsAct of 1934, as amended by the 1996 Act. See 47 U.S.C.254. Congress specified several groups as beneficiaries of the universal service supportmechanism, including consumers in high-cost areas, low-income consumers, schoolsand libraries, and rural health care providers. See 47 U.S.C.  254(h)(1). The extensionof universal service to schools and libraries in section 254(h) is commonly referredto as the Schools and Libraries Program, or ""E-rate"" Program. Under the E-rate Program, ""[a]ll telecommunications carriers serving a geographic areashall,upon a bona fide requestfor any of its services that are within the definition of universalservice . . ., provide such services to elementary schools, secondary schools, and librariesfor educational purposes at rates less than the amounts charged for similar servicestoother parties."" 47 U.S.C.  254(h)(1)(B). Under FCC regulations, providers of ""interstate telecommunications"" (with certain exceptions, see 47 C.F.R.  54.706(d)), mustcontribute a portion of their revenue for disbursement among eligible carriers that areproviding services to those groups or areas specified by Congress in section 254. To beeligible for the discounts, a library must: (1) be eligible for assistance from a State library administrative agency underthe Library Services and Technology Act, see infra;  17   (2)befunded as an independent entity, completely separate from any schools; and (3) not beoperating as a for-profit business. See 47 C.F.R.  54.501(c). Discounts on services foreligible libraries are set as a percentage of the pre-discount price, and range from 20% to90%,depending on a library's level of economic disadvantage and its location in an urbanorrural area. See 47 C.F.R.  54.505. Currently, a library's level of economic disadvantage is based on the percentage of students eligible for the national school lunch program in the school district in which the library is located. TheLibrary Services and Technology Act (""LSTA""), Subchapter II of the Museum andLibrary Services Act, 20 U.S.C.  9101 et seq., was enacted by Congress in 1996 as partof theOmnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 104-208. The LSTAestablishes three grant programs to achieve the goal of improving library services acrossthenation. Under the Grants to States Program, LSTA grant funds are awarded, interalia,in order to assist libraries in accessing information through electronic networks andpay for the costs of acquiring or sharing computer systems and telecommunications technologies. See 20 U.S.C.  9141(a). Through the Grants to States program, LSTA fundshave been used to acquire and pay costs associated with Internet-accessible computerslocated in libraries. 2. CIPA TheChildren's Internet Protection Act (""CIPA"") was enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001, which consolidated and enacted several  18   appropriations bills, including the Miscellaneous Appropriations Act, of which CIPA was apart. See Pub. L. No. 106-554. CIPA addresses three distinct types of federal funding programs:(1) aid to elementary and secondary schools pursuant to Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, see CIPA  1711 (amending Title 20 toadd3601); (2) LSTA grants to states for support of libraries, see CIPA  1712 (amendingthe Museum and Library Services Act, 20 U.S.C.  9134); and (3) discounts undertheE-rate program, see CIPA  1721(a) & (b) (both amending the Communications Actof 1934, 47 U.S.C.  254(h)). Only sections 1712 and 1721(b) of CIPA, which apply tolibraries, are at issue in this case. Asexplained in more detail below, CIPA requires libraries that participate in the LSTAand E-rate programs to certify that they are using software filters on their computersto protect against visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or in thecaseof minors, harmful to minors. CIPA permits library officials to disable the filters forpatrons for bona fide research or other lawful purposes, but disabling is not permitted forminorpatrons if the library receives E-rate discounts. a. CIPA's Amendments to the E-rate Program Section 1721(b) of CIPA imposes conditions on a library's participation in the Erateprogram. A library ""having one or more computers with Internet access may not receiveservices at discount rates,"" CIPA  1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C.  254(h)(6)(A)(i)), unless the library certifies that it is ""enforcing a policy of Internet safety  19   thatincludes the operation of a technology protection measure with respect to any of its computerswith Internet access thatprotects against access through such computers to visualdepictions that are  (I) obscene; (II) child pornography; or (III) harmful to minors,""and that it is ""enforcing the operation of such technology protection measure duringany use of such computers by minors."" CIPA  1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C.  254(h)(6)(B)).2 CIPA defines a ""technology protection measure"" as ""a specific CIPAdefines ""[m]inor"" as ""any individual who has not attained the age of 17 years."" CIPA1721(c) (codified at 47 U.S.C.  254(h)(7)(D)). CIPA further provides that ""[o]bscene"" has the meaning given in 18 U.S.C.  1460, and ""child pornography"" has the meaninggiven in 18 U.S.C.  2256. CIPA  1721(c) (codified at 47 U.S.C.  254(h)(7)(E) & (F)). CIPA definesmaterial that is ""harmful to minors"" as: any picture, image, graphic image file, or other visual depiction that  (i) taken as a whole and with respect to minors, appeals to a prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion; (ii) depicts, describes, or represents, in a patently offensive way with respect to what is suitable for minors, an actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact, actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual acts, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals; and (iii) taken as awhole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value as to minors. CIPA1721(c) (codified at 47 U.S.C.  254(h)(7)(G)). CIPA prohibits federal interference in local determinations regarding what Internet contentisappropriate for minors: Adetermination regarding what matter is appropriate for minors shall be made by the school board, local educational agency, library or other authority responsible for making the determination. No agency or instrumentality of the United States Government may  (A) establish criteria for making such determination; (B) review the determination made by the certifying [entity] . . . ; or (C) consider the criteria employed by the certifying [entity] . . . in the administration of subsection (h)(1)(B). CIPA1732 (codified at 47 U.S.C.  254(l)(2)). 20 2   technology that blocks or filters access to visual depictions that are obscene, . . . child pornography, . . . or harmful to minors."" CIPA  1703(b)(1) (codified at 47 U.S.C.  254(h)(7)(I)). Toreceive E-rate discounts, a library must also certify that filtering software is in operationduring adult use of the Internet. More specifically, with respect to adults, a library must certify that it is ""enforcing a policy of Internet safety that includes the operationof a technology protection measure with respect to any of its computers with Internetaccess that protects against access through such computers to visual depictions thatare(I) obscene; or (II) child pornography,"" and that it is ""enforcing the operation of suchtechnology protection measure during any use of such computers."" CIPA  1721(b) (codifiedat 47 U.S.C.  254(h)(6)(C)). Interpreting the statutory terms ""any use,"" the FCChasconcluded that ""CIPA makes no distinction between computers used only by staff andthose accessible to the public."" In re Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service:Children's Internet Protection Act, CC Docket No. 96-45, Report and Order, FCC01-120,  30 (Apr. 5, 2001). With respect to libraries receiving E-rate discounts, CIPA further specifies that ""[a]nadministrator, supervisor, or other person authorized by the certifying authority . . . may disable the technology protection measure concerned, during use by an adult, to enableaccess for bona fide research or other lawful purpose."" CIPA 1721(b) (codified at47U.S.C.  254(h)(6)(D)).  21   b. CIPA's Amendments to the LSTA Program Section 1712 of CIPA amends the Museum and Library Services Act (20 U.S.C.  9134(f))toprovide that no funds made available under the Act ""may be used to purchase computers used to access the Internet, or to pay for direct costs associated with accessing theInternet,"" unless such library ""has in place"" and is enforcing ""a policy of Internet safety thatincludes the operation of a technology protection measure with respect to any of itscomputers with Internet access that protects against access through such computers tovisualdepictions"" that are ""obscene"" or ""child pornography,"" and, when the computers areinuseby minors, also protects against access to visual depictions that are ""harmful to minors."" CIPA  1712 (codified at20 U.S.C.  9134(f)(1)). Section 1712 contains definitionsof ""technology protection measure,"" ""obscene,"" ""child pornography,"" and ""harmfulto minors,"" that are substantially similar to those found in the provisions governingthe E-rate program. CIPA  1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C.  9134(f)(7)); see also supra note 2. Asunder the E-rate program, ""an administrator, supervisor or other authority may disableatechnology protection measure . . . to enable access for bona fide research or otherlawful purposes."" CIPA  1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C.  9134(f)(3)). Whereas CIPA'samendments to the E-rate program permit disabling for bona fide research or otherlawful purposes only during adult use, the LSTA provision permits disabling for bothadults and minors.  22   B. Identity of the Plaintiffs 1. Library and Library Association Plaintiffs Plaintiffs American Library Association, Alaska Library Association, California Library Association, Connecticut Library Association, Freedom to Read Foundation, MaineLibrary Association, New England Library Association, New York Library Association, and Wisconsin Library Association are non-profit organizations whose membersinclude public libraries that receive either E-rate discounts or LSTA funds for theprovision of Internet access. Because it is a prerequisite to associational standing, we notethatthe interests that these organizations seek to protect in this litigation are central totheir raison d'tre. Plaintiffs Fort Vancouver Regional Library District, in southwest Washington state;Multnomah County Public Library, in Multnomah County, Oregon; Norfolk Public Library System, in Norfolk, Virginia; Santa Cruz Public Library Joint Powers Authority, inSantaCruz, California; South Central Library System (""SCLS""), centered in Madison, Wisconsin; and the Westchester Library System, in Westchester County, New York, are publiclibrary systems with branch offices in their respective localities that provide Internetaccess to their patrons. TheFort Vancouver Regional Library District, for over three years from 19992001,received $135,000 in LSTA grants and $19,500 in E-rate discounts for Internet access. The Multnomah County Public Library received $70,000 in E-rate discountsfor  23   Internetaccess this year, and has applied for $100,000 in E-rate discounts for the upcomingyear. The Norfolk Public Library System received $90,000 in E-rate discounts forInternet access this year, and has received a $200,000 LSTA grant to put computer labsineight of its libraries. The Santa Cruz Public Library Joint Powers Authority received$20,560 in E-rate discounts for Internet access in 2001-02. The SCLS received between$3,000 and $5,000 this year in E-rate discounts for Internet access. The Fort Vancouver Regional Library District Board is a public board whose membersare appointed by elected county commissioners. The Multnomah County Library isa county department, whose board is appointed by the county chair and confirmedby the other commissioners. The SCLS is an aggregation of 51 independently governedstatutory member public libraries, whose relationship to SCLS is defined by statelaw. The governing body of the SCLS is the Library Board of Trustees, which consistsof 20 members nominated by county executives and ratified by county boards of supervisors. 2. Patron and Patron Association Plaintiffs Plaintiffs Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, Friends of thePhiladelphia City Institute Library, and the Pennsylvania Alliance for Democracy are nonprofitorganizations whose members include individuals who access the Internet at publiclibraries that receive E-rate discounts or LSTA funds for the provision of public Internetaccess. We note for the purpose of associational standing that the interests that  24   theseorganizations seek to protect in this litigation are germane to their purposes. Plaintiffs Emmalyn Rood, Mark Brown, Elizabeth Hrenda, C. Donald Weinberg, SherronDixon, by her father and next friend Gordon Dixon, James Geringer, Marnique TyneshaOverby, by her next friend Carolyn C. Williams, William J. Rosenbaum, Carolyn C.Williams, and Quiana Williams, by her mother and next friend Sharon Bernard, are adultsandminors who use the Internet at public libraries that, to the best of their knowledge, do not filter patrons' access to the Internet. Several of these plaintiffs do not haveInternet access from home. Emmalyn Rood is a sixteen-year-old who uses the Multnomah County Public Library. When she was 13, she used the Internet at the Multnomah County Public Library toresearch issues relating to her sexual identity. Ms. Rood did not use her home or schoolcomputer for this research, in part because she wished her searching to be private. Althoughthe library offered patrons the option of using filtering software, Ms. Rood did notusethat option because she had had previous experience with such programs blocking information that was valuable to her, including information relating to gay and lesbian issues. Plaintiff Mark Brown used the Internet at the Philadelphia Free Library to research breastcancer and reconstructive surgery for his mother who had breast surgery. Mr. Brown'sresearch at the library provided him and his mother with essential information abouthismother's medical condition and potential treatments.  25   3. W eb Publisher Plaintiffs Plaintiff Afraid to Ask, Inc.,based in Saunderstown, Rhode Island, publishes a healtheducation Web site, www.AfraidtoAsk.com. Dr. Jonathan Bertman, the president andmedical director of Afraid to Ask, is a family practice physician in rural Rhode Island andaclinical assistant professor of family medicine at Brown University. AfraidtoAsk.com's mission is to provide detailed information on sensitive health issues, oftenof asexual nature, such as sexually transmitted diseases, male and female genitalia, andbirthcontrol, sought by people of all ages who would prefer to learn about sensitive healthissues anonymously, i.e., they are ""afraid to ask."" As part of its educational mission,AfraidtoAsk.com often uses graphic images of sexual anatomy to convey information. Its primary audience is teens and young adults. Based on survey data collectedon the site, half of the people visiting the site are under 24 years old and a quarterare under 18. AfraidtoAsk.com is blocked by several leading blocking products ascontaining sexually explicit content. Plaintiff Alan Guttmacher Institute has a Web site that contains information about itsactivities and objectives, including its mission to protect the reproductive choices of womenand men. Plaintiff Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. (""Planned Parenthood"") is a national voluntary organization in the field of reproductive health care. PlannedParenthood owns and operates several Web sites that provide a range of information about reproductive health, from contraception to prevention of sexually  26   transmitted diseases, to finding an abortion provider, and to information about the drug Mifepristone. Plaintiff Safersex.org is a Web site that offers free educational information onhowtopractice safer sex. Plaintiff Ethan Interactive, Inc., d/b/a Out In America, is an online content providerthat owns and operates 64 free Web sites for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered persons worldwide. Plaintiff PlanetOut Corporation is an online content providerfor gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered persons. Plaintiff the Naturist ActionCommittee (""NAC"") is the nonprofit political arm of the Naturist Society, a privateorganization that promotes a way of life characterized by the practice of nudity. TheNACWeb site provides information about Naturist Society activities and about state andlocallaws that may affect the rights of Naturists or their ability to practice Naturism, andincludes nude photographs of its members. Plaintiff Wayne L. Parker was the Libertarian candidate in the 2000 U.S. Congressional election for the FifthDistrict of Mississippi (and is running again in 2002). Hepublishes a Web site that communicates information about his campaign and that providesinformation about his political views and the Libertarian Party to the public. Plaintiff Jeffrey Pollock was the Republican candidate in the 2000 U.S. Congressional electionfor the Third District of Oregon. He operates a Web site that is now promoting hiscandidacy for Congress in 2002. 3 3  Thegovernment challenges the standing of several of the plaintiffs and the ripeness of theirclaims. These include all of the Web site publishers and all of the individual 27   C. The Internet 1. Background Aswe noted at the outset, the Internet is a vast, interactive medium consistingof a decentralized network of computers around the world. The Internet presents low entry barrierstoanyone who wishes to provide or distribute information. Unlike television, cable,radio, newspapers, magazines or books, the Internet provides an opportunity for thosewithaccess to it to communicate with a worldwide audience at little cost. At least 400million people use the Internet worldwide, and approximately 143 million Americans wereusing the Internet as of September 2001. Nat'l Telecomm. & Info. Admin., A NationOnline: How Americans Are Expanding Their Use of the Internet (February 2002), available at http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/dn/. The World Wide Web is a part of the Internet that consists of a network of computers, called ""Web servers,"" that host ""pages"" of content accessible via the HypertextTransfer Protocol or ""HTTP."" Anyone with a computer connected to the Internetcan search for and retrieve information stored on Web servers located around the library patrons. Notwithstanding these objections, we are confident that the ""case or controversy"" requirement of Article III,  2 of the Constitution is met by the existence of theplaintiff libraries that qualify for LSTA and E-rate funding and the library associations whose members qualify for such funding. These plaintiffs are faced with the impendingchoice of either certifying compliance with CIPA by July 1, 2002, or foregoingsubsidies under the LSTA and E-rate programs, and therefore clearly have standingto challenge the constitutionality of the conditions to which they will be subject shouldthey accept the subsidies. We also note that the presence of the Web site publishersand individual library patrons does not affect our legal analysis or disposition of thecase. 28   world. Computer users typically access the Web by running a program called a ""browser"" ontheircomputers. The browser displays, as individual pages on the computer screen, thevarious types of content found on the Web and lets the user follow the connections builtintoWeb pages  called ""hypertext links,"" ""hyperlinks,"" or ""links""  to additional content. Two popular browsers are Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator. A""Web page"" is one or more files a browser graphically assembles to make a viewablewhole when a user requests content over the Internet. A Web page may contain avariety of different elements, including text, images, buttons, form fields that the user canfillin,and links to other Web pages. A ""Web site"" is a term that can be used in severaldifferent ways. It may refer to all of the pages and resources available on a particularWeb server. It may also refer to all the pages and resources associated with a particularorganization, company or person, even if these are located on different servers, orinasubdirectory on a single server shared with other, unrelated sites. Typically, aWeb sitehasasan intended point of entry, a ""home page,"" which includes links to other pages onthesame Web site or to pages on other sites. Online discussion groups and chat rooms relatingtoa variety of subjects are available through many Web sites. Users may find content on the Web using engines that search for requested keywords. In response to a keyword request, a search engine will display a list of Web sitesthatmay contain relevant content and provide links to those sites. Search engines anddirectories often return a limited number of sites in their search results (e.g., the  29   Googlesearch engine will return only 2,000 sites in response to a search, even if it has found,forexample, 530,000 sites in its index that meet the search criteria). Auser may also access content on the Web by typing a URL (Uniform Resource Locator)into the address line of the browser. A URL is an address that points to some resourcelocated on a Web server that is accessible over the Internet. This resource may beaWebsite, a Web page, an image, a sound or video file, or other resource. A URL canbeeither a numeric Internet Protocol or ""IP"" address, or an alphanumeric ""domain name""address. Every Web server connected to the Internet is assigned an IP address. A typicalIPaddress looks like ""13.1.64.14."" Typing the URL ""http://13.1.64.14/"" intoa browserwill bring the user to the Web server that corresponds to that address. For convenience, most Web servers have alphanumeric domain name addresses in addition to IPaddresses. For example, typing in ""http://www.paed.uscourts.gov"" will bring the user tothesame Web server as typing in""http://204.170.64.143."" Every time a user attempts to access material located on a Web server by entering a domainname address into a Web browser, a request is made to a Domain Name Server, whichisadirectory of domain names and IP addresses, to ""resolve,"" or translate, the domainname address into an IP address. That IP address is then used to locate the Web serverfrom which content is being requested. A Web site may be accessed by using eitheritsdomain name address or its IP address. Adomain name address typically consists of several parts. For example, the  30   alphanumeric URL http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents/opinions can be broken downintothree parts. The first part is the transfer protocol the computer will use in accessingthe content (e.g., ""http"" for Hypertext Transfer Protocol); next is the name of thehostserver on which the information is stored (e.g., www.paed.uscourts.gov); and thenthename of the particular file or directory on that server (e.g., /documents/opinions). Asingle Web page may be associated with more than one URL. For example, the URLs http://www.newyorktimes.com and http://www.nytimes.com will both take the user tothe New York Times home page. The topmost directory in a Web site is often referred toasthatWeb site's root directory or root URL. For example, in http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents, the root URL is http://www.paed.uscourts.gov. Theremay be hundreds or thousands of pages under a single root URL, or there may be oneoronly a few. There are a number of Web hosting companies that maintain Web sites for other businesses and individuals, which can lead to vast amounts of diverse content being locatedatthe same IP address. Hosting services are offered either for a fee, or in some cases,forfree, allowing any individual with Internet access to create a Web site. Some hostingservices are provided through the process of ""IP-based hosting,"" where each domainname is assigned a unique IP number. For example, www.baseball.com might maptotheIP address ""10.3.5.9"" and www.XXX.com might map to the IP address ""10.0.42.5."" Other hosting services are provided through the process of ""name-based  31   hosting,""where multiple domain name addresses are mapped to a single IP address. If thehosting company were using this method, both www.baseball.com and www.XXX.com could map to a single IP address, e.g., ""10.3.5.9."" As a result of the ""name-based hosting"" process, up to tens of thousands of pages with heterogeneous contentmay share a single IP address. 2. The Index able W eb, the ""Deep W eb""; Their Size and Rates of G row th and Change Theuniverse of content on the Web that could be indexed, in theory, by standard searchengines is known as the ""publicly indexable Web."" The publicly indexable Web is limitedtothose pages that are accessible by following a link from another Web page that isrecognized by a search engine. This limitation exists because online indexing techniquesused by popular search engines and directories such as Yahoo, Lycos and AltaVista,are based on ""spidering"" technology, which finds sites to index by following linksfrom site to site in a continuous search for new content. If a Web page or site is not linkedby others, then spidering will not discover that page or site. Furthermore, many larger Web sites contain instructions, through software, that preventspiders from investigating that site, and therefore the contents of such sites also cannotbeindexed using spidering technology. Because of the vast size and decentralized structureof the Web, no search engine or directory indexes all of the content on the publicly indexable Web. We credit current estimates that no more than 50% of the contentcurrently on the publicly indexable Web has been indexed by all search engines 32   anddirectories combined. No currently available method or combination of methods for collectingURLs can collect the addresses of all URLs on the Web. The portion of the Web that is not theoretically indexable through the use of ""spidering"" technology, because other Web pages do not link to it, is called the ""Deep Web."" Such sites or pages can stillbe made publicly accessible without being made publicly indexable by, for example,using individual or mass emailings (also known as ""spam"")to distribute the URL to potential readers or customers, or by using types of Web linksthatcannot be found by spiders but can be seen and used by readers. ""Spamming"" is acommonmethod of distributing to potential customers links to sexually explicit content thatisnotindexable. Because the Web is decentralized, it is impossible to say exactly how large it is. A 2000study estimated a total of 7.1 million unique Web sites, which at the Web's historicalrate of growth, would have increased to 11 million unique sites as of September 2001. Estimates of the total number of Web pages vary, but a figure of 2 billion is a reasonableestimate of the number of Web pages that can be reached, in theory, by standardsearch engines. We need not make a specific finding as to a figure, for by any measurethe Web is extremely vast, and it is constantly growing. The indexable Web is growingata rate of approximately 1.5 million pages per day. The size of the unindexableWeb, or the ""Deep Web,"" while impossible to determine precisely, is estimated tobetwoto ten times that of the publicly indexable Web.  33   Inaddition to growing rapidly, Web pages and sites are constantly being removed, orchanging their content. Web sites or pages can change content without changing their domainname addresses or IP addresses. Individual Web pages have an average life span of approximately 90 days. 3. The Amount of Sexually Explicit Material on the Web There is a vast amount of sexually explicit material available via the Internet and theWeb. Sexually explicit material on the Internet is easy to access using any public searchengine, such as, for example, Google or AltaVista. Although much of the sexually explicitmaterial available on the Web is posted on commercial sites that require viewers topay inorder to gain access to thesite, a large number of sexually explicit sites may be accessedfor free and without providing any registration information. Most importantly, someWebsites that contain sexually explicit content have innocuous domain names and thereforecan be reached accidentally. A commonly cited example is http://www.whitehouse.com. Other innocent-sounding URLs that retrieve graphic, sexually explicit depictions include http://www.boys.com, http://www.girls.com, http://www.coffeebeansupply.com, and http://www.BookstoreUSA.com. Moreover, commercial Web sites that contain sexually explicit material often use a technique of attachingpop-up windows to their sites, which open new windows advertising other sexually explicit sites without any prompting by the user. This technique makes it difficultfor a user quickly to exit all of the pages containing sexually explicit material,  34   whetherhe or she initially accessedsuch material intentionally or not. The percentage of Web pages on the indexed Web containing sexually explicit contentisrelatively small. Recent estimates indicate that no more than 1-2% of the contentonthe Web is pornographic or sexually explicit. However, the absolute number of Websites offering free sexually explicit material is extremely large, approximately 100,000sites. D. American Public Libraries The more than 9,000 public libraries in the United States are typically funded (at leastinlarge part) by state or local governments. They are frequently overseen by a board of directors that is either elected or is appointed by an elected official or a body of elected officials. We heard testimony from librarians and library board members working in eightpublic library systems in different communities across the country, some of whom arealsoplaintiffs in this case. They hailed from the following library systems: Fort Vancouver, Washington; Fulton County, Indiana; Greenville, South Carolina; a regional consortium of libraries centered in Madison, Wisconsin; Multnomah County, Oregon; Norfolk,Virginia; Tacoma, Washington; and Westerville, Ohio. The parties also took depositions from several other librarians and library board members who did not testify duringthetrial, and submitted a number of other documents regarding individual libraries'policies. 1. The M ission of Public Libraries, and Their Reference and Collection Development Practices 35   American public libraries operate in a wide variety of communities, and it is not surprisingthat they do not all view their mission identically. Nor are their practices uniform. Nevertheless, they generally share a common mission  to provide patrons with awiderange of information and ideas. Public libraries across the country have endorsed the American Library Association's (""ALA"") ""Library Bill of Rights"" and/or ""Freedom to Read Statement,"" includingevery library testifying on behalf of the defendants in this case. The ""Library Billof Rights,"" first adopted by theALA in 1948, provides, among other things, that ""[b]ooksand other library resources should be provided for the interest, information,and enlightenment of all people of the community the library serves."" It also states that libraries""should provide materials and information presenting all points of view on currentand historical issues"" and that library materials ""should not be proscribed or removedbecause of partisan or doctrinal disapproval."" TheALA's ""Freedom to Read"" statement, adopted in 1953 and most recently updatedin July 2000, states, amongother things, that ""[i]t is in the public interest for publishersand librarians to make available the widest diversity of views and expressions, includingthose that are unorthodox or unpopular with the majority."" It also states that ""[i]tistheresponsibility of . . . librarians . . . to contest encroachments upon th[e] freedom [to read] by individuals or groups seeking to impose their own standards or tastes uponthecommunity at large."" 36   Public libraries provide information not only for educational purposes, but also for recreational, professional, and other purposes. For example, Ginnie Cooper, Director of theMultnomah County Library, testified that some of the library's most popular items includevideo tapes of the British Broadcasting Corporation's ""Fawlty Towers"" series, andalsoprint and ""books on tape"" versions of science fiction, romance, and mystery novels. Many public libraries include sexually explicit materials in their print collection, suchas The Joy of Sex and The Joy of Gay Sex. Very few public libraries, however, collectmore graphic sexually explicit materials, such as XXX-rated videos, or Hustler magazine. 4  Themission of public librarians is to provide their patrons with a wide array of information, and they surely do so. Reference librarians across America answer more than7million questions weekly. If a patron has a specialized need for information not availablein the public library, the professional librarian will use a reference interview to findoutwhat information is needed to help the user, including the purpose for whichan item willbe used. Reference librarians are trained to assist patrons without judging the patron'spurpose in seeking information, or the content of the information that the patron isseeking.  TheOCLC database, a cooperative cataloging service established to facilitate interlibrary loan requests, includes 40 million catalog records from approximately 48,000 librariesof all types worldwide. Slightly more than 400 of the libraries in the OCLC databaseare listed as carrying Playboy in their collections, while only eight subscribe to Hustler. 37  4   Many public libraries routinely provide patrons with access to materials not in their collections through the use of bibliographic access tools and interlibrary loan programs. Publiclibraries typically will assist patrons in obtaining access to all materials except thosethatare illegal, even if they do not collect those materials in their physical collection. In order to provide this access, a librarian may attempt to find material not includedin the library's own collection in other libraries in the system, through interlibrary loan, or through a referral, perhaps to a government agency or a commercial bookstore. Interlibrary loan is expensive, however, and is therefore used infrequently. Public librarians also apply professional standards to their collection development practices. Public libraries generally make material selection decisions and frame policies governingcollection development at the local level. Collection development is a key subjectinthe curricula of Masters of Library Science programs and is defined by certain practices. In general, professional standards guide public librarians to build, developand createcollections that have certain characteristics, such as balance in its coverage and requisiteand appropriate quality. To this end, the goal of library collections is not universalcoverage, but rather to find those materials that would be of the greatest direct benefitorinterest to the community. In making selection decisions, librarians consider criteriaincluding the content of thematerial, its accuracy, the title's niche in relationto therestof the collection, the authority of the author, the publisher, the work's presentation, and how it compares with other material available in the same genre or on  38   thesamesubject. Inpursuing the goal of achieving a balanced collection that serves the needs and interestsof their patrons, librarians generally have a fair amount of autonomy, but may alsobeguided by a library's collection development policy. These collection development policies are often drawn up in conjunction with the libraries' governing boardsand with representatives from the community, and may be the result of public hearings,discussions and other input. Although many librarians use selection aids, such as review journals and bibliographies, as a guide to the quality of potential acquisitions, they do not generally delegatetheir selection decisions toparties outside of the public library or its governing body. One limited exception is the use of third-party vendors or approval plans to acquire printandvideo resources. In such arrangements, third-party vendors provide materials basedonthe library's description of its collection development criteria. The vendor sends materialsto the library, and the library retains the materials that meet its collection development needs and returns the materials that do not. Even in this arrangement, however,the librarians still retain ultimate control over their collection development and reviewallof the materials that enter their library's collection. 2. The Internet in Public Libraries Thevast majority of public libraries offer Internet access to their patrons. According to a recent report by the U.S. National Commission on Libraries and  39   Information Science, approximately 95% of all public libraries provide public accessto theInternet. John C. Bertot & Charles R. McClure, Public Libraries and the Internet 2000:Summary Findings and DataTables, Report to National Commission on Libraries andInformation Science, at 3. The Internet vastly expands the amount of information availableto patrons of public libraries. The widespread availability of Internet access in publiclibraries is due, in part, to the availability of public funding, including state and localfunding and the federal funding programs regulated by CIPA. Many libraries face a large amount of patron demand for their Internet services. Atsomelibraries, patron demand for Internet access during a given day exceeds the supply of computer terminals with access to the Internet. These libraries use sign-in and timelimitprocedures and/or establish rules regarding the allowable uses of the terminals, inaneffort to ration their computer resources. For example, some of the libraries whose librarianstestified at trial prohibit the use of email and chat functions on their public Internetterminals. Public libraries play an important role in providing Internet access to citizens who wouldnototherwise possess it. Of the 143 million Americans using the Internet, approximately 10%, or 14.3 million people, access the Internet at a public library. Internetaccess at public libraries is more often used by those with lower incomes than thosewithhigher incomes. About 20.3% of Internet users with household family income of lessthan $15,000 per year use public libraries for Internet access. Approximately 70%  40   of librariesserving communities with poverty levels in excess of 40% receive E-rate discounts. a. Internet Use Policies in Public Libraries Approximately 95% of libraries with public Internet access have some form of ""acceptable use"" policy or ""Internet use"" policy governing patrons' use of the Internet. Thesepolicies set forth the conditions under which patrons are permitted to access and usethelibrary's Internet resources. These policies vary widely. Some of the less restrictivepolicies, like those held by Multnomah County Library and Fort Vancouver RegionalLibrary, do not prohibit adult patrons from viewing sexually explicit materials ontheWeb, as long as they do so at terminals with privacy screens or recessed monitors, whicharedesigned to prevent other patrons from seeing the material that they are viewing,and as long as it does not violate state or federal law to do so. Other libraries prohibittheir patrons from viewing all ""sexually explicit"" or ""sexually graphic"" materials. Some libraries prohibit the viewing of materials that are not necessarily sexual, suchasWeb pages that are ""harmful to minors,"" ""offensive to the public,"" ""objectionable,"" ""racially offensive,"" or simply ""inappropriate."" Other libraries restrict accesstoWeb sites that the library just does not want to provide, even though the sites are notnecessarily offensive. For example, the Fulton County Public Library restricts access totheWebsites of dating services. Similarly, the Tacoma Public Library's policy does notallowpatrons to use the library's Internet terminals for personal email, for onlinechat,  41   orforplaying games. Insome cases, libraries instituted Internet use policies after having experienced specificproblems, whereas in other cases, libraries developed detailed Internet use policiesand regulatory measures (such as using filtering software) before ever offering publicInternet access. Essentially four interests motivate libraries to institute Internet use policiesand to apply the methods described above to regulate their patrons' use of the Internet. First, libraries have sought to protect patrons (especially children) and staff membersfrom accidentally viewing sexually explicit images, or other Web pages containing content deemed harmful, that other patrons are viewing on the Internet. For example,some librarians who testified described situations in which patrons left sexually explicitimages minimized on an Internet terminal so that the next patron would see them whenthey began using it, or in which patrons printed sexually explicit images from a Websiteand left them at a public printer. Second, libraries have attempted to protect patrons from unwittingly or accidentally accessing Web pages that they do not wish to see while they are using the Internet. For example, the Memphis-Shelby County (Tennessee) Public Library's Internet usepolicy states that the library ""employs filtering technology to reduce the possibility thatcustomers may encounter objectionable content in the form of depictions of full nudity and sexual acts.""  42   Third, libraries have sought to keep patrons (again, especially children) from intentionally accessing sexually explicit materials or other materials that the library deems inappropriate. For example, a study of the Tacoma Public Library's Internet use logs for theyear2000 showed that users between the ages of 11 and 15 accounted for 41% of the filterblocks that occurred on library computers. The study, which we credit, concluded thatchildren and young teens were actively seeking to access sexually explicit images in thelibrary. The Greenville Library's Board of Directors was particularly concerned that patronswere accessing obscene materials in the public library in violation of South Carolina'sobscenity statute. Finally, some libraries have regulated patrons' Internet use to attempt to control patrons'inappropriate (or illegal) behavior that is thought to stem from viewing Web pagesthatcontain sexually explicitmaterials or content that is otherwise deemed unacceptable. We recognize the concerns that led several of the public libraries whose librarians andboardmembers testified in thiscase to start using Internet filtering software. The testimony of the Chairman of the Board of the Greenville Public Library is illustrative. In December1999, there was considerable local press coverage in Greenville concerning adultpatrons who routinely used the library to surf the Web for pornography. In response topublicoutcry stemming from the newspaper report, the Board of Trustees held a specialboard meeting to obtain information and to communicate with the public  43   concerning the library's provision of Internet access. At this meeting, the Board learned forthefirst time of complaints about children being exposed to pornography that was displayedon the library's Internet terminals. Inlate January to early February of 2000, the library installed privacy screens and recessedterminals in an effort to restrict the display of sexually explicit Web sites at the library. InFebruary, 2000, the Board informed the library staff that they were expected to befamiliar with the South Carolinaobscenity statute and to enforce the policy prohibition onaccessto obscene materials, child pornography, or other materials prohibited under applicablelocal, state, and federal laws. Staff were told that they were to enforce the policy by means of a ""tap on the shoulder."" Prior to adopting its current Internet Use Policy,theBoard adopted an ""Addendum to Current Internet Use Policy."" Under the policy,the Board temporarily instituted a two-hour time limit per day for Internet use; reducedsubstantially the number of computers with Internet access in the library; reconfigured the location of the computers so that librarians had visual contact with all Internet-accessible terminals; and removed the privacy screens from terminals with Internetaccess. Even after the Board implemented the privacy screens and later the ""tap-on-theshoulder""policy combined with placing terminals in view of librarians, the library experienced a high turnover rate among reference librarians who worked in view of Internetterminals. Finding that the policies that it had tried did not prevent the viewing  44   of sexually explicit materials in the library, the Board at one point considered discontinuing Internet access in thelibrary. The Board finally concluded that the methods thatithadused to regulate Internet use were not sufficient to stem the behavioral problemsthat it thought were linked to the availability of pornographic materials in the library. As a result, it implemented a mandatory filtering policy. Wenote, however, that none of the libraries proffered by the defendants presented any systematic records or quantitative comparison of the amount of criminal or otherwise inappropriate behavior that occurred in their libraries before they began using Internet filteringsoftware compared to the amount that happened after they installed the software. Theplaintiffs' witnesses also testified that because public libraries are public places, incidentsinvolving inappropriate behavior in libraries (sexual and otherwise) existed long beforelibraries provided access to the Internet. b. M ethods for Regulating Internet Use Themethods that public libraries use to regulate Internet use vary greatly. They canbeorganized into four categories: (1) channeling patrons' Internet use; (2) separating patronssothat they will not see what other patrons are viewing; (3) placing Internet terminalsin public view and having librarians observe patrons to make sure that they are complyingwith the library's Internet use policy; and (4) using Internet filtering software. Thefirst category  channeling patrons' Internet use  frequently includes offering trainingtopatrons on how to use the Internet, including how to access the information  45   thatthey want and to avoid the materials that they do not want. Another technique that somepublic libraries use to direct their patrons to pages that the libraries have determined tobeaccurate and valuable is to establish links to ""recommended Web sites"" from the publiclibrary's home page (i.e., the page that appears when patrons begin a session at one of thelibrary's public Internet terminals). Librarians select these recommended Web sites by usingcriteria similar to those employed in traditional collection development. However,unless the library determines otherwise, selection of these specific sites does notpreclude patrons from attempting to access other Internet Web sites. Libraries may extend the ""recommended Web sites"" method further by limiting patrons'access to only those Web sites that are reviewed and selected by the library's staff. Forexample, in 1996, the Westerville, Ohio Library offered Internet access to childrenthrough a service called the ""Library Channel."" This service was intended to be ameansby which the library could organize the Internet in some fashion for presentation topatrons. Through the Library Channel, the computers in the children's section of the library were restricted to 2,000 to 3,000 sites selected by librarians. After three years, Westerville stopped using the Library Channel system because it overly constrained the children'sability to access materials on the Internet, and because the library experienced severaltechnical problems with thesystem. Public libraries also use several different techniques to separate patrons during Internetsessions so that they will not see what other patrons are viewing. The simplest  46   way toachieve this result is to position the library's public Internet terminals so that they arelocated away from traffic patterns in the library (and from other terminals), for example,by placing them so that they face a wall. This method is obviously constrained by libraries' space limitations and physical layout. Some libraries have also installed privacy screens on their public Internet terminals. These screens make a monitor appear blankunless the viewer is looking at it head-on.5 Although the Multnomah and Fort VancouverLibraries submitted records showing that they have received few complaints regardingpatrons' unwilling exposure to materials on the Internet, privacy screens do not alwaysprevent library patrons or employees from inadvertently seeing the materials that anotherpatron is viewing when passing directly behind a terminal. They also have the drawbackof making it difficult for patrons to work together at a single terminal, or for librariansto assist patrons at terminals, because it is difficult for two people to stand side by sideand view a screen at the same time. Some library patrons also find privacy screenstobe a hindrance and have attempted to remove them in order to improve the brightnessof the screen or to make the view better. Another method that libraries use to prevent patrons from seeing what other  FortVancouver Regional Library, for example, combines the methods of strategically placing terminals in low traffic areas and using privacy screens. A section headed""Confidentiality and Privacy"" on the library's home page states: ""in order to protecttheprivacy of the user and the interests of other library patrons, the library will attempttominimize unintentional viewing of the Internet. This will be done by use of privacy screens, and by judicious placement of the terminals and other appropriate means."" 47  5   patronsare viewing on their terminals is the installation of ""recessed monitors."" Recessedmonitors are computer screens that sit below the level of a desk top and are viewedfrom above. Although recessed monitors, especially when combined with privacy screens,eliminate almost all of the possibility of a patron accidentally viewing the contentson another patron's screen, they suffer from the same drawbacks as privacy screens,that is, they make it difficult for patrons to work together or with a librarian at a singleterminal. Some librarians also testified that recessed monitors are costly, but did notindicate how expensive they are compared to privacy screens or filtering software. A relatedtechnique that some public libraries use is to create a separate children's Internet viewingarea, where no adults except those accompanying children in their care may use theInternet terminals. This serves the objective of keeping children from inadvertently viewingmaterials appropriate only for adults that adults may be viewing on nearby terminals. Athird set of techniques that public libraries have used to enforce their Internet usepolicies takes the opposite tackfrom the privacy screens/recessed monitors approach by placing all of the library's public Internet terminals in prominent and visible locations, suchasnear the library's reference desk. This approach allows librarians to enforce their library'sInternet use policy by observing what patrons are viewing and employing the tap-on-the-shoulder policy. Under this approach, when patrons are viewing materials that areinconsistent with the library's policies, a library staff member approaches them and  48   asksthem to view something else, or may ask them to end their Internet session. A patron whodoesnot comply with these requests, or who repeatedly views materials not permittedunder the library's Internet use policy, may have his or her Internet or library privilegessuspended or revoked. But many librarians are uncomfortable with approaching patrons who are viewing sexually explicit images, finding confrontation unpleasant. Hence some libraries are reluctant to apply the tap-on-the-shoulder policy. The fourth category of methods that public libraries employ to enforce their Internetuse policies, and the one that gives rise to this case, is the use of Internet filtering software. According to the June 2000 Survey of Internet Access Management in Public Libraries,approximately 7% of libraries with public Internet access had mandated the use of blocking programs by adult patrons. Some public libraries provide patrons with the optionof using a blocking program, allowing patrons to decide whether to engage the program when they or their children access the Internet. Other public libraries require theirchildpatrons to use filtering software, but not their adult patrons. Filtering software vendors sell their products on a subscription basis. The cost of a subscription varies with the number of computers on which the filtering software will be used. In2001, the cost of the Cyber Patrol filtering software was $1,950 for 100 terminal licenses. The Greenville County Library System pays $2,500 per year for the N2H2 filteringsoftware, and a subscription to the Websense filter costs Westerville Public Library approximately $1,200 per year.  49   Noevidence was presented on the cost of privacy screens, recessed monitors, and thetap-on-the-shoulder policy, relative to the costs of filtering software. Nor did any of thelibraries proffered by the government present any quantitative evidence on the relative effectiveness of use of privacy screens to prevent patrons from being unwillingly exposed tosexually explicit material, and the use of filters, discussed below. No evidence was presented,for example, comparing the number of patron complaints in those libraries that havetriedboth methods. Thelibrarians who testified at trial whose libraries use Internet filtering software allprovide methods by which their patrons may ask the library to unblock specific Web sitesorpages. Of these, only the Tacoma Public Library allows patrons to request that a URLbeunblocked without providing any identifying information; Tacoma allows patrons torequesta URL by sending an email from the Internet terminal that the patron is using thatdoesnot contain a return emailaddress for the user. David Biek, the head librarian at theTacoma Library's main branch,testified at trial that the library keeps records that wouldenable it to know which patrons made unblocking requests, but does not use that information to connect users with their requests. Biek also testified that he periodically scansthelibrary's Internet use logs to search for: (1) URLs that were erroneously blocked,so that he may unblock them; or (2) URLs that should have been blocked, but werenot,in order to add them to a blocked category list. In the course of scanning the uselogs, Biek has also found what looked like attempts to access child pornography. In  50   twocases,he communicated his findings to law enforcement and turned over the logs in responseto a subpoena. Atall events, it takes time for librarians to make decisions about whether to honor patrons'requests to unblock Web pages. In the libraries proffered by the defendants, unblocking decisions sometimes take between 24 hours and a week. Moreover, none of theselibraries allows unrestricted access to the Internet pending a determination of the validity of a Web site blocked by the blocking programs. A few of the defendants' profferedlibraries represented that individual librarians would have the discretion to allowapatron to have full Internet access on a staff computer upon request, but none claimedthat allowing such access was mandatory, and patron access is supervised in every instance. None of these libraries makes differential unblocking decisions based on thepatrons' age. Unblocking decisions are usually made identically for adults and minors. Unblocking decisions even for adults are usually based on suitability of the Web siteforminors. Itisapparent that many patrons are reluctant or unwilling to ask librarians to unblockWeb pages or sites that contain only materials that might be deemed personal or embarrassing, even if they are not sexually explicit or pornographic. We credit the testimony of Emmalyn Rood, discussed above, that she would have been unwilling as a youngteento ask a librarian to disable filtering software so that she could view materials concerning gay and lesbian issues. We also credit the testimony of Mark Brown, who  51   statedthathe would have been too embarrassed to ask a librarian to disable filtering softwareif it had impeded his ability to research treatments and cosmetic surgery options forhismother when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. The pattern of patron requests to unblock specific URLs in the various libraries involvedin this case also confirms our finding that patrons are largely unwilling to make unblocking requests unless they arepermitted to do so anonymously. For example, the FultonCounty Library receives only about 6 unblocking requests each year, the Greenville Public Library has received only 28 unblocking requests since August 21, 2000,andthe Westerville, Ohio Library has received fewer than 10 unblocking requests since1999. In light of the fact thata substantial amount of overblocking occurs in these very libraries, see infra Subsection II.E.4, we find that the lack of unblocking requests in theselibraries does not reflect the effectiveness of the filters, but rather reflects patrons' reluctanceto ask librarians to unblock sites. E. Internet Filtering Technology 1. W hat Is Filtering Softw are, W ho M akes It, and W hat Does It Do? Commercially available products that can be configured to block or filter access to certainmaterial on the Internet are among the ""technology protection measures"" that may beusedtoattempt to comply with CIPA. There are numerous filtering software products availablecommercially. Three network-based filtering products  SurfControl's Cyber Patrol,N2H2's Bess/i2100, and Secure Computing's SmartFilter  currently have the  52   lion'sshare of the public library market. The parties in this case deposed representatives from these three companies. Websense, another network-based blocking product, is also currently used in the public library market, and was discussed at trial. Filtering software may be installed either on an individual computer or on a computernetwork. Network-based filtering software products are designed for use on a networkof computers and funnel requests for Internet content through a centralized networkdevice. Of the various commercially available blocking products, networkbasedproducts are the ones generally marketed to institutions, such as public libraries, thatprovide Internet access through multiple terminals. Filtering programs function in a fairly simple way. When an Internet user requests accesstoacertain Web site or page, either by entering a domain name or IP address into a Webbrowser, or by clicking on a link, the filtering software checks that domain name or IPaddressagainst a previously compiled ""control list"" that may contain up to hundreds of thousandsof URLs. The three companies deposed in this case have control lists containing between 200,000 and 600,000 URLs. These lists determine which URLs will beblocked. Filtering software companies divide their control lists into multiple categoriesfor whichthey have created unique definitions. SurfControl uses 40 such categories, N2H2 uses35categories (and seven ""exception"" categories), Websense uses 30 categories,and SecureComputing uses 30 categories. Filtering software customers choose which  53   categoriesof URLs they wish to enable. A user ""enables"" a category in a filtering program by configuring the program to block all of the Web pages listed in that category. The following is a list of thecategories offered by each of these four filtering programs. SurfControl's Cyber Patrol offers the following categories: Adult/Sexually Explicit;Advertisements; Arts & Entertainment; Chat; Computing & Internet; Criminal Skills;Drugs, Alcohol & Tobacco; Education; Finance & Investment; Food & Drink; Gambling;Games; Glamour & Intimate Apparel; Government & Politics; Hacking; Hate Speech;Health & Medicine; Hobbies & Recreation; Hosting Sites; Job Search & Career Development; Kids' Sites; Lifestyle & Culture; Motor Vehicles; News; Personals & Dating;Photo Searches; Real Estate; Reference; Religion; Remote Proxies; Sex Education;Search Engines; Shopping; Sports; Streaming Media; Travel; Usenet News; Violence;Weapons; and Web-based Email. N2H2 offers the following categories: Adults Only; Alcohol; Auction; Chat; Drugs;Electronic Commerce; Employment Search; Free Mail; Free Pages; Gambling; Games;Hate/Discrimination; Illegal; Jokes; Lingerie; Message/Bulletin Boards; Murder/Suicide; News; Nudity; Personal Information; Personals; Pornography; Profanity; Recreation/Entertainment; School Cheating Information; Search Engines; Search Terms; Sex;Sports; Stocks; Swimsuits; Tasteless/Gross; Tobacco; Violence; and Weapons. The ""Nudity""category purports to block only ""non-pornographic"" images. The ""Sex"" category isintended to block only those depictions of sexual activity that are not intended  54   toarouse. The ""Tasteless/Gross"" category includes contents such as ""tasteless humor"" and""graphic medical or accident scene photos."" Additionally, N2H2 offers seven ""exceptioncategories."" These exception categories include Education, Filtered Search Engine,For Kids, History, Medical, Moderated, and Text/Spoken Only. When an exceptioncategory is enabled, access to any Web site or page via a URL associated with bothacategory and an exception, for example, both ""Sex"" and ""Education,"" will be allowed,even if the customer has enabled the product to otherwise block the category ""Sex."" Asof November 15, 2001, of those Web sites categorized by N2H2 as ""Sex,"" 3.6%werealso categorized as ""Education,"" 2.9% as ""Medical,"" and 1.6% as ""History."" Websense offers the following categories: Abortion Advocacy; Advocacy Groups; AdultMaterial; Business & Economy; Drugs; Education; Entertainment; Gambling; Games;Government; Health; Illegal/Questionable; Information Technology; Internet Communication; Job Search; Militancy/Extremist; News & Media; Productivity Management; Bandwidth Management; Racism/Hate; Religion; Shopping; Society & Lifestyle;Special Events; Sports; Tasteless; Travel; Vehicles; Violence; and Weapons. The""Adult"" category includes ""full or partial nudity of individuals,"" as well as sites offering""light adult humor and literature"" and ""[s]exually explicit language."" The ""Sexuality/Pornography"" category includes, inter alia, ""hard-core adult humor and literature""and ""[s]exually explicit language."" The ""Tasteless"" category includes ""hardto-stomach sites, including offensive, worthless or useless sites, grotesque or lurid  55   depictionsof bodily harm."" The ""Hacking"" category blocks ""sites providing information onorpromoting illegal or questionable access to or use of communications equipment and/orsoftware."" SmartFilter offers the following categories: Anonymizers/Translators; Art & Culture;Chat; Criminal Skills; Cults/Occult; Dating; Drugs; Entertainment; Extreme/Obscene/Violence; Gambling; Games; General News; Hate Speech; Humor; Investing;Job Search; Lifestyle; Mature; MP3 Sites; Nudity; On-line Sales; Personal Pages;Politics, Opinion & Religion; Portal Sites; Self-Help/Health; Sex; Sports; Travel; UsenetNews; and Webmail. Most importantly, no category definition used by filtering software companies is identicalto CIPA's definitions of visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, orharmfulto minors. And category definitions and categorization decisions are made withoutreference to local community standards. Moreover, there is no judicial involvement in the creation of filtering software companies' category definitions andno judicialdetermination is made before these companies categorize a Web page or site. Each filtering software company associates each URL in its control list with a ""tag""orother identifier that indicates the company's evaluation of whether the content or featuresof the Web site or page accessed via that URL meets one or more of its category definitions. If a user attempts to access a Web site or page that is blocked by the filter, theuserisimmediately presented with a screen that indicates that a block has occurred as  56   aresultof the operation of the filtering software. These ""denial screens"" appear only at thepointthat a user attempts to access a site or page in an enabled category. Allfour of the filtering programs on which evidence was presented allow users to customizethe category lists that exist on their own PCs or servers by adding or removing specificURLs. For example, if a public librarian charged with administering a library's Internetterminals comes across a Web site that he or she finds objectionable that is not blockedby the filtering program that his or her library is using, then the librarian may add thatURLto a category list that exists only on the library's network, and it would thereafterbe blocked under that category. Similarly, a customer may remove individual URLsfrom category lists. Importantly, however, no one but the filtering companies has accesstothe complete list of URLsin any category. The actual URLs or IP addresses of theWebsites or pages contained in filtering software vendors' category lists are considered to be proprietary information, and are unavailable for review by customers or thegeneral public, including the proprietors of Web sites that are blocked by filtering software.6 Filtering software companies do not generally notify the proprietors of Web sites whenthey block their sites. The only way to discover which URLs are blocked and whicharenot blocked by any particular filtering company is by testing individual URLs  Indeed, we granted leave for N2H2's counsel to intervene in order to object to testimony that would potentially reveal N2H2's trade secrets, which he did on several occasions. 57  6   withfiltering software, or by entering URLs one by one into the ""URL checker"" thatmost filteringsoftware companies provide on their Web sites. Filtering software companies willentertain requests for recategorization from proprietors of Web sites that discover theirsitesare blocked. Because new pages are constantly being added to the Web, filteringcompanies provide their customers with periodic updates of category lists. Once aparticular Web page or site is categorized, however, filtering companies generally do notre-review the contents of that page or site unless they receive a request to do so, even thoughthecontent on individual Web pages and sites changes frequently. 2. The Methods that Filtering Companies Use to Compile Category Lists While the way in which filtering programs operate is conceptually straightforward by comparing a requested URL to a previously compiled list of URLs and blocking accesstothe content at that URL if it appears on the list  accurately compiling and categorizing URLs to form the category lists is a more complex process that is impossible toconductwith any high degree of accuracy. The specific methods that filtering software companiesuse to compile and categorize control lists are, like the lists themselves, proprietary information. We will therefore set forth only general information on the varioustypes of methods that all filtering companies deposed in this case use, and the sourcesof error that are at once inherent in those methods and unavoidable given the currentarchitecture of the Internet and the current state of the art in automated classification systems. We base our understanding of these methods largely on the  58   detailedtestimony and expert report of Dr. Geoffrey Nunberg, which we credit. The plaintiffsoffered, and the Court qualified, Nunberg as an expert witness on automated classification systems.7 When compiling and categorizing URLs for their category lists, filtering software companies go through two distinct phases. First, they must collect or ""harvest"" the relevantURLs from the vast number of sites that exist on the Web. Second, they must sortthrough the URLs they have collected to determine under which of the company's self-defined categories (if any), they should be classified. These tasks necessarily result inatradeoff between overblocking (i.e., the blocking of content that does not meet the category definitions established by CIPA or by the filtering software companies), and underblocking (i.e., leaving off of acontrol list a URL that contains content that would meetthecategory definitions defined by CIPA or the filtering software companies). a. The ""H arvesting"" Phase Filtering software companies, given their limited resources, do not attempt to indexorclassify all of the billions of pages that exist on the Web. Instead, the set of pagesthatthey attempt to examine and classify is restricted to a small portion of the Web.  Geoffrey Nunberg (Ph.D., Linguistics, C.U.N.Y. 1977) is a researcher at the Center fortheStudy of Language and Information at Stanford University and a Consulting Full Professorof Linguistics at Stanford University. Until 2001, he was also a principal scientistat the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. His research centers on automated classification systems, with a focuson classifying documents on the Web with respect to theirlinguistic properties. He has published his research in numerous professional journals,including peer-reviewed journals. 59  7   Thecompanies use a variety of automated and manual methods to identify a universe of Websitesand pages to ""harvest"" for classification. These methods include: entering certainkey words into search engines; following links from a variety of online directories (e.g.,generalized directories like Yahoo or various specialized directories, such as those thatprovide links to sexually explicit content); reviewing lists of newly-registered domain names;buying or licensing lists of URLs from third parties; ""mining"" access logs maintained by their customers; and reviewing other submissions from customers andthe public. The goal of each of these methods is to identify as many URLs as possible that arelikely to contain content that falls within the filtering companies' category definitions. The first method, entering certain keywords into commercial search engines, suffersfrom several limitations. First, the Web pages that may be ""harvested"" through thismethod are limited to those pages that search engines have already identified. However,as noted above, a substantial portion of the Web is not even theoretically indexable(because it is not linked to by any previously known page), and only approximately 50% of the pages that are theoretically indexable have actually been indexedby search engines. We aresatisfied that the remainder of the indexable Web, and thevast""Deep Web,"" which cannot currently be indexed, includes materials that meet CIPA'scategories of visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, and harmful tominors. These portions of the Web cannot presently be harvested through the methods thatfiltering software companies use (except through reporting by customers or by  60   observingusers' log files), becausethey are not linked to other known pages. A usercan, however,gain access to a Web site in the unindexed Web or the Deep Web if the Web site'sproprietor or some other thirdparty informs the user of the site's URL. Some Web sites,forexample, send out mass email advertisements containing the site's URL, the spammingprocess we have described above. Second, the search engines that software companies use for harvesting are able to searchtextonly, not images. This is of critical importance, because CIPA, by its own terms,covers only ""visual depictions."" 20 U.S.C.  9134(f)(1)(A)(i); 47 U.S.C.  254(h)(5)(B)(i). Image recognition technology is immature, ineffective, and unlikely to improvesubstantially in the near future. None of the filtering software companies deposedinthis case employs imagerecognition technology when harvesting or categorizing URLs. Due to the reliance on automated text analysis and the absence of imagerecognition technology, a Web page with sexually explicit images and no text cannotbeharvested using a search engine. This problem is complicated by the fact that Websitepublishers may use image files rather than text to represent words, i.e., they may useafilethat computers understand to be a picture, like a photograph of a printed word, ratherthan regular text, making automated review of their textual content impossible. For example,if the Playboy Web site displays its name using a logo rather than regular text, a searchengine would not see or recognize the Playboy name in that logo. Inaddition to collecting URLs through search engines and Web directories  61   (particularly those specializing in sexually explicit sites or other categories relevant to one of thefiltering companies' category definitions), and by mining user logs and collecting URLssubmitted by users, the filtering companies expand their list of harvested URLs by using""spidering"" software that can""crawl"" the lists of pages produced by the previous fourmethods, following their links downward to bring back the pages to which they link (andthepages to which those pages link, and so on, but usually down only a few levels). Thisspidering software uses the same type of technology that commercial Web search enginesuse. While useful in expanding the number of relevant URLs, the ability to retrieve additionalpages through this approach is limited by the architectural feature of the Web thatpage-to-page links tend to converge rather than diverge. That means that the more pagesfrom which one spiders downward through links, the smaller the proportion of new sitesonewill uncover; if spidering the links of 1000 sites retrieved through a search engineorWeb directory turns up 500 additional distinct adult sites, spidering an additional1000 sites may turn up, for example, only 250 additional distinct sites, and the proportionof new sites uncovered will continue to diminish as more pages are spidered. These limitations on the technology used to harvest a set of URLs for review will necessarily lead to substantial underblocking of material with respect to both the category definitionsemployed by filtering software companies and CIPA's definitions of visual depictionsthat are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors.  62   b. The ""W innow ing"" or Categorization Phase Once the URLs have been harvested, some filtering software companies use automatedkey word analysis tools to evaluate the content and/or features of Web sites or pagesaccessed via a particular URL and to tentatively prioritize or categorize them. This processmay be characterized as ""winnowing"" the harvested URLs. Automated systems currently used by filtering software vendors to prioritize, and to categorize or tentatively categorizethe content and/or features of a Web site or page accessed via a particular URL operateby means of (1) simple key word searching, and (2) the use of statistical algorithmsthat rely on the frequency and structure of various linguistic features in a Web page'stext. The automated systems used to categorize pages do not include image recognition technology. All of the filtering companies deposed in the case also employ humanreview of some or all collected Web pages at some point during the process of categorizing Web pages. As with the harvesting process, each technique employed in the winnowing process is subject to limitations that can result in both overblocking and underblocking. First, simple key-word-based filters are subject to the obvious limitation that no stringof words can identify all sites that contain sexually explicit content, and most stringsof words are likely to appear in Web sites that are not properly classified as containingsexually explicit content. As noted above, filtering software companies also usemoresophisticated automated classification systems for the statistical classification of  63   texts. These systems assign weights to words or other textual features and use algorithms todetermine whether a text belongs to a certain category. These algorithms sometimes makereference to the position of a word within a text or its relative proximity to other words. The weights are usually determined by machine learning methods (often describedas ""artificial intelligence""). In this procedure, which resembles an automated form of trial and error, a system is given a ""training set"" consisting of documents preclassified into two or more groups, along with a set of features that might be potentially useful in classifying the sets. The system then ""learns"" rules that assign weightstothose features accordingto how well they work in classification, and assigns eachnewdocument to a category with a certain probability. Notwithstanding their ""artificial intelligence"" description, automated text classification systems are unable to grasp many distinctions between types of contentthat wouldbeobvious to a human. And of critical importance, no presently conceivable technology can make the judgments necessary to determine whether a visual depiction fits thelegaldefinitions of obscenity, child pornography, or harmful to minors. Finally, all the filtering software companies deposed in this case use some form of humanreview in their process of winnowing and categorizing Web pages, although one company admitted to categorizing some Web pages without any human review. SmartFilter states that ""the final categorization of every Web site is done by a human reviewer."" Another filtering company asserts that of the 10,000 to 30,000 Web pages that  64   enterthe""work queue"" to be categorized each day, two to three percent of those are automatically categorized by their PornByRef system (which only applies to materials classifiedin the pornography category), and the remainder are categorized by human review. SurfControl also states that no URL is ever added to its database without human review. Human review of Web pages has the advantage of allowing more nuanced, if not moreaccurate, interpretations than automated classification systems are capable of making,but suffers from its own sources of error. The filtering software companies involvedhere have limited staff, of between eight and a few dozen people, available for handreviewing Web pages. The reviewers that are employed by these companies base theircategorization decisions on both the text and the visual depictions that appear on the sitesorpages they are assigned to review. Human reviewers generally focus on English languageWeb sites, and are generally not required to be multi-lingual. Given the speed at which human reviewers must work to keep up with even a fractionof the approximately 1.5 million pages added to the publicly indexable Web each day,human error is inevitable. Errors are likely to result from boredom or lack of attentiveness, overzealousness, or adesire to ""err on the side of caution"" by screening out materialthat might be offensive to some customers, even if it does not fit within any of thecompany's category definitions. None of the filtering companies trains its reviewers inthelegal definitions concerning what is obscene, child pornography, or harmful to  65   minors,and none instructs reviewers to take community standards into account when makingcategorization decisions. Perhaps because of limitations on the number of human reviewers and because of thelargenumber of new pages that are added to the Web every day, filtering companies alsowidely engage in the practice of categorizing entire Web sites at the ""root URL,"" ratherthan engaging in a more fine-grained analysis of the individual pages within a Web site. Forexample, the filtering software companies deposed in this case all categorize the entirePlayboy Web site as Adult, Sexually Explicit, or Pornography. They do not differentiate between pages within the site containing sexually explicit images or text, and forexample, pages containing no sexually explicit content, such as the text of interviews of celebrities or politicians. If the ""root"" or ""top-level"" URL of a Web site is given a category tag, then access to all content on that Web site will be blocked if the assigned category is enabled by a customer. Insome cases, whole Web sites are blocked because the filtering companies focus only onthe content of the home page that is accessed by entering the root URL. Entire Websitescontaining multiple Web pages are commonly categorized without human reviewof each individual page on that site. Web sites that may contain multiple Web pagesandthat require authentication or payment for access are commonly categorized basedsolely on a human reviewer's evaluation of the pages that may be viewed prior to reachingthe authentication or payment page.  66   Because there may be hundreds or thousands of pages under a root URL, filtering companies make it their primary mission to categorize the root URL, and categorize subsidiary pages if the need arises or if there is time. This form of overblocking is called ""inheritance,"" because lower-level pages inherit the categorization of the root URL withoutregard to their specific content. In some cases, ""reverse inheritance"" also occurs, i.e.,parent sites inherit the classification of pages in a lower level of the site. This might happenwhen pages with sexual content appear in a Web site that is devoted primarily to non-sexual content. For example, N2H2's Bess filtering product classifies every page in theSalon.com Web site, which contains a wide range of news and cultural commentary, as""Sex,Profanity,"" based on the fact that the site includes a regular column that deals withsexual issues. Blocking by both domain name and IP address is another practice in which filteringcompanies engage that is afunction both of the architecture of the Web and of theexigencies of dealing with the rapidly expanding number of Web pages. The category listsmaintained by filtering software companies can include URLs in either their humanreadabledomain name address form, their numeric IP address form, or both. Through ""virtualhosting"" services, hundreds of thousands of Web sites with distinct domain namesmay share a single numeric IP address. To the extent that filtering companies blocktheIP addresses of virtual hosting services, they will necessarily block a substantial amountof content without reviewing it, and will likely overblock a substantial amount of  67   content. Another technique that filtering companies use in order to deal with a structural featureof the Internet is blocking the root level URLs of so-called ""loophole"" Web sites. TheseareWeb sites that provide access to a particular Web page, but display in the user's browseraURL that is different from the URL with which the particular page is usually associated. Because of this feature,they provide a ""loophole"" that can be used to get aroundfiltering software, i.e., they display a URL that is different from the one that appearson the filtering company's control list. ""Loophole"" Web sites include caches of Webpages that have been removedfrom their original location, ""anonymizer"" sites, and translationsites. Caches are archived copies that some search engines, such as Google, keep of the Webpages they index. The cachedcopy stored by Google will have a URL that is differentfrom the original URL. Because Web sites often change rapidly, caches are the only way to access pages that have been taken down, revised, or have changed their URLs forsomereason. For example, a magazine might place its current stories under a given URL,andreplace them monthly with new stories. If a user wanted to find an article publishedsix months ago, he or she would be unable to access it if not for Google's cachedversion. Some sites on the Web serve as a proxy or intermediary between a user and anotherWeb page. When using a proxy server, a user does not access the page from its  68   originalURL, but rather from the URL of the proxy server. One type of proxy service is an""anonymizer."" Users may access Web sites indirectly via an anonymizer when they do notwantthe Web site they are visiting to be able to determine the IP address from which they areaccessing the site, or to leave ""cookies"" on their browser.8 Some proxy servers canbeused to attempt to translate Web page content from one language to another. Ratherthan directly accessing the original Web page in its original language, users can insteadindirectly access the page via a proxy server offering translation features. Asnoted above, filtering companies often block loophole sites, such as caches, anonymizers, and translation sites. The practice of blocking loophole sites necessarily resultsina significant amount of overblocking, because the vast majority of the pages thatarecached, for example, do not contain content that would match a filtering company'scategory definitions. Filters that do not block these loophole sites, however, may enable users to access any URL on the Web via the loophole site, thus resulting in substantial underblocking. c. The Process for ""Re-Review ing"" W eb Pages After Their Initial Categorization Most filtering software companies do not engage in subsequent reviews of categorized sites or pages on a scheduled basis. Priority is placed on reviewing and  A""cookie"" is ""a small file or part of a file stored on a World Wide Web user's computer,created and subsequently read by a Web site server, and containing personal information (as a user identification code, customized preferences, or a record of pages visited)."" Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, available at http://www.mw.com/dictionary.htm. 69  8   categorizing new sites and pages, rather than on re-reviewing already categorized sites andpages. Typically, a filtering software vendor's previous categorization of a Website isnotre-reviewed for accuracy when new pages are added to the Web site. To the extent theWebsite was previously categorized as a whole, the new pages added to the site usually share the categorization assigned by the blocking product vendor. This necessarily results in both over- and underblocking, because, as noted above, the content of Webpages and Web sites changes relatively rapidly. Inaddition to the content onWeb sites or pages changing rapidly, Web sites themselves may disappear and be replaced by sites with entirely different content. If an IPaddressassociated with a particular Web site is blocked under a particular category and theWebsite goes out of existence, then the IP address likely would be reassigned to a differentWeb site, either by an Internet service provider or by a registration organization, suchastheAmerican Registry for Internet Numbers, see http://www.arin.net. In that case,thesite that received the reassigned IP address would likely be miscategorized. Becausefiltering companies do not engage in systematic re-review of their category lists, suchasitewould likely remain miscategorized unless someone submitted it to the filteringcompany for re-review, increasing the incidence of over- and underblocking. This failure to re-review Web pages primarily increases a filtering company'srate of overblocking. However, if a filtering company does not re-review Web pages after it determines that they do not fall intoany of its blocking categories, then that would result  70   inunderblocking (because, for example, a page might add sexually explicit content). 3. The Inherent Tradeoff Betw een O verblocking and Underblocking There is an inherent tradeoff between any filter's rate of overblocking (which information scientists also call ""precision"") and its rate of underblocking (which is also referredtoas ""recall""). The rate of overblocking or precision is measured by the proportionof the things a classification system assigns to a certain category that are appropriately classified. The plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Nunberg, provided the hypothetical exampleof a classification system that is asked to pick out pictures of dogs from a databaseconsisting of 1000 pictures of animals, of which 80 were actually dogs. If it returned100 hits, of which 80 were in fact pictures of dogs, and the remaining 20 were picturesof cats, horses, and deer, we would say that the system identified dog pictures withaprecision of 80%. This would be analogous to a filter that overblocked at a rate of 20%. The recall measure involves determining what proportion of the actual members of acategory the classification system has been able to identify. For example, if the hypothetical animal-picture database contained a total of 200 pictures of dogs, and the system identified 80 of them and failed to identify 120, it would have performed with a recallof 40%. This would be analogous to a filter that underblocked 60% of the material inacategory.  In automated classification systems, there is always a tradeoff between precision  71   and recall. In the animal-picture example, the recall could be improved by using a looser set of criteria to identify the dog pictures in the set, such as any animal with four legs, and all the dogs would be identified, but cats and other animals would also be included, with a resulting loss of precision. The same tradeoff exists between rates of overblocking and underblocking in filtering systems that use automated classification systems. For example, an automated system that classifies any Web page that contains the word ""sex"" as sexually explicit will underblock much less, but overblock much more, than a system that classifies any Web page containing the phrase ""free pictures of people having sex"" as sexually explicit. This tradeoff between overblocking and underblocking also applies not just to automated classification systems, but also to filters that use only human review. Given the approximately two billion pages that exist on the Web, the 1.5 million new pages that are added daily, and the rate at which content on existing pages changes, if a filtering company blocks only those Web pages that have been reviewed by humans, it will be impossible, as a practical matter, to avoid vast amounts of underblocking. Techniques used by human reviewers such as blocking at the IP address level, domain name level, or directory level reduce the rates of underblocking, but necessarily increase the rates of overblocking, as discussed above. To use a simple example, it would be easy to design a filter intended to block sexually explicit speech that completely avoids overblocking. Such a filter would have  72   only a single sexually explicit Web site on its control list, which could be re-reviewed daily to ensure that its content does not change. While there would be no overblocking problem with such a filter, such a filter would have a severe underblocking problem, as it would fail to block all the sexually explicit speech on the Web other than the one site on its control list. Similarly, it would also be easy to design a filter intended to block sexually explicit speech that completely avoids underblocking. Such a filter would operate by permitting users to view only a single Web site, e.g., the Sesame Street Web site. While there would be no underblocking problem with such a filter, it would have a severe overblocking problem, as it would block access to millions of non-sexually explicit sites on the Web other than the Sesame Street site. While it is thus quite simple to design a filter that does not overblock, and equally simple to design a filter that does not underblock, it is currently impossible, given the Internet's size, rate of growth, rate of change, and architecture, and given the state of the art of automated classification systems, to develop a filter that neither underblocks nor overblocks a substantial amount of speech. The more effective a filter is at blocking Web sites in a given category, the more the filter will necessarily overblock. Any filter that is reasonably effective in preventing users from accessing sexually explicit content on the Web will necessarily block substantial amounts of non-sexually explicit speech. 4. Attempts to Quantify Filtering Programs' Rates of Over- and Underblocking The government presented three studies, two from expert witnesses, and one from  73   alibrarianfact witness who conducted a study using Internet use logs from his own library,that attempt to quantify the over- and underblocking rates of five different filteringprograms. The plaintiffs presented one expert witness who attempted to quantify theratesof over- and underblocking for various programs. Each of these attempts to quantify rates of over- and underblocking suffers from various methodological flaws. The fundamental problem with calculating over- and underblocking rates is selectinga universe of Web sites or Web pages to serve as the set to be tested. The studiesthat the parties submitted in this case took two different approaches to this problem. Two of the studies, one prepared by the plaintiffs' expert witness Chris Hunter, agraduatestudent at the University of Pennsylvania, and the other prepared by the defendants' expert, Chris Lemmons of eTesting Laboratories, in Research Triangle Park, NorthCarolina, approached this problem by compiling two separate lists of Web sites, oneof URLs that they deemed should be blocked according to the filters' criteria, and anotherof URLs that they deemed should not be blocked according to the filters' criteria. They compiled these lists by choosing Web sites from the results of certain key word searches.9 The problem with this selection method is that it is neither random, nor does it Hunter drew three different ""samples"" for his test. The first consisted of ""50 randomly generated Web pages from the Webcrawler search engine."" The ""second sampleof 50 Web pages was drawn from searches for the terms `yahoo, warez, hotmail, sex,andMP3,' using the AltaVista.com search engine."" And the ""final sample of 100 Websiteswas drawn from the sitesof organizations who filed amicus briefs in support of theACLU's challenges to the Community [sic] Decency Act (CDA) and COPA [the Children's Online Protection Act], and from Internet portals, political Web sites, feminist Websites,hate speech sites, gambling sites, religious sites, gay pride/homosexual sites, 74 9   necessarily approximate the universe of Web pages that library patrons visit. The two other studies, one by David Biek, head librarian at the Tacoma Public Library'smain branch, and one by Cory Finnell of Certus Consulting Group, of Seattle, Washington, chose actual logs of Web pages visited by library patrons during specific timeperiods as the universe of Web pages to analyze. This method, while surely notas accurateas a truly random sample of the indexed Web would be (assuming it would be possibletotake such a sample), hasthe virtue of using the actual Web sites that library patronsvisited during a specific period. Because library patrons selected the universe of Websitesthat Biek and Finnell's studies analyzed, this removes the possibility of bias resultingfrom the study author's selection of the universe of sites to be reviewed. We findthatthe Lemmons and Hunter studies are of little probative value because of the methodology used to select the sample universe of Web sites to be tested. We will alcohol,tobacco, and drug sites, pornography sites, new sites, violent game sites, safe sex sites,andpro and anti-abortion sites listed on the popular Web directory, Yahoo.com."" Lemmons testified that he compiled the list of sexually explicit sites that should havebeenblocked by entering the terms ""free adult sex, anal sex, oral sex, fisting lesbians,gay sex, interracial sex, big tits, blow job, shaved pussy, and bondage"" into the Googlesearch engine and then ""surfing"" through links from pages generated by the list of sitesthatthe search engine returned. Using this method, he compiled a list of 197 sites thathedetermined should be blocked according to the filtering programs' category definitions. Lemmons also attempted to compile a list of ""sensitive"" Web sites that, althoughthey should not have been blocked according to the filtering programs' category definitions, might have been mistakenly blocked. In order to do this, he used the same methodof entering terms into the Google search engine and surfing through the results. Heusedthe following terms to compile this list: ""breast feeding, bondages, fetishes, ebony,gay issues, women's health,lesbian, homosexual, vagina, vaginal dryness, pain, analcancer, teen issues, safe sex, penis, pregnant, interracial, sex education, penis enlargement, breast enlargement, . . . and shave."" 75   thereforefocus on the studies conducted by Finnell and Biek in trying to ascertain estimatesof the rates of over- and underblocking that takes place when filters are used in publiclibraries. The government hired expert witness Cory Finnell to study the Internet logs compiledby the public libraries systems in Tacoma, Washington; Westerville, Ohio;and Greenville, South Carolina. Each of these libraries uses filtering software that keeps a log of information about individual Web site requests made by library patrons. Finnell, whoseconsulting firm specializes in data analysis, has substantial experience evaluating Internetaccess logs generated on networked systems. He spent more than a year developing a reporting tool for N2H2, and, in the course of that work, acquired a familiarity with the design and operation of Internet filtering products. The Tacoma library uses Cyber Patrol filtering software, and logs information only onsitesthat were blocked. Finnell worked from a list of all sites that were blocked in the Tacomapublic library in the monthof August 2001. The Westerville library uses the Websensefiltering product, and logs information on both blocked sites and non-blocked sites. When the logs reach a certain size, they are overwritten by new usage logs. Becauseof this overwriting feature, logs were available to Finnell only for the relatively shortperiod from October 1, 2001 to October 3, 2001. The Greenville library uses N2H2'sfiltering product and logs both blocked sites and sites that patrons accessed. The logscontain more than 500,000 records per day. Because of the volume of the records,  76   Finnellrestricted his analysis to the period from August 2, 2001 to August 15, 2001. Finnell calculated an overblocking rate for each of the three libraries by examining thehostWeb site containing each of the blocked pages. He did not employ a sampling technique,but instead examined each blocked Web site. If the contents of a host Web site orthepages within the Web site were consistent with the filtering product's definition of thecategory under which the site was blocked, Finnell considered it to be an accurate block. Finnell and three others, two of whom were temporary employees, examined the Websitesto determine whether they were consistent with the filtering companies' category definitions. Their review was, of course, necessarily limited by: (1) the clarity of thefiltering companies' category definitions; (2) Finnell's and his employees' interpretations of the definitions; and (3) human error. The study's reliability is also undercutby the fact that Finnell failed to archive the blocked Web pages as they existed eitheratthe point that a patron in one of the three libraries was denied access or when Finnelland his team reviewed the pages. It is therefore impossible for anyone to check theaccuracy and consistency of Finnell's review team, or to know whether the pages containedthe same content when the block occurred as they did when Finnell's team reviewedthem. This is a key flaw, because the results of the study depend on individual determinations as to overblocking and underblocking, in which Finnell and his team were requiredto compare what they saw on the Web pages that they reviewed with standard definitionsprovided by the filtering company.  77   Tacoma library's Cyber Patrol software blocked 836 unique Web sites during the monthof August. Finnell determined that 783 of those blocks were accurate and that 53 wereinaccurate. 10  The error rate for Cyber Patrol was therefore estimated to be 6.34%,  andthetrue error rate was estimated with 95% confidence to lie within the range of 4.69%to7.99%. 11  Finnell and his team reviewed 185 unique Web sites that were blocked  by Westerville Library's Websensefilter during the logged period and determined that 158of them were accurate and that 27 of them were inaccurate. He therefore estimated theWebsense filter's overblocking rate at 14.59% with a 95% confidence interval of 9.51%to19.68%. Additionally, Finnell examined 1,674 unique Web sites that were blockedby the Greenville Library's N2H2 filter during the relevant period and determined that 1,520 were accurate and that 87 were inaccurate. This yields an estimatedoverblocking rate of 5.41% and a 95% confidence interval of 4.33% to 6.55%. Finnell's methodology was materially flawed in that it understates the rate of overblocking for the following reasons. First, patrons from the three libraries knew that If separate patrons attempted to reach the same Web site, or one or more patrons attemptedto access more than one page on a single Web site, Finnell counted these attemptsas a single block. For example, the total number of blocked requests for Web pagesatTacoma Library during the logged period was 2,812, but Finnell counted this as only 895blocks of unique Web sites. Of the 895 unique blocked sites, Finnell was unable toaccess59, yielding 836 unique blocked sites for his team to review. Theconfidence intervals that Finnell calculated represent the range of percentages withinwhich we can be 95% confident that the actual rate of overblocking in that particularlibrary falls. We note that these confidence intervals assume that the time periodforwhich the study assessed the library's internet logs constitutes a random and representative sample. 78 11 10   thefilterswere operating, and may have been deterred from attempting to access Web sitesthatthey perceived to be ""borderline"" sites, i.e., those that may or may not have been appropriately filtered according to the filtering companies' category definitions. Second, intheircross-examination of Finnell, the plaintiffs offered screen shots of a number of Websitesthat, according to Finnell, had been appropriately blocked, but that Finnell admittedcontained only benign materials. Finnell's explanation was that the Web sites musthavechanged between the time when he conducted the study and the time of the trial,butbecause he did not archive the images as they existed when his team reviewed them forthe study, there is no way to verify this. Third, because of the way in which Finnellcounted blocked Web sites  i.e., if separate patrons attempted to reach the same Website,or one or more patrons attempted to access more than one page on a single Web site,Finnell counted these attempts as a single block, see supra note 10  his results necessarily understate the number of times that patrons were erroneously denied access to information. Atall events, there is no doubt that Finnell's estimated rates of overblocking, whicharebased on the filtering companies' own category definitions, significantly understatethe rate of overblocking with respect to CIPA's category definitions for filteringfor adults. The filters used in the Tacoma, Westerville, and Greenville libraries wereconfigured to block, among other things, images of full nudity and sexually explicit materials. There is no dispute, however, that these categories are far broader than CIPA's  79   categoriesof visual depictions that are obscene, or child pornography, the two categories of material that libraries subject to CIPA must certify that they filter during adults' use of theInternet. Finnell's study also calculated underblocking rates with respect to the Westerville andGreenville Libraries (both of which logged not only their blocked sites, but all sites visitedby their patrons), by taking random samples of URLs from the list of sites that werenotblocked. The study used a sample of 159 sites that were accessed by Westerville patronsand determined that only one of them should have been blocked under the software's category definitions, yielding an underblocking rate of 0.6%. Given the size of thesample, the 95% confidence interval is 0% to 1.86%. The study examined a sample of 254Websites accessed by patrons in Greenville and found that three of them should have beenblocked under the filtering software's category definitions. This results in an estimatedunderblocking rate of 1.2% with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 0% to 2.51%. Wedo not credit Finnell's estimates of the rates of underblocking in the Westerville and Greenville public libraries for several reasons. First, Finnell's estimates likely understate the actual rate of underblocking because patrons, who knew that filtering programswere operating in the Greenville and Westerville Libraries, may have refrained from attempting to access sites with sexually explicit materials, or other contents that they knewwould probably meet a filtering program's blocked categories. Second, and most  80   importantly, we think that the formula that Finnell used to calculate the rate of underblocking in these two libraries is not as meaningful as the formula that information scientiststypically use to calculate a rate of recall, which we describe above in Subsection II.E.3. AsDr. Nunberg explained, the standard method that information scientists use to calculatearate of recall is to sort a set of items into two groups, those that fall into a particularcategory (e.g., those that should have been blocked by a filter) and those that do not. Therate of recall is then calculated by dividing the number of items that the system correctly identified as belonging to the category by the total number of items in the category. Inthe example above, we discussed a database that contained 1000 photographs. Assumethat 200 of these photographs were pictures of dogs. If, for example, a classification system designed to identify pictures of dogs identified 80 of the dog picturesand failed to identify 120, it would have performed with a recall rate of 40%. Thiswould be analogous to a filter that underblocked at a rate of 60%. To calculate the recallrateof the filters in the Westerville and Greenville public libraries in accordance withthestandard method described above, Finnell should have taken a sample of sites from thelibraries' Internet use logs(including both sites that were blocked and sites that werenot),and divided the number of sites in the sample that the filter incorrectly failed to blockby the total number of sites in the sample that should have been blocked. What Finnelldidinstead was to take a sample of sites that were not blocked, and divide the  81   totalnumber of sites in this sample by the number of sites in the sample that should have beenblocked. This made the denominator that Finnell used much larger than it would havebeenhad he used the standardmethod for calculating recall, consequently making theunderblocking rate that he calculated much lower than it would have been under the standardmethod. 12  Moreover, despite the relatively low rates of underblocking that Finnell's study found,librarians from several of the libraries proffered by defendants that use blocking products,including Greenville, Tacoma, and Westerville, testified that there are instances of underblocking in their libraries. No quantitative evidence was presented comparing theeffectiveness of filters and other alternative methods used by libraries to prevent patronsfrom accessing visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or in the caseof minors, harmful to minors. Biek undertook a similar study of the overblocking rates that result from the TacomaLibrary's use of the Cyber Patrol software. He began with the 3,733 individual  Toillustrate the two different methods, consider a random sample of 1010 web sites takenfrom a library's Internet use log, 10 of which fall within the category that a filter is intendedto block (e.g., pornography), and suppose that the filter incorrectly failed to block2of the 10 sites that it should have blocked and did not block any sites that should nothavebeen blocked. The standard method of quantifying the rate of underblocking woulddivide the number of sites inthe sample that the filter incorrectly failed to block by thenumber of sites in the sample that the filter should have blocked, yielding an underblocking rate in this example of 20%. Finnell's study, however, calculated the underblocking rate by dividing the number of sites that the filter incorrectly failed to blockby the total number of sites in the sample that were not blocked (whether correctly orincorrectly) yielding an underblocking rate in this example of only .2%. 82  12   blocksthat occurred in the TacomaLibrary in October 2000 and drew from this data set a random sample of 786 URLs. He calculated two rates of overblocking, one with respect totheTacoma Library's policy on Internet use  that the pictorial content of the site may notinclude ""graphic materials depicting full nudity and sexual acts which are portrayed obviously and exclusively for sensational or pornographic purposes""  and the other with respecttoCyber Patrol's own category definitions. He estimated that Cyber Patrol overblocked 4% of all Web pages in October 2000 with respect to the definitions of the TacomaLibrary's Internet Policy and 2% of all pages with respect to Cyber Patrol's own category definitions. 13  Itis difficult to determine how reliable Biek's conclusions are, because he didnot keeprecords of the raw data that heused in his study; nor did he archive images of the Webpages as they looked when he made the determination whether they were properly classifiedby the Cyber Patrol program. Without this information, it is impossible to verify hisconclusions (or to undermine them). And Biek's study certainly understates CyberPatrol's overblocking rate for some of the same reasons that Finnell's study likely understates the true rates of overblocking used in the libraries that he studied. We also note that Finnell's study, which analyzed a set of Internet logs from the TacomaLibrary during which the same filtering program was operating with the same set of blocking categories enabled, found a significantly higher rate of overblocking than the According to Biek, the sample size that he used yielded a 95% confidence interval of plusorminus 3.11%. 83 13   Biekstudy did. Biek found a rate of overblocking of approximately 2% while the Finnell study estimated a 6.34% rate of overblocking. At all events, the category definitions employedby CIPA, at least with respect to adult use  visual depictions that are obscene orchildpornography  are narrower than the materials prohibited by the Tacoma Library policy,and therefore Biek's study understates the rate of overblocking with respect to CIPA'sdefinitions for adults. Insum, we think that Finnell's study, while we do not credit its estimates of underblocking, is useful because it states lower bounds with respect to the rates of overblocking that occurred when the Cyber Patrol, Websense, and N2H2 filters were operatingin public libraries. While these rates are substantial  between nearly 6% and 15%wethink, for the reasons stated above, that they greatly understate the actual rates of overblocking that occurs, and therefore cannot be considered as anything more than minimum estimates of the rates of overblocking that happens in all filtering programs. 5. Methods of Obtaining Examples of Erroneously Blocked Web Sites The plaintiffs assembled a list of several thousand Web sites that they contend were,atthe time of the study, likely to have been erroneously blocked by one or more of fourmajorcommercial filtering programs: SurfControl Cyber Patrol 6.0.1.47, N2H2 InternetFiltering 2.0, Secure Computing SmartFilter 3.0.0.01, and Websense Enterprise 4.3.0. They compiled this list using a two-step process. First, Benjamin Edelman, an expertwitness who testified before us, compiled a list of more than 500,000 URLs and  84   devisedaprogram to feed them through all four filtering programs in order to compile a listof URLs that might have been erroneously blocked by one or more of the programs. Second,Edelman forwarded subsets of the list that he compiled to librarians and professorsof library science whom the plaintiffs had hired to review the blocked sites for suitability in the public library context. Edelman assembled the list of URLs by compiling Web pages that were blocked by thefollowing categories in the four programs: Cyber Patrol: Adult/Sexually Explicit; N2H2:Adults Only, Nudity, Pornography, and Sex, with ""exceptions"" engaged in the categoriesof Education, For Kids, History, Medical, Moderated, and Text/Spoken Only; SmartFilter: Sex, Nudity, Mature, and Extreme; Websense: Adult Content, Nudity, and Sex. Edelman then assembled a database of Web sites for possible testing. He derived thislistby automatically compiling URLs from the Yahoo index of Web sites, taking them from categories from the Yahoo index that differed significantly from the classifications that he had enabled in each of the blocking programs (taking, for example, Websitesfrom Yahoo's ""Government"" category). He then expanded this list by entering URLstaken from the Yahoo index into the Google search engine's ""related"" search function,which provides the user with a list of similar sites. Edelman also included and Edelman is a Harvard University student and a systems administrator and multimedia specialist at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School. Despite Edelman's young age, he has been doing consulting work on Internetrelatedissues for nine years, since he was in junior high school. 85 14 14   excludedspecific Web sites at the request of the plaintiffs' counsel. Taking the list of more than 500,000 URLs that he had compiled, Edelman used an automated system that he had developed to test whether particular URLs were blocked by eachof the four filtering programs. This testing took place between February and October2001. He recorded the specific dates on which particular sites were blockedby particularprograms, and, using commercial archiving software, archived the contents of thehomepage of the blocked Web sites (and in some instances the pages linked to from thehomepage) as it existed when it was blocked. 15  Through this process, Edelman,  whosetestimony we credit, compiled a list of 6,777 URLs that were blocked by one or moreof the four programs. Because these sites were chosen from categories from the Yahoodirectory that were unrelated to the filtering categories that were enabled during thetest(i.e., ""Government"" vs. ""Nudity""), he reasoned that they were likely erroneously blocked. As explained in the margin, Edelman repeated his testing and discovered that CyberPatrol had unblocked most of the pages on the list of 6,777 after he had published thelistonhis Web site. His records indicate that an employee of SurfControl (the company that produces Cyber Patrol software) accessed his site and presumably checked outtheURLs on the list, thus confirming Edelman's judgment that the majority of URLs  Thearchiving process in some cases took up to 48 hours from when the page was blocked. 86  15   onthelistwere erroneously blocked.  16  Edelman forwarded the list of blocked sites to Dr. Joseph Janes, an Assistant Professorin the Information School of the University of Washington who also testified at trialasanexpert witness. Janes reviewed the sites that Edelman compiled to determine whetherthey are consistent with library collection development, i.e., whether they are sitestowhich a reference librarian would, consistent with professional standards, direct a patronasasource of information. 16 17  InOctober 2001, Edelman published the results of his initial testing on his Web site. InFebruary and March 2002 he repeated his testing of the 6,777 URLs originally foundtobe blocked by at least one of the blocking products, in order to determine whetherand to what extent the blocking product vendors had corrected the mistakes that hepublicized. Of those URLs blocked by N2H2 in the October 2001 testing, 55.10% remainedblocked when tested by Edelman in March 2002. Of those URLs blocked by Websensein the October 2001 testing, 76.28% remained blocked when tested by Edelmanin February 2002. Of those URLs blocked by SurfControl's Cyber Patrol product,only 7.16% remained blocked, i.e., Cyber Patrol had unblocked almost 93% of theWebpages originally blocked. Because the results posted to his Web site were accessedby an employee of SurfControl (as evidenced by Edelman's records of who was accessinghis Web site), we infer that Cyber Patrol had determined that 93% of all 6,777 pages,or6,302 Web pages, were originally wrongly blocked by the product. Twoother expert witnesses reviewed subsets of the list of Web pages that Edelman compiled. Dr. Michael T. Ryan, Director of the Rare Book and Manuscript Library and of theCenter for Electronic Text and Image at the University of Pennsylvania, reviewed a listof 204sites that Edelman forwarded to him in order to determine their appropriateness andusefulness in the library setting. Because the sites that Ryan reviewed were not selectedrandomly (i.e., they were chosen by plaintiffs' counsel), his study says little aboutthecharacter of the set of 6,777 sites that Edelman compiled, or the total amount of overblocking by the four filtering programs that Edelman used. Anne Lipow, a practicing librarian for more than 30 years and the director of a library consulting firm, also reviewed the same list of 204 URLs from the set that Edelmanhad collected for their appropriateness for a library's collection. She categorized sites in four different levels according to their appropriateness for a public 87 17   Edelman forwarded Janes a list of 6,775 Web sites, almost the entire list of blockedsites that he collected, from which Janes took a random sample of 859 usingthe SPSSstatistical software package. Janes indicated that he chose a sample size of 859 becauseitwould yield a 95% confidence interval of plus or minus 2.5%. Janes recruited agroupof 16 reviewers, most of whom were current or former students at the University of Washington's Information School, to help him identify which sites were appropriate forlibrary use. We describe the process that he used in the margin. 18  Due to  library'scollection. Again, becausethese URLs were not selected randomly, Lipow's study isnot particularly relevant to the total set that Edelman compiled, or to the total amountof overblocking by the fourfiltering programs that Edelman used. Although the methodology used to select the list of Web pages that was forwarded toRyanand Lipow is problematic, Ryan's and Lipow's testimony established that many of theerroneously blocked sites that Edelman identified would be useful and appropriate sourcesof information for library patrons. Allof the reviewers that Janes recruited had some relevant experience in library referenceservices or library collection development. Janes divided the reviewers into two groups,agroup of 11 less experienced reviewers, and a group of five more experienced reviewers. Janes assigned the less experienced group to do a first-round review with the purposeof identifying the most obviously overblocked sites. The more experienced groupwasto review the remaining sites (i.e., those that were not obviously overblocked) andtomake final decisions regarding these sites. Inthe first round, each person evaluated two sets of around 80 sites, and each groupwasevaluated by two different people. Each set of sites included the following instructions: Lookcarefully at each of the Web sites on the list. Please make a notation of any site that appearstomeet any of the following criteria: a.Contains information similar to that already found in libraries, or 88 18   theinability of a member of Janes's review team to complete the reviewing process, Janes hadtocut157 Web sites out of the sample, but because the Web sites were randomly assignedto reviewers, it is unlikely that these sites differed significantly from the rest of thesample. That left the sample size at 699, which widened the 95% confidence interval toplusorminus 2.8%. Of the total 699 sites reviewed, Janes's team concluded that 165 of them, or 23.6% percentof the sample, were not of any value in the library context (i.e., no librarian b.Contains information a librarian would want in the library if s/he had unlimited funds to purchase information and unlimited shelf space, or c.You would be willing to refer a patron (of any age) to the site if the patron appeared at a reference desk seeking information about the subject of thesite. For this last criterion, we recognize that you might not refer a young child to a Calculus site just because it would not be useful to that child, but you should ignore that factor. Informational sites, such as a Calculus site, should be noted. A site that is purely erotica should not be noted. Sitesthatreceived ""Yes"" votes from both reviewers were determined to be of sufficient interestina library context and removed from further analysis. Sites receiving one or two ""No""votes would go to the next round. In the first round, 243 sites received ""Yes"" votes from bothreviewers, while 456 sites received one or more ""No"" votes or could not be found. These 456 sites were sent forward to the second round of judging. Theinstructions for the second-round reviewers were the same as those given to thefirst-round reviewers, except that in section c, the following sentence was added: ""Sitesthathave a commercial purpose should be included here if they might be of use or interesttosomeone wishing to buy the product or service or doing research on commercial behavior on the Internet, much as most libraries include the Yellow Pages in theircollections."" The second round of review produced the following results: 60 sites couldnotbe found (due to broken links, 404 ""not found"" errors, domain for sale messages,etc.), 231 sites were judged ""Yes,"" and 165 judged ""No."" 89   would,consistent with professional standards, refer a patron to these sites as a source of information). They were unable to find 60 of the Web sites, or 8.6% of the sample. Therefore,they concluded that the remaining 474 Web sites, or 67.8% of the sample, wereexamples of overblocking with respect to materials that are appropriate sourcesof information in public libraries. Applying a 95% confidence interval of plus or minus 2.8%,thestudy concluded that we can be 95% confident that the actual percentage of sitesinthelist of 6,775 sites that are appropriate for use in public libraries is somewhere between65.0% and 70.6%. In other words, we can be 95% certain that the actual number of sitesout of the 6,775 that Edelman forwarded to Janes that are appropriate for use in publiclibraries (under Janes's standard) is somewhere between 4,403 and 4,783. The government raised some valid criticisms of Janes's methodology, attacking in particularthe fact that, while sites that received two ""yes"" votes in the first round of votingwere determined to be of sufficient interest in a library context to be removedfrom furtheranalysis, sites receiving oneor two ""no"" votes were sent to the next round. The government also correctly points out that results of Janes's study can be generalized only tothepopulation of 6,775 sites thatEdelman forwarded to Janes. Even taking these criticismsinto account, and discounting Janes's numbers appropriately, we credit Janes's study asconfirming that Edelman'sset of 6,775 Web sites contains at least a few thousandURLs that were erroneously blocked by one or more of the four filtering programsthat he used, whether judged against CIPA's definitions, the filters' own  90   category criteria, or against the standard that the Janes study used. Edelman tested only 500,000unique URLs out of the 4000 times that many, or two billion, that are estimated toexistinthe indexable Web. Even assuming that Edelman chose the URLs that were mostlikely to be erroneously blocked by commercial filtering programs, we conclude that many times the number of pages that Edelman identified are erroneously blocked by one ormoreof the filtering programs that he tested. Edelman's and Janes's studies provide numerous specific examples of Web pages thatwereerroneously blocked by one or more filtering programs. The Web pages that wereerroneously blocked by one or more of the filtering programs do not fall into any neatpatterns; they range widely in subject matter, and it is difficult to tell why they may havebeenoverblocked. The list that Edelman compiled, for example, contains Web pagesrelating to religion, politics and government, health, careers, education, travel, sports,andmany other topics. In the next section, we provide examples from each of thesecategories. 6. Examples of Erroneously Blocked Web Sites Several of the erroneously blocked Web sites had content relating to churches, religiousorders, religious charities, and religious fellowship organizations. These includedthe following Web sites: the Knights of Columbus Council 4828, a Catholic men'sgroup associated with St. Patrick's Church in Fallon, Nevada, http://msnhomepages.talkcity.com/SpiritSt/kofc4828, which was blocked by Cyber Patrol  91   inthe""Adult/Sexually Explicit"" category; the Agape Church of Searcy, Arkansas, http://www.agapechurch.com, which was blocked by Websense as ""Adult Content""; the homepageof the Lesbian and Gay Havurah of the Long Beach, California Jewish Community Center, http://www.compupix.com/gay/havurah.htm, which was blocked by N2H2as""Adults Only, Pornography,"" by Smartfilter as ""Sex,"" and by Websense as ""Sex"";Orphanage Emmanuel, a Christian orphanage in Honduras that houses 225 children, http://home8.inet.tele.dk/rfb_viva, which was blocked by Cyber Patrol in the ""Adult/Sexually Explicit"" category; Vision Art Online, which sells wooden wall hangings forthehome that contain prayers, passages from the Bible, and images of the Star of David, http://www.visionartonline.com, which was blocked in Websense's ""Sex"" category;and the home page of Tenzin Palmo, a Buddhist nun, which contained a description of her project to build a Buddhist nunnery and international retreat centerfor women, http://www.tenzinpalmo.com, which was categorized as ""Nudity"" by N2H2. Several blocked sites also contained information about governmental entities or specificpolitical candidates, or contained political commentary. These included: theWeb siteforKelley Ross, a Libertarian candidate for the California State Assembly, http://www.friesian.com/ross/ca40, which N2H2 blocked as ""Nudity""; the Web site for BobCoughlin, a town selectman inDedham, Massachusetts, http://www.bobcoughlin.org, which was blocked under N2H2's ""Nudity"" category; alist of Websites containing information about government and politics in Adams County,  92   Pennsylvania, http://www.geocities.com/adamscopa, which was blocked by Websense as ""Sex"";theWeb site for Wisconsin Right to Life, http://www.wrtl.org, which N2H2 blockedas ""Nudity""; a Web site that promotes federalism in Uganda, http://federo.com, whichN2H2 blocked as ""Adults Only, Pornography""; ""Fight the Death Penalty in the USA,""aDanish Web site dedicated to criticizing the American system of capital punishment, http://www.fdp.dk, which N2H2 blocked as ""Pornography""; and ""Dumb Laws,""ahumor Web site that makes fun of outmoded laws, http://www.dumblaws.com, whichN2H2 blocked under its ""Sex"" category. Erroneously blocked Web sites relating to health issues included the following: a guidetoallergies, http://www.x-sitez.com/allergy, which was categorized as ""Adults Only,Pornography"" by N2H2; a health question and answer site sponsored by Columbia University, http://www.goaskalice.com.columbia.edu, which was blocked as ""Sex"" by N2H2,andas ""Mature"" by Smartfilter; the Western Amputee Support Alliance Home Page, http://www.usinter.net/wasa, which was blocked by N2H2 as ""Pornography""; the Websiteof the Willis-Knighton Cancer Center, a Shreveport, Louisiana cancer treatment facility, http://cancerftr.wkmc.com,which was blocked by Websense under the ""Sex"" category;and a site dealing with halitosis, http://www.dreamcastle.com/tungs, whichwas blockedby N2H2 as ""Adults, Pornography,"" by Smartfilter as ""Sex,"" by Cyber Patrol as ""Adult/Sexually Explicit,"" and by Websense as ""Adult Content."" The filtering programs also erroneously blocked several Web sites having to do  93   witheducation and careers. The filtering programs blocked two sites that provide information on home schooling. ""HomEduStation  the Internet Source for Home Education,"" http://www.perigee.net/~mcmullen/homedustation/, was categorized by CyberPatrol as ""Adult/Sexually Explicit."" Smartfilter blocked ""Apricot: A Web site madeby and for home schoolers,"" http://apricotpie.com, as ""Sex."" The programs also miscategorized several career-related sites. ""Social Work Search,"" http://www.socialworksearch.com/, is a directory for social workers that Cyber Patrol placedinits ""Adult/Sexually Explicit"" category. The ""Gay and Lesbian Chamber of SouthernNevada,"" http://www.lambdalv.com, ""a forum for the business community to developrelationships within the Las Vegas lesbian, gay, transsexual, and bisexual community"" was blocked by N2H2as ""Adults Only, Pornography."" A site for aspiring dentists, http://www.vvm.com/~bond/home.htm, was blocked by Cyber Patrol in its ""Adult/Sexually Explicit"" category. The filtering programs erroneously blocked many travel Web sites, including: the Websitefor the Allen Farmhouse Bed & Breakfast of Alleghany County, North Carolina, http://planet-nc.com/Beth/index.html, which Websense blocked as ""Adult Content""; OdysseusGay Travel, a travel company serving gay men, http://www.odyusa.com, which N2H2categorized as ""Adults Only, Pornography""; Southern Alberta Fly Fishing Outfitters, http://albertaflyfish.com, which N2H2 blocked as ""Pornography""; and ""Nature andCulture Conscious Travel,"" a tour operator in Namibia, http://www.trans-namibia-  94   tours.com,which was categorized as ""Pornography"" by N2H2. The filtering programs also miscategorized a large number of sports Web sites. Theseincluded: a site devoted to Willie O'Ree, the first African-American player in the NationalHockey League, http://www.missioncreep.com/mw/oree.html, which Websense blockedunder its ""Nudity"" category; the home page of the Sydney University Australian FootballClub, http://www.tek.com.au/suafc, which N2H2 blocked as ""Adults Only, Pornography,"" Smartfilter blocked as ""Sex,"" Cyber Patrol blocked as ""Adult/Sexually Explicit""and Websense blocked as ""Sex""; and a fan's page devoted to the Toronto Maple Leafshockey team, http://www.torontomapleleafs.atmypage.com, which N2H2 blocked underthe""Pornography"" category. 7. Conclusion: The Effectiveness of Filtering Programs Public libraries have adopted a variety of means of dealing with problems created by theprovision of Internet access. The large amount of sexually explicit speech that is freely available on the Internet has,to varying degrees, led to patron complaints about suchmatters as unsought exposure to offensive material, incidents of staff and patron harassment by individuals viewing sexually explicit content on the Internet, and the use of library computers to access illegal material, such as child pornography. In some libraries, youthfullibrary patrons have persistently attempted to use the Internet to access hardcore pornography. Those public libraries that have responded to these problems by using software  95   filtershave found such filters to provide a relatively effective means of preventing patronsfrom accessing sexually explicit material on the Internet. Nonetheless, out of the entireuniverse of speech on the Internet falling within the filtering products' category definitions, the filters will incorrectly fail to block a substantial amount of speech. Thus, softwarefilters have not completely eliminated the problems that public libraries have soughttoaddress by using the filters, as evidenced by frequent instances of underblocking. Nor is there any quantitative evidence of the relative effectiveness of filtersandthe alternatives to filters that are also intended to prevent patrons from accessingillegal content on the Internet. Even more importantly (for this case), although software filters provide a relatively cheapandeffective, albeit imperfect, means for public libraries to prevent patrons from accessingspeech that falls within the filters' category definitions, we find that commercially available filtering programs erroneously block a huge amount of speech thatisprotected by the First Amendment. Any currently available filtering product that is reasonably effective in preventing users from accessing content within the filter's category definitions will necessarily block countless thousands of Web pages, the content of whichdoes not match the filtering company's category definitions, much less the legal definitionsof obscenity, child pornography, or harmful to minors. Even Finnell, an expertwitness for the defendants, found that between 6% and 15% of the blocked Web sitesinthepublic libraries that he analyzed did not contain content that meets even the  96   filteringproducts' own definitions of sexually explicit content, let alone CIPA's definitions. This phenomenon occurs fora number of reasons explicated in the more detailed findingsof fact supra. These include limitations on filtering companies' ability to: (1) harvestWeb pages for review; (2) review and categorize the Web pages that they have harvested;and (3) engage in regular re-review of the Web pages that they have previously reviewed. The primary limitations on filtering companies' ability to harvest Web pages forreview is that a substantial majority of pages on the Web are not indexable using the spideringtechnology that Web search engines use, and that together, search engines have indexedonly around half of the Web pages that are theoretically indexable. The fastrate of growthin the number of Web pages also limits filtering companies' ability to harvest pagesforreview. These shortcomings necessarily result in significant underblocking. Several limitations on filtering companies' ability to review and categorize the Webpages that they have harvested also contribute to over- and underblocking. First, automatedreview processes, even those based on ""artificial intelligence,"" are unable with any consistency to distinguish accurately material that falls within a category definition from material that does not. Moreover, human review of URLs is hampered by filtering companies' limited staff sizes, and by human error or misjudgment. In order to deal with thevastsize of the Web and its rapid rates of growth and change, filtering companies engageinseveral practices that are necessary to reduce underblocking, but inevitably  97   resultinoverblocking. These include: (1) blocking whole Web sites even when only a smallminority of their pages contain material that would fit under one of the filtering company'scategories (e.g., blocking the Salon.com site because it contains a sex column);(2) blocking by IP address (because a single IP address may contain many differentWeb sites and many thousands of pages of heterogenous content); and (3) blockingloophole sites such as translator sites and cache sites, which archive Web pages thathavebeen removed from the Web by their original publisher. Finally, filtering companies'failure to engage in regular re-review of Web pages thatthey have already categorized (or that they have determined do not fall into any category)results in a substantial amount of over- and underblocking. For example, Web publisherschange the contents of Web pages frequently. The problem also arises when a Websitegoes out of existence and its domain name or IP address is reassigned to a new Websitepublisher. In that case, a filtering company's previous categorization of the IP addressordomain name would likely be incorrect, potentially resulting in the over- or underblocking of many thousands of pages. The inaccuracies that result from these limitations of filtering technology are quite substantial. At least tens of thousands of pages of the indexable Web are overblocked by eachof the filtering programs evaluated by experts in this case, even when considered againstthe filtering companies' own category definitions. Many erroneously blocked pagescontain content that is completely innocuous for both adults and minors, and that no  98   rationalperson could conclude matches the filtering companies' category definitions, suchas""pornography"" or ""sex."" The number of overblocked sites is of course much higher with respect to the definitionsof obscenity and child pornography that CIPA employs for adults, since the filteringproducts' category definitions, such as ""sex"" and ""nudity,"" encompass vast amountsof Web pages that are neither child pornography nor obscene. Thus, the number of pagesof constitutionally protected speech blocked by filtering products far exceeds the many thousands of pages that are overblocked by reference to the filtering products' category definitions. Nopresently conceivable technology can make the judgments necessary to determinewhether a visual depiction fits the legal definitions of obscenity, child pornography, or harmful to minors. Given the state of the art in filtering and image recognition technology, and the rapidly changing and expanding nature of the Web, we findthatfiltering products' shortcomings will not be solved through a technical solution intheforeseeable future. 19 19  In sum,filtering products are currently unable to block only  Although it was not proffered as evidence in this trial, (and hence we do not rely on ittoinform our findings), we note that Youth, Pornography, and the Internet, a congressionally commissioned study by the National Research Council, a division of the NationalAcademies of Science, see Pub. L. 105-314, Title X, Sec. 901, comes to a conclusionsimilar to the one that we reach regarding the effectiveness of Internet filters. Thecommission concludes that: Allfiltersthose of today and for the foreseeable futuresuffer (and will suffer) from some degree of overblocking (blocking content that should be allowed through) and some degree of underblocking (passing content that 99   visualdepictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors (or, only contentmatching a filtering product's category definitions) while simultaneously allowingaccess to all protected speech (or, all content not matching the blocking product'scategory definitions). Any software filter that is reasonably effective in blockingaccess to Web pages that fall within its category definitions will necessarily erroneously block a substantial number of Web pages that do not fall within its category definitions. III. Analytic Framework for the Opinion: The Centrality of Dole and the Role of the Facial Challenge Both the plaintiffs and the government agree that, because this case involves a challengeto the constitutionality of the conditions that Congress has set on state actors' receiptof federal funds, the Supreme Court's decision in South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203(1987), supplies the proper threshold analytic framework. The constitutional source of Congress's spending power is Article I,  8, cl. 1, which provides that ""Congress shall havePower . . . to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfareof the United States."" In Dole, the Court upheld the constitutionality of a federal should not be allowed through). While the extent of overblocking and underblocking will vary with the product (and may improve over time), underblocking and overblocking result from numerous sources, including thevariability in the perspectives that humans bring to the task of judging content. Youth,Pornography, and the Internet (Dick Thornburgh & Herbert S. Lin, eds., 2002), availableat http://bob.nap.edu/html/youth_internet/. 100   statuterequiring the withholding of federal highway funds from any state with a drinking agebelow21. Id. at 211-12. In sustaining the provision's constitutionality, Dole articulated four general constitutional limitations on Congress's exercise of the spending power. First, ""the exercise of the spending power must be in pursuit of `the general welfare.'"" Id. at 207. Second, any conditions that Congress sets on states' receipt of federalfunds must be sufficiently clear to enable recipients ""to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of their participation."" Id. (internal quotation marksandcitation omitted). Third, the conditions on the receipt of federal funds must bearsomerelation to the purpose of the funding program. Id. And finally, ""other constitutional provisions may provide an independent bar to the conditional grant of federalfunds."" Id. at 208. In particular, the spending power ""may not be used to induce theStatesto engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional. Thus, for example,agrant of federal funds conditioned on invidiously discriminatory state action or theinfliction of cruel and unusual punishment would be an illegitimate exercise of the Congress'broad spending power."" Id. at 210. Plaintiffs do not contend that CIPA runs afoul of the first three limitations. However,they do allege that CIPA is unconstitutional under the fourth prong of Dole becauseitwill induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment. 20 20  Plaintiffs  Because we find that the plaintiff public libraries are funded and controlled by state andlocalgovernments, they are state actors, subject to the constraints of the First 101   thereforesubmit that the First Amendment ""provide[s] an independent bar to the conditional grant of federal funds"" created by CIPA. Id. at 208. More specifically, they arguethatby conditioning public libraries' receipt of federal funds on the use of software filters,CIPA will induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment rights of Internet content-providers to disseminate constitutionally protected speech to library patrons via theInternet, and the correlative First Amendment rights of public library patrons to receiveconstitutionally protected speech on the Internet. 21  Thegovernment concedes that under the Dole framework, CIPA is facially invalid if itsconditions will induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment. The government and the plaintiffs disagree, however, on the meaning of Dole's ""inducement"" requirement in the context of a First Amendment facial challenge to the conditions that Congressplaces on state actors' receipt of federal funds. The government contends that becauseplaintiffs are bringing a facial challenge, they must show that under no circumstances is it possible for a public library to comply with CIPA's conditions without  Amendment, as incorporated by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. TheSupreme Court has recognized that the First Amendment encompasses not only therighttospeak, but also the right to receive information. See Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844,874(1997) (invalidating a statute because it ""effectively suppresses a large amount of speechthat adults have a constitutional right to receive and to address to one another""); Stanleyv.Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 564 (1969) (""[The] right to receive information and ideas,regardless of their social worth . . . is fundamental to our free society.""); see also Bd.ofEduc. v. Pico, 457 U.S. 853, 867-68 (1982) (plurality opinion) (""[T]he right to receiveideas follows ineluctably from the sender's First Amendment right to send them.""). 102 21   violatingthe First Amendment. The plaintiffs respond that even if it is possible for some publiclibraries to comply with CIPA without violating the First Amendment, CIPA is facially invalid if it ""will result in the impermissible suppression of a substantial amount of protected speech."" Because it was clear in Dole that the states could comply with the challenged conditionsthat Congress attached to the receipt of federal funds without violating the Constitution, the Dole Court did not have occasion to explain fully what it means for Congressto use the spending power to ""induce [recipients] to engage in activities that wouldthemselves be unconstitutional."" Dole, 483 U.S. at 210; see id. at 211 (""Were SouthDakota to succumb to the blandishments offered by Congress and raise its drinking ageto21,the State's action in so doing would not violate the constitutional rights of anyone.""). Although the proposition that Congress may not pay state actors to violate citizens'First Amendment rights is unexceptionable when stated in the abstract, it is unclearwhat exactly a litigant must establish to facially invalidate an exercise of Congress's spending power on this ground. Ingeneral, it is well-established that a court may sustain a facial challenge to a statuteonly if the plaintiff demonstrates that the statute admits of no constitutional application. See United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987) (""A facial challenge toalegislative Act is, of course, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since thechallenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act  103   wouldbevalid.""); see also Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 612 (1988) (""It has not been theCourt's practice, in consideringfacial challenges to statutes of this kind, to strike them down in anticipation that particular applications may result in unconstitutional use of funds."") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). First Amendment overbreadth doctrine creates a limited exception to this ruleby permittingfacial invalidation of a statute that burdens a substantial amount of protected speech,even if the statute may be constitutionally applied in particular circumstances. ""TheConstitution gives significant protection from overbroad laws that chill speech withintheFirst Amendment's vast and privileged sphere. Under this principle, [a law] is unconstitutional on its face if it prohibits a substantial amount of protected expression."" Ashcroftv.Free Speech Coalition, 122 S. Ct. 1389, 1399 (2002); see also Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 612 (1973). This more liberal test of a statute's facial validity undertheFirst Amendment stems from the recognition that where a statute's reach contemplates a number of both constitutional and unconstitutional applications, the law's sanctionsmay deter individuals from challenging the law's validity by engaging in constitutionally protected speech that may nonetheless be proscribed by the law. Without anoverbreadth doctrine, ""the contours of regulation would have to be hammered outcase by caseand tested only by those hardy enough to risk criminal prosecution to determine theproperscope of regulation."" Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 487 (1965); see also Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491, 503 (1985) (""[A]n individual  104   whoseown speech or expressive conduct may validly be prohibited or sanctioned is permittedto challenge a statute on its face because it also threatens others not beforethe courtthose who desire to engage in legally protected expression but who may refrain from doing so rather than risk prosecution or undertake to have the law declared partially invalid.""). Plaintiffs argue that the overbreadth doctrine is applicable here, since CIPA ""threatensto chill free speech  because it will censor a substantial amount of protected speech,because it is vague, and because the law creates a prior restraint . . . ."" Unlike the statutestypically challenged as facially overbroad, however, CIPA does not impose criminalpenalties on those who violate its conditions. Cf. Freedom of Speech Coalition, 122S.Ct.at 1398 (""With these severe penalties in force, few legitimate movie producers orbookpublishers, or few other speakers in any capacity, would risk distributing images inornearthe uncertain reach of this law.""). Thus, the rationale for permitting facial challenges to laws that may be constitutionally applied in some instances is less compelling in cases such as this, which involve challenges to Congress's exercise of the spendingpower, than in challenges to criminal statutes. Nonetheless, ""even minor punishments can chill protected speech,"" id., and absent theability to challenge CIPA on itsface, public libraries that depend on federal funds may decide to comply with CIPA's terms, thereby denying patrons access to substantial amountsof constitutionally protected speech, rather than refusing to comply with CIPA's  105   termsandconsequently losing the benefits of federal funds. See 47 C.F.R.  54.520(e)(1) (""Aschoolor library that knowingly fails to ensure the use of computers in accordance withthecertifications required by this section, must reimburse any funds and discounts receivedunder the federal universal support service support mechanism for schools and librariesfor the period in which there was noncompliance.""). Even in cases where the only penalty for failure to comply with a statute is the withholding of federal funds, the Courthassustained facial challenges to Congress's exercise of the spending power. See, e.g., LegalServs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533 (2001) (declaring unconstitutional on itsfaceafederal statute restricting the ability of legal services providers who receive federalfunds to engage in activity protected by the First Amendment). The Court's unconstitutional conditions cases, such as Velazquez, are not strictly controlling, since they do not require a showing that recipients who comply with the conditions attached to federal funding will, as state actors, violate others' constitutional rights,asis the case under the fourth prong of Dole. However, they are highly instructive. The Supreme Court's pronouncements in the unconstitutional conditions cases on whatisnecessary for a plaintiff to mount a successful First Amendment facial challenge toanexercise of Congress's spending power have not produced a seamless web. For example,in Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991), the Court rejected a First Amendment facialchallenge to federal regulations prohibiting federally funded healthcare clinics from  106   providingcounseling concerning the use of abortion as a method of family planning, explaining that: Petitioners are challenging the facial validity of the regulations. Thus, we areconcerned only with the question whether, on their face, the regulations areboth authorized by the Act and can be construed in such a manner that they can be applied to a set of individuals without infringing upon constitutionally protected rights. Petitioners face a heavy burden in seeking tohave the regulations invalidated as facially unconstitutional. . . . The fact thatthe regulations might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render them wholly invalid. Id. at183(internal quotation marks, alterations, and citation omitted). In contrast, NEA v. Finley,524 U.S. 569 (1998), which also involved a facial First Amendment challenge to anexercise of Congress's spending power, articulated a somewhat more liberal test of facialvalidity than Rust, explaining that ""[t]o prevail, respondents must demonstrate a substantialrisk that application of the provision will lead to the suppression of speech."" Id. at580. Against this background, it is unclear to us whether, to succeed in facially invalidating CIPA on the grounds that it will ""induce the States to engage in activities that wouldthemselves be unconstitutional,"" Dole, 483 U.S. at 210, plaintiffs must show that it isimpossible for public libraries to comply with CIPA's conditions without violating the FirstAmendment, or rather simply that CIPA will effectively restrict library patrons' accesstosubstantial amounts of constitutionally protected speech, therefore causing many librariestoviolate the First Amendment. However, we need not resolve this issue.  107   Rather,we may assume without deciding, for purposes of this case, that a facial challenge toCIPArequires plaintiffs to show that any public library that complies with CIPA's conditionswill necessarily violate the First Amendment and, as explained in detail below, webelievethat CIPA's constitutionality fails even under this more restrictive test of facialvalidity urged on us by the government. Because of the inherent limitations in filteringtechnology, public libraries can never comply with CIPA without blocking accesstoasubstantial amount of speech that is both constitutionally protected and fails to meeteventhe filtering companies' own blocking criteria. We turn first to the governing legalprinciples to be applied to thefacts in order to determine whether the First Amendment permits a library to use the filtering technology mandated by CIPA. IV. Level of Scrutiny Applicable to Content-based Restrictions on Internet Access in Public Libraries Inanalyzing the constitutionality of a public library's use of Internet filtering software,we must first identify the appropriate level of scrutiny to apply to this restriction onpatrons' access to speech. While plaintiffs argue that a public library's use of such filtersissubject to strict scrutiny, the government maintains that the applicable standard is rationalbasis review. If strict scrutiny applies, the government must show that the challengedrestriction on speech is narrowly tailored to promote a compelling government interestand that no less restrictive alternative would further that interest. United States v. PlayboyEntm't Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000). In contrast, under rational basis review,the challenged restriction need only be reasonable; the government interest that 108   therestriction serves need not be compelling; the restriction need not be narrowly tailored toservethat interest; and the restriction ""need not be the most reasonable or the only reasonablelimitation."" Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 808 (1985). Software filters, by definition, block access to speech on the basis of its content, andcontent-based restrictions on speech are generally subject to strict scrutiny. See Playboy,529 U.S. at 813 (""[A] content-based speech restriction . . . can stand only if it satisfiesstrict scrutiny.""). Strict scrutiny does not necessarily apply to content-based restrictions on speech, however, where the restrictions apply only to speech on government property, such as public libraries. ""[I]t is . . . well settled that the government neednotpermit all forms of speechon property that it owns and controls."" Int'l Soc'y for KrishnaConsciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 678 (1992). We perforce turn to a discussionof public forum doctrine. A. O verview of Public Forum Doctrine The government's power to restrict speech on its own property is not unlimited. Rather,under public forum doctrine, the extent to which the First Amendment permits the government to restrict speech on its own property depends on the character of the forum thatthegovernment has created. See Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, Inc., 473U.S.788 (1985). Thus, the First Amendment affords greater deference to restrictions onspeechin those areas consideredless amenable to free expression, such as military  109   bases, see Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S.828 (1976), jail grounds, see Adderley v. Florida, 385 U.S.39(1966), or public airport terminals, see Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc.v.Lee, 505 U.S. 672 (1992), than to restrictions on speech in state universities, see Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819 (1995), or streets,  sidewalks and public parks, see Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474 (1988); Hague v. CIO, 307 U.S. 496 (1939). The Supreme Court has identified three types of fora for purposes of identifying the level of First Amendment scrutiny applicable to content-based restrictions on speech on government property: traditional public fora, designated public fora, and nonpublic fora. Traditional public fora include sidewalks, squares, and public parks: [S]treets and parks . . . have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions. Such use of the streets and public places has, from ancient times, been a part of the privileges, immunities, rights, and liberties of citizens. Hague, 307 U.S. at 515. ""In these quintessential public forums, . . . [f]or the State to enforce a content-based exclusion it must show that its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end."" Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educs. Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983); see also Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, 505 U.S. at 678 (""[R]egulation of speech on government property that has traditionally been available for public expression is subject to the highest scrutiny.""); Frisby, 487 U.S. at 480 (""[W]e have repeatedly referred to public  110   streets as the archetype of a traditional public forum.""). A second category of fora, known as designated (or limited) public fora, ""consists of public property which the State has opened for use by the public as a place for expressive activity."" Perry, 460 U.S. at 46. Whereas any content-based restriction on the use of traditional public fora is subject to strict scrutiny, the state is generally permitted, as long as it does not discriminate on the basis of viewpoint, to limit a designated public forum to certain speakers or the discussion of certain subjects. See Perry, 460 U.S. at 45 n.7. Once it has defined the limits of a designated public forum, however, ""[r]egulation of such property is subject to the same limitations as that governing a traditional public forum."" Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, 505 U.S. at 678. Examples of designated fora include university meeting facilities, see Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981), school board meetings, see City of Madison Joint School Dist. v. Wisc. Employment Relations Comm'n, 429 U.S. 167 (1976), and municipal theaters, see Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546 (1975). The third category, nonpublic fora, consists of all remaining public property. ""Limitations on expressive activity conducted on this last category of property must survive only a much more limited review. The challenged regulation need only be reasonable, as long as the regulation is not an effort to suppress the speaker's activity due to disagreement with the speaker's view."" Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, 505 U.S. at 679.  111   B. Contours of the Relevant Forum: the Library's Collection as a Whole or the Provision of Internet Access? To apply public forum doctrine to this case, we must first determine whether the appropriate forum for analysis is the library's collection as a whole, which includes both print and electronic resources, or the library's provision of Internet access. Where a plaintiff seeks limited access, for expressive purposes, to governmentally controlled property, the Supreme Court has held that the relevant forum is defined not by the physical limits of the government property at issue, but rather by the specific access that the plaintiff seeks: Although . . . as an initial matter a speaker must seek access to public property or to private property dedicated to public use to evoke First Amendment concerns, forum analysis is not completed merely by identifying the government property at issue. Rather, in defining the forum we have focused on the access sought by the speaker. When speakers seek general access to public property, the forum encompasses that property. In cases in which limited access is sought, our cases have taken a more tailored approach to ascertaining the perimeters of a forum within the confines of the government property. Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 801 (1985). Thus, in Cornelius, where the plaintiffs were legal defense and political advocacy groups seeking to participate in the Combined Federal Campaign charity drive, the Court held that the relevant forum, for First Amendment purposes, was not the entire federal workplace, but rather the charity drive itself. Id. at 801. Similarly, in Perry Education Association v. Perry Local Educators' Association, 460 U.S. 37 (1983), which addressed a union's right to access a public school's internal mail system and teachers' mailboxes, 112   the Court identified the relevant forum as the school's mail system, not the public school as a whole. In Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981), in which a student group challenged a state university's restrictions on use of its meeting facilities, the Court identified the relevant forum as the meeting facilities to which the plaintiffs sought access, not the state university generally. And in Christ's Bride Ministries, Inc. v. SEPTA, 148 F.3d 242 (3d Cir. 1998), involving a First Amendment challenge to the removal of advertisements from subway and commuter rail stations, the Third Circuit noted that the forum at issue was not the rail and subway stations as a whole, but rather the advertising space within the stations. Id. at 248. Although these cases dealt with the problem of identifying the relevant forum where speakers are claiming a right of access, we believe that the same approach applies to identifying the relevant forum where the parties seeking access are listeners or readers. In this case, the patron plaintiffs are not asserting a First Amendment right to compel public libraries to acquire certain books or magazines for their print collections. Nor are the Web site plaintiffs claiming a First Amendment right to compel public libraries to carry print materials that they publish. Rather, the right at issue in this case is the specific right of library patrons to access information on the Internet, and the specific right of Web publishers to provide library patrons with information via the Internet. Thus, the relevant forum for analysis is not the library's entire collection, which includes both print and electronic media, such as the Internet, but rather the specific forum created  113   when the library provides its patrons with Internet access. Although a public library's provision of Internet access does not resemble the conventional notion of a forum as a well-defined physical space, the same First Amendment standards apply. See Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 830 (1995) (holding that a state university's student activities fund ""is a forum more in a metaphysical than a spatial or geographic sense, but the same principles are applicable""); see also Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 801 (identifying the Combined Federal Campaign charity drive as the relevant unit of analysis for application of public forum doctrine). C. Content-based Restrictions in Designated Public Fora Unlike nonpublic fora such as airport terminals, see Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672 (1992), military bases, see Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828 (1976), jail grounds, see Adderley v. Florida, 385 U.S. 39 (1966), the federal workplace, see Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 805 (1985), and public transit vehicles, see Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298 (1974), the purpose of a public library in general, and the provision of Internet access within a public library in particular, is ""for use by the public . . . for expressive activity,"" Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educs. Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983), namely, the dissemination and receipt by the public of a wide range of information. We are satisfied that when the government provides Internet access in a public library, it has created a  114   designated public forum. See Mainstream Loudoun v. Bd. of Trustees of the Loudoun County Library, 24 F. Supp. 2d 552, 563 (E.D. Va. 1998); cf. Kreimer v. Bureau of Police, 958 F.2d 1242, 1259 (3d Cir. 1992) (holding that a public library is a limited public forum). Relying on those cases that have recognized that government has leeway, under the First Amendment, to limit use of a designated public forum to narrowly specified purposes, and that content-based restrictions on speech that are consistent with those purposes are subject only to rational basis review, the government argues for application of rational basis review to public libraries' decisions about which content to make available to their patrons via the Internet. See Rosenberger, 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995) (""The necessities of confining a forum to the limited and legitimate purposes for which it was created may justify the State in reserving it for certain groups or for the discussion of certain topics.""); Perry, 460 U.S. at 46 n.7 (1983) (""A public forum may be created for a limited purpose such as use by certain groups . . . or for the discussion of certain subjects.""). In particular, the government forcefully argues that a public library's decision to limit the content of its digital offerings on the Internet should be subject to no stricter scrutiny than its decisions about what content to make available to its patrons through the library's print collection. According to the government, just as a public library may choose to acquire books about gardening but not golf, without having to show that this  115   content-based restriction on patrons' access to speech is narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest, so may a public library make content-based decisions about which speech to make available on the Internet, without having to show that such a restriction satisfies strict scrutiny. Plaintiffs respond that the government's ability to restrict the content of speech in a designated public forum by restricting the purpose of the designated public forum that it creates is not unlimited. Cf. Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 547 (2001) (""Congress cannot recast a condition on funding as a mere definition of its program in every case, lest the First Amendment be reduced to a simple semantic exercise.""). As Justice Kennedy has explained: If Government has a freer hand to draw content-based distinctions in limiting a forum than in excluding someone from it, the First Amendment would be a dead letter in designated public forums; every exclusion could be recast as a limitation. . . . The power to limit or redefine forums for a specific legitimate purpose does not allow the government to exclude certain speech or speakers from them for any reason at all. Denver Area Telecomm. Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U.S. 727, 801 (1996) (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment). Although we agree with plaintiffs that the First Amendment imposes some limits on the state's ability to adopt content-based restrictions in defining the purpose of a public forum, precisely what those limits are is unclear, and presents a difficult problem in First Amendment jurisprudence. The Supreme Court's ""cases have not yet determined . . . that government's decision to dedicate a public forum to one type of content or 116   another is necessarily subject to the highest level of scrutiny. Must a local government, for example, show a compelling state interest if it builds a band shell in the park and dedicates it solely to classical music (but not to jazz)? The answer is not obvious."" Denver, 518 U.S. at 750 (plurality opinion); see also Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546, 572-73 (1975) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (""May an opera house limit its productions to operas, or must it also show rock musicals? May a municipal theater devote an entire season to Shakespeare, or is it required to book any potential producer on a first come, first served basis?""). We believe, however, that certain principles emerge from the Supreme Court's jurisprudence on this question. In particular, and perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, the more narrow the range of speech that the government chooses to subsidize (whether directly, through government grants or other funding, or indirectly, through the creation of a public forum) the more deference the First Amendment accords the government in drawing content-based distinctions. At one extreme lies the government's decision to fund a particular message that the government seeks to disseminate. In this context, content-based restrictions on the speech that government chooses to subsidize are clearly subject to at most rational basis review, and even viewpoint discrimination is permissible. For example, ""[w]hen Congress established a National Endowment for Democracy to encourage other countries to adopt democratic principles, 22 U.S.C.  4411(b), it was not constitutionally required  117   to fund a program to encourage competing lines of political philosophy such as communism and fascism."" Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 194 (1991); see also Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 541 (""[V]iewpoint-based funding decisions can be sustained in instances in which the government is itself the speaker, or in instances, like Rust, in which the government used private speakers to transmit information pertaining to its own program."") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although not strictly controlling, the Supreme Court's unconstitutional conditions cases, such as Rust and Velazquez, are instructive for purposes of analyzing contentbased restrictions on the use of public fora. This is because the limitations that government places on the use of a public forum can be conceptualized as conditions that the government attaches to the receipt of a benefit that it offers, namely, the use of government property. Public forum cases thus resemble those unconstitutional conditions cases involving First Amendment challenges to the conditions that the state places on the receipt of a government benefit. See Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 544 (""As this suit involves a subsidy, limited forum cases . . . may not be controlling in the strict sense, yet they do provide some instruction.""). Even when the government does not fund the dissemination of a particular government message, the First Amendment generally permits government, subject to the constraints of viewpoint neutrality, to create public institutions such as art museums and state universities, dedicated to facilitating the dissemination of private speech that the  118   government believes to have particular merit. Thus, in NEA v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569 (1998), the Court upheld the use of content-based restrictions in a federal program awarding grants to artists on the basis of, inter alia, artistic excellence. ""The very assumption of the NEA is that grants will be awarded according to the artistic worth of competing applications, and absolute neutrality is simply inconceivable."" Id. at 585 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Similarly, as Justice Stevens explained in his concurring opinion in Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981), the First Amendment does not necessarily subject to strict scrutiny a state university's use of content-based means of allocating scarce resources, including limited public fora such as its meeting facilities: Because every university's resources are limited, an educational institution must routinely make decisions concerning the use of the time and space that is available for extracurricular activities. In my judgment, it is both necessary and appropriate for those decisions to evaluate the content of a proposed student activity. I should think it obvious, for example, that if two groups of 25 students requested the use of a room at a particular time  one to view Mickey Mouse cartoons and the other to rehearse an amateur performance of Hamlet  the First Amendment would not require that the room be reserved for the group that submitted its application first. Nor do I see why a university should have to establish a ""compelling state interest"" to defend its decision to permit one group to use the facility and not the other. Id. at 278 (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment).2 22 2  Indeed, if the First Amendment subjected to strict scrutiny the government's decisionto dedicate a forum to speech whose content the government judges to be particularly valuable, many of our public institutions of culture would cease to exist in theircurrent form: 119   The more broadly the government facilitates private speech, however, the less deference the First Amendment accords to the government's content-based restrictions on the speech that it facilitates. Thus, where the government creates a designated public forum to facilitate private speech representing a diverse range of viewpoints, the government's decision selectively to single out particular viewpoints for exclusion is subject to strict scrutiny. Compare Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 834 (applying heightened First Amendment scrutiny to viewpoint-based restrictions on the use of a limited public forum where the government ""does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers""), with Finley, 524 U.S. at 586 (""In the context of arts funding, in contrast to many other subsidies, the Government does not indiscriminately encourage a diversity of From here on out, the National Gallery in Washington, D.C., for example, would be required to display the art of all would-be artists on a first-comefirst-served basis and wouldnot be able to exercise any content control over itscollection through evaluations of quality. Such a conclusion, of course, strikes us as absurd, but thatis only because we feel that the government should be free to establish public cultural institutions guided by standards such as ""quality."" ... While the First Amendment articulates a deep fear of government intervention in the marketplace of ideas (because of the risk of distortion), it also seems prepared to permit state-sponsored and -supported cultural institutions that exercise considerable control over which art to fund, which pictures to hang, and which courses to teach. That these choices necessarily involve judgments about favored and disfavored content  judgments clearly prohibited in the realm of censorship  is indisputable. LeeC.Bollinger, Public Institutions of Culture and the First Amendment: The New Frontier,63 U. Cin. L. Rev. 1103, 1110-15 (1995). 120   views from private speakers."") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Similarly, although the government may create a designated public forum limited to speech on a particular topic, if the government opens the forum to members of the general public to speak on that topic while selectively singling out for exclusion particular speakers on the basis of the content of their speech, that restriction is subject to strict scrutiny. For instance, in City of Madison Joint School District No. 8 v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, 429 U.S. 167 (1976), the Court held that where a school board opens its meetings for public participation, it may not, consistent with the First Amendment, prohibit teachers other than union representatives from speaking on the subject of pending collective-bargaining negotiations. See id. at 175 (noting that the state ""has opened a forum for direct citizen involvement""); see also Ark. Educ. Television Comm'n v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666, 680 (1998) (distinguishing, for purposes of determining the appropriate level of First Amendment scrutiny, a televised debate in which a public broadcasting station exercises editorial discretion in selecting participating candidates from a debate that has ""an open-microphone format""). Finally, content-based restrictions on speech in a designated public forum are most clearly subject to strict scrutiny when the government opens a forum for virtually unrestricted use by the general public for speech on a virtually unrestricted range of topics, while selectively excluding particular speech whose content it disfavors. Thus, in Conrad, the Court held that a local government violated the First Amendment when it  121   denied a group seeking to perform the rock musical ""Hair"" access to a general-purpose municipal theater open for the public at large to use for performances. See also Denver, 518 U.S. at 802 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment) (suggesting that strict scrutiny would not apply to a local government's decision to ""build[] a band shell in the park and dedicate[] it solely to classical music (but not jazz),"" but would apply to ""the Government's creation of a band shell in which all types of music might be performed except for rap music""). Similarly, in FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U.S. 364 (1984), the Court subjected to heightened scrutiny a federal program that funded a wide range of public broadcasting stations that disseminated speech on a wide range of subjects, where the federal program singled out for exclusion speech whose content amounted to editorializing. As the Court later explained: In FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U.S. 364 (1984) the Court was instructed by its understanding of the dynamics of the broadcast industry in holding that prohibitions against editorializing by public radio networks were an impermissible restriction, even though the Government enacted the restriction to control the use of public funds. The First Amendment forbade the Government from using the forum in an unconventional way to suppress speech inherent in the nature of the medium. Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 543. In sum, the more widely the state opens a forum for members of the public to speak on a variety of subjects and viewpoints, the more vulnerable is the state's decision selectively to exclude certain speech on the basis of its disfavored content, as such  122   exclusions distort the marketplace of ideas that the state has created in establishing the forum. Cf. Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 544 (""Restricting LSC attorneys in advising their clients and in presenting arguments and analyses to the courts distorts the legal system by altering the traditional role of the attorneys in much the same way broadcast systems or student publication networks were changed in the limited forum cases . . . .""). Thus, we believe that where the state designates a forum for expressive activity and opens the forum for speech by the public at large on a wide range of topics, strict scrutiny applies to restrictions that single out for exclusion from the forum particular speech whose content is disfavored. ""Laws designed or intended to suppress or restrict the expression of specific speakers contradict basic First Amendment principles."" United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 812 (2000); see also Denver, 518 U.S. at 782 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment) (noting the flaw in a law that ""singles out one sort of speech for vulnerability to private censorship in a context where content-based discrimination is not otherwise permitted""). Compare Forbes, 523 U.S. at 679 (holding that the state does not create a public forum when it ""allows selective access for individual speakers rather than general access for a class of speakers"") (emphasis added), with Police Dep't of the City of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 96 (1972) (""Selective exclusions from a public forum may not be based on content alone, and may not be justified by reference to content alone."") (emphasis added). We note further that to the extent that the government creates a public forum  123   expressly designed to facilitate the dissemination of private speech, opens the forum to any member of the public to speak on any virtually any topic, and then selectively targets certain speech for exclusion based on its content, the government is singling out speech in a manner that resembles the discriminatory taxes on the press that the Supreme Court subjected to heightened First Amendment scrutiny in Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221 (1987), and Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue, 460 U.S. 575 (1983), which we explain in the margin.2 D. Reasons for Applying Strict Scrutiny 1. Selective Exclusion From a ""Vast Democratic Forum"" Applying these principles to public libraries, we agree with the government that generally the First Amendment subjects libraries' content-based decisions about which print materials to acquire for their collections to only rational review. In making these decisions, public libraries are generally free to adopt collection development criteria that Inboth of these cases, the taxation scheme at issue effectively subsidized a vast rangeof publications, and singled out for penalty only a handful of speakers. See Arkansas Writers' Project, 460U.S. at 228-29 (noting that ""selective taxation of the press... [by] targeting individual members of the press  poses a particular danger of abuseby the State"" and explaining that ""this case involves a more disturbing use of selectivetaxation than MinneapolisStar, because the basis on which Arkansas differentiates between magazines isparticularly repugnant to First Amendment principles: amagazine's tax status depends entirely on its content""); Minneapolis Star, 460 U.S.at 591(""Minnesota's ink and paper tax violates the First Amendment not only because it singlesoutthe press, but also because it targets a small group of newspapers.""); see also TurnerBroad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 660 (1994) (""The taxes invalidated in Minneapolis Star and Arkansas Writers' Project . . . targeted a small number of speakers, andthusthreatened to distort the market for ideas."") (internal quotation marks and citationomitted). 124 23 3   reflect not simply patrons' demand for certain material, but also the library's evaluation of the material's quality. See Bernard W. Bell, Filth, Filtering, and the First Amendment: Ruminations on Public Libraries' Use of Internet Filtering Software, 53 Fed. Comm. L.J. 191, 225 (2001) (""Librarians should have the discretion to decide that the library is committed to intellectual inquiry, not to the satisfaction of the full range of human desires.""). Thus, a public library's decision to use the last $100 of its budget to purchase the complete works of Shakespeare even though more of its patrons would prefer the library to use the same amount to purchase the complete works of John Grisham, is not, in our view, subject to strict scrutiny. Cf. NEA v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569 (1998) (subjecting only to rational basis review the government's decision to award NEA grants on the basis of, inter alia, artistic excellence). Nonetheless, we disagree with the government's argument that public libraries' use of Internet filters is no different, for First Amendment purposes, from the editorial discretion that they exercise when they choose to acquire certain books on the basis of librarians' evaluation of their quality. The central difference, in our view, is that by providing patrons with even filtered Internet access, the library permits patrons to receive speech on a virtually unlimited number of topics, from a virtually unlimited number of speakers, without attempting to restrict patrons' access to speech that the library, in the exercise of its professional judgment, determines to be particularly valuable. Cf. Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 834 (1995) (applying  125   strict scrutiny to viewpoint-based restrictions where the state ""does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers""). See generally supra Section IV.C. In those cases upholding the government's exercise of editorial discretion in selecting certain speech for subsidization or inclusion in a state-created forum, the state actor exercising the editorial discretion has at least reviewed the content of the speech that the forum facilitates. Thus, in Finley the NEA examined the content of those works of art that it chose to subsidize, and in Arkansas Educational Television Commission v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666 (1998), the public broadcaster specifically reviewed and approved each speaker permitted to participate in the debate. See id. at 673 (""In the case of television broadcasting, . . . broad rights of access for outside speakers would be antithetical, as a general rule, to the discretion that stations and their editorial staff must exercise to fulfill their journalistic purpose and statutory obligations.""); Finley, 524 U.S. at 586 (""The NEA's mandate is to make esthetic judgments, and the inherently contentbased `excellence' threshold for NEA support sets it apart from the subsidy at issue in Rosenberger  which was available to all student organizations that were `related to the educational purpose of the University . . . .'"") (quoting Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 824); see also Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 804 (1985) (""The Government's consistent policy has been to limit participation in the [Combined Federal Campaign] to `appropriate' voluntary agencies and to require agencies seeking admission  126   to obtain permission from federal and local Campaign officials. . . . [T]here is no evidence suggesting that the granting of the requisite permission is merely ministerial.""). The essence of editorial discretion requires the exercise of professional judgment in examining the content that the government singles out as speech of particular value. This exercise of editorial discretion is evident in a library's decision to acquire certain books for its collection. As the government's experts in library science testified, in selecting a book for a library's collection, librarians evaluate the book's quality by reference to a variety of criteria such as its accuracy, the title's niche in relation to the rest of thecollection, the authority of the author, the publisher, the work's presentation, and howitcompares with other material available in the same genre or on the same subject.  Thus, the content of every book that a library acquires has been reviewed by the library's collection development staff or someone to whom they have delegated the task, and has been judged to meet the criteria that form the basis for the library's collection development policy. Although some public libraries use ""approval plans"" to delegate the collection development to third-party vendors which provide the library with recommended materials that the library is then free to retain or return to the vendor, the same principle nonetheless attains. In contrast, in providing patrons with even filtered Internet access, a public library invites patrons to access speech whose content has never been reviewed and recommended as particularly valuable by either a librarian or a third party to whom the  127   library has delegated collection development decisions. Although several of the government's librarian witnesses who testified at trial purport to apply the same standards that govern the library's acquisition of print materials to the library's provision of Internet access to patrons, when public libraries provide their patrons with Internet access, they intentionally open their doors to vast amounts of speech that clearly lacks sufficient quality to ever be considered for the library's print collection. Unless a library allows access to only those sites that have been preselected as having particular value, a method that, as noted above, was tried and rejected by the Westerville Ohio Public Library, see supra at 46-47, even a library that uses software filters has opened its Internet collection ""for indiscriminate use by the general public."" Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educs. Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 47 (1983). ""[M]ost Internet forums  including chat rooms, newsgroups, mail exploders, and the Web  are open to all comers."" Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 880 (1997). The fundamental difference between a library's print collection and its provision of Internet access is illustrated by comparing the extent to which the library opens its print collection to members of the public to speak on a given topic and the extent to which it opens its Internet terminals to members of the public to speak on a given topic. When a public library chooses to carry books on a selected topic, e.g. chemistry, it does not open its print collection to any member of the public who wishes to write about chemistry. Rather, out of the myriad of books that have ever been written on chemistry,  128   each book on chemistry that the library carries has been reviewed and selected because the person reviewing the book, in the exercise of his or her professional judgment, has deemed its content to be particularly valuable. In contrast, when a public library provides Internet access, even filtered Internet access, it has created a forum open to any member of the public who writes about chemistry on the Internet, regardless of how unscientific the author's methods or of how patently false the author's conclusions are, regardless of the author's reputation or grammar, and regardless of the reviews of the scientific community. Notwithstanding protestations in CIPA's legislative history to the contrary,2 4  members of the general public do define the content that public libraries make available to their patrons through the Internet. Any member of the public with Internet access could, through the free Web hosting services available on the Internet, tonight jot down a few musings on any subject under the sun, and tomorrow those musings would become part of public libraries' online offerings and be available to any library patron who seeks them out.  24  [P]atrons at a library do nothave the right to make editorial decisions regarding the availability of certain material. It is the exclusive authority of thelibrary to make affirmative decisions regarding what books, magazines, orother material is placed on library shelves, or otherwise made available to patrons. Libraries impose many restrictions on the use of their systems which demonstrate that the content of the library's offerings are not determined by the general public.  S.Rep.No. 106-141, at 8-9 (1999). 129   In providing its patrons with Internet access, a public library creates a forum for the facilitation of speech, almost none of which either the library's collection development staff or even the filtering companies have ever reviewed. Although filtering companies review a portion of the Web in classifying particular sites, the portion of the Web that the filtering companies actually review is quite small in relation to the Web as a whole. The filtering companies' harvesting process, described in our findings of fact, is intended to identify only a small fraction of Web sites for the filtering companies to review. Put simply, the state cannot be said to be exercising editorial discretion permitted under the First Amendment when it indiscriminately facilitates private speech whose content it makes no effort to examine. Cf. Bell, supra, at 226 (""[C]ourts should take a much more jaundiced view of library policies that block Internet access to a very limited array of subjects than they take of library policies that reserve Internet terminals for very limited use.""). While the First Amendment permits the government to exercise editorial discretion in singling out particularly favored speech for subsidization or inclusion in a state-created forum, we believe that where the state provides access to a ""vast democratic forum[],"" Reno, 521 U.S. at 868, open to any member of the public to speak on subjects ""as diverse as human thought,"" id. at 870, and then selectively excludes from the forum certain speech on the basis of its content, such exclusions are subject to strict scrutiny. These exclusions risk fundamentally distorting the unique marketplace of ideas that  130   public libraries create when they open their collections, via the Internet, to the speech of millions of individuals around the world on a virtually limitless number of subjects.2 A public library's content-based restrictions on patrons' Internet access thus resemble the content-based restrictions on speech subsidized by the government, whether through direct funding or through the creation of a designated public forum, that the Supreme Court has subjected to strict scrutiny, as discussed above in Section IV.C. Although the government may subsidize a particular message representing the Indistinguishing restrictions on public libraries' print collections from restrictions ontheprovision of Internet access, we do not rely on the rationale adopted in Mainstream Loudounv. Board of Trustees of the Loudoun County Library, 2 F. Supp. 2d 783 (E.D. Va.1998). The Loudoun Court reasoned that a library's decision to block certain Web sitesfundamentally differs from itsdecision to carry certain books but not others, in that unlikethemoney and shelf space consumed by the library's provision of print materials, ""noappreciable expenditure of library time or resources is required to make a particular Internetpublication available"" once the library has acquired Internet access. Id. at 79394. Wedisagree. Nearly every librarian who testified at trial stated that patrons' demandfor Internet access exceeds the library's supply of Internet terminals. Undersuch circumstances, every time library patrons visit a Web site, they deny other patrons waiting tousetheterminal access to other Web sites. Just as the scarcity of a library's budget and shelf space constrains a library's ability to provide its patrons with unrestricted access to printmaterials, the scarcity of time at Internet terminals constrains libraries' ability to providepatrons with unrestricted Internet access: The same budget concerns constraining the number of books that libraries can offer also limits the number of terminals, Internet accounts, and speed of access links that can be purchased, and thus the number of Web pages thatpatrons can view. This is clear to anyone who has been denied access toa Website because no terminal was unoccupied. MarkS.Nadel, The First Amendment's Limitations on the Use of Internet Filtering in PublicandSchool Libraries: What Content Can Libraries Exclude?, 78 Tex. L. Rev. 1117,1128 (2000). 131 25 5   government's viewpoint without having to satisfy strict scrutiny, see Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991), strict scrutiny applies to restrictions that selectively exclude particular viewpoints from a public forum designed to facilitate a wide range of viewpoints, see Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819 (1995). Similarly, although the state's exercise of editorial discretion in selecting particular speakers for participation in a state-sponsored forum is subject to rational basis review, see Ark. Educ. Television Comm'n v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666 (1998), selective exclusions of particular speakers from a forum otherwise open to any member of the public to speak are subject to strict scrutiny, see City of Madison Joint School Dist. No. 8 v. Wis. Employment Relations Comm'n, 429 U.S. 167 (1976). And while the government may, subject only to rational basis review, make content-based decisions in selecting works of artistic excellence to subsidize, see NEA v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569 (1998), the Supreme Court has applied heightened scrutiny where the government opens a general-purpose municipal theater for use by the public, but selectively excludes disfavored content, see Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546 (1975), where the government facilitates the speech of public broadcasters on a virtually limitless number of topics, but prohibits editorializing, see FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U.S. 364 (1984), and where the government funds a wide range of legal services but restricts funding recipients from challenging welfare laws, see Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533 (2001). Similarly, where a public library  132   opens a forum to an unlimited number of speakers around the world to speak on an unlimited number of topics, strict scrutiny applies to the library's selective exclusions of particular speech whose content the library disfavors. 2. Analogy to Traditional Public Fora Application of strict scrutiny to public libraries' use of software filters, in our view, finds further support in the extent to which public libraries' provision of Internet access promotes First Amendment values in an analogous manner to traditional public fora, such as sidewalks and parks, in which content-based restrictions on speech are always subject to strict scrutiny. The public library, by its very nature, is ""designed for freewheeling inquiry."" Bd. of Education v. Pico, 457 U.S. 853, 915 (1982) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). As such, the library is a ""mighty resource in the free marketplace of ideas,"" Minarcini v. Strongsville City Sch. Dist., 541 F.2d 577, 582 (6th Cir. 1976), and represents a ""quintessential locus of the receipt of information."" Kreimer v. Bureau of Police for Morristown, 958 F.2d 1242, 1255 (3d Cir. 1992); see also Sund v. City of Wichita Falls, 121 F. Supp. 2d 530, 547 (N.D. Tex. 2000) (""The right to receive information is vigorously enforced in the context of a public library . . . .""); cf. Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 681 (1992) (""[A] traditional public forum is property that has as `a principal purpose . . . the free exchange of ideas.'"") (quoting Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 800 (1985)). We acknowledge that the provision of Internet access in a public library does not  133   enjoy the historical pedigree of streets, sidewalks, and parks as a vehicle of free expression. Nonetheless, we believe that it shares many of the characteristics of these traditional public fora that uniquely promote First Amendment values and accordingly warrant application of strict scrutiny to any content-based restriction on speech in these fora. Regulation of speech in streets, sidewalks, and parks is subject to the highest scrutiny not simply by virtue of history and tradition, but also because the speechfacilitating character of sidewalks and parks makes them distinctly deserving of First Amendment protection. Many of these same speech-promoting features of the traditional public forum appear in public libraries' provision of Internet access. First, public libraries, like sidewalks and parks, are generally open to any member of the public who wishes to receive the speech that these fora facilitate, subject only to narrow limitations. See Kreimer, 958 F.2d at 1260 (noting that a public library does not retainunfettered discretion ""to choose whom it will permit to enter the Library,"" but upholdingthe library's right to exclude patrons who harass patrons or whose offensive personalhygiene precludes the library's use by other patrons). Moreover, like traditional  public fora, public libraries are funded by taxpayers and therefore do not charge members of the public each time they use the forum. The only direct cost to library patrons who wish to receive information, whether via the Internet or the library's print collection, is the time spent reading. By providing Internet access to millions of Americans to whom such access would  134   otherwise be unavailable, public libraries play a critical role in bridging the digital divide separating those with access to new information technologies from those that lack access. See generally National Telecommunications and Information Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Falling Through the Net: Defining the Digital Divide (1999), available at http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fttn99/contents.html. Cf. Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 546 (invalidating a content-based restriction on the speech of federally funded legal services corporations and noting that given the financial hardship of legal services corporations' clients, ""[t]he restriction on speech is even more problematic because in cases where the attorney withdraws from a representation, the client is unlikely to find other counsel""). Public libraries that provide Internet access greatly expand the educational opportunities for millions of Americans who, as explained in the margin, would otherwise be deprived of the benefits of this new medium.2 6  Just as important as the openness of a forum to listeners is its openness to speakers. Parks and sidewalks are paradigmatic loci of First Amendment values in large part because they permit speakers to communicate with a wide audience at low cost. One can address members of the public in a park for little more than the cost of a soapbox, Wehave found that approximately 14.3 million Americans access the Internet at a publiclibrary, and Internet access at public libraries is more often used by those with lowerincomes than those with higher incomes. We found that about 20.3% of Internet userswithhousehold family income of less than $15,000 per year use public libraries for Internetaccess, and approximately 70% of libraries serving communities with poverty levelsinexcess of 40% receive E-rate discounts. The widespread availability of Internet accessinpublic libraries is due, in part, to the availability of public funding, including stateandlocal funding and the federal funding programs regulated by CIPA. 135 26   and one can distribute handbills on the sidewalk for little more than the cost of a pen, paper, and some photocopies. See Martin v. City of Struthers, 319 U.S. 141, 146 (1943) (""Door to door distribution of circulars is essential to the poorly financed causes of little people.""); Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law  12-24 at 987 (2d ed. 1988) (""The `public forum' doctrine holds that restrictions on speech should be subject to higher scrutiny when, all other things being equal, that speech occurs in areas playing a vital role in communication  such as in those places historically associated with first amendment activities, such as streets, sidewalks, and parks  especially because of how indispensable communication in these places is to people who lack access to more elaborate (and more costly) channels.""); Daniel A. Farber, Free Speech without Romance: Public Choice and the First Amendment, 105 Harv. L. Rev. 554, 574 n.86 (1991) (noting that traditional public fora ""are often the only place where less affluent groups and individuals can effectively express their message""); Harry Kalven, Jr., The Concept of the Public Forum: Cox v. Louisiana, 1965 Sup. Ct. Rev. 1, 30 (""[T]he parade, the picket, the leaflet, the sound truck, have been the media of communication exploited by those with little access to the more genteel means of communication.""). Similarly, given the existence of message boards and free Web hosting services, a speaker can, via the Internet, address the public, including patrons of public libraries, for little more than the cost of Internet access. As the Supreme Court explained in Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844 (1997), ""the Internet can hardly be considered a `scarce' expressive  136   commodity. It provides relatively unlimited, low-cost capacity for communication of all kinds."" Id. at 870. Although the cost of a home computer and Internet access considerably exceeds the cost of a soapbox or a few hundred photocopies, speakers wishing to avail themselves of the Internet may gain free access in schools, workplaces, or the public library. As Professor Lessig has explained: The ""press"" in 1791 was not the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal. It did not comprise large organizations of private interests, with millions of readers associated with each organization. Rather, the press then was much like the Internet today. The cost of a printing press was low, the readership was slight, and anyone (within reason) could become a publisher  and in fact an extraordinary number did. When the Constitution speaks of the rights of the ""press,"" the architecture it has in mind is the architecture of the Internet. Lawrence Lessig, Code 183 (1999). While public libraries' provision of Internet access shares many of the speechpromoting qualities of traditional public fora, it also facilitates speech in ways that traditional public fora cannot.27 In particular, whereas the architecture of real space Weacknowledge that traditional public fora have characteristics that promote First Amendment values in ways that the provision of Internet access in public libraries does not. Forexample, a significant virtue of traditional public fora is their facilitation of faceto-facecommunication. ""In a face-to-face encounter there is a greater opportunity for the exchangeof ideas and the propagation of views . . . ."" Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 798. Faceto-faceexchanges also permit speakers to confront listeners who would otherwise not actively seek out the information that the speaker has to offer. In contrast, the Internet operateslargely by providing individuals with only that information that they actively seekout. Although the Internet does not permit face-to-face communication in the same way thattraditional public fora do, the Internet, as a medium of expression, is significantly more interactive than the broadcast media and the press. ""[T]he Web makes itpossibleto establish two-way linkages with potential sympathizers. Unlike the unidirectional nature of most mass media, websites, bulletin boards, chatrooms, and email 137 27   limits the audience of a pamphleteer or soapbox orator to people within the speaker's immediate vicinity, the Internet renders the geography of speaker and listener irrelevant: Through the use of chat rooms, any person with a phone line can become a town crier with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox. Through the use of Web pages, mail exploders, and newsgroups, the same individual can become a pamphleteer. Reno, 521 U.S. at 870 . By providing patrons with Internet access, public libraries in effect open their doors to an unlimited number of potential speakers around the world, inviting the speech of any member of the public who wishes to communicate with library patrons via the Internet. Due to the low costs for speakers and the irrelevance of geography, the volume of speech available to library patrons on the Internet is enormous and far exceeds the volume of speech available to audiences in traditional public fora. See id. at 868 (referring to ""the vast democratic forums of the Internet""). Indeed, as noted in our findings of fact, the Web is estimated to contain over one billion pages, and is said to be growing at a rate of over 1.5 million pages per day. See id. at 885 (noting ""[t]he dramatic expansion of this new marketplace of ideas""). This staggering volume of content on the Internet ""is as diverse as human thought,"" id. at 870, and ""is thus comparable, from the reader's viewpoint, to . . . a vast library including millions of readily available and indexed publications,"" id. at 853. As a result of the Internet's unique speech-facilitating arepotentially interactive."" Seth F. Kreimer, Technologies of Protest: Insurgent Social Movements and the First Amendment in the Era of the Internet, 150 U. Pa. L. Rev. 119, 130(2001). 138   qualities, ""it is hard to find an aspiring social movement, new or old, of left, right, or center, without a website, a bulletin board, and an email list."" Kreimer, supra n.27, at 125. ""[T]he growth of the Internet has been and continues to be phenomenal."" Reno, 521 U.S. at 885. This extraordinary growth of the Internet illustrates the extent to which the Internet promotes First Amendment values in the same way that the historical use of traditional public fora for speaking, handbilling, and protesting testifies to their effectiveness as vehicles for free speech. Cf. Martin, 319 U.S. at 145 (""The widespread use of this method of communication [door-to-door distribution of leaflets] by many groups espousing various causes attests its major importance.""); Schneider v. State, 308 U.S. 147, 164 (1939) (""[P]amphlets have proved most effective instruments in the dissemination of opinion.""). The provision of Internet access in public libraries, in addition to sharing the speech-enhancing qualities of fora such as streets, sidewalks, and parks, also supplies many of the speech-enhancing properties of the postal service, which is open to the public at large as both speakers and recipients of information, and provides a relatively low-cost means of disseminating information to a geographically dispersed audience. See Lamont v. Postmaster Gen., 381 U.S. 301 (1965) (invalidating a content-based prior restraint on the use of the mails); see also Blount v. Rizzi, 400 U.S. 410 (1971) (same). Indeed, the Supreme Court's description of the postal system in Lamont seems equally  139   apt as a description of the Internet today: ""the postal system . . . is now the main artery through which the business, social, and personal affairs of the people are conducted . . . ."" 381 U.S. at 305 n.3. In short, public libraries, by providing their patrons with access to the Internet, have created a public forum that provides any member of the public free access to information from millions of speakers around the world. The unique speech-enhancing character of Internet use in public libraries derives from the openness of the public library to any member of the public seeking to receive information, and the openness of the Internet to any member of the public who wishes to speak. In particular, speakers on the Internet enjoy low barriers to entry and the ability to reach a mass audience, unhindered by the constraints of geography.28 Moreover, just as the development of new media ""presents unique problems, which inform our assessment of the interests at stake, and which may justify restrictions that would be unacceptable in other contexts,"" United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000), the development of new media, such as the Internet, also presents unique possibilities for promoting First  Weacknowledge that the Internet's architecture is a human creation, and is therefore subjecttochange. The foregoing analysis of the unique speech-enhancing qualities of the Internetislimited to the Internet as currently constructed. Indeed, the characteristics of theInternet that we believe render it uniquely suited to promote First Amendment values may change as the Internet's architecture evolves. See Lawrence Lessig, Reading the Constitution in Cyberspace, 45 Emory L.J. 869, 888 (1996) (""Cyberspace has no permanent nature, save the nature of a place of unlimited plasticity. We don't find cyberspace, we build it.""); see also Lawrence Lessig, The Death of Cyberspace, 57 Wash. &LeeL.Rev. 337 (2000). 140  28   Amendment values, which also inform our assessment of the interests at stake, and which we believe, in the context of the provision of Internet access in public libraries, justify the application of heightened scrutiny to content-based restrictions that might be subject to only rational review in other contexts, such as the development of the library's print collection. Cf. id. at 818 (""Technology expands the capacity to choose; and it denies the potential of this revolution if we assume the Government is best positioned to make these choices for us.""). A faithful translation of First Amendment values from the context of traditional public fora such as sidewalks and parks to the distinctly non-traditional public forum of Internet access in public libraries requires, in our view, that content-based restrictions on Internet access in public libraries be subject to the same exacting standards of First Amendment scrutiny as content-based restrictions on speech in traditional public fora such as sidewalks, town squares, and parks: The architecture of the Internet, as it is right now, is perhaps the most important model of free speech since the founding. . . . Two hundred years after the framers ratified the Constitution, the Net has taught us what the First Amendment means. . . . The model for speech that the framers embraced was the model of the Internet  distributed, noncentralized, fully free and diverse. Lessig, Code, at 167, 185. Indeed, ""[m]inds are not changed in streets and parks as they once were. To an increasing degree, the more significant interchanges of ideas and shaping of public consciousness occur in mass and electronic media."" Denver Area Educ. Telecomms. Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U.S. 727, 802-03 (1996) (Kennedy, J., 141   concurring in the judgment). In providing patrons with even filtered Internet access, a public library is not exercising editorial discretion in selecting only speech of particular quality for inclusion in its collection, as it may do when it decides to acquire print materials. By providing its patrons with Internet access, public libraries create a forum in which any member of the public may receive speech from anyone around the world who wishes to disseminate information over the Internet. Within this ""vast democratic forum[],"" Reno, 521 U.S. at 868, which facilitates speech that is ""as diverse as human thought,"" id. at 870, software filters single out for exclusion particular speech on the basis of its disfavored content. We hold that these content-based restrictions on patrons' access to speech are subject to strict scrutiny. V. Application of Strict Scrutiny Having concluded that strict scrutiny applies to public libraries' content-based restrictions on patrons' access to speech on the Internet, we must next determine whether a public library's use of Internet software filters can survive strict scrutiny. To survive strict scrutiny, a restriction on speech ""must be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling Government interest. If a less restrictive alternative would serve the Government's purpose, the legislature must use that alternative."" United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000) (citation omitted); see also Fabulous Assocs., Inc. v. Pa. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 896 F.2d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 1990)  142   (holding that a content-based burden on speech is permissible ""only if [the government] shows that the restriction serves a compelling interest and that there are no less restrictive alternatives""). The application of strict scrutiny to a public library's use of filtering products thus requires three distinct inquiries. First, we must identify those compelling government interests that the use of filtering software promotes. It is then necessary to analyze whether the use of software filters is narrowly tailored to further those interests. Finally, we must determine whether less restrictive alternatives exist that would promote the state interest. A. State Interests We begin by identifying those legitimate state interests that a public library's use of software filters promotes. 1. Preventing the Dissemination of Obscenity, Child Pornography, and Material Harmful to Minors  On its face, CIPA is clearly intended to prevent public libraries' Internet terminals from being used to disseminate to library patrons visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or in the case of minors, harmful to minors. See CIPA  1712 (codified at 20U.S.C. 9134(f)(1)(A) & (B)),  1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C.  254(h)(6)(B) & (C)) (requiringany library that receives E-rate discounts to certify that it is enforcing ""a policy of Internetsafety that includes the operation of a technology protection measure with respecttoany of its computers withInternet access that protects against access through 143   suchcomputers to visual depictions"" that are ""obscene"" or ""child pornography,"" and, whenthecomputers are in use by minors, also protects against access to visual depictions thatare""harmful to minors""). The government's interest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity, child pornography, or, in the case of minors, material harmful to minors, is well-established. Speechthat is obscene, under the legal definition of obscenity set forth in the margin, is unprotected under the First Amendment, and accordingly the state has a compelling interestinpreventing its distribution.29 See Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 18 (1973) (""ThisCourt has recognized that the States have a legitimate interest in prohibiting dissemination or exhibition of obscene material.""); Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 563 (1969)(""[T]he First and Fourteenth Amendments recognize a valid governmental interest indealingwith the problem of obscenity.""); Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 485 (1957)(""We hold that obscenity is not within the area of constitutionally protected speech of press."").  The First Amendment also permits the state to prohibit the distribution to minors of material that, while not obscene with respect to adults, is obscene with respect to minors. See Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 637 (1968) (holding that it is constitutionally permissible ""to accord minors under 17 a more restricted right than that ForFirst Amendment purposes, obscenity is ""limited to works which, taken as a whole,appeal to the prurient interest in sex, which portray sexual conduct in a patently offensiveway, and which, taken as a whole, do not have serious literary, artistic, political, orscientific value."" Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24 (1973). 144 29   assured to adults to judge and determine for themselves what sex material they may read or see""). Proscribing the distribution of such material to minors is constitutionally justified by the government's well-recognized interest in safeguarding minors' wellbeing. See Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 869-70 (1997) (""[T]here is a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors which extend[s] to shielding them from indecent messages that are not obscene by adult standards . . . ."") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 756-57 (1982) (""It is evident beyond the need for elaboration that a State's interest in safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of a minor is compelling."") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 640 (""The State . . . has an independent interest in the well-being of its youth.""). The government's compelling interest in protecting the well-being of its youth justifies laws that criminalize not only the distribution to minors of material that is harmful to minors, but also the possession and distribution of child pornography. See Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 111 (1990) (holding that a state ""may constitutionally proscribe the possession and viewing of child pornography""); Ferber, 458 U.S. at 757, 763 (noting that ""[t]he prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of children constitutes a government objective of surpassing importance,"" and holding that ""child pornography [is] a category of material outside the protection of the First Amendment"").  145   Thus, a public library's use of software filters survives strict scrutiny if it is narrowly tailored to further the state's well-recognized interest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity and child pornography, and in preventing minors from being exposed to material harmful to their well-being. 2. Protecting the Unwilling Viewer Several of the libraries that use filters assert that filters serve the libraries' interest in preventing patrons from being unwillingly exposed to sexually explicit speech that the patrons find offensive. Nearly every library proffered by either the government or the plaintiffs received complaints, in varying degrees of frequency, from library patrons who saw other patrons accessing sexually explicit material on the library's Internet terminals. In general, First Amendment jurisprudence is reluctant to recognize a legitimate state interest in protecting the unwilling viewer from speech that is constitutionally protected. ""Where the designed benefit of a content-based speech restriction is to shield the sensibilities of listeners, the general rule is that the right of expression prevails, even where no less restrictive alternative exists. We are expected to protect our own sensibilities simply by averting our eyes."" Playboy, 529 U.S. at 813 (2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 209 (1975) (""[W]hen the government, acting as censor, undertakes selectively to shield the public from some kinds of speech on the ground that they are more offensive than others, the First Amendment strictly limits its power."").  146   For example, in Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971), the Supreme Court reversed defendant's conviction for wearing, in a municipal courthouse, a jacket bearing the inscription ""Fuck the Draft."" The Court noted that ""much has been made of the claim that Cohen's distasteful mode of expression was thrust upon unwilling or unsuspecting viewers, and that the State might therefore legitimately act as it did in order to protect the sensitive from otherwise unavoidable exposure to appellant's crude form of protest."" Id. at 21. This justification for suppressing speech failed, however, because it ""would effectively empower a majority to silence dissidents simply as a matter of personal predilections."" Id. The Court concluded that ""[t]hose in the Los Angeles courthouse could effectively avoid further bombardment of their sensibilities simply by averting their eyes."" Id. Similarly, in Erznoznik, the Court invalidated on its face a municipal ordinance prohibiting drive-in movie theaters from showing films containing nudity if they were visible from a public street or place. The city's ""primary argument [was] that it may protect its citizens against unwilling exposure to materials that may be offensive."" 422 U.S. at 208. The Court soundly rejected this interest in shielding the unwilling viewer: The plain, if at times disquieting, truth is that in our pluralistic society, constantly proliferating new and ingenious forms of expression, we are inescapably captive audiences for many purposes. Much that we encounter offends our esthetic, if not our political and moral, sensibilities. Nevertheless, the Constitution does not permit government to decide which types of otherwise protected speech are sufficiently offensive to require protection for the unwilling listener or viewer. Rather, absent . . . narrow circumstances . . . the burden normally falls upon the viewer to avoid 147   further bombardment of his sensibilities simply by averting his eyes. 422 U.S. at 210-11 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The state's interest in protecting unwilling viewers from exposure to patently offensive material is accounted for, to some degree, by obscenity doctrine, which originated in part to permit the state to shield the unwilling viewer. ""The Miller standard, like its predecessors, was an accommodation between the State's interests in protecting the sensibilities of unwilling recipients from exposure to pornographic material and the dangers of censorship inherent in unabashedly content-based laws."" Ferber, 458 U.S. at 756 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Miller, 413 U.S. at 18-19 (""This Court has recognized that the States have a legitimate interest in prohibiting dissemination or exhibition of obscene material when the mode of dissemination carries with it a significant danger of offending the sensibilities of unwilling recipients or of exposure to juveniles."") (citation omitted). To the extent that speech has serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value, and therefore is not obscene under the Miller test of obscenity, the state's interest in shielding unwilling viewers from such speech is tenuous. Nonetheless, the Court has recognized that in certain limited circumstances, the state has a legitimate interest in protecting the public from unwilling exposure to speech that is not obscene. This interest has justified restrictions on speech ""when the speaker intrudes on the privacy of the home, or the degree of captivity makes it impractical for  148   the unwilling viewer or auditor to avoid exposure."" Erznoznik 422 U.S. at 209 (citations , omitted). Thus, in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978), the Court relied on the state's interest in shielding viewers' sensibilities to uphold a prohibition against profanity in radio broadcasts: Patently offensive, indecent material presented over the airwaves confronts the citizen, not only in public, but also in the privacy of the home, where the individual's right to be left alone plainly outweighs the First Amendment rights of an intruder. Because the broadcast audience is constantly tuning in and out, prior warnings cannot completely protect the listener or viewer from unexpected program content. Id. at 748 (citation omitted); accord Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 485 (1988) (""Although in many locations, we expect individuals simply to avoid speech they do not want to hear, the home is different.""); see also Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298, 302 (1974) (plurality opinion) (upholding a content-based restriction on the sale of advertising space in public transit vehicles and noting that ""[t]he streetcar audience is a captive audience""). Although neither the Supreme Court nor the Third Circuit has recognized a compelling state interest in shielding the sensibilities of unwilling viewers, beyond laws intended to preserve the privacy of individuals' homes or to protect captive audiences, we do not read the case law as categorically foreclosing recognition, in the public library setting, of the state's interest in protecting unwilling viewers. See Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 749 n.27 (""Outside the home, the balance between the offensive speaker and the unwilling audience may sometimes tip in favor of the speaker, requiring the offended 149   listener to turn away."") (emphasis added). Under certain circumstances, therefore a public library might have a compelling interest in protecting library patrons and staff from unwilling exposure to sexually explicit speech that, although not obscene, is patently offensive. 3. Preventing Unlawful or Inappropriate Conduct Several of the librarians proffered by the government testified that unfiltered Internet access had led to occurrences of criminal or otherwise inappropriate conduct by library patrons, such as public masturbation, and harassment of library staff and patrons, sometimes rising to the level of physical assault. As in the case with patron complaints, however,the government adduced no quantitative data comparing the frequency of criminalor otherwise inappropriatepatron conduct before the library's use of filters and afterthelibrary's use of filters. The sporadic anecdotal accounts of the government's library witnesses were countered by anecdotal accounts by the plaintiffs' library witnesses,that incidents of offensive patron behavior in public libraries have long predatedthe advent of Internet access. Aside from a public library's interest in preventing patrons from using the library's Internetterminals to receive obscenity or child pornography, which constitutes criminal conduct,we are constrained to reject any compelling state interest in regulating patrons' conductasa justification for content-based restrictions on patrons' Internet access. ""[T]heCourt's First Amendment cases draw vital distinctions between words and deeds,  150   betweenideas and conduct."" Ashcroft, 122 S. Ct. at 1403. First Amendment jurisprudence makes clear that speech may not be restricted on the ground that restricting  speech will reduce crime or other undesirable behavior that the speech is thought to cause, subject to only a narrow exception for speech that ""is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action."" Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 447 (1969) (per curiam). ""The mere tendency of speech to encourage unlawful acts is insufficient reason for banning it."" Ashcroft, 122 S. Ct. at 1403. Outside of the narrow ""incitement"" exception, the appropriate method of deterring unlawful or otherwise undesirable behavior is not to suppress the speech that induces such behavior, but to attach sanctions to the behavior itself. ""Among free men, the deterrents ordinarily to be applied to prevent crime are education and punishment for violations of the law, not abridgement of the rights of free speech."" Kingsley Int'l Pictures Corp. v. Regents of the Univ. of the State of New York, 360 U.S. 684, 689 (1959) (quoting Whitney v. Cal., 274 U.S. 357, 378 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring)); see also Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. 514, 529 (2001) (""The normal method of deterring unlawful conduct is to impose an appropriate punishment on the person who engages in it.""). 4. Summary In sum, we reject a public library's interest in preventing unlawful or otherwise  151   inappropriate patron conduct as a basis for restricting patrons' access to speech on the Internet. The proper method for a library to deter unlawful or inappropriate patron conduct, such as harassment or assault of other patrons, is to impose sanctions on such conduct, such as either removing the patron from the library, revoking the patron's library privileges, or, in the appropriate case, calling the police. We believe, however, that the state interests in preventing the dissemination of obscenity, child pornography, or in the case of minors, material harmful to minors, and in protecting library patrons from being unwillingly exposed to offensive, sexually explicit material, could all justify, for First Amendment purposes, a public library's use of Internet filters, provided that use of such filters is narrowly tailored to further those interests, and that no less restrictive means of promoting those interests exist. Accordingly, we turn to the narrow tailoring question. B. Narrow Tailoring Having identified the relevant state interests that could justify content-based restrictions on public libraries' provision of Internet access, we must determine whether a public library's use of software filters is narrowly tailored to further those interests. ""It is not enough to show that the Government's ends are compelling; the means must be carefully tailored to achieve those ends."" Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989). ""[M]anifest imprecision of [a] ban . . . reveals that its proscription is not sufficiently tailored to the harms it seeks to prevent to justify . . .  152   substantial interference with . . . speech."" FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U.S. 364, 392 (1984). The commercially available filters on which evidence was presented at trial all block many thousands of Web pages that are clearly not harmful to minors, and many thousands more pages that, while possibly harmful to minors, are neither obscene nor child pornography. See supra, Subsection II.E.7. Even the defendants' own expert, after analyzing filtering products' performance in public libraries, concluded that of the blocked Web pages to which library patrons sought access, between 6% and 15% containedno content that meets even the filtering products' own definitions of sexually explicitcontent, let alone the legal definitions of obscenity or child pornography, which noneof the filtering companies thatwere studied use as the basis for their blocking decisions. Moreover, in light of the flaws in these studies, discussed in detail in our findingsof fact above, these percentages significantly underestimate the amount of speechthat filters erroneously block, and at best provide a rough lower bound on the filters'rates of overblocking. Given the substantial amount of constitutionally protected speechblocked by the filters studied, we conclude that use of such filters is not narrowly tailoredwith respect to the government's interest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity,child pornography, and material harmful to minors. Tobe sure, the quantitative estimates of the rates of overblocking apply only to thosefourcommercially a"

GX037-47-14631496	Anti-Smuggling Unit closes down smuggling group; Three principals plead guilty, sentenced         DEL RIO, TEXAS   A six-month investigation into a major immigrant and narcotics smuggling organization by agents with the San Angelo Border Patrol Stations Anti-Smuggling Unit ended April 27, 2001 with the sentencing of three principals in the organization. Victor Hugo Mancera-Rosas, Jose Javier Mancera-Rosas and Victor Velez-Guitierrez were arrested in Fort Worth, Texas, Nov. 7, 2000, by agents from the San Angelo Anti-Smuggling Unit and the Dallas District Office. The three were charged with alien smuggling (violation of Title 8 United States Code, section 1324) and fraud and misuse of visas, permits and other documents (violation of Title 18 United States Code Section 1546 and 1028). The investigation into the group began in March 2000, and revealed the group was a well established major organization involved in the smuggling of illegal aliens and narcotics, as well as, the manufacturing and selling of counterfeit documents.  The group manufactured a variety of documents, including resident alien cards, social security cards, and auto liability insurance cards. They also falsified Mexican Passports and assisted illegal immigrants in obtaining Texas identification cards and drivers licenses. Records indicate the group was manufacturing 80-100 counterfeit document sets per day, selling them for $100 to $120 per set. It was estimated the activities of the group generated revenues of approximately $10,000 per day. In addition to the counterfeiting of documents, it was discovered the organization had the ability and the means to sell complete counterfeit document manufacturing set-ups. When the three were arrested, agents seized a complete computerized document making system, including blank I-551 cards, blank social security cards, Mexican passports, and an assortment of Immigration and Naturalization Services rubber stamps. Also seized were two handguns, a .45 semi-automatic and a .357 caliber revolver. All three principals were Mexican Nationals. Velez is a lawfully admitted permanent resident; while the two Manceras were not legally in the United States. Jose Javier Mancera-Rosas and Victor Velez-Guitierrez each were sentenced to 12 months in prison, while Victor Hugo Mancera-Rosas received a 10-month sentence. During the six-month investigation, agents revealed the group smuggled more than 100 illegal immigrants per month. Agents also seized 549 pounds of marijuana the group had smuggled into the United States. (5/1/01)                  Last Modified 06/05/2003
GX021-64-5572053	"Making Homelessness Programs Accountable to Consumers,   Funders and the Public      by   Dennis Culhane, Ph.D.   David Eldridge, M.S.W.     Robert Rosenheck, M.D.   Carol Wilkins, M.P.P.      Abstract      This paper discusses how different types of performance measurement can   be used to improve the accountability of homeless programs to consumers,   funders, and to the public. A distinction is made between the kinds of data   used in formal research projects and data that can be practically obtained in a   practice setting. Consumer outcomes are discussed in terms of accountability to   consumers, program outcomes in terms of accountability to funders, and systems   outcomes in terms of accountability to the public. Cost-benefit analyses are   also discussed as providing another critical dimension of accountability to   funders and the public.       If performance effectiveness is determined by appropriate measures of   consumer need, services delivered, and outcomes attained, policy makers and   practitioners can gain important insight into what policies have the greatest   impact on homelessness and what practices serve homeless people the most   effectively. A reliable performance accounting system will require   collaboration among policy makers, practitioners, and consumers to collect   systematic consumer- and program-specific information.      Lessons for Practitioners, Policy Makers, and Researchers            Outcome-based program evaluation uses methods that range from simple     and inexpensive to complex and resource-intensive. Doing at least some basic     outcome measurement provides valuable information about program effectiveness.            Research measures and practice measures are necessarily different.     For instance, there is tension between low demand clinical engagement and the     intimidation of comprehensive “intake,” so it may not always be     possible to get a baseline measurement.        Standardized data collection at the consumer level is a critical     building block. Decisions about desired program outcomes should include     consumer input and results of program evaluations should be shared with     consumers.        System-wide standards and provider information are needed to compare     the relative effectiveness of program. A number of Management Information     Systems (MIS) programs are available that standardize outcome.        The homeless system must demonstrate effectiveness to compete with     other public priorities. Funders are increasingly using outcome measures to     evaluate programs and make choices about which programs to fund.        The homeless system is related to performance of other systems     (e.g., health, welfare, and housing) so evaluating their impact involves     complex interagency data acquisition issues.        Thorough cost-benefit analysis requires the integration of a large     number of data sets that are usually not compatible, but like any evaluation     research a little research concerning a program’s cost-effectiveness can     nevertheless be informative.            Introduction      Funding agencies at all levels of government have begun to consistently   use outcome measures to evaluate the effectiveness of social services. Some   local governments have been using outcome-based evaluations of their programs   in their reporting and application for federal funds. The link between receipt   of funding and performance has been further strengthened with the establishment   of the Government Performance and Results Act which obligates federal   departments to report on the performance of all funded programs in meeting   their specified objectives by the year 2000.      This paper reviews the literature on homeless services outcomes and   discusses how different kinds of performance measurement can be used to improve   the accountability of programs to consumers, funders, and to the public. In   doing so, a distinction is made between the kinds of information gathered by   formal research projects and that which can be practically obtained in a   practice setting. Regardless, accountability should be based on outcome   measurements that provide as clear indicators as practicable that the public   and private homeless services are meeting their intended objectives, for   consumers, funders and the public. While each constituency may have interests   that cross analytic boundaries, this paper is organized according to the   primary accountability issues for each audience, and the corresponding level of   analysis. Thus, consumer outcomes are discussed primarily in the section on   accountability to consumers, program outcomes in the section on accountability   to funders, and systems outcomes in the section on accountability to the   public.      Introduction: Analysis Framework                                Level of Accountability                 Primary Units of Analysis                               Consumers                 Consumer Needs         Services Received                               Funders                 Provider                                Public                 System                          Cost-benefit analyses provide another critical dimension of   accountability by weighing the costs of not conducting programs along with the   impact of current programs. These kinds of analyses must incorporate a range of   data, typically in different units of analysis, with varying degrees of   reliability, and from a variety of service systems that use different data   management systems. Thus, even less literature in this area is available than   in homelessness outcome measurement evaluation generally, providing provisional   guidance at best. However, this methodology may help to increase accountability   and has been given particular attention in this paper for the potential   benefits it offers to policy analysts, program administrators, and state and   local officials.      When performance effectiveness is determined by outcome measures, policy   makers and practitioners gain important insight into what policies have the   greatest impact on homelessness and what practices serve homeless people the   most effectively. It must be noted that the needs of consumers and the limited   resources of providers can interfere with the types and extent of measurements   that can be reasonably and reliably gathered. Thus, an active collaboration   between policy makers and practitioners is required to accommodate to the   clinical realities that make outcome measurement challenging. Nevertheless,   sound policy and good practice require a concerted effort to collect   information on what consumers need, what they receive, and to what effect.         Accountability to Consumers      In order for programs to be accountable to consumers, they must be able   to demonstrate responsiveness to consumers’ needs—both as   consumers’ perceive them, and as may be ascertained through reliable and   clinically appropriate means by service providers. Because consumers and   providers often differ in their views of what consumers need, as well as the   relative priority of those needs, multiple methods of assessment should be   used. Correspondingly, to assess the adequacy by which consumers’ needs   have been served multiple methods of performance and outcome measurement should   also be employed. These include measures for services provided, consumer   progress in meeting service goals, and consumer satisfaction. The usefulness of   these measures for achieving accountability to consumers depends in large   measure on the degree to which these measures are accessible to and reviewed by   program staff and program managers, as well as by consumers. The use of such   measures for achieving accountability to funders and the public will be   discussed in later sections; this section will review how they can be used to   increase the accountability of programs to consumers.      Accountability to Consumers: Measurement Strategies                                Assessment Type                 Methodology                               Consumer Preferences                 Checklists, Likert scales (domain specific)                               Standardized Assessment Tools                 Standardized scales, MIS assessment instruments                               Match-Mismatch                 Compare consumer needs with services delivered       (“appropriateness”)                               Outcomes                 Housing stability         Adequate income        Social relationships/functioning        Consumer satisfaction        Quality of life                         Consumer-Perceived Needs.   Several published studies have   reported attempts to gauge what consumers perceive as their needs and the   relative priority of those needs. For example, in an early study of   consumer-defined needs, Ball and Havassy (1984) found that homeless repeat   users of psychiatric facilities in San Francisco prioritized their lack of   basic resources for survival, over their lack of access to social services, as   the main cause for their homelessness. Results from the 112 subjects surveyed   identified the following needs: affordable housing (44%), financial   entitlements (38%), alcohol treatment   (9%), and counseling (7%). More   recently, a needs assessment study conducted as part of the Access to Community   Care and Effective Services and Supports (ACCESS) program found that among   1,482 homeless people with mental illness, 91 percent identified a need for   long-term housing, including 61 percent who identified this as one of their top   three needs (Rosenheck & Lam, 1997b). In each case, long term housing was   the most frequently identified need. But it was clearly not the only need.   Other needs, in order of importance, were for mental health services (78%),   dental services (73%), medical services (72%), financial assistance (70%), help   getting a job (56%) and substance abuse treatment (28%). Other studies of   consumer preferences have employed similar measures, and derived similar   conclusions (see Herman, Stuening & Barrow, 1994; Moxley & Freddolino,   1991; Acosta & Toro, in press; Linn & Gelberg, 1989).      Compared to assessments of homeless consumers’ psychiatric status,   employment history, or substance use history, these studies of   consumer-perceived needs have employed relatively simple and straightforward   surveys of consumer preferences that are quick and easy to complete.   Consumer-perceived needs tend to be assessed in fairly broadly conceived   domains, with standard Likert-type scales, checklists, or rank ordered lists.   In some cases, such as those assessing consumers’ preferences for a   specific type of housing placement, more detailed questions may be asked.   Nevertheless, standardized, psychometrically tested (i.e., tested for   reliability and validity) instruments, have not been developed in this area.   This has been due to the presumption that consumers can accurately describe   what they want, and how much they want it, without major threats to validity.   The reliance on consumers to identify their own needs helps alter the focus of   practitioners, researchers, and policy makers from measuring dysfunctions to   determining survival skills and assessing consumer aspirations (Friedman,   1998).       Of course, consumers’ and case managers’ assessments of   consumer needs are not always in concordance. One study that measured the   discrepancy between these assessments is the study mentioned above from the   ACCESS program (Rosenheck & Lam, 1997b). In that study assessment data   gathered from consumers were matched with similar needs assessments from   providers in the same domains (mental health, general health, substance abuse,   public support, housing assistance/support, dental care, and employment). The   greatest consumer/provider differences in perceived service needs were in   dental services (identified by 73% of consumers, but only 44% of providers);   medical service (identified by 72% of consumers but only 55% of providers);   substance abuse services (identified by only 28% of consumers but 44% of   providers) and mental health services (identified by 78% of consumers and 93%   of providers). Mental health providers were thus less likely than consumers to   identify needs for non-mental health services, but more likely to identify   needs for mental health services. Awareness and respect for the potential   discrepancies between consumer and provider needs assessments is important: it   can help agencies in their self-evaluation process to reflect on their   missions, and to affirm a more consumer-centered approach to policy, program   design and/or advocacy. Thus, simple consumer surveys conducted periodically   can offer program managers with a useful self-study tool for improving their   accountability to consumers.      Standardized Assessment Tools      More traditional consumer assessment techniques usually take the form of   an intake interview. Researchers, focused as they are on obtaining thorough   data, have created many standardized instruments to assess a broad range of   consumer characteristics. Since homeless people typically have a multiplicity   of problems, consumers’ needs must be assessed along multiple dimensions:   housing; health status (including psychiatric illness, substance abuse, and   medical and dental problems); income support; access to necessities such as   food and clothing; social support; employment; involvement in the criminal   justice system; and access to health care and/or social or vocational,   rehabilitation services. In addition to these specific components there is also   value to assessing quality of life according to a global assessment (Lehman,   1988), and general satisfaction with services (Attkisson & Greenfield,   1996; Rosenheck, Wilson & Meterko, 1997). Assessment is further complicated   by the fact that each of these domains may have multiple sub-components. For   example, housing status can be assessed by the number of days a consumer has   been free of homelessness in the past 30 days; by the stability of their   residence (how many times they have moved in the past 6 months); by the quality   of the housing (safety, state of repair, privacy, proximity to transportation   etc.); or by the number and type of people with whom they reside.       In general, it is best to use standard measures of health outcome that   have well-characterized validity and reliability. There are typically numerous   measures to chose from. In the ACCESS program psychiatric status is assessed by   self-reported symptoms of depression (Robins, Helzer, Croughan & Ratcliff,   1981), psychosis (Dohrenwend, 1976), and interviewer ratings of psychotic   behavior on standardized scales. Substance use was assessed with the composite   alcohol and drug indices of the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) (McLellan,   Luborsky, Wood & O’Brien, 1980). Psychological distress can also be   measured using the Brief Symptom Inventory, a 53-item version of the well-known   Symptom Checklist-90 (Derogatis & Spencer, 1982).      One of the major dilemmas evaluators must face is the trade off between   obtaining comprehensive data and consumer tolerance for participating in   assessments. To paraphrase Abraham Lincoln, “You can get all of the data   on some of the people, and some of the data on all of the people. But you can't   get all of the data on all of the people.” Only people with the least   problems and the greatest willingness to cooperate will complete assessment   batteries, and the data will thus not be representative of the population being   served. Moreover, from a service delivery perspective, too many questions may   pose a barrier to engagement of homeless mentally ill consumers. Consequently,   most agencies use relatively brief intake or assessment forms to collect basic   demographic information, income status, reasons for homelessness, educational   status, employment status, health status, family issues, etc. These intake   interviews typically do not employ standardized instruments, and their   psychometric properties have not been established. They are more commonly   developed to facilitate the planning of direct services for individual   consumers or to verify eligibility, as opposed to answering research questions.         That said, many public agencies, including the federal government, have   encouraged the development of more standardized intake or assessment   interviews. For example, for nearly ten years, cities such as New York,   Philadelphia, Columbus (OH), St. Louis, and Maricopa County (Phoenix), have   been collecting basic demographic and psychosocial information on nearly all   persons entering emergency shelters. The Department of Veterans Affairs Health   Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) Programs and Domiciliary Care for Homeless   Veterans (DCHV) programs have conducted over 150,000 standardized assessments   since beginning operation in 1987, using selected items from standardized   instruments (Seibyl, Rosenheck, Medak & Corwel, 1997; Kasprow, Rosenheck   & Chapdelaine, 1997). In addition, many individual shelters throughout the   country have also developed their own intake and assessment tools.       The federal government has also encouraged broader use and   standardization of such instruments through their support for the development   of the Participant Outcomes Monitoring System (POMS) (Fosburg, Locke, Peck   & Finkel, 1997), and the Runaway and Homeless Youth Management Information   System. Many jurisdictions are also beginning to implement local Management   Information System (MIS), or to install other consumer-tracking software   applications. (1)  Because of their automation and consequent   standardization across providers in a jurisdiction, these systems and   assessment instruments are very useful for establishing accountability of   programs to funders and to the public (to be discussed later). Even when they   do not document outcomes, they indicate that the programs are reaching their   intended target population, an important performance standard that should not   be taken for granted. Furthermore, to the extent that these systems assess   consumer needs for housing, employment, and health services, as well as the   services provided to the consumer, consumers can use such systems, or reports   generated by them, to measure how well their needs are being addressed. It   should be noted that the administrative data generated by MIS programs have   advantages and disadvantages in terms of reliability and validity and should be   used judiciously like any other kind of data.       Anecdotally, jurisdictions that have implemented automated   “consumer tracking” systems or management information systems (MIS),   have reported that consumers more often express appreciation than complaints   that they are interviewed with a formal set of questions. A locality has to   weigh the burden of information gathering against the benefits of having   service planning data and outcome measures, in creating an assessment   instrument or information system. However, one way to persuade consumers to   tolerate an intake interview is to inform them that the information will be   used to plan their services, and to keep the service system accountable to   them. Consumers should also be actively involved in devising privacy controls   over the personal data that is maintained in MIS programs (Friedman, 1998).   Consumers can benefit directly from the use of MIS by providers because they   would not have to provide the same information to multiple providers and they   would be served more effectively from increased coordination of services.   Providers, for example, could facilitate referrals to programs in other systems   for needed services or could notify consumers where emergency shelter beds or   other services are actually available.      Performance Measurement      Once consumers’ needs have been identified, it is critical to   record the services a consumer actually receives in order to adequately judge   program outcomes. The record of services delivered and the outcomes   attained—often in combination—are referred to as “performance   measures.” Quantifiable measures of the services a program provides are   essentially the “inputs” against which outcomes can be measured.   Research- and demonstration-oriented projects often have a bundle of services   that comprise the intervention and are presumed to be received by the   experimental or intervention group. Therefore, some demonstration projects will   not collect detailed services information. However, in the non-research, or   typical practice setting, consumers access a variety of services of different   types and to different extents. Thus, to assess how outcomes are related to   services delivered, thereby providing another measure of accountability to   consumers, some method of recording units of service by type of service is   needed.      This is probably the most variable and difficult aspect of information   collection by homeless services agencies. Again, some of the automated tracking   systems mentioned earlier attempt to record the discrete use of services by   type of service. However, this gets very complicated beyond measuring more   traditional units of service, such as nights of shelter provided, and standard   units of clinical services (e.g. mental health outpatient visits). Many social   services are unevenly provided and have variations in intensity, duration, or   in the professional level of the staff, and this variability is typically not   captured in denoting a “unit of service.” This area deserves more   attention by agencies, cities, and researchers who should work towards a more   common understanding of what services and units of services mean in different   settings so that they can be more comparably measured. As one example of the   utility of service use measurements, a Veterans Administration (VA) outcome   study was able to demonstrate significant relationships between outcomes and   the number of times consumers were seen, whether they were contacted through   community outreach, the number of days of residential treatment they received,   and whether they received increased public support payments (Rosenheck, Frisman   & Gallup, 1995).      Whether or not discrete services are measured, programs can still be   held accountable to consumers simply by showing whether or not consumers   progress or achieve other intended outcomes. Again, researchers have been far   more careful to collect exhaustive information when trying to assess program   outcomes than is typically possible in a practice setting. In the research   setting, assessment tools like those described previously are typically used as   periodic follow-up measures. This would be the equivalent of repeatedly   administering an intake/assessment interview to a consumer. Other instruments   are explicitly designed to collect “outcome” data (i.e., housing   stability). But, again, while researchers typically receive special funds to   hire staff to track consumers, to interview them, and to compensate them for   their participation, these are resources that a typical practice setting cannot   afford. Still, it is important to be able to demonstrate to consumers that   their participation has real effects in improving the homeless service system.         To some extent less rigorous outcome measurement has into some of the   consumer tracking systems mentioned earlier. In the VA's HCHV and DCHV   programs, mentioned above, a brief discharge form has been completed after each   one of over 50,000 episodes of residential treatment. This form documents where   each veteran will be residing after discharge, their employment status, whether   they completed the program to a mutually agreed upon discharge or premature   departure, and staff assessments of clinical improvement. While these measures   lack the rigor and reliability of research-level measures, they provide useful   and face-valid evidence of program results (Rosenheck, Leda & Gallup,   1992). Some of these consumer-tracking systems not only have assessment forms   but also allow for collecting periodic measures of status in several domains.   These relatively consumer-friendly techniques can be applied to a broader   population and tend to be much more brief than an assessment interview. They   can be used to assess whether programs are meeting their objectives in serving   either consumer- or program-identified needs. In some cases, jurisdictions may   elect to collect outcome measures on a sample of discharged consumers, given   the difficulty of tracking consumers, especially after they have left a given   program. Indeed, the major challenge in collecting outcomes information is   finding former consumers. Doing so for all discharged consumers would require   an unrealistic (and unjustifiable) expenditure of effort and resources in most   cases. Alternatively, some agencies may choose to follow a sample (i.e.,   ten-percent) of their consumers for six months, measuring their progress once   or twice over this time period.      The subject of follow-up raises another issue: how long after leaving a   program should consumers be followed? Unfortunately, there are no established   standards for this important consideration. Outcome data are most easily and   comprehensively gathered during participation in or at the time of discharge   from a program. However, while some program “graduates” may be   tracked through aftercare programs, these typically represent the most   successful exits from a given program. Again, research and demonstration   projects may have the resources to conduct long-term follow-up (perhaps two   years or more) with a broader cohort of service users, while service agencies   will have to choose a more practical strategy. Nevertheless, care should be   used to avoid selection biases, whereby only the successful consumers are   followed (sometimes referred to as “creaming”).      Accountability to Funders      While it is theoretically possible for consumers to hold programs   accountable by reviewing their own services histories and progress reports, as   well as aggregate reports on other consumers (indeed, such a practice might be   encouraged among consumer advocacy groups), providers are more commonly held   accountable by their funders. Funders, especially government funders, will   usually enforce accountability through annual or periodic reporting   requirements, and through applications for new or renewed funding.   Unfortunately, because of the range of funders that may be involved, providers   have to struggle with widely variable and inconsistent reporting requirements.   In general, funders tend to require data elements similar to those used to   establish accountability to consumers described above. However, since funders   often must regulate or oversee a large number of programs, and programs of   different types, they may have more generic benchmarking practices. It is worth   noting that to the extent that some large social service agencies have several   programs that they directly manage, they might conduct similar analyses as   described here, and could therefore be considered “funders.” Some of   the more common reporting formats and issues are discussed below.      Accountability to Funders: Performance Measurement                                Components                 Measures                               Consumers served                 Contract Performance (units of service per consumer)                               Units of Service delivered                  Effectiveness (maximize positive outcomes per consumer)                                   Outcomes                  Efficiency (maximize ratio of positive outcomes :: services       delivered per consumer)                         Again, the research literature, where resources are available for   tracking consumers and analyzing large quantities of data, offers only a few   examples of detailed provider or program evaluation research. The vast majority   of program evaluations measure either the relative effectiveness of two or   three different program interventions, or the impact of a single program model,   implemented by a number of providers. The first type of program evaluation,   which typically uses an experimental or quasi-experimental design, compares   models of housing or services in terms of how well they serve consumers, using   aggregated consumer-level data over time. For example, Miesher and Galanter   (1996) experimentally compared two programs that served homeless alcoholic men   according to consumer retention in each program. (Interestingly, the   authors’ conclusions point to the importance of service integration, or   systems-level concerns, rather than the program-level issues, in producing   better outcomes.)      A second type of program evaluation in the literature derives   system-level conclusions by aggregating program-level outcomes from a large   project. For example, Matulef et al.’s (1995) National Evaluation of the   Supportive Housing Demonstration Program evaluates the impact of 93 percent of   the over 700 programs that participated in this demonstration project. While   this strategy generates information on the need for systems-level interventions   across sites, the relative effectiveness of each program is not evaluated.   Alternatively, Huebner and Crosse (1991) used an innovative approach that   combines experimental and quasi-experimental comparisons with site-level and   systems-level analyses for a nine-site demonstration project evaluation. They   conclude that inconsistent definitions of homelessness, problems with missing   data and difficulty in measuring treatment effects were major obstacles to   developing cross-project comparisons. This lack of standardization could   similarly frustrate analysts working within, let alone across, jurisdictions.   Finally, from a research perspective, the authors point out that common   instrumentation is not a panacea, but that data-collection procedures and   schedules, comparison groups, and selection into these groups are also   important factors to consider in assessing program effectiveness. Another   strategy that may help performance measurement is the institution of quality   standards for providers that are developed in conjunction with consumers   (Friedman, 1998).      In the Department of Veterans Affairs HCHV and DCHV programs reporting   formats are uniform nationally. A total of 33 ""critical monitors"" (benchmark   measures) are used to evaluate the comparative performance of over 100 programs   across the country in the areas of program structure (6 measures); contacting   the intended target population (7 measures); delivering intended services (8   measures) and outcomes (11 measures) (Kasprow et al., 1997; Seibyl et al.,   1997). Less able or interested in funding research projects, more typically   funders of homeless services will require basic data for reporting purposes,   such as the number of people served, consumer characteristics, and, less often,   the needs of those consumers. They also usually require some description of the   program or services provided, and may even ask for the total number of units of   service delivered by service category. Funders have less traditionally asked   for outcomes, but, as stated previously, that is becoming more common as   federal, state, and local governments are more conscious of performance, or   employ performance-based auditing or contracting procedures.       Performance measures can be as crude as units of service per person   (efficiency) to more complicated attempts to link units of services to some   desired outcome (efficacy). For example, a funder of homeless programs may want   to know the number of consumers served and the number of shelter days used, and   - in combination - the average length of stay in a program. Given that the   residential component of homeless programs is usually the most significant in   terms of cost, the “average length of stay” (ALOS) is perhaps the   most common proxy measure of what a consumer receives, or what the funder is   “purchasing.” For some funders, this might constitute performance in   that it may document what amount of service was provided for the average   consumer, or in that it may be used to compare the efficiency of providers in   serving a given pool of consumers. However, even this level of reporting is   only recently becoming more common in jurisdictions. To calculate an average   length of stay per episode, a provider must know, at a minimum, the total   number of consumer episodes (which may include duplicates of individuals) and   the total number of days of service provided. To calculate average length of   stay per consumer, agencies must furthermore be able to unduplicate consumers   across episodes. To do so across a jurisdiction, or some other grouping of   agencies, would undoubtedly require some automated information system.      Given the rather basic state of reporting at present, research is needed   to develop more accurate and discriminating performance criteria, as well as   organizational or service delivery factors that can be associated with those   criteria. The average length of stay is one indicator that has been discussed;   still others might include units of case management delivered, hours of   counseling, frequency of outreach contacts, rate of readmission to shelter,   etc. For example, a recent “provider performance” analysis (Culhane,   Eldridge & Metraux, 1999) chose the rate of readmission to shelter as the   critical benchmark for measuring the effectiveness of transitional housing   providers. Of particular interest to the funders of the research was whether or   not rate of return was associated with length of stay. In other words, do   shelters with longer lengths of stay have lower rates of return? In later   models, length of stay was treated as a control variable, and the effect of   various social services (frequency, duration, etc.) on readmission rates was   assessed (i.e., Does providing case management or a certain amount of it reduce   the rate of return to homelessness?). Still further models included consumer   characteristics (“case mix”) and discharge type (percent receiving   housing subsidies) as variables. The operationalization of these variables   involved a number of challenging conceptual decisions and statistical   procedures. Nevertheless, the study provides a method for systematically   comparing programs while taking account of variations in consumer mix, service   mix, etc., and doing so based primarily on administrative records, rather than   depending exclusively on costly, time-consuming survey methods.       Accountability to Funders: Benchmarking      Example  (Culhane, Eldridge, & Metraux, 1999)                                Variables                               Dependent Variable:  Rate of Return        Independent Variables:  Specific services delivered        Control Variables:         Length of Stay  Exit type   Case-mix adjustments         Provider characteristics                               Required Standardized Data                             1. Consumer needs/characteristics  2. Services       delivered 3. Discharge type  4. Provider characteristics  5.       System-wide admission data                       From a funder’s perspective, if more days, or certain services, or   more of certain services, are not associated with reductions in rate of return,   one could conclude that those are either poorly performing programs or are not   critically important services. Similarly, one could measure placements to   housing, tenure in housing, increases in income, etc., as performance measures   against which various inputs are measured. In choosing benchmarks, one must be   careful that the outcome measures reflect an intended policy or programmatic   objective. For example, some might argue that rate of return, while a readily   available measure in some cities, is really a poor measure of how a person or   family is functioning, particularly given that some persons may prefer to live   on the streets instead of return to a shelter. For these persons, the lack of   “return” to shelter would not indicate “success.”      Also, as indicated by the preliminary study of provider performance   mentioned above (Culhane et al., 1999), if funders want to be accurate in   judging providers, additional sets of data are needed, beyond length of stay   and rate of return. First, consumer characteristic information must be   collected so that adjustments can be made for variations in case mix. Some   providers may serve a more chronically disabled population, and would therefore   be expected to have different performance parameters. The VA programs described   previously use over ten baseline measures to risk adjust outcomes assessments   that are used to compare programs seeing different types of patients across the   country. Additionally, a number of provider level characteristics, which cannot   be obtained through consumer-tracking systems, may be important as qualifying   or control variables. These may include organizational size, auspices, funding   sources, staffing levels, ownership, revenues by source, expenditures by   category, etc. For example, Rosenheck and Lam (1997a) used ACCESS program data   to find that geographic location of homeless services provider sites was a   greater obstacle to service use than consumer characteristics among homeless   persons with serious mental illness.      Thus, in addition to implementing consumer tracking information systems,   funders concerned with accountability should consider the creation of provider   inventories, similar to that which exists for providers of mental health   services (the Inventory of Mental Health Organizations, National Institute of   Mental Health, 1983 and 1986). Such periodic surveys would enable comparisons   of providers’ performance controlling for differences in provider   characteristics. A survey developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau   of the Census (1995) on behalf of the Interagency Council on the Homeless (the   National Survey of Homeless Assistance Providers and Clients) may serve as a   good beginning point for such a survey.      The major problem for providers will be collecting the information   necessary to measure performance, however it is measured (Huebner & Crosse,   1991). Clearly, standardization of information collection, automation of   information collection, and, in particular, explicit reporting requirements by   government funders, will drive the collection of performance data. Though   challenging, streamlining data and achieving unduplicated counts of consumers   is doable (Friedman, 1998). A great deal of work remains, however, before the   multitude of service and funding systems are fully coordinated. For example one   administrator wondered how it was possible to report to multiple, and as many   as fifteen or more, funders (Harris, 1998).       Besides these data collection difficulties, an equally challenging   quandary for both providers and funders is that the homeless services system,   is primarily reactive, and cannot always be appropriately accountable for   patterns of homeless service utilization. People may stay longer in shelters   because the supply of housing certificates or affordable housing shrinks, or   more people may re-enter shelters because of welfare reform. Thus, the   performance of homeless providers is affected by significant externalities that   are beyond the control of the homeless providers, or their funders. This   contingency makes any assessment of homeless providers’   “performance” necessarily tentative and provisional.      Accountability to the Public      Because public funders essentially represent the public, requiring   accountability for funding expenditures serves the public’s interest.   However, funders cannot just require reporting from providers, but must make   available to the public information regarding how their systems, or networks of   providers, are performing, what they cost, and what objectives they do or do   not meet. In so doing, the public may be more able to hold policymakers   accountable for sound public policymaking and efficient administration of   programs.      Accountability to the Public: Research Strategies                                    Strategy                 Methodology                               Homeless System Performance                 Services delivered and costs  Effectiveness        Efficiency                               Program Innovations                 Comparison of program types  Costs/Effectiveness/Efficiency        Pre-Post comparisons                               Policy Changes                 Pre-Post comparisons  Multiple Systems Analysis (Data       integration across systems, secondary impacts on health, welfare, housing and       criminal justice systems.)                         The Congress, state legislatures, and their administrative departments   are institutions, which through their funding structures, can require local   agents to report standardized information on services. Unfortunately, there are   fewer requirements that obligate federal agencies to make easily available   standardized, comprehensive measures of relative performance by jurisdiction.   For example, while HUD and HHS and other federal departments currently require   providers to report the number of consumers served, consumer characteristic   information, and services received (i.e., through the Annual Performance Report   (APR), through the Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness   (PATH) and Health Care for the Homeless (HCH) reporting requirements, and the   Runaway and Homeless Youth (RHY) reporting system), they less consistently   require outcome information or jurisdiction level information (which would   require unduplication across the jurisdiction). The HUD APR does collect   outcomes such as housing stability and changes in income, and the Center for   Mental Health Services (CMHS) does require outcomes data on persons served by   PATH. These efforts will hopefully be further advanced by the Government   Performance and Results Act. However, from a public accountability stand point   (a system versus provider level of analysis), most Federal programs do not   require jurisdiction-wide aggregation of those measures on an unduplicated   consumer basis. Thus, it is difficult for the public to judge whether policies   are having an intended effect (i.e., Are fewer people homeless? Are people   homeless for shorter periods of time? Do peoples’ incomes and quality of   life improve as a result of program participation?). Policy can consequently be   more often driven by anecdote, the exigencies of funding constraints, and the   ideological perspective of policy makers, rather than a reasoned discussion and   review of the evidence. One could argue that the inability to have   institutionalized jurisdiction-wide performance measurement results in public   policy being unaccountable to consumers as well as the general public.      This lack of performance information is particularly disconcerting given   that many important and national initiatives have been undertaken by state,   local, and federal governments. Despite their value, without information to   substantiate efficiency and efficacy, good programs often remain demonstration   projects and are not realized on an appropriate scale. Similarly, failed   policies can remain in place because they suit the prerogatives of established   interests, though they may have little evidentiary basis for continuing.       Alternatively, some service integration strategies and some large   demonstration projects have been documented and there is much to be learned   from them. Dennis, Cocozza and Steadman (1998) present findings from 10   different systems integration projects which used different levels of   evaluation procedures, ranging from none at all to sophisticated   quasi-experimental, outcome-oriented designs. Some, such as the HUD Shelter   Plus Care Program, have demonstrated significant improvements in the lives of   program participants in both service usage (e.g. engagement in needed treatment   and reduced hospital and jail use), and material well-being (e.g. increased   income, employment, and housing stability) (Fosburg et al., 1997). Similarly,   the NIMH/CMHS McKinney Demonstrations showed a dramatic improvement in   residential stability resulting from increased collaboration between the   participating housing authorities and mental health centers. Only one project,   the ACCESS Program, has built in outcome measures at the consumer, program, and   systems levels. Some of the improvements demonstrated by these programs are   very important, and because they have supporting evidence, arguments can be   advanced for their continuation, and they are less vulnerable to legislative or   departmental program cuts.       Cost-Benefit Analysis       Very little research has been published about the cost-effectiveness of   services to homeless people. Studies that have been published fall into two   major groups: research on small groups of homeless consumers (usually fewer   than 100), and program evaluations which are usually completed by (or on behalf   of) service providers and/or government agencies that fund programs serving   homeless people. Research studies often use rigorous data collection strategies   and powerful statistical tools, and results are published in academic journals   several years after services are provided. Program evaluations tend to use   routinely collected administrative data, have substantially larger sample   sizes, and their results are often reported quickly in order to support program   planning and decision-making about ongoing funding.       As with any consumer level, provider level and systems level analysis,   cost-benefit analysis uses information that most homeless service providers   have limited capacity to collect: consumer demographics, service utilization,   and outcomes for the same group of consumers over time or across service   settings or programs. Very few programs even use unique consumer identifiers,   so they may not have the capacity to determine how many intakes or bed nights   are unique to individuals, or how many of the people served at one site are   also served later in the year at another program site. The kind of data that   providers do collect relates to the following program needs: (1) establishing   consumers’ eligibility for services, (2) documenting service utilization   for billing purposes, and (3) to a very limited extent, documenting outcomes   that are of interest to the source of funding for the program. While there is   clearly a need for more comprehensive data collection by providers,   cost-benefit analysis can utilize a variety of measures based on the kind of   data that providers may already collect.      Ideally, cost-benefit analyses would compare the total costs and   benefits of providing homelessness interventions with the total costs and   benefits of providing no interventions, or some other standard set of services.   This analysis requires measurement of costs in a wide range of systems, and we   are not aware of any study that synthesizes data from every relevant system to   measure the costs of not addressing homelessness at all. Instead, it is likely   that we will need to patch together information from a variety of sources and   methodological approaches to draw conclusions about what service models   “work” to reduce homelessness and to identify both the costs and the   savings benefits to consumers and to the public. Cost-benefit analysis includes   the following methods: cost effectiveness, before and after comparisons,   service utilization comparisons, waiting list comparisons, comparisons between   groups, comparisons between programs, multivariate analysis, and multiple   systems analysis. All of these approaches can provide valuable information   about the relative costs of homelessness interventions.      Cost-Benefit Analysis                                Strategy and Analysis Level                 Description                               Cost Effectiveness (Consumer Level)                 Measures the costs for providing a unit of service to an       eligible consumer.                                Before and After Comparison (Consumer Level)                 Compares service utilization costs by homeless consumers before       entering program with costs after leaving program.                                Service Utilization Comparison (Consumer Level)                 Compares service utilization costs by homeless consumers with       non-homeless consumers.                               Waiting List Comparison (Consumer Level)                 Compares service utilization costs and benefits by currently       served consumers with eligible consumers on waiting list.                               Programs Comparison (Program Level)                 Compares service utilization costs and benefits between two or       more of the same kind of programs or between programs that offer different       kinds of intervention.                                Multiple Systems Analysis (System Level)                 Measures costs and benefits of services to consumers relative to       not providing those services using data from the homeless-ness, housing, health       care, mental health and substance abuse treatment, criminal, and welfare and       employment systems.                          Cost Effectiveness.  Some studies simply measure the costs   for providing a unit of services to an eligible person. If the costs appear to   be “reasonable” and the projects appear to achieve desired outcomes   for most consumers, the report concludes that services are “cost   effective” (Matulef et al., 1995). While not a complete picture of   cost-effectiveness, this measure may be meaningful if a desired outcome is the   engagement of the project’s target population. This is particularly true   in the case of projects serving consumers who have not consistently   participated in treatment. It can also be a useful indicator of the efficiency   and effectiveness of program implementation in terms of evaluating such program   activities as filling vacancies, or providing outreach to maintain program   capacity.      Before and After Comparison.   Costs of services utilized by   homeless individuals before they enter a program are compared to costs and   benefits during and after program participation. For example, the evaluation of   the Minnesota Supportive Housing Demonstration Program (Tilsen, 1998) found   that average monthly costs for a range of services, including hospitals, jails,   state institutions, and income support, were reduced from an average of $2,168   to $1,370 per month, resulting in annualized savings of $1.7 million a year for   180 units of supportive housing. Changes in residential stability, consumer   functioning, and consumer satisfaction are also reported. Because some homeless   people might have achieved some improvements in functioning or reduced   utilization of other services without program assistance, it has been suggested   that changes measured using this approach may be useful as an estimate of the   upper boundary of program impacts (Rosenheck et al., 1995).      Service Utilization Comparison.  In a recent study which   examined hospital discharge data from New York City’s public hospitals,   Salit et al. (1998) found that homeless patients stayed 36 percent longer than   other patients, after adjustments were made for clinical and demographic   characteristics. Rosenheck and Seibyl (1998) reached similar conclusions after   comparing a national study of the health service use and costs for homeless and   domiciled veterans hospitalized in psychiatric and substance abuse units at VA   medical centers. The authors found that 13.3 percent more money was spent   serving homeless veterans than domiciled veterans. Measurements of the costs   associated with homelessness are one way of identifying the savings that could   be achieved by successful interventions. Ideally this information can be linked   to data from programs serving homeless people to compare the costs of programs   that are successfully targeting and retaining people with the same clinical and   demographic characteristics. Programs to prevent homelessness can use a similar   approach by creating models to project what would have happened to program   participants if services had not been provided. The New York State Department   of Social Services (1990) used this method to estimate the cost effectiveness   of programs that intervened to prevent evictions, and estimated that the late   stage eviction component of their Homeless Prevention Program saves   approximately $11.6 million in averted homeless costs.      Waiting List Comparison.   Another strategy that has been   discussed but not fully pursued is to compare costs and benefits for program   participants with those for homeless individuals who are eligible for the   program but on wait lists because of limited program capacity. Where   participants are selected by lottery, (as is often the case in housing for   homeless people), there is  de facto  random selection into a treatment   group and a control group. Comparison between the service utilization costs and   program benefits between these groups may yield valuable cost-benefit data.   While it would be very difficult to track homeless individuals who do not   receive services, information from public data systems such as public hospitals   and clinics, mental health services, and other systems of care could be used to   gather longitudinal data on wait list subjects.      Program Comparison.   A number of research studies   compare two or more programs which use interventions that are based on   different service models. For example, Wolff et al. (1997) compared costs and   outcomes for three types of case management after randomly assigning consumers   to each service model. The authors found that higher average costs for two   assertive community treatment approaches were associated with increases in   financial assistance (vocational/educational, residential, and income support)   and decreases in costs for inpatient psychiatric services, when compared to   less intensive and less expensive brokered case management services. Dickey,   Latimer, Powers, Gonzalez and Goldfinger (1997) compared two types of housing   with services and found that treatment and case management costs did not vary   by housing type, but that one housing program was significantly more costly   than independent living arrangements, without producing significantly different   outcomes. Rosenheck et al. (1995) used multivariate analysis to assess   relationships between specific treatment elements and outcome measures in VA   homeless programs. Using this approach, the researchers measured the costs for   determining a standardized amount of improvement for different outcomes   (housing stability, symptoms, employment), using different service strategies   (e.g., case management, residential treatment, and income supports). They found   that the cost of residential treatment was three to five times the cost of case   management for achieving a standardized amount of improvement in outcomes, but   that the interventions were associated with improvements in different areas of   functioning. Residential treatment was associated in improvements in the number   of days housed and days employed, while case management was associated with   improvements in days of substance abuse and psychological distress. Income   transfer payments were associated with improvements in days homeless but worse   outcomes in paid employment.      Multiple Systems Analysis.   Because homeless people   often face a number of additional problems, such as mental illness and drug and   alcohol addiction, it is important to compare costs from many different service   systems. These data include utilization of shelter, housing, and other   “homeless” services; utilization of health care, mental health and   substance abuse treatment; utilization of welfare and employment services; and   involvement with the police and jail systems. For families, we need to also   consider costs of child protective services and foster care. We know   anecdotally that effectively stabilizing the lives of homeless people can   prevent or reduce the costs of services in each of these systems. A number of   the program comparisons cited above (Wolff et al., 1997; Dickey et al., 1997;   Tilsen, 1998) combine data from several of these systems, but to date there   have been no published studies that have been successful in accessing and   matching data from all of these systems.      Challenges.  The limited availability of cost-benefit   information is a result of a variety of challenges frequently encountered   during cost-benefit analyses. These challenges include: high attrition rates,   small sample sizes, imprecise measurement of service utilization costs,   inconsistent data over time and across systems, and lack of provider commitment   to and resources for data collection. A description of the extent of these   challenges is followed by a description of strategies that providers can use to   meet them and conduct effective cost-benefit studies.      Attrition rates in most studies are very high, reflecting the   instability in the lives of many homeless people. In some studies plans to   track participants over an extended time period are abandoned when findings are   compromised by high rates of attrition. After 12 months, Rosenheck et al.   (1995) were able to conduct follow-up interviews with only 37 percent of   homeless veterans who had agreed to participate in the study at entry into the   program. Wolff et al. (1997) found that between 33 percent and 63 percent of   participants assigned to case management dropped out, and that higher rates of   attrition in brokered case management compared to assertive community treatment   may have resulted in unknown bias that compromised the study’s   conclusions. Attrition is particularly problematic if participation in data   collection is dependent upon participation in services, as is the case in most   data collection by programs that serve homeless people. Because our current   research does a poor job of tracking outcomes for homeless people who   discontinue treatment, findings can be generalized only to those who are most   successfully engaged in services. Better outcomes for consumers are usually   associated with more consistent participation in services, but it is hard to   tell if this is cause or effect. It is possible that both participation and   outcomes such as residential stability, employment, or improved quality of   life, are associated with other variables that are not identified upon intake.   For example, people who experience substance abuse relapse problems are likely   to discontinue participation in services and have worse outcomes that are not   included in study results because they drop out of data collection.      Another challenge for cost-benefit analysis is sample size. Sample sizes   that are too small will not yield statistically valid results. Consequently, it   is often very difficult to identify statistically significant differences   between program outcomes, even when there appear to be changes in the expected   direction. Compounding this problem, observed changes are often small and   progress for many homeless people is unsteady and rarely linear. In addition,   service utilization after intervention is often strongly correlated with prior   service utilization (Wolff et al., 1997). Large sample sizes would resolve   these two problems, because the larger the sample size the easier it is to   detect small or non-linear changes and the easier it is to control such   variables as prior service utilization.      A third challenge to conducting cost-benefit analysis is the   difficulties with using billing records data. Public data systems that have   been created for billing purposes usually report charges which may be much   higher than actual costs, while payment rates from Medicaid or other programs   may be lower than costs. Services which are not reimbursed (e.g. jail medical   care) are often not recorded in a way that is easy to assign costs. One partial   solution is to use data systems to gather information about the types and   quantity of services used by consumers, and then use other budget information   to get average costs for each type of service. This is particularly appropriate   when variability in the costs of other services, (e.g., regional variations in   the cost of a hospital day), is not relevant to measuring the effectiveness of   different programs (Dickey et. al., 1997).      The inconsistent reliability of billing records is related to the wider   problem of “messy data.” People who are homeless are often not   identified consistently when they use services, and many will have more than   one “unique identifier” in public data systems. If it is not possible   to gather data from all of these systems, significant cost shifting may not be   identified in the analysis. For example, a reduction in hospital use may be a   benefit, or may reflect increased rate of incarceration for study participants.   Another source of data problems is the changes in the data systems of public   health departments, hospitals and mental health systems data systems that has   accompanied the recent transition to managed health care. This often results in   significant year-to-year differences in data quality, format, and availability,   making it extremely difficult to get consistent information about service   utilization over time.      Homeless service provider capacity and willingness to participate in   data collection may also limit the availability of data. Direct service   providers have challenging jobs, are often required to use creative strategies   to engage consumers who may be resistant to the offer of services, and often   deliver services in unconventional settings. This leaves little time to fill   out paperwork, particularly when providers do not see analysis of the data they   collect data collection as helping their front-line efforts. This problem can   be mitigated to some degree if the collected data is analyzed and given back to   program staff quickly and in a format that is useful to them and their   consumers. Administrators can provide incentives for the collection of data by   proving a link between cost-benefit analysis and improvement in consumer   outcomes and/or in the acquisition of additional funding.       Because of the above challenges, powerful statistical techniques and a   very significant investment of resources are needed to achieve ideal levels of   scientific validity and reliability. However, this sort of research usually   takes years to complete, requires resources outside of the reach of most   homeless programs, and the results may not be published until three to five   years after the program intervention has been tested. Homeless advocates, then,   must be prepared to utilize a number of less thorough cost-benefit analyses to   develop an understanding of the savings represented by various approaches to   addressing homelessness. Fortunately, there are a variety of strategies   advocates can use that will increase the rigor of their cost-benefit analyses.   Forging partnerships with providers in other service systems, for example, can   address the problem of attrition by facilitating longitudinal tracking of their   consumers. Utilizing the MIS programs discussed above can help standardize   routine data collection and increase sample size for studies that include   multiple providers and multiple service systems. These MIS systems can also   facilitate speedy feedback from program administrators and funders that both   providers and consumers could use to measure and improve consumer outcomes.        The importance of system-wide cost-benefit analysis is evident when   considering programs whose consumers have multiple problems and utilize   multiple programs. For example, those people who visit public hospital   emergency rooms 12 to 50 (or more) times a year and the visible homeless people   in our streets and parks tend to have similar characteristics—chronically   homeless, out-of-treatment addicts, out-of-treatment mentally ill, and often   living with chronic health problems and at very high risk for HIV/AIDS. As we   move toward establishing new systems of accountability which measure outcomes   and cost-effectiveness, we need to be sure that we do not create fiscal or   other incentives for programs to “cream” and to exclude those most at   risk of failure. For example, programs that require 60 days of sobriety before   intake may achieve better outcomes related to employment and housing stability,   but may be completely inaccessible to most of the homeless people who are seen   in public hospital emergency rooms or city doorways.      As described earlier, to get a complete picture of cost effectiveness,   we need to look across systems and funding streams (e.g., federal, state, and   local, as well as “homeless,” health care, criminal justice, and   welfare). However, program and funding decisions are almost never made from   this global perspective. For example, it is hard to convince a county mental   health department to allocate funds for interventions that will create savings   in other systems by reducing entry into shelters, hospitals, or jails and that   may result in increased demand for the limited resources available within the   mental health system. Homelessness does not occur in isolation and so must not   be addressed as an isolated phenomenon. The need for cost-benefit analysis that   integrates data from a variety of systems, then, reflects the need for policies   that bring providers from a wide number of systems together to solve   homelessness.      Finally, cost-benefit analyses can provide powerful tools for homeless   advocates in the policy arena. Any intervention designed to reduce or end   homelessness requires funding, and quantitative arguments that a given   intervention can save money relative to not investing in that intervention can   go a long way to obtaining that funding. The matter of funding is perhaps the   clearest aspect of accountability to the public whose taxes fund the vast   majority of homeless programs and who has a vested interest in eliminating   homelessness.      Next Steps      The assessment of consumer needs, reporting of services, and the   measurement of consumer outcomes are where policy and practice meet.   Policymakers need information to drive decisions such as the allocation of   resources and the design of programs, and practitioners need data to understand   who they are serving, how they serve them, and to what effect. Thus,   information collection represents an intersection of interests and around which   there could be concerted effort to improve upon current practice. Consumers,   providers, funders, and the public, all stand to gain by a system of mutual   accountability that can be enabled by reasonable and accurate data collection.         At the most basic level, providers and consumers can be the keystone for   such an effort through their initiation or cooperation with the development   and/or implementation of standardized information collection. Organizations of   providers or “service systems” (i.e., local government) can foster   such standardization by establishing agreed upon protocols or through adoption   of existing mechanisms for collecting information. Service systems can use the   goal of accountability as one way to encourage participation in such   arrangements. Local government can also demonstrate their conviction and value   for such efforts by supporting the functions of assessment, tracking and   outcome assessment, financially and materially through equipment and technical   support.      Similarly, the federal government can support accountability for   consumers, funders, and the public by funding and even mandating the   establishment of minimum data collection requirements. At a minimum, homeless   programs can begin to be accountable to the public if jurisdictions were   required to report basic information such as: unduplicated counts of consumers   served, units of service by consumer type, and direct (i.e., housing stability,   reduced hospitalization, improved quality of life, even if just on a sample)   and indirect (i.e., rate of readmission) measures of service utilization. The   extensive data collection that has been part of the Department of Veteran   Affairs national homeless program has clearly demonstrated the possibility of   generating higher levels of accountability on a national scale in integrated   service systems (Kasprow et al., 1997; Seibyl et al., 1997). If inducements to   collect standardized information were in place, local, state and federal   government as well as consumer and provider advocacy groups and other   interested parties could exploit information technologies and establish   monitoring systems. These systems could be used to gauge demand for emergency   shelter, and measure duration of shelter stays, rate of shelter exit and   return, and assessment of consumer satisfaction.       With these tools at hand, an evidentiary discussion of the merits of   existing or proposed policies could ensue. Perhaps even more importantly, the   system of homeless services from a policy perspective can become more proactive   and apply such information technologies as an accountability check and as a   critical performance measurement for the larger social welfare and insurance   systems. For example, if welfare reform produces increases in shelter admission   or longer shelter stays, homeless providers and consumers would be in a   position to prove it. If increases in the development of support housing units   yield increases in the rate of shelter exits, local governments can show it. If   managed care of Medicaid programs is leading to premature discharge of hospital   patients, some of whom end up in the shelters, regulators can prove it. In this   way, the homeless system can become an accountability check on the larger arena   of public policy related to poverty.      Recommended Research Initiatives           Develop new instruments that measure consumer outcomes, provider     performance, and systems effectiveness and efficiency. These instruments should     be brief, reliable and valid so they can be used by practitioners without     interfering with their ability to meet their consumers’ needs and at the     same time can provide useful evaluative data. Such instruments should capture a     variety of data including: performance variables that measure inputs (services     provided), outputs (placements to housing, tenure in housing, increases in     income), ALOS (average length of stay), and organizational characteristics     (size, auspice, funding sources, staffing levels, ownership, revenues by     source, expenditure by category, etc.).        Forge a closer relationship between providers and researchers so     that provider-identified trends could become the source of formal research     projects.      Develop techniques and guidelines for tracking the outcomes of     consumers longitudinally. Protocols should be established for sample sizes and     periodicity of follow-up.       Develop benchmarking measures for performance. These include ratios     of inputs to outputs, which may include cost-benefit analyses. A crucial     component to these benchmarks is the development of a more common understanding     of what services and units of services mean in different settings so that they     can be more comparably measured. This common understanding should include input     from consumers, providers, funders, and researchers.      Conduct system-wide analysis that provides the “bigger”     picture policy effectiveness to answer the following questions: Do expenditures     yield reductions in costs in other systems? Do broad policy initiatives yield     overall gains in housing stability, costs, etc.?       Devise creative strategies (e.g., data integration strategies,     interagency task forces, or case reviews) to use data from different systems     that take different forms.      Adopt automated systems (e.g., software programs, or management     information systems) more widely in order to track consumers at the site of     service delivery.

GX021-55-8280745	"Homeless Youth: Research, Intervention, and Policy      by  Marjorie J. Robertson, Ph.D.  Paul A. Toro,   Ph.D.      Abstract      Homelessness among youth in the U.S. is disturbingly common, with an   estimated annual prevalence of at least 5 percent for those ages 12 to 17.   Although homeless youth appear throughout the nation, they are most visible in   major cities. Rigorous research on this special population is sparse, making it   difficult to capture an accurate and complete picture. Despite its limitations,   recent research describes homeless youth as a large and diverse group. Many   homeless youth have multiple overlapping problems including medical, substance   abuse, and emotional and mental problems. Literature suggests that   comprehensive and tailored services are needed that address both the immediate   and long-term needs of homeless youth. Where appropriate, services should   include assistance with meeting basic needs as perceived by youth as a gateway   to other needed services. In addition to serving those already homeless,   interventions are needed to prevent homelessness among at-risk youth.       Lessons for Practitioners, Policy Makers, and Researchers            As used here, the term “homeless youth” focuses on minors     who have experienced literal homelessness on their own—i.e., who have     spent at least one night either in a shelter or ""on the streets"" without adult     supervision. On occasion, where warranted by the research being discussed, the     term is also used to describe homeless young adults up to age 24.        Homelessness among youth in the U.S. is disturbingly common. With an     estimated annual prevalence of at least 5 percent for those ages 12 to 17,     adolescents appear to be at greater risk for literal homelessness than adults.     Although homeless youth appear throughout the nation, they are most visible in     major cities.        Research on homeless youth has major limitations. Rigorous research     on this special population is sparse, making it difficult to capture an     accurate and complete picture of homeless youth. Research would benefit from     studies that include large representative samples, reliable and valid measures,     comparison groups, and assessment of strengths as well as problems of homeless     youth. Research with this special population would likely benefit from more     input by service providers, policy makers, and the youth themselves.        Despite limitations of the literature, it seems clear that homeless     youth constitute a large and diverse group        Many youth have multiple overlapping problems. Many youth come from     homes where family conflict and child maltreatment are common. A wide range of     health and behavior problems have been documented among homeless youth,     including substance abuse, emotional and mental problems, and medical problems.     While some of these problems appear to be long-standing, others are probably     exacerbated by the stressful experiences of homelessness. Homeless youth,     especially those on the streets, sometimes resort to illegal activities such as     prostitution or drug dealing in order to survive. Many youth are victimized     while homeless.        Few interventions with homeless youth have been formally evaluated.     Careful program evaluation of services is sorely needed, especially based on     rigorous experimental designs.        The limited literature suggests that comprehensive and tailored     services are needed that address the immediate and long-term needs of homeless     youth. Where appropriate, services should include assistance with meeting basic     needs as perceived by youth as a gateway to other needed services. Other needed     services include screening and treatment for health, mental health, and     substance use problems, reconciling family conflict, and educational or     vocational training. In addition to serving those already homeless,     interventions designed to prevent homelessness among at-risk youth are needed.                Estimating Needs Based on Existing Research      Homelessness among young people in the United States and other nations   is a serious and complex problem.(1) The population of homeless youth seems to   have disproportionately high rates of health problems, emotional and behavioral   problems, and substance use. Homelessness itself potentially poses health risks   to youth and can interrupt normal socialization and education, which likely   affects a young person's future ability to live independently. This paper   provides a profile of homeless youth in the US, documenting their diversity and   their service needs. The paper then describes various intervention approaches   for homeless youth and discusses relevant social policy. It ends with   recommendations for future research.       Limitations of Existing Literature      The available literature on homeless adolescents has major limitations.   Rigorous research on this special population is sparse. Much research and other   information about homeless youth is fugitive and often dated. As a body of   research, it is much less rigorous than contemporary research on homeless   adults or families. Information on homeless youth in large urban areas is most   prevalent but may not generalize to other areas, and different definitions and   methods often prohibit meaningful comparisons. Cross-sectional samples over   represent longer-term homeless youth, which results in an over-reporting of   factors related to chronic homelessness. In addition, many studies lack   rigorous sampling strategies, which limits their generalizability.       Capturing a complete picture of homeless youth is difficult. In some   cases, what is known about a particular characteristic of homeless youth may be   based on a single study. Where multiple studies are available, findings may be   contradictory.       Often contradictory findings occur because the results from a study   depend very much on the source of its sample. Recent literature has relied on   four basic approaches to sampling. One surveys large groups of teens in the   general population and identifies youth from this pool who have a history of   homelessness (e.g., Ringwalt et al., 1998; Windle, 1989). These approaches   under-represent youth who have longer histories of homelessness or   institutional histories. The second approach draws youth from shelters (e.g.,   McCaskill et al., 1998) who are often younger and less likely to have previous   histories of homelessness. The third draws a sample from clinical settings such   as medical clinics (Yates et al., 1988). Such studies describe youth seeking   treatment and who are often very different from youth who do not seek   treatment. The fourth involves sampling from street locations where homeless   youth are known to congregate (e.g., Cauce et al., 1994a; Kipke et al., 1995;   Robertson, 1989). This street-sampling method, especially if it includes youth   who are 18 or older, generally yields a much more ""deviant"" profile of homeless   youth.       Despite its limitations, recent literature suggests that homeless youth   constitute a large and very diverse population.      Definitions      Defining what constitutes a ""homeless youth"" may seem fairly   straightforward but, in fact, the issues involved in the task are rather   complicated. Most researchers studying homeless persons tend to focus on   persons who are ""literally homeless"" (Rossi, 1989). In this paper, we take a   similar approach, using the term ""homeless youth"" to refer primarily to minors   on their own who have spent at least one night either in emergency shelter or   ""on the streets""—that is, in places outdoors or in improvised shelter   without parental supervision.(2)      An important decision to be made in defining ""homeless youth"" involves   age. Across the existing literature on homeless youth, the age range has varied   widely. In this paper, we will generally use the term ""homeless youth"" to refer   to those between the ages of 12 and 17. However, many studies of homeless youth   have also included young adults up to age 24. We will still review studies of   youth that also include young adults, but we will note the extended age range   involved.(3)       The target population for this review is heterogeneous and includes   youth described with a variety of terms in research and popular literature   (Kennedy et al., 1990; Robertson, 1996). These terms include ""runaways,"" who   have left home without parental permission, ""throwaways,"" who have been forced   to leave home by their parents, and ""street youth,"" who have spent at least   some time living on the streets. All studies reviewed here include youth who   have spent at least one night literally homeless, regardless of the conditions   of separation from their last home. It is important to note that some homeless   youth have experienced long or repeated episodes of homelessness, while others   are having their first experience with homelessness or have been homeless only   for a few days.      To avoid the sort of terminological confusion common in the existing   literature, throughout this paper we will refer to this overall group as   ""homeless youth.” However, when referring to specific reports or studies,   we may use the language of their authors specifically to identify the subgroup   of homeless youth they studied.       How Many Homeless Youth Are There?      The methodological problems in estimating the prevalence of homelessness   have been widely discussed and debated (Appelbaum, 1990; Blau, 1992; Burt,   1994, 1998; Culhane, Dejowski, Ibanez, Needham, & Macchia, 1994;   Foscarinis, 1991; Kondratas, 1991, 1994; Link, Susser, Strueve, Phelan, Moore   & Struening, 1994; Robertson, 1991; Rossi, 1989, 1994; Solarz, 1988; Toro   & Warren, 1999; Wright, Rubin, & Devine, 1998). Though most of this   debate has involved homeless adults, many of the controversies and   methodological problems identified in the literature apply to homeless youth.         Notwithstanding the debates, evidence suggests that the size of the   homeless youth population is substantial and widespread.(4) A recent   large-scale survey of U.S. adolescents provides the most comprehensive data to   date on the extent of homelessness among youth (Ringwalt, Greene, Robertson,   and McPheeters, 1998). In 1992 and 1993, researchers interviewed a nationally   representative household survey of 6,496 youth, ages 12 to 17, as part of the   National Health Interview Study (NHIS) sponsored by the Centers for Disease   Control and Prevention. To assess literal homelessness in the previous 12   months, youth were asked whether they had spent one or more nights in specific   types of places. These included: a youth or adult shelter; any of several   locations not intended to be dwelling places (i.e., in a public place such as a   train or bus station or restaurant; in an abandoned building; outside in a   park, on the street, under a bridge, or on a rooftop; in a subway or other   public place underground); or where their safety would be compromised (i.e.,   with someone they did not know because they needed a place to stay). Based on   these estimates, researchers estimated the annual prevalence of literal   homelessness among this age group to be 7.6 percent (or 1.6 million youth in a   given year). Even after revising their estimate down, removing youth whose only   experience with homelessness was in a ""shelter"" (a potentially ambiguous term   used in the interview), they still estimated that 5 percent had experienced   literal homelessness in the previous year (or more than 1 million youth in a   given year). The prevalence of homelessness did not vary significantly by   family poverty status (determined by parent’s reported income), geographic   area, or sociodemographic factors other than by gender (i.e., with   significantly higher rates of homelessness for males than females).       These estimates suggest that adolescents under age 18 may be at higher   risk for homelessness than adults. In 1990, researchers surveyed a nationally   representative sample of 1507 adults in households with telephones (Link,   Susser, Stueve, Phelan, Moore, & Struening, 1994). To assess literal   homelessness, adults were asked if they had ever considered themselves to be   homeless. Next they were asked if, while homeless, they had ever slept in a   shelter for homeless people or another temporary residence because they did not   have a place to stay, or in a park in an abandoned building, in the street, or   in a train or bus station. Among those who reported literal homelessness, those   who had been homeless within the previous five years were identified. Among US   adults,  five -year prevalence of self-reported homelessness among those   ever literally homeless was estimated at 3.1 percent (or 5.7 million adults in   a five-year period) and  lifetime  prevalence was estimated at 7.4 percent   (or 13.5 million adults). Other studies report similar lifetime rates (8%;   Manrique & Toro, 1994).      Geographic Distribution and Patterns of Homelessness      Based on the national survey of housed youth described above, those with   a history of recent homelessness were found throughout the nation and across   urban, suburban, and rural areas (Ringwalt et al., 1998). Nevertheless,   homeless youth appear to be most concentrated and visible in major cities (as   is the case for homeless adults and families). It is hard to determine whether   this apparent concentration in urban areas is a function of where researchers   are located or a ""true"" over-representation of homeless youth in urban areas.         Street Youth.  The research literature documents   significant numbers of youth actually living “on the streets” (i.e.,   not in shelters), primarily in certain large metropolitan areas on the east and   west coasts. While street youth have been studied in areas such as Los Angeles,   San Francisco, Seattle, and New York City, such youth have rarely been   documented in Midwestern and southern communities. While street youth represent   an unknown proportion of all homeless youth, this subgroup is of obvious   concern and much research has focused on it. As we will document in this   review, street youth generally show the most disturbing histories of life   disruptions and personal problems. This subgroup also often has longer   histories of homelessness and is less likely to use traditional services.      Local Residents .  Contrary to popular stereotypes,   several older studies show that most homeless youth are in fact ""local kids.""   For example, the majority (72%) of youths served in 17 runaway and homeless   youth programs nationally were from the immediate geographical area in which   the program was located (van Houten & Golembiewski, 1978). Most New York   City shelter clients were born in the city (Citizens' Committee for Children of   New York, 1983; New York State Council on Children and Families, 1984). In   Albany, New York, the majority were from Albany or other parts of the Capital   District (58%); only about one-quarter were from out of state (Council of   Community Services, 1984). Service providers in Los Angeles County reported   that the majority of their clients are from within the county (67%) or within   the state (18%; Rothman & David, 1985). Even in Hollywood, California,   where one might expect a more transient population, three-quarters of a sample   of street youth had been residents of the surrounding county for more than a   year (Robertson, 1989). Although most homeless youth seem to be local   residents, many homeless youth (25-42%) are not local.      History of Homelessness .  History of homelessness   seems to vary by whether youth are sampled from shelters or from the streets.   Studies of homeless youth obtained from shelters generally find that most   homeless youth have been homeless for relatively short periods of time and have   not experienced prior homeless episodes. For example, in a probability sample   of 118 adolescents (ages 12-17) from all six major youth shelters in the   Detroit metropolitan area, two-thirds had never been homeless before, and most   (86%) had been homeless for four weeks or less in their current episode   (McCaskill, Toro, & Wolfe, 1998). In contrast, in one Hollywood street   sample (ages 13 to 17), most youth demonstrated patterns of episodic (i.e.,   multiple episodes adding up to less than one year; 44%) or chronic homelessness   (i.e., being homeless for one year or longer; 39%) (Greenblatt & Robertson,   1993).      Characteristics of Homeless Youth      There is no typical homeless youth, and there is no single cause for   youth homelessness. The literature describes youth who experience homelessness   and offers varied explanations for why youth become homeless in the first place   or why they may remain so. Yet, it is difficult to determine the degree to   which any particular characteristic or experience might be a primary cause or a   contributing factor to youth homelessness. Below, we review these findings and   highlight the diversity of the homeless youth population.       Background Characteristics      Gender and Age.  In a national survey of youth (Ringwalt et   al., 1998) males were significantly more likely than females to report recent   homelessness. In local studies of homeless youth, gender representation seems   to vary depending on the source and age of the sample (Robertson, 1996).   Samples from shelters suggest either even numbers or more females. In contrast,   samples of street youth or older youth tend to include more males.       Based on recent studies, the vast majority of homeless youth appear to   be age 13 or older, although several studies have identified small numbers of   youth homeless on their own who are as young as nine (Clark & Robertson,   1996; Robertson, 1991).       Race or Ethnicity.  A national survey of youth found no   differences in rates of recent homelessness by racial or ethnic group   (Ringwalt, et al., 1998). While local studies tend to document that homeless   youth generally reflect the racial and ethnic make-up of their local areas,   three local studies also report over-representation of members of racial or   ethnic minorities relative to the local community. For example, African   Americans were over represented in a probability sample from shelters   throughout metropolitan Detroit, where 46 percent of 118 homeless youth were   African-American compared to 22 percent in the area's general population   (McCaskill et al., 1998). Both African Americans and Native Americans were   reported to be over-represented in a street sample from Seattle (N=229; ages   13-21; Cauce et al., 1994a) and a statewide sample from Minnesota (N=165, ages   11-17; Owen et al., 1998).       Sexual Orientation.  The rate of gay or bisexual   orientation among homeless youth varies across studies. In several studies with   shelter and street samples, 3 to 10 percent of youth have reported their sexual   orientation as gay, lesbian or bisexual (Greenblatt & Robertson, 1993;   Johnson, Aschkenasy, Herbers, & Gillenwater, 1993; Rotheram-Borus et al.,   1992b; Toro et al., 1998; Wolfe et al., 1994). Such rates suggest that homeless   youth are no more likely than non-homeless youth to report gay or bisexual   orientation when compared to the national rate of about 10 percent (Dempsey,   1994). However, higher rates of gay or bisexual identity (16 to 38%) are   reported in another set of studies.(5) The higher rates in these studies (16 to   38%) can be accounted for by samples that came from street or clinical sites;   tended to be older; included more men (who generally have higher rates than   women for gay or bisexual orientation); or came from areas with significant   concentrations of gay or bisexual persons in the larger community.      Family Poverty and Youth Homelessness.   Youth who   experience literal homelessness seem to come from  less  impoverished   backgrounds than homeless adults. For example, sheltered youth came from   significantly better socioeconomic circumstances than the sheltered adults in   Detroit (Bukowski & Toro, 1996). In a representative national sample of   youth (ages 12 to 17), those living with families in poverty  were not    more likely than other youth to have experienced homelessness in the   previous year (Ringwalt et al., 1998b). In contrast, among adults in a   representative national sample, those with lower socioeconomic status (SES)   were  more  likely to experience homelessness in the previous five years   (i.e., lower SES was defined by less than high school education; history of   public assistance; or current annual income of $20,000 or less) (Link et al.,   1994).       Some state and local studies suggest that disproportionate numbers of   homeless youth may come from lower-income or working-class families and   neighborhoods. For instance, for a broad four-state Midwestern sample of 602   homeless youth, two-thirds of the youths' parents (68%) reported family incomes   under $35,000 (ages 12-22, obtained from shelters, street sites, and drop-in   centers in urban, rural and suburban areas) (Whitbeck et al., 1997b). In a   Detroit shelter, most youth (69%) came from families in which the parents held   unskilled or blue-collar jobs (McCaskill et al., 1998). Most youth also (80%)   came from neighborhoods where the median family income was under $40,000 (which   was the approximate 1990 median family income for the total Detroit   metropolitan area). A more recent study in Detroit, with a broader probability   sample of 176 homeless youth (ages 13-17), obtained similar findings (Toro et   al., 1998).(6)      The profile of homeless youth observed in the literature is highly   dependent on the source of the sample (as observed for homeless adults by Link   and colleagues, 1994). Findings suggest that while family poverty may not be   related to homelessness among youth per se (given findings from the national   household survey), family poverty may be related to more chronic or repeated   homelessness (given recent local cross-sectional studies). Household surveys of    formerly  homeless youth may be more useful for setting lower-bound   estimates of the extent of homelessness among youth within a given period of   time. Such household surveys also likely present a more complete picture of the   larger homeless youth population and of factors that put a youth at risk for   homelessness. However, because of their method, they under-represent youth with   longer histories of homelessness or institutional stays. On the other hand, the   profile of  currently  homeless youth from studies with cross-sectional   samples is a “snap-shot“ of homeless youth on a given day, a   population which likely over-represents youth with more chronic histories of   homelessness. Since they represent the potential service population, such   cross-sectional profiles may be more useful for assessing needs and service   planning.      Family Conflict and Abuse .  Youth consistently   report family conflict as the primary reason for their homelessness. Sources of   conflict vary but include conflicts with parents over a youth's relationship   with a step-parent, sexual activity and sexual orientation, pregnancy, school   problems, and alcohol and drug use (Owen et al., 1998; Robertson, 1996; Toro,   Goldstein, & Rowland, 1998; Whitbeck, Hoyt, Tyler, Ackley, & Fields,   1997b).       Neglect and physical or sexual abuse in the home are also common   experiences. Across studies of homeless youth, rates of sexual abuse range from   17 to 35 percent, and physical abuse ranges from 40 to 60 percent (Busen &   Beech, 1997; Robertson, 1989; Rothman & David, 1985). For example, most   (75%) of 122 sheltered homeless youth (ages 12-17) in Detroit reported some   form of maltreatment (Boesky, Toro, & Wright, 1995). Neglect was most   common (57%), though many also reported physical (40%) and sexual abuse (31%).   Many experienced multiple forms of maltreatment as well (e.g., 16% reported all   three). When compared to housed peers, these homeless youth reported more   maltreatment and received higher scores on the standardized measures of family   conflict (Wolfe, Toro, & McCaskill, 1999). Homeless youth reported that   their parents were more physically and verbally aggressive toward them, and   that they were more verbally aggressive toward their parents. While violence   from these youth may very well have been in response to the parent's initial   violence, violence in these families seemed to occur in a context where both   the youth and their parents may be engaging in violent or provocative behavior   and where escalation is a dangerous prospect.       There is evidence that neglect and abuse may actually precipitate   separations of many youth from their homes. In a Hollywood street sample (ages   13-17), many youth specifically reported leaving their homes in the past   because of physical abuse (37%) or sexual abuse (11%). One-fifth of the sample   (20%) had at some earlier point been removed from their homes by the   authorities because of neglect or abuse (Robertson, 1989). Similarly, a study   of 356 street youth (ages 13-21) in Seattle found that 18 percent had been   removed from their homes (MacLean et al., 1999).       Families of Origin.   Many homeless youth report disrupted   family histories, which may contribute to the risk for homelessness. In a   Hollywood street sample (ages 13-17), many homeless youth never knew their   father (16%) or their mother (9%). Among the parents who were known, almost   three-quarters had been either divorced or never married (Greenblatt &   Robertson, 1993). In a probability sample of 122 sheltered homeless youth from   Detroit (ages 12-17), most grew up in single-parent (34%) or ""blended"" (32%)   families, many (22%) had been formally placed outside the home by officials,   and about half (48%) had lived with relatives (not parents) for a substantial   amount of time (Reed, 1994).       Residential Instability.  For many youth, homelessness   appears to be part of a long pattern of residential instability (Robertson,   1996). Consistently, homeless youth report repeated moves during their   lifetimes. For example, three quarters (73%) of a probability sample of 176   homeless youth in Detroit and surrounding counties had experienced at least one   move during the prior 12 months, and 55 percent had move twice in this time   period (ages 13-17; sampled from shelter, juvenile justice, and mental health   agencies) (Toro, 1998).       Many studies report that many homeless youth have repeated contacts with   public social service systems, many of which occurred at very early ages.   Across several studies, rates of foster care placements have ranged from 21   percent to 53 percent (Cauce, Paradise, Embry, Morgan, Lohr, Theofelis et al.,   1997; Owen et al., 1998; Robertson, 1989, 1991; Toro et al., 1998). Many   homeless youth also report stays in psychiatric facilities and criminal justice   facilities. For example, one-quarter of a Hollywood street sample (24%)   reported previous psychiatric hospitalizations (Robertson, 1989). Majorities in   two street youth samples in San Francisco and Hollywood reported stays in   juvenile detention facilities, and most had multiple detentions (Clark &   Robertson, 1996; Robertson, 1989).       Similarly, many adolescents in public systems have histories of   homelessness or residential instability. Adolescent psychiatric inpatients in   Los Angeles were found to have histories of high residential instability, with   an average of 3 runaway episodes; most (70%) also had a history of placement   into foster care or with an alternative caregiver (Mundy, Robertson, Robertson,   & Greenblatt, 1989). In Albany County, New York, between 33 percent and 40   percent of jail inmates (ages 16 to 20), were homeless (Council of Community   Services, 1984).       Evidence from two studies suggests that youth in residential placements   or in institutional settings risk becoming homeless upon separation from those   settings. In studies of street youth in Hollywood and San Francisco, more than   one-quarter of those who had been in foster care, group homes, or juvenile   detention became homeless upon their most recent separation. These youth   reported that they had spent their first night after leaving the respective   sites either in a shelter or on the streets (Clark & Robertson, 1996;   Robertson, 1989). (However, it is unclear whether these moves into homelessness   were the result of ""running away"" from the institutional placement or running   away from the discharge site after leaving the placement.)      Some providers suggest that youth who are returned inappropriately to   their prior homes due to lack of more appropriate alternative long-term   placements may also be at risk. A 1985 Boston report suggested that the lack of   available out-of-home resources (e.g., foster and group homes) is often more   influential in service planning than the needs of the adolescents and their   families. Half of the cases of first-time, out-of-home placements in one   setting were returned home despite the assessment of the emergency shelter   staff that this was an inappropriate placement decision (Greater Boston   Emergency Network, 1985).       Additionally, some youth ""age out"" of the foster-care system with   limited alternatives in place. One recent follow-up of such youth found that,   in the 12 months after ""aging out,"" a full 12 percent of the youth had spent at   least some time homeless (Courtney, Piliavin, Grogan-Kaylor, & Nesmith,   1998).       According to an older survey of providers, less than half (47%) of youth   in Los Angeles shelters were considered to have a realistic prospect of   returning to their homes (Rothman & David, 1985). Only 19 percent were good   candidates for immediate family reunification; and 25 percent were chronic   runaways who were very unlikely to be returned home or to placement. In   contrast to these findings, the majority of youth in federally funded shelters   nationally (57%) were reunited with families or placed in a safe living   environment (National Network of Runaway and Youth Services Inc., 1985).      School and Learning Difficulties .  Consistently,   studies suggest that many homeless youth have had interrupted or difficult   school histories, and many are currently not attending school. In several   studies, 25 to 35 percent of youth report being held back a year in school   (Clark & Robertson, 1996; Robertson, 1989; Upshur, 1986; Young, Godfrey,   Matthew, & Adams, 1983). In two studies of street youth, about one-quarter   report participation in special or remedial classes (Clark & Robertson,   1996; Robertson, 1989). In a Detroit sample of 176 homeless youth, 85 percent   had at some point been suspended from school, 26 percent had been expelled, and   15 percent had dropped out of school (Toro et al., 1998). One study found a   high rate (28%) of attention deficit disorder (Cauce et al., 1997). While a   history of school problems is prominent in the literature, its contribution to   homelessness is unclear. School problems are often hypothesized to be a   precipitant of family conflict that results in a runaway response. Others   suggest that school difficulties are merely symptoms of more pervasive family   problems.       Emotional and Mental Problems      Mental Disorders.  As for homeless adults, the assessment   of mental health status among homeless adolescents poses a number of problems   (Robertson, 1992; Toro, 1998). It is difficult to determine whether a homeless   youth's emotional disturbance at a given point in time is more causally   associated with an underlying emotional or mental disorder, the exigencies of   homelessness; chronic stresses such as family violence or parental substance   abuse; the youth's own use of alcohol or other drugs; or combinations of these   (Robertson, 1996).      In any event, several studies have documented high rates of emotional   and mental health problems among homeless youth. Rates of serious disorders   assessed with standardized instruments with diagnostic criteria range from 19   to 50 percent. For example, half of a sample of 150 youth from a New York City   shelter (50%) had at least one major affective disorder as assessed by the DISC   (Feitel et al., 1992). Among street youth in Hollywood (ages 13-17), 26 percent   met DSM-III criteria for major depression compared to 4-9 percent of community   and school samples of adolescents (Russell, 1996). In addition, many youth   reported serious psychotic symptoms (Mundy, Robertson, Greenblatt, &   Robertson, 1989). In another street sample (ages 13-21), 45 percent of the   youth received at least one DSM-III-R diagnosis for a mental disorder (Cauce et   al., 1997). These disorders included depression (19%), dysthymia (14%), mania   (13%), hypomania (9%), and psychosis (9%). In two different probability samples   from throughout metropolitan Detroit (one from shelters only, N=122; the other   from a variety of sites, including shelters, juvenile justice facilities, and   mental health centers, N=180), similar rates for these same mental disorders   were obtained (McCaskill et al., 1998; Toro et al., 1998).       It should be noted that in a rare study that included a   carefully-matched comparison group of housed youth, McCaskill and colleagues   found that the rates for many mental disorders were not significantly   different, although homeless youth did have significantly higher rates of   disruptive behavior disorders and alcohol abuse or dependence. Such findings   highlight the need for appropriate comparison groups when attempting to   identify distinctive characteristics of homeless youth.       As in the adult homeless population, the co-occurrence of substance   abuse disorders and serious mental health problems has also been documented in   several studies (Robertson, 1989; Rotheram-Borus, 1993; Russell, 1998; Shaffer   & Caton, 1984; Upshur, 1986; Yates, MacKenzie, Pennbridge, & Cohen,   1988).      In San Francisco, two-thirds of a street sample met DSM-III-R diagnostic   criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Clark & Robertson,   1996). Almost half of the sample (46%) had experienced PTSD symptoms related to   their disorders within the previous two weeks. Most frequently reported   traumatic events included seeing another person hurt or killed or being   physically or sexually assaulted themselves.       Suicide Attempts .  Studies of homeless youth   consistently report suicide attempt rates that are higher than rates for   normative groups. In a study of homeless youth in New York City shelters, more   than one-third (37%) had ever attempted suicide, and one-third of these had   made repeated attempts (Rotheram-Borus, 1993). Many in the sample (16%)   reported suicide attempts in the previous month. Nearly one-quarter (24%) of   runaways in New York City shelters (Shaffer and Caton, 1984) and 18 percent of   runaways using an outpatient health clinic in Los Angeles (Yates et al., 1988)   reported suicide attempts. About half (48%) of a Hollywood street sample (age   13-17) had attempted suicide, and more than half of these had repeated   attempts. More than one-quarter of the sample (27%) had attempted suicide   during the previous 12 months (Robertson, 1989). Other studies have reported   equally high rates (Ackley & Hoyt, 1997; Feitel et al., 1992; Powers,   Eckenrode, & Jaklitsch, 1990). All reported rates of suicide attempts for   homeless youth are higher than the lifetime rate for adults reported in the LA   ECA project which was 4 percent (Russell, 1998).      Conduct Problems.  A wide range of conduct problems are   reported for homeless youth. Though it appears that many such problems are of   long duration, some may develop or become exacerbated by experiences while   homeless. In three studies of homeless youth, rates of conduct disorder ranged   from 48 percent to 93 percent (Cauce et al., 1997; Feitel, Margetson, Chama,   & Lipman, 1992; Robertson, 1989) using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule   for Children (DISC) (Fisher, Wicks, Shaffer, Piacentini, & Lapkin, 1992).   It is important to note that current diagnostic criteria, in fact, consider the   experience of running away or being homeless, itself, as a key sign of conduct   disorder. However, even excluding such criteria, the rate of conduct disorder   among homeless youth is high. For instance, in a study of sheltered youth (ages   12-17) that used the DISC but excluded such criteria, the rate of disruptive   behavior disorders (primarily conduct disorder) was still high (39%) and   significantly greater than that in a matched housed sample (20%) (McCaskill et   al., 1998).      Research suggests that homeless youth may have associations with deviant   peers, some of whom may themselves be homeless. Gang activity appears common   among homeless youth. Across several studies on homeless youth, a history of   gang participation has ranged from 14 percent to 53 percent (Kipke, O'Conner,   Palmer, & MacKenzie, 1995; Robertson, 1989; Toro et al., 1998; Whitbeck et   al., 1997a).       Substance Use and Abuse      Youth Substance Use.  Though it is not possible to   determine from existing research the extent to which alcohol or other drug use   may contribute to youth homelessness, many youth report substance use   themselves and by their parents. Based on DSM-III criteria, most youth in a   Hollywood street sample (ages 13-17) met diagnostic criteria for substance use   disorders [i.e., alcohol disorders (48%), other drug disorders (39%), or both   (26%)] (Robertson, 1989; Robertson, Koegel, & Ferguson, 1989; Russell,   1998). About one-quarter (26%) reported a history of injection drug use (IDU).   The majority used illicit drugs before they experienced homelessness the first   time (74.7%), and several reported that their own drug use had contributed to   their leaving home (17.7%).       In a study of clients of a Hollywood outpatient clinic (ages 12-24),   recent alcohol and other drug use was significantly higher among homeless   compared to non-homeless youth using the same clinic (48% vs. 19%,   respectively). Many reported IDU (8% compared to 0.1% of non-homeless clients)   (Kipke, Montgomery, & MacKenzie, 1993). About half of youth in New York   City shelters (ages 11-19) reported physical symptoms of substance abuse, and   17 percent reported addiction symptoms (Koopman, Rosario, and Rotheram-Borus,   1994). In a probability sample of sheltered homeless youth, 21 percent met   DSM-III-R criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence and 24 percent for drug   abuse or dependence (McCaskill et al., 1998).      Rates of substance use seem to vary dramatically by history of   homelessness. In three large national samples, street youth showed the highest   rates of substance use followed by sheltered youth and runaways and finally   housed youth (Greene, Ennett, & Ringwalt, 1997). Comparing youth who   reported having run away once, two or more times, or never, Windle (1989) found   a similar pattern, with those having multiple homeless episodes showing the   highest rates of substance use or abuse.       As with the general population, rates of substance use and abuse   increase with age. Among homeless clients of a community-based clinic in   Hollywood, older youth were significantly more likely to report use of alcohol,   stimulants, narcotics, and injection drug use (Kipke, 1995). Among a   probability sample of 122 youth in shelters in metropolitan Detroit (ages   12-17), older youth had significantly higher rates of DSM-III-R diagnoses of   drug abuse or dependence (Boesky et al., 1997). However, rates for the youth   overall were significantly lower than homeless adults from shelters in the same   city (Bukowski & Toro, 1996).       Parental Substance Use .  One study suggests that   parental alcohol use may contribute to youth homelessness. In a Hollywood   street sample, 24 percent of the youth (ages 13-17) reported that they had ""run   away or left home"" at least once because their parent or step-parent had an   alcohol problem which caused frequent arguments or physical violence   (Robertson, 1989). Other studies suggest high substance use by parent. For   example, a study of intake records for over 44,000 youth in federally-supported   shelters reported that drug abuse by the parent figure was the principal   problem of 16 percent to 18 percent of youth (U.S. Government Accounting   Office, 1989). For youth in 17 shelters across the nation, parental alcohol   abuse was correlated significantly with runaway behavior (van Houten &   Golembiewski, 1978). Miller, Hoffman, and Duggan (1980) found that 41 percent   of runaways reported that one or both of their parents had a problem with   alcohol and 17 percent reported that one or both parents had a serious drug   problem. Toro et al. (1998) found that 44 percent of homeless youth reported   that one or both of their parents had at some point received treatment for   alcohol, drug, or psychological problems.       Health Status .  Like homeless adults, homeless youth   appear to be at greater risk than their domiciled counterparts for a variety of   medical problems, and their health often deteriorates while homeless. Youth on   the streets in particular often sleep too little, and when they do, it is often   in an unsafe, unclean, or overcrowded environment (Clark & Robertson,   1996). They may have little money and eat poorly. They may have little   opportunity to maintain adequate personal hygiene and are hard put to find the   time or place to recuperate adequately from illness or injury. They suffer   disproportionately from traumatic injury, skin infestations, infectious   diseases, nutritional disorders, and other conditions (Kennedy et al., 1990;   Yates et al., 1988). Because of the patient mix and the concentration of health   problems that are less common in conventional medical practices, a   specialization of sorts in ""street medicine"" has developed among health   professionals who treat homeless youth, (Kennedy et al., 1990).      Sexual Behavior .  The literature reveals high rates   of sexual activity among homeless youth, but variable rates of protection   against pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases. Studies consistently report   that the majority of youth (i.e., from 62% to 93%) are sexually active (i.e.,   had sex at least once). For example, in New York City shelters, most males   (93%; ages 12 to 17) were sexually active (Rotheram-Borus, Meyer-Bahlburg,   Koopman, Rosario, Exner, Henderson et al., 1992a; 1992b). Similarly, 92 percent   a Hollywood street sample (ages 13 to 17) were sexually active. While most of   these (82%) reported using birth control the last time they had sex, only about   half reported condom use (Robertson, 1989). In another study of Hollywood   street youth (ages 12-23), most (70%) reported recent (30 day) sexual activity   (Kipke et al., 1995). In a sample of 602 homeless youth from 4 Midwestern   states, Whitbeck et al. (1997b) found that most youth had intercourse prior to   age 16 (70% of the males and 85% of the females, ages 12 to 22). Among those   reporting intercourse in the past year, only one-third (36%) reported always   using condoms. In Detroit, Wolfe, Levit, and Toro (1994) found that 71 percent   of homeless youth (age 12 to 17) in shelters had ever had intercourse and 43   percent reported being currently sexually active. In another Detroit study,   Toro et al. (1998) found that 62 percent of 176 homeless youth (age 13 to 17)   reported ever having had vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Both studies also found   that, compared to matched housed youth, the homeless youth were significantly   more sexually active.       Pregnancy.   In four local studies, the lifetime rate of   pregnancy for homeless girls has ranged from 27 to 44 percent, and 6 to 22   percent have reported having given birth (Cauce, Morgan, Wagner, Moore, Sy,   Wurzbacher et al., 1994a; Owen et al., 1998; Robertson, 1989; Toro et al.,   1998; Whitbeck et al., 1997b). Studies have identified as many as 10 to 20   percent of homeless young women who are currently pregnant (e.g., Toro et al.,   1998; Robertson, 1996). Young women who are pregnant while homeless are at risk   for low-birthweight babies and high infant-mortality because they are unlikely   to get prenatal care and may not have adequate health and dietary habits   (Kennedy et al., 1990; Sullivan & Damrosch, 1987).       Risk for HIV and AIDS.  Homeless youth present a high-risk   profile for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Specific high-risk   sexual and drug use behaviors including multiple sex partners, high-risk sexual   partners, survival sex, minimal condom use, injection drug use, sharing   needles, and having sex while high (Allen, Lehman, Green, Lindergren, Onorato,   Forrester, Field Services Branch, 1994; Kipke et al., 1995; Greenblatt &   Robertson, 1993; Rosenthal, Moore, & Buswell, 1994; Rotheram-Borus, 1991,   1992a, 1992b; Toro et al., 1998). Risk behaviors for HIV exposure are more   common among youth who are older, homeless longer, and not staying in shelters.   Despite knowledge about transmission modes, many homeless youth do not use   protection against exposure.      Recent seroprevalence studies in clinical samples suggest that HIV is   already a widespread health problem among homeless youth and young adults in   some areas. In one study of HIV rates in clinical samples of homeless youth   ages 15 to 24, the rate of HIV-positives across four cities was 2 percent.   Rates were higher among youth over age 19, and they varied dramatically by   site. These included Dallas (0%), Houston (1%), New York City (4%), and two   sites in San Francisco (2% and 7%) (Allen et al., 1994). Similarly, in a   medical clinic in Covenant House in New York City, 6 percent of ""street kids""   overall tested HIV-positive (6% of young men and 5% of young women; Kennedy et   al., 1990). Covenant House health clinics also produced elevated rates in New   Orleans (3%), Fort Lauderdale (3%) and Houston (2%). Because these communities   have higher rates of HIV infection generally, the high rates of HIV in New York   or San Francisco may not generalize to other areas. Yet the risk of exposure   poses a real threat to homeless youth across geographic areas who report   high-risk behaviors.      Survival While Homeless      Shelter, Food, and Other Basics Needs      Many youth have difficulty meeting basic needs. For example, in a San   Francisco street sample (ages 15 to 19), most youth reported that they had   spent the previous 30 nights outside, in abandoned buildings (or ""squats""),   traveling, and in public places such as doorways, allies, parks, beaches, and   under bridges. Very few had stayed even one night in a shelter (15%). Several   reported institutional stays including one young woman who had been in a   hospital for childbirth. One youth reported spending three nights in a dumpster   (Clark & Robertson, 1996). In this same study, youth who slept in public   spaces often formed groups in which individuals took turns staying awake to   keep guard. A few reported committing offenses that resulted in arrest in order   to secure ""shelter"" for the night (Clark & Robertson, 1996). Providers   occasionally report that minors sometimes misrepresent their age to gain access   to adult shelters.       In a study of Hollywood street youth (ages 13-17), most (79%) identified   ""improvised shelter"" as their usual sleeping place. This included abandoned   buildings, vehicles, parks and beaches, loading docks, rooftops, and crawl   spaces under houses. Relatively few in the sample had used shelters recently   (l5%) due largely to the scarcity of shelter beds in the area (i.e., at the   time, 50 youth shelter beds throughout Los Angeles County) (Robertson, 1989;   Greenblatt & Robertson, 1993). Shelters or meal programs were the most   usual sources of food. Yet about half of the youth (48%) reported difficulty   getting adequate food, and the majority (57%) had spent at least one day in the   past month with nothing to eat. Many also reported difficulty finding a place   to clean up, to obtain medical care, or to find clothing (Greenblatt &   Robertson, 1993; Robertson, 1989). Youth reported little if any income, most of   which came from legal sources such as odd jobs or family gifts. However, income   from illegal activities was also common including sex work and drug dealing   (Robertson, 1989).      Anecdotal reports from staff and youth suggest that staff at shelters   and other sites sometimes exclude youth with severe emotional problems, those   dangerous to themselves or others, those with alcohol or drug problems, or   those with HIV infection.       Resorting to Illegal Activities      Many homeless adolescents report illegal behavior. However, some of this   behavior may be part of their strategies for survival. Some illegal behaviors   may provide for basic needs directly (for example, breaking into an abandoned   building for a place to stay or trading sex for food or shelter) while others   may generate income to meet basic needs (for example, selling drugs or sex). In   a 4-state Midwestern sample of 602 homeless youth, 23 percent reported   stealing, 14 percent forced entry to a residence, 20 percent dealt drugs, and 2   percent engaged in prostitution (Whitbeck et al., 1997b). In an unusual sample   of 409 Los Angeles street youth (ages 12-23), which included many who were not   literally homeless but who were ""integrated"" into the street economy, 43   percent of the sample (46% of young men and 32% of young women) reported ever   engaging in survival sex, which included trading sex for food, a place to stay,   drugs, or money (Kipke et al., 1995). Of these, 82 percent traded sex for   money, 48 percent for food or a place to stay, and 22 percent for drugs. Almost   one-quarter of the sample (22%) reported survival sex in the previous 30 days.   Similarly, among clients of a Hollywood health clinic, 26 percent of runaway   clients reported involvement in ""survival sex"" compared to only 0.2 percent   among non-runaway clients (Yates et al., 1988). Similarly, about one-third of a   Hollywood street sample (ages 13-17) reported ever trading sex for money, food,   or shelter. Most of these (75%) reported doing so only when homeless. Sex also   had been traded for drugs by 11 percent of the sample. About half of the sample   had ever sold drugs (52%), although many reported doing so only when homeless   (21%). Although generating cash income was the principal motive for drug sales,   one-fifth of the sample also sold drugs to support their own drug use.       Victimization      Studies have reported high rates of victimization among homeless youth.   Runaway clients of an outpatient clinic in Hollywood sought treatment for   trauma (4%) and rape (2%) at rates which were two and one-half and three times   higher than non-runaway clients (Yates et al., 1988). The majority of a   Hollywood street sample had been victimized in the past twelve months,   including high rates of physical assault (42%) and sexual assault (13%;   Greenblatt & Robertson, 1993). In their 4-state Midwestern sample, Whitbeck   et al. (1997b) documented a wide range of types of victimization. While   homeless, 18 percent of the boys and 12 percent of the girls had been beaten up   more than once, 11 percent and 7 percent had been robbed more than once, and 11   percent and 4 percent had been assaulted with a weapon more than once. These   researchers have also found evidence for a ""risk-amplification"" model for   understanding adolescent homelessness (see Ackley & Hoyt, 1997; Whitbeck,   Hoyt, & Ackley, 1997a; Whitbeck & Simons, 1990). This model proposes   that a variety of background characteristics, including maltreatment, poverty,   parental psychopathology, and negative parenting, all put homeless youth at   risk for poor outcomes. Homelessness also puts the youth in a context conducive   to further negative outcomes (e.g., through experiences on the street and with   deviant peers), which amplifies the impact of the background characteristics.   In some recent and disturbing findings based on a 5-month follow-up of 354   street youth from Seattle, Hoyt and Ryan (1997) found that those with a prior   history of victimization were the most likely to be victimized during the   follow-up period.      Long-Term Outcomes      Will These Youth Become Homeless Adults?       Since the mid-1970s, scholars and service providers have expressed   concern that homeless youth would become a new generation of homeless adults   (Blumberg, Shipley, & Barsky, 1978; Miller, 1991). There is no longitudinal   evidence that homeless youth are, in fact, at heightened risk for homelessness   later in adulthood (although a few ongoing studies are investigating this;   Cauce et al., 1994b; Toro et al., 1998). Nevertheless, recent evidence does   indicate that 9 percent to 26 percent of homeless adults were first homeless as   children or youth (Susser, Streuning, & Conover, 1987; McChesney, 1987;   Zlotnick et al., in press). These rates are higher for homeless adults than   adults in the general population among whom about 7 percent have  ever    experienced homelessness (Link et al., 1994; Manrique & Toro, 1995).       Other Long-term Outcomes      In a 30-year follow-up of clients from a child guidance clinic, Robins   and O'Neal (1959) found that runaways had higher rates of mental disorder,   divorce, and arrest than non-runaways. Olson et al. (1980) obtained similar   results in a 12-year follow-up of 96 runaways from the Washington, DC area.   Those who had run away more than once, as compared to their siblings or those   who ran away only once, had poorer work histories, more involvement with the   justice system, and were more likely to be single. More recently, Windle (1989)   used the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to compare 14-15 year olds who   had never run away (n=1,139) to those who had run away once (n=61) or more   times (n=41). After four years, he found that the repeat runaways reported more   alcohol and drug use and abuse, more delinquent behaviors, lower self-esteem,   and a higher rate of dropping out of school, while the one-time runaways fell   about midway between the never and repeat runaways on most of these domains.         Intervention Strategies      Strategies are needed to reduce the amount of harm a youth encounters   while homeless. In the short term, emergency and transitional services are   needed for those who are currently homeless. Providers suggest that the younger   youth and those in their first episode of homelessness are more likely to   reconcile with families if the homeless episode is responded to with early   intervention.       For the longer term, however, strategies are also needed to reduce the   number of youth who become homeless. Homelessness itself presents physical and   mental health risks to the youth. It may also represent an interruption of   normative socialization and education, which will likely affect the ability to   live independently in the future.       Providing Needed Services to Homeless Youth      There is little comprehensive information on model programs serving   youth or young adults who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.       Comprehensive and Tailored Services      Homeless youth and young adults face many barriers to services in the   larger community (Clark and Robertson, 1996). Most are survivors of difficult   situations, and many are skeptical and distrustful toward adults. Many street   youth in particular have become accustomed to taking care of themselves and   some seem unwilling to come into service sites or eventually return to a family   or foster home in which they could lose a great deal of control over their   everyday lives. Many homeless youth have serious emotional or mental problems.   In addition, interventions may have to take place in the context the youth's   substance use and behavior problems. While many youth report only occasional   drug or alcohol use, others cycle in and out of more hard core drug use,   complicating any intervention effort (Clark & Robertson, 1996). In many   cases providers first may want to help homeless youth meet their immediate   needs. Basic services can then provide a gateway to other needed services.         Providers have suggested that since homeless youth have diverse needs   which cross agency jurisdictions, they require a comprehensive service array   (New York State Council, 1984). Homeless youth need many services, including   housing, education, vocational training, health care, mental health care,   substance abuse services, and legal assistance. Coordination among providers is   needed to strengthen their ability to serve the population. Interagency   cooperation could be augmented by linkages with community non-profit agencies   serving youth. Bringing together stakeholders from all parts of the youth-care   community can help build the needed continuum of care for homeless youth by   consolidating resources and to forging service alliances (Mangano, 1999).       Based on similar interventions designed for persons with mental   disorders (Morse, Calsyn, Allen, Tempelhoff, & Smith, 1992; Toro, Passero   Rabideau, Bellavia, Baeschler, Wall et al., 1997), Cauce and colleagues (1993,   1994a, 1997) have developed a comprehensive approach to case management for   street youth ages 13-21. The approach involves many components including   careful assessment and treatment planning, linkage to a full range of needed   community services, crisis counseling, flexible use of funds to support youth,   small caseloads (no more than 12 cases per counselor), and open-ended service   provision. Preliminary findings have suggested some modest positive gains over   a 3-month follow-up period for the program youth in comparison to other street   youth randomly assigned to ""regular case management"" (Cauce et al., 1994a).         Special Populations with Special Needs      There are many different groups among homeless youth with special needs.   These include gay and bisexual youth; non-English speakers; those who have been   homeless longer; those involved in sex work; pregnant teens; and youth with   serious medical, emotional, behavioral, or substance use problems. Staff of   shelters, drop-in centers, medical clinics and other programs might better be   trained to deal with the particular circumstances, experiences, and special   needs of such groups (Rotheram-Borus, 1991b; 1993). Young adults (e.g., ages 18   to 24) are another special group that often falls through the cracks between   public systems of care because they are ineligible for treatment in   children’s service systems at the same time that the their developmental   needs may not be met by adult service systems.      Shelters as Interventions Sites      Besides providing a safe place to spend the night, youth shelters have   often served as sites from which to mount special programs and therapeutic   interventions (Rotheram-Borus, 1991b). However, some homeless youth and young   adults never use shelters or use them only intermittently (Kipke et al., 1995;   Robertson, 1996). Shelters sometimes exclude youth most in need of intervention   because they lack adequate staff or appropriate facilities to deal with youth   who have special needs. According to anecdotal reports, youth most likely to be   excluded from shelters are those who pose a threat to institutional routine or   safety (i.e., those who are actively psychotic, suicidal, or intoxicated; or   those with HIV or other infectious diseases). At times, appropriate or   accessible shelter beds for youth are not available. In addition, many youth   may choose not to use shelters because there are too many demands on their   behavior or the programs are too structured (Chelimsky, 1982; Clark &   Robertson, 1996; Rotheram-Borus, 1991b; Rothman & David, 1985). To reach   such youth, services can be provided in sites other than shelters. Educational   and treatment interventions have been located successfully within low-demand   community sites such as drop-in centers as well as through outreach programs to   youth on the streets.      Treatment Services      A number of studies have documented high need for treatment but low   utilization of formal treatment programs for medical, mental, and substance use   services (Farrow, Deisher, Brown, Kulig, & Kipke, 1992; Kennedy, 1991;   Johnson, Aschkenasy, Herbers, & Gillenwater, 1993; Morey & Friedman,   1993; Robertson, Koegel, & Ferguson, 1989). In most states, minors may   consent to some types of health care including treatment for alcohol, drug or   mental health problems, true emergencies, or treatment for sexually transmitted   diseases (Kennedy et al., 1990). Even so, few homeless youth have adequate   contact with the health care system, which may result in delayed treatment for   acute and chronic health problems.       Providers have identified specific barriers to treatment in formal   settings. These include the youth's mistrust of health professionals, the lack   of social skills to cooperate in their own care, failure to keep appointments   for follow-up care, failure to follow-through in treatment once immediate   distress has been relieved, and problems in transferring care when a youth gets   moved to a different neighborhood (Kennedy et al., 1990). Aggressive screening   of homeless youth can identify such health problems as a first step in   providing proper treatment and health care. In designing treatment services,   many of which have been developed for adults, it will be important to adapt the   services to the specific needs of homeless youth and young adults.       Researchers have recommend that homeless youth and young adults be   targeted for health education and prevention programs, given their high risk   for exposure to and transmission of HIV, other STDs, and other infectious   diseases (Rotheram-Borus, 1991a). Studies suggest that accessible HIV-testing   services will be used by homeless youth (Greenblatt & Robertson, 1993).   Because of high rates of prior suicide attempts, current ideation, plans for   suicide, and depression, staff working with homeless youth should receive   training in assessing suicidality (Rotheram-Borus, 1993).       Education and Job Training Opportunities      Once homeless on their own, homeless youth face extraordinary economic   problems. Homeless youth and young adults often need to become part of the work   force. Unfortunately, most are ill prepared for work, requiring extensive job   training and placement services. Vocational and occupational programs are a   fundamental part of the transition from the streets to mainstream society.   Providers recommend programs that enable these young people to complete high   school, college, or some alternative education, and to develop marketable   skills (Morey & Friedman,1993; National Network of Runaway and Youth   Services, Inc., 1985).       Interventions to Prevent Homelessness      Though there has been considerable discussion in the literature on   services for youth who are already homeless, little attention has been given to   how we might prevent homelessness in the first place. Below, we consider two   basic approaches to accomplishing prevention of homelessness among youth.       Preventing Repeated Homelessness .  For youth and   young adults who have already experienced homelessness, an obvious goal of   services should be to prevent any future homeless episodes. Such interventions   could target youth early in their ""homeless careers"" (e.g., youth with a single   short experience with homelessness or little or no time spent on the streets).   Toro and Bukowski (1995) have recently advocated for an expanded service   delivery model for youth shelters. This model would supplement the crisis   intervention approach common in most youth shelters to provide a variety of   long-term services for youth and their families. Many have recognized this need   and have proposed intensive case management programs (e.g., Cauce et al.,   1993), ""full-service"" shelters (e.g., Rotheram-Borus, 1991), transitional   living programs for those who cannot be reunited with their families (MacAllum   et al., 1997), and other ongoing services for youth after their brief stays in   a shelter. Service providers often would like to offer such expanded services,   but have limited resources to do so (Sedlak, Schultz, Wiener, & Cohen,   1997). Since most homeless youth eventually return to their families, providers   might consider active outreach to all family members in addition to the youth   themselves to help the families cope and remain intact.      Primary Prevention .  Primary preventive   interventions would attempt to prevent homelessness and other harmful outcomes   among adolescents in the general population. Such interventions are generally   consistent with a youth development approach to improving the lives of youth   (Family & Youth Services Bureau, 1996) and have proven effective in dealing   with a wide range of problems in children and youth (Durlak & Wells, 1997;   Price, Cowen, Lorion, & Ramos-McKay, 1988). In the case of homelessness,   interventions could identify youth at risk for residential instability and   homelessness or could be targeted even more broadly. Based on research   findings, there appear to be a number of risk factors for both youth and adult   homelessness. These include socioeconomic status, problematic family   environments (including family violence and substance abuse), and a history of   conduct problems and delinquency. Implementation of family-based preventive   interventions would be one useful approach. School-based interventions might   also be effective at preventing homelessness and other harmful outcomes. Peer   groups have been utilized in a number of existing effective prevention programs   (e.g., Pedro-Carroll, Cowen, Hightower, & Guare, 1986) and could be useful   in programs to prevent homelessness. Child-protective services in many   localities, with often-limited resources, frequently seem to focus primarily on   the removal of youth from abusive homes and the prosecution of abusive parents.   Intervening with families earlier might help prevent homelessness for many   youth.       Recent longitudinal findings of Courtney et al. (1998) and others   suggest that youth with histories of residential instability, foster care, and   other out-of-home placements are at heightened risk for homelessness during   both adolescence and in early adulthood. Such groups could be targeted for   intervention. For youth in public institutions including foster care, juvenile   detention, and psychiatric institutions, more careful and effective discharge   planning may be helpful in preventing subsequent homelessness. However, more   knowledge is needed about what specific elements might constitute. Furthermore,   it is critical that youth be tracked for a substantial period of time following   discharge, since homeless episodes may not be immediate but can occur months   after the discharge.       Another way to prevent homelessness is to create more alternative   residential settings for youth. Policies could continue to encourage foster   placement with extended family members who would take in youth who have already   (or who are about to) separate from their family of origin. Some homeless youth   already make use of extended family members as an occasional housing resource,   suggesting their desirability as a placement. This strategy may increase the   ability or motivation of extended family members to house the youth.       For foster youth, independent living skills programs could be upgraded   for youth in foster care preparing for independent living (e.g., those ""aging   out"" of the foster care system at age 18). The age of eligibility for foster   care or other placements could be extended to age 21 or later. Another strategy   would be to extend support services one to two years beyond the exit from   foster care. A striking number of homeless youth become homeless upon   separation from foster or group home placements. We suggest that special   training for foster parents dealing with high-risk youth, especially those who   have already been homeless, might help extend periods of residential stability.         Policy Issues      Residential Options .  As is true for homeless   adults, long-term housing with independent-living services is needed.   Transitional services also are needed. Most services for youth and young adults   are emergency or short-term, with care limited to crisis periods. Youth who   lack basic skills such as money management, education, and vocational training   need intensive support to achieve independent living. A recent national   evaluation of the Transitional Living Program (TLP) for Homeless Youth (based   on a quasi-experimental design implemented in 10 sites with 175 homeless youth,   most ages 18 to 21), found some positive program effects over a 6-month   follow-up period (MacAllum, Kerttula, & Quinn, 1997).       Youth Advocacy and Legal Issues .  Greater monitoring   of foster homes and group homes may be needed to protect youth while they are   in placement. Assigning caseworkers or special advocates to work with the   individual youth may help identify and resolve problems before youth leave   placements or institutional settings (English, 1991). Homeless youth who are   minors often are denied services because of their legal status and the   consequent need for parental consent. State laws vary considerably regarding a   minor's ability to give consent. In many states, it is technically illegal to   be a homeless minor not under the supervision of a guardian. In most states,   unemancipated minors can legally give consent for care for some services as   mentioned earlier. However, legislative guarantees are needed to delineate   circumstances under which homeless minors may consent to other types of   services (English, 1991; Johnson, Aschkenasy, Herbers, & Gillenwater, 1993;   Kennedy et al., 1990). Requirements to establish emancipation could be   simplified or could be changed to increase youth access to entitlement   programs, health care, and other services, without necessarily relieving the   parent of responsibility.       The recently passed federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity   Reconciliation Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-193) replaced the Aid to Dependent   Children (ADC) program with the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF)   program nationwide. Under provisions of TANF, teen parents receiving assistance   must now live under the supervision of a guardian. While these welfare reforms   have been politically popular, they may serve to make if even more difficult   for homeless youth who have children to receive welfare benefits. Youth without   children, even those who are legally emancipated minors, have virtually no   access to public assistance in most localities. It is our view that, if the   goal is to serve homeless youth better, expanding eligibility for benefits,   rather than further restricting them, may be the better policy course.       Youth Leaving State Institutions.   Not all homeless youth   have received services from state youth-care agencies such as foster care,   group homes, or juvenile detention. However, these represent an important   subgroup of the larger homeless youth population (Mangano, 1999). Mangano   suggests three key components for any youth-care agency that seeks to reduce   and end homelessness among those it serves: discharge planning, aftercare   tracking, and expanding “next-step” residential options. Early in the   case-management process, agency caseworkers could develop service plans for   clients that help youth establish and maintain contacts with community   resources (such as health care, job training, and recreation) that would   ideally continue after discharge. He also suggests that aftercare tracking   (which is rarely done currently) will allow state agencies to review their   effectiveness in preparing the youth for a return to their families or   independent living. Finally, nn increase in the number of “next-step”   residential and housing resources is needed since youth who have been in state   care or institutions often have less skills or resources needed to maintain   their own housing. Such residential options could include a variety of supports   such as substance abuse and mental health services, life-skills training, and   peer counseling.       Evidence is mounting that the lack of discharge planning and aftercare   at state agencies can leave youth and young adults ill-prepared for a return to   their families or for independent living. Providers suggest that increased   aftercare tracking by state agencies would help inform discharge planning and   other efforts to prevent homelessness among at-risk youth.       Recommendations for Future Research      Needs Assessment: Methodological Issues       Sampling and Measurement.    Many studies on homeless youth   provide only very sketchy information on the sampling methods used. Researchers   studying homeless  adults  have recently found important differences   depending on the sources of their samples (e.g., Hannappel, Calsyn, &   Morse, 1989; Link et al., 1994 ; Robertson, Zlotnick, and Westerfelt, 1998;   Toro et al., 1999b; Toro & Wall, 1991). Studies of homeless youth (Greene   et al., 1997) reviewed in this paper suggest that sampling effects may be even   greater for homeless  youth .       We recommend that future research on homeless youth carefully document   the sampling methods used. A growing number of large-scale studies of homeless   adults have refined probability sampling procedures for selecting   representative groups from a variety of settings across large geographical   areas (e.g., Dennis, 1991; Koegel, Burnam, & Morton, 1996; Robertson,   Zlotnick, and Westerfelt, 1997; Toro et al., 1999b). We recommend that future   research consider adapting such methods for homeless youth (we are aware of   only one ongoing study that has done this; see Toro et al., 1998).       Another common flaw in the existing research literature involves the use   of standardized instruments without documented reliability and validity for use   with homeless youth. In addition, very few common measures have been used   across studies, making comparison of findings difficult. We recommend that   researchers give more attention to documenting the psychometric properties of   standardized measures they use and, where appropriate, use measures that have   been used in previous studies to enhance comparability across studies.       Comparison Groups.   The existing literature tends to paint   a rather disturbing picture of the homeless youth population. Homeless youth   seem to have multiple, often overlapping problems, including serious medical   and emotional health problems, substance abuse, sexual and social risk taking,   and poor educational attainment. However, without appropriate comparison   groups, it is impossible to determine the degree to which these problems are   unique to homeless youth. While recent studies on homeless adults and families   have benefited from appropriate comparison groups (e.g., Shinn, Knickman, &   Weitzman, 1991; Sosin, 1992; Toro et al., 1995; Wood, Valdez, & Hayashi,   1990), few studies on homeless youth have included appropriate comparisons (see   McCaskill et al., 1998; Wolfe et al., 1999). Comparison groups are essential to   get a clearer picture of the unique features that distinguish homeless youth   from other youth.       Also, carefully analyzed qualitative interview data has proven useful in   understanding the needs of homeless adults and families (Banyard, 1995; Koegel,   1992; Underwood, 1993) and a few such studies have been done on homeless youth   (e.g., Lagloire, 1990). Similar approaches to needs assessment may be useful in   studies of homeless youth. When assessing the needs of homeless youth, we   believe that it is important to include the opinions of the youth themselves.         Longitudinal Research.   Though there is a growing number of   longitudinal studies on homeless adults and families (e.g., Shinn et al., 1998;   Toro, Goldstein, Rowland, Bellavia, Wolfe, Thomas et al., 1999a; Toro et al.,   1997; Zlotnick, Robertson, and Lahiff, 1999), there have been only a few such   studies on homeless youth. The intervention research of Cauce et al. (1993,   1994a) represents another recent example of longitudinal research on homeless   youth and there are at least three ongoing longitudinal studies (Albornoz et   al., 1998; Cauce et al., 1994b; Toro et al., 1998). Much more work of this type   is needed to help us understand what happens to homeless youth over time and   what services and other resources seem to help them achieve positive long-term   outcomes as they approach adulthood.       Strengths Versus Deficits.  The existing research and   professional literature has focused intently on the problems and deficits of   homeless youth. Virtually no attention has been paid to the strengths and   competencies these youth may possess.       Geographic Coverage.  Further research is also needed to   document needs of homeless youth in rural areas, smaller urban centers and in   the central US.      Program Evaluation      There is a paucity of research evidence about best practices for meeting   the needs of homeless youth. We need research around the effectiveness of case   management, primary care, mental health and substance abuse services much in   the same way that we have research for the adult systems. We would be   interested in knowing not only what works, but under what conditions, for which   groups, and at what cost.       Most shelters and other services for homeless youth have not been   systematically evaluated. One exception comes from work by Cauce and her   colleagues who have used an experimental design to evaluate an intensive case   management program for street youth in Seattle (Cauce et al., 1993, 1994a).   More such rigorous designs, including control groups, are needed to determine   which approaches to assisting homeless youth are most effective. Another is a   recent national evaluation of the Transitional Living Program (TLP) for   Homeless Youth (based on a quasi-experimental design implemented in 10 sites   with 175 homeless youth, most ages 18 to 21), which found some positive program   effects over a 6-month follow-up period (MacAllum, Kerttula, & Quinn,   1997).      We recommend that the organization and financing of services for   homeless youth be informed by reliable information about the population and its   needs. Input from service providers, policy makers, and other community leaders   can also inform research on this population (Acosta & Toro, 1999).          References      Ackley, K. A., & Hoyt, D. R.

Rick Lazio [chairman of the subcommittee] presiding.      Present: Chairman Lazio, Representatives Ney, Kennedy, Jackson, LaFalce, Maloney, and Hill.      Chairman  LAZIO.  I want to welcome everyone here to the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity. This is our first hearing this year involving some solutions to the homeless problem that we have in America.      Today we are going to be hearing testimony and discussing the issues surrounding homelessness. On any given day in America, many surveys reflect about 600,000 Americans are homeless. For many years, when I was growing up, it seemed to me that homelessness was an aberration, the ''hobo'' or vagrant down the street. Now, both because of the electronic media and because of the overall increase in the homeless problem, it has become something that is synonymous with governmental failure, with the fact that we have been unable to find long-term and permanent solutions to one of the most dramatic domestic problems facing America today, whether you are in a suburban or rural area, or urban area. You can walk through most major cities today and find, tragically, some of our fellow citizens sleeping in parks, out in the cold in the winter, looking for food in garbage cans, and even sometimes experiencing hallucinations.     Page 8         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    Today, these observations rarely shock the conscience in some of our communities, and we are in the process now of rethinking what our role needs to be.      On the first day of this Congress I introduced H.R. 217, The Homeless Housing Programs Consolidation and Flexibility Act. The purpose of this bill is the following three major principles:      First, to maximize the taxpayers' investment in homeless programs that ensure superior performance and value for housing and services;      Second, to facilitate permanent solutions to homelessness, where we stop historical patterns of simply treating symptoms. Instead, we propose a holistic approach using various resources; and      Third, to provide incentives to local communities to meet the challenges of homelessness that they face each and every day.      These past 15 years represent an incremental approach by this Congress to spend well over $5 billion on various homeless problems, yet the public questions whether the value of that taxpayer investment has made a significant dent in ending homelessness. At some point, in response to those concerns, it is the Congress' responsibility to reassess and rethink our approach to the homeless problem and perhaps ask some very fundamental questions, such as, who is homeless and how did they get there? What type of housing best serves the homeless? And how do we get homeless people access to housing? What services, if any, are necessary to assist those homeless people staying in housing? Why do we have chronically homeless individuals, given the variety of service providers and assistance available? And, most importantly, how can the Federal Government provide better coordination, partnerships, and greater flexibility to homeless advocates, whether to States, localities, or non-profit organizations?     Page 9         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    Under today's approaches, we spend about $823 million annually in the McKinney HUD housing dollars, and use approximately 50 to 70 percent of those funds for services rather than permanent housing solutions. Although I recognize and understand the need for supportive services, I believe that the taxpayers would get more value for their investment if we provided incentives for linkages with other agencies and resources to enable us to do both the supportive services and the so-called ''bricks and mortar.''      Homelessness is not just a housing problem for some individuals. It is a symptom of other pathological problems, yet I have to say that I am perplexed that our Federal approach is to hand off this problem totally to HUD, which has been ill-prepared to meet a mission it was never designed to hold. Who wouldn't agree that HUD will need to collaborate with the other agencies who have eligible block grants, but perhaps have failed to meet the challenge of homelessness?      House Resolution 217 will not only consolidate the various homeless programs, but also require coordination among the different agencies. The bill is intended to provide a non-adversarial approach for agencies such as HHS and Labor, to provide service funds for these homeless programs and deserving homeless service providers.      The legislation also requires a match, where the grant recipients bring hard cash or the value of goods and services equal to 50 percent of the Federal grant.      I believe that it is imperative that other Government sectors also face their responsibility in this issue. In the vast majority of cases, matches will not be a problem. In some areas, however, localities have perceived homelessness as a Federal problem, without any coordination or local assistance, and therefore they lack the investment and outcome that we need.     Page 10         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    Hopefully, this match requirement will provide incentives for localities and States to provide creative and flexible solutions.      Finally, another major thrust of this legislation would emphasize permanent housing solutions. Out of this block grant will be a modest competitive block grant for acquisition, construction, and significant rehabilitation.      Before I turn to some of the other Members here, I would ask that all of the opening statements that Members have prepared be included in the record. Members will have 3 days to submit such statements. I also want to ask unanimous consent to place in the record a February 8th, 1997 article published in  The Economist  entitled: ''Down and Out: Homelessness is One of America's Most Visible Social Ills; Can Economics Offer Ways to Cure It?'' The article outlines the distinctions between two schools of thought, one promoted by Dr. Christopher Jencks, a social scientist at Harvard University, who argues that homelessness is caused by drug and substance abuse and mental illness, which have little to do with housing economics; and the second, promoted by Dr. Brendan O'Flaherty of Columbia University, one of our witnesses today, who cites changes in the housing market as the largest factor in the rise of homelessness. This article was a major impetus for having this hearing to discuss the explanations and possible solutions to homelessness. Dr. Jencks was invited to participate today, but unfortunately he had a scheduling conflict.      [The referenced article can be found on page 38 in the appendix.]      Today we have four expert witnesses: Dr. E. Fuller Torrey; Dr. Brendan O'Flaherty; Dr. Dennis Culhane, and Dr. Martha Burt. All four have different perspectives and observations on homelessness.     Page 11         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    I am hopeful that we can use this as a dialogue to engage in a worthwhile discussion on the issues that cut to the foundation of the debate.      We intend to hold a second hearing, with the participation of the Administration, homeless service and housing providers, and State and local government officials, to discuss specifics of the legislation.      Again, I want to welcome everyone, and also announce that our Ranking Member, Mr. Kennedy, should be here very soon. I know he has some scheduling conflicts. Mr. Kennedy is very involved in this issue and we have been working closely together on a number of these problems.      Let me turn to Mr. LaFalce.      [The prepared statement of Hon. Rick Lazio can be found on page 34 in the appendix.]      Mr.  LAFALCE.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to listening to the witnesses. We all agree that homelessness is a very serious problem. I would like to hear further documentation of that from the witnesses.      I think most of us also agree, too, that H.R. 217, in the majority, is a good combination of the existing programs. There are some difficulties that some of us might have within it, however, with respect to certain caps for temporary shelter and for supportive services. But I would prefer to hear the witnesses' perspective on all those issues.       Page 12         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC   Thank you.      Chairman  LAZIO.  Thank you, Mr. LaFalce.      The gentleman from Montana, Mr. Hill.      Mr.  HILL.  Mr. Chairman, just to expedite the hearing, I will pass.      Chairman  LAZIO.  Thank you very much.      The gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Jackson.      Mr.  JACKSON.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to associate myself with my colleague's remarks, and in the interest of expediting the hearing, I would like to enter my remarks in the record.      Chairman  LAZIO.  Thank you very much.      [The prepared statement of Hon. Jesse L. Jackson can be found on page 40 in the appendix.]       Chairman  LAZIO.  I would like to introduce the first panel. The first presentation will be made by Dr. E. Fuller Torrey.      Dr. Torrey is a research psychiatrist at the Neuroscience Center of the National Institute of Mental Health. He is also the author of 12 books, including the best-selling ''Surviving Schizophrenia,'' which has been described as the ''bible of the mentally ill and their families.'' He recently published ''Out of the Shadows: Confronting America's Mental Illness Crisis,'' which in chapter 2, entitled ''Nowhere to Go: Homelessness and Mental Illness,'' discusses the relationship of the homeless mentally ill to de-institutionalization, as well as a quantitative analysis and profile of homeless people.     Page 13         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    Dr. Torrey contends that the single largest cause of homelessness is substance abuse, both alcohol and drugs, especially cocaine and heroin. The second largest cause is severe psychiatric illness, specifically schizophrenia and manic-depressive illness. He estimates that approximately 150,000 out of 402,000 homeless individuals have severe psychiatric illness. He argues that if any homeless programs are to be successful, then you must take into account the problems of drugs and substance abuse and severe mental illnesses.      It is with a great deal of pleasure that I welcome you to the panel.     STATEMENT OF DR. E. FULLER TORREY, M.D., RESEARCH PSYCHIATRIST, NEUROSCIENCE CENTER, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH        Dr.  TORREY.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. My name is E. Fuller Torrey. I am a clinical and research psychiatrist specializing in schizophrenia, manic-depressive illness, and other severe psychiatric disorders. I am also the Director of the Stanley Foundation, which supports research on these disorders. For over 14 years I have run a free clinic every other week for homeless individuals who are mentally ill, and I have visited public shelters for homeless individuals in 20 States. I have published 16 books and over 200 professional papers. My testimony today is based on a chapter out of my most recent book, ''Out of the Shadows: Confronting America's Mental Illness Crisis.''      I think my position today is representing the viewpoint, basically, that homelessness is, at a minimum, a housing issue. The homelessness issue placed on the HUD committee as primary responsibility strikes me as very similar to taking homeless mentally ill and putting them in jails, and having the public librarians and the people running the subways taking primary responsibility. It's both inappropriate and a very clear indication of the failure of the public services, especially at the State and county levels.     Page 14         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    Studies have shown conclusively that the largest group of the homeless are the substance abusers, alcohol and cocaine especially, some heroin, and that they constitute about 50 percent of the homeless in the surveys that have been done.      The second largest group are the homeless mentally ill. These are the individuals who I have had the most experience with. And I might stress very strongly that these individuals are not homeless by choice; they are homeless because they have a brain disorder, because they have a brain disease. And on the handout that I have here there is a picture of identical twins with schizophrenia, showing the enlarged ventricles in the twin who has schizophrenia compared to the twin who does not have schizophrenia. This is the kind of research that I am involved in on a daily basis.      It is important to emphasize that the homeless mentally ill have a brain disease just exactly as people do who have Parkinson's or Multiple Sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease. This is not an issue of stress; this is not an issue of being poor. This is an issue that something has changed the chemistry in their brain, and their brains are no longer working normally.   Depending on what you accept as your total homelessness in the United States, if you take a figure of 400,000, then the number of homeless mentally ill on any given day is about 150,000; if you take the 600,000, as you mentioned earlier, then the number of homeless mentally ill on any given day is about 200,000. That's greater than the total population of Hartford or Providence or Fort Lauderdale or Reno, and it is more than twice as many individuals, seriously mentally ill individuals, as are in any hospitals for the mentally ill on any given date.      In short, many of the shelters and the jails have become the largest mental institutions in their counties or in their States. And in fact, the Los Angeles County Jail is the largest mental institution in the United States,  de facto .     Page 15         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    The quality of life for the homeless mentally ill is grim on the best of days. A recent study found that 28 percent of them get some food from garbage cans; 9 percent use garbage cans as their primary food source. A third of the homeless mentally ill women have been raped. If I told you today that 28 percent of people with Alzheimer's disease were getting food from garbage cans, and a third of the women had been raped, you would be outraged, and I think that that's an appropriate response to what I am telling you today.      These individuals you have all seen; as you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, you certainly saw them in your younger years on Long Island. In fact, Long Beach on Long Island was one of the earliest places where the homeless mentally ill were described in the early and mid-1970's, being de-institutionalized from the State hospitals on Long Island. You can see them even a few blocks from here. A woman lived for about 2 years up on the corner of Independence and 3rd; I notice she is not there anymore. I don't know where she is, but the chances are quite high that she is now deceased.      If this subcommittee hopes to influence the problem of homelessness in the United States, it must take into account the problems of substance abuse and severe psychiatric illness, even though that is not your primary responsibility. Cocaine addicts, you can put homeless people who are mentally ill and who are substance abusers in housing, and you're not going to get very far ahead. Cocaine addicts will sell the apartment's copper water pipes to buy more cocaine. Individuals with paranoid schizophrenia, and I've had this experience, being placed in housing here in Washington, and they are convinced that the authorities have installed invisible television monitors, and they move directly back to the streets because of their mental illness.       Page 16         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC   In short, the easy part of the homeless problem is to provide housing, but that solution by itself will do little to alleviate the homeless problem.      What are the solutions? I am going to discuss three very briefly. One is the block grants; two is involuntary treatment; third is evaluation and accountability.      The proposed legislation that you have before you today I think is an important step in the right direction in block-granting the Federal funds back to the States. I think the McKinney funds have accomplished a lot, but this is a State and a local issue. This is not a Federal issue. The Federal Government does many things well, but providing human services is not among them. The record of Federal involvement in programs for the seriously mentally ill and substance abusers is a rather dismal one, and I will give you as Exhibit A the failed Community Mental Health Centers Program, which I know very well, and which out of the 670 Federally-funded centers, maybe 20 did what they were supposed to do. They are, in fact, one of the reasons why we have the problem with the homeless mentally ill today.      Second, although it is not the responsibility of your subcommittee, whatever you do to recommend solutions to homelessness must deal with the issue of involuntary treatment. It is very clear that about half of people with severe mental illnesses who are homeless have no insight into their illness. When I run my clinic, I spend about half of my time saying to the homeless mentally ill individuals, ''You need to be on medications,'' and about 90 percent of the time they say back, ''There's nothing wrong with me. It's not voices. I know the CIA has implanted those electrodes in my brain, and if you think these medicines are so great, you take them.'' It is very, very difficult now to treat involuntarily severely mentally ill people who are homeless, because the laws have been changed at the State level by the ACLU, by the Bazelon Center, by well meaning lawyers who don't understand the problem, and that is a major problem in terms of how to solve this today.     Page 17         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    Until the problem of involuntary treatment is addressed at the State level, there will be no appreciable decrease in homelessness, and it seems perfectly appropriate to me to give priority in housing to alcoholics who are taking Antabuse under supervision; to drug addicts who are in drug rehab programs, getting random urine checks; and the severely psychiatrically homeless individuals who are taking their medications as prescribed.      The third part of the solution that I am going to address is evaluation and accountability. There should be no block grants without accompanying evaluation and accountability, and this should probably be the primary role of the Federal Government.      A small proportion of the proposed block grant should be set aside and used to hire private contractors, like Rand or the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research, to survey homelessness in each State periodically, for example, every 2 years, and then to publish and report back the findings to the Federal Government. Such a survey should not be done by Government agencies, such as the Center for Mental Health Services, because of their proven vulnerability to Congressional influence, White House mandates, and political correctness. The results of the survey could then be used as a ''carrot and stick'' to determine the following year's Federal block grant allotment to each State.      In addition to relatively modest housing funds, the Federal Government currently spends approximately $38 billion, these are 1994 figures, for support and services for people with severe mental disorders. Thus, the Federal Government has potentially a very large stick and a very large carrot to influence what the States do with the block grant.       Page 18         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC   In summary, the proposed legislation is an important step toward solving the problem of homelessness, which is a continuing tragedy for individuals affected, and a blight on the American social scene. However, this legislation must be integrated with other programs that directly address the problems of substance abuse and severe psychiatric disorders, and that, to me, is the biggest challenge facing this subcommittee, to coordinate what you're doing with the other committees in Congress who have oversight over the individuals who are involved in this problem.      The Homeless Housing Programs Consolidation and Flexibility Act should be coordinated. Give the money to the States, but measure the outcome, and then hold them publicly and fiscally responsible.      Thank you. I will be glad to answer any questions, if you have any.      [The prepared statement of Dr. E. Fuller Torrey can be found on page 43 in the appendix.]       Chairman  LAZIO.  Thank you, Doctor.      I would note also that we have been joined by Congressman Ney.      The next panelist is Dr. Brendan O'Flaherty. Dr. O'Flaherty is an Associate Professor of Economics at Columbia University. He argues that homelessness is at the root of the housing problem, not substance abuse or mental illness.       Page 19         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC   Dr. O'Flaherty, thank you very much for joining us.    STATEMENT OF DR. BRENDAN O'FLAHERTY, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY        Dr.  O'FLAHERTY.  Thank you for inviting me. Thank you very much also for emphasizing the idea that it's time to look at the foundational questions in homelessness.      Let me begin by quoting approvingly from a recent book on homelessness: ''Better housing is still the first step in dealing with the problem. Regardless of why people are on the streets, giving them a place to live that offers a modicum of privacy and stability is usually the most important thing we can do to improve their lives. If people have housing, the rest of their life may improve. Even if it does not, at least they have a home.''      That's not a quote from me. That's a quote from Dr. Christopher Jencks.      I begin with that quote partly because it's right and because it's important, and also partly because it reminds me of the confusion, the imprecision, and the muddle that continue to bedevil the discussions of homelessness.  The Economist  article and several other articles have been billing '' Jencks  v.  Me '' as a major fight, and when it comes to history, that's true; Jencks and I disagree about history. But when it comes to policy, I consider myself closer to Jencks than to practically anyone else who writes in the field, probably to most of the other people who are here today.      This confusion between history and policy is just one of the many things that bother me about the discussions of homelessness, especially some of which  I've even heard today. There is for instance, the confusion between levels and changes, between individual trajectories and social trends that underlies the idea that mental illness or substance abuse is responsible for the rise in homelessness over the last 20 years. It's a question of history. True, many homeless people are mentally ill, and many are substance abusers. That is not why homelessness rose. In fact, there have always been people who are substance abusers and there have always been people who are mentally ill. In 1975 or 1978 there were probably more of them than there are today.     Page 20         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    Homelessness rose not because the number of non-institutionalized mentally ill people rose; not because the number of substance abusers rose; but because the probability rose that you would be homeless, given that you were mentally ill or a substance abuser. Indeed, the decline in State, county, and VA mental hospitals since 1975 was more than offset by increases in the number of mentally ill people institutionalized in private hospitals, nursing homes, and prisons and jails. Whether this is good or bad, I would defer to Dr. Torrey on. But people who are in jails are not on the streets, so if you want to explain the number of people on the streets, that's not going to explain it in terms of social trends of what is happening.      As Dr. Martha Burt points out, this change in the conditional probability of being homeless, given that you have some other debilitating condition, is almost the entire story of why homelessness rose, and it cannot by its very nature be a story about pathology.      I am convinced that it's mainly a housing market story, but I don't want to take the time to go into the details of how it's a housing market story, various changes in filtering modes, and things like that, because the force that is driving the housing market adjustments, growing earnings inequality, is not something that this subcommittee can address. That's one confusion, the question about understanding causality in a real sense, in an interesting sense of why there are social trends, not why individual people are homeless rather than other individual people.      My next confusion is the penchant that people have for pretending that everybody means the same thing when they use and hear the word ''homeless.'' In fact, there are at least three distinct usages that I am very familiar with; there are probably more.     Page 21         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    First, there is the traditional American usage that the Chairman has referred to when he was growing up, a synonym for ''vagrant.'' In fact, up until 1982,  New York Times  stories on homelessness were indexed under the category of vagrants and vagrancy. Homelessness in this traditional American usage is a status that depends on what you wear and what you drink, not where you sleep. It's not a housing market status. People still use that. There's nothing wrong with using it, but it's a distinct usage.      Second, there is a traditional British usage as a synonym for ''squatter,'' a housing market term having nothing to do with clothing or pathologies. If you read the  London Times  in the 1960's and 1970's, there were many, many stories about homelessness, none of them about vagrants.      Finally, you have the current American official usage, which happens to be a total mess: ''. . . the sum of people living on streets and in places called shelters.'' This is a definition so totally inexact that no one has ever actually used it. That's why I am a little bit disturbed about ideas of taking surveys of something when we don't know what we're surveying.      Why is it that we have no usable definition of ''homelessness''? That we don't know what we're talking about when we do it, when we say the word ''homelessness''? The reason, I think, is that we haven't come to grips with looking for what's wrong with homelessness. People have several times used the words, ''. . . the homeless problem.'' What is ''the homeless problem''?      What I'm saying here essentially is, yes, let's get down to fundamental questions, but I think the fundamental questions that the Chairman outlined are not fundamental. The fundamental question is, ''What's wrong with homelessness?'' I think once you think about that, you can decide which definition you want to use, and you can decide fairly quickly what the programs are that make sense. Let me give you some quick examples, because those are what you're doing, OK?     Page 22         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    This is the message that I most want the subcommittee to hear, that you have to make up your mind what's wrong. That's why I don't think I'm giving very good testimony today; I feel like I'm coming in to a movie that's half over, and asked to give comments on what's going to happen next, because I don't know where you're heading. Unless you define what's wrong with homelessness, I can't help you.      OK. One message, I think an example; I won't necessarily recommend either one of these, but an example of the type of thought that I think is appropriate on this question. Suppose that what you want to do is minimize the negative externalities experienced by middle-class people, the inconvenience of being importuned by panhandlers, the unpleasantness of encountering unkempt people, the health dangers of exposure to contagious diseases. There is merit to this as a goal. Then you would use the traditional American definition. You wouldn't use the current official definition, since a considerable portion of street people are not homeless under any of the possible definitions that are around. You would have representatives of police and legal scholars like Bob Ellickson here today rather than a bunch of social scientists. And you would be concerned about the most visible of the street people. You would have no reason to discuss housing at all, and you would be most concerned about labor markets and therapeutic interventions.      But your discussion of therapeutic interventions would be quite different from the kind of discussion that I heard from Dr. Torrey. For a fixed sum of money, you would be asking not how many lives can be turned around, but rather, how many people could be made to disappear or moved to less conspicuous places and times. Your emphasis on local control, if this is your goal, would be appropriate, since these are local problems. That's one possible answer to the question of why homelessness is wrong and one possible set of directions in which you could go if that's your answer.     Page 23         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    Another possible answer, suppose that what you want to do is minimize the number of people whose housing is grossly inadequate; that for some people to lack housing totally, or to have grossly inadequate housing, is unacceptable in a developed country. Then you would concentrate on housing, but you would not countenance spending any Federal money to improve the quality of one person's housing while another person's housing was still grossly inadequate. So you would be led to immediately think about Section 8 and to two major reforms in how Section 8 works.      First, you would reduce the amount that individual recipients get, since the essential goal is avoiding gross inadequacy, not providing nice housing; and second, you would make Section 8 an entitlement program because no person's gross inadequacy is any less offensive than any other's. That is the direction in which you would go. You would be concerned with Federal responsibilities, not with local initiatives, and you would not be interested in therapeutic interventions, first of all, because they don't deal with the problem that you're dealing with, and they're expensive, and because history, the 1970's and the 1960's, has shown that under the right market conditions, almost everyone can find housing, albeit of fairly low quality; but not necessarily live very good lives, but that's not your goal in that case.      These are only two of the alternatives. There are many other possibilities. They are probably the most salient; they point in different directions, and I offer them to you only as important examples, not as definitive.      What they have in common is that both lead to the conclusion that for a given amount of money, it is better to make small interventions into many lives than large interventions into a few. Some of the recent research I've been doing leads me to believe that this property holds for any reasonable and reasonably tight specification of goals.     Page 24         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    In summary, then, unless you think clearly and specifically about what you're trying to accomplish, you are unlikely to accomplish it. And I very much applaud your going into the fundamental questions. I hope you continue in this direction. Thank you.      [The prepared statement of Dr. Brendan O'Flaherty can be found on page 63 in the appendix.]      Chairman  LAZIO.  Thank you very much.      Our next witness is Dr. Dennis Culhane. He is Associate Professor of Social Welfare Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, and is a Senior Fellow at Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics. His primary area of research is homelessness, where he studies the dynamics of public shelter use, the geographic and housing market factors associated with housing instability, and design and evaluation of homelessness prevention programs.      He is currently leading a team in the implementation of the Anchor System, a homeless service management information system that tracks use of services, and we welcome you here today.    STATEMENT OF DR. DENNIS CULHANE, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF SOCIAL WELFARE POLICY, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA        Dr.  CULHANE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Members of the subcommittee. I appreciate this opportunity to speak with you today.     Page 25         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    If we're the experts, I can understand why the Congress and the U.S. in general are confused about this issue, and I sympathize with having to deal with the varying interpretations you've heard this morning. But if I might, I would like to stick to the research that we've been undertaking at the University of Pennsylvania, which I think sheds a bit more light on some of the more specific aspects of the population, how many people experience homelessness, who is exactly among the population, and what some of the reasons for that are.      A lot of the research that has been done over the last decade has, unfortunately, been very limited in that it has used samples of people counted on a given day who are homeless, and that tends to overrepresent people who have long-term homelessness relative to longitudinal studies. And the research I am going to present today is based on data which the City of New York and the City of Philadelphia collect, because they register every person who goes into a public shelter. Just like a person who stays in a hospital, they register the admission date and the discharge date. This gives us a very accurate picture of the number of people who actually stay in a public shelter, what their characteristics are, and what some of the determinants are of their use of public shelter. So I am going to focus on that. It's an admittedly conservative definition of homelessness because it is only looking at people who use public shelters; nevertheless, I think you will find it instructive.      The first study which I would like to summarize here this morning addresses the scope of the homelessness problem; in other words, the number of people who have used public shelter in these two cities. Basically, what we have found is that since 1990, between 1990 and 1995, about 275,000 different people stayed in a public shelter in New York City. And in Philadelphia, it was about 78,000 people who stayed in a public shelter in that 6-year period. That represents about 5 percent of Philadelphia's population and about 4 percent of New York City's population. Those are significant proportions of the population that are experiencing homelessness.     Page 26         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    Now, of course, the general population is not always the appropriate population to look at in terms of who experiences homelessness. You have to adjust it by poverty, for example, and when you do that, you see that in fact about 10 percent of the poor children in New York City stayed in a public shelter just in 1995. This chart which I have to my left shows the age distribution, the percentage of the population by age, that experienced a public shelter stay in 1995. What you can see is that the highest rate of risk is children, and the younger your age, the higher your rate of risk, such that the highest risk age group for homelessness in both of these cities was people under the age of 1. So in New York City about 4 percent of the children under the age of 1 stayed in a public shelter in 1995 alone.      If you, again, adjust that by race and by age, you will see that indeed about 16 percent of the poor black children in New York City who are under the age of 5 stayed in a public shelter last year.      Now, that risk grows for people in their 20's and 30's. The people in their 20's are people who are primarily the mothers of those children, and the people in their 30's are the single adults.      In terms of how the population breaks up, you've heard a lot about substance abuse and mental illness, and those are very clearly important characteristics of segments of the population. But what you must remember is that 40 percent of the shelter users in these cities are children; 20 percent are their parents, so 60 percent are in families; and 40 percent are the single adults. So that when people talk about half of the homeless or a third having mental illness and substance abuse problems, they're really dealing with that 40 percent, primarily, who are the single adults. So just putting it in perspective, that would mean that about 20 percent of the population overall, if you include children, has a substance abuse or mental health problem.     Page 27         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    The second study which I would like to summarize for you this morning is a study that you have in front of you in the  Journal Housing Policy Debate , which the Fannie Mae Foundation has published recently. What that study looks at is where homeless families lived before they became homeless. Today I have brought two maps of New York City. The two maps compare the distribution of poverty and the distribution of the prior addresses of homeless families. What you may observe is that while poverty is more broadly dispersed, homelessness is very concentrated. A neighborhood is essentially either a homelessness-producing neighborhood or it is not, and that is not true in the case of poverty.      In the case of New York we found, for example, that about 70 percent of the families came from just three neighborhoods: Harlem, the South Bronx, and the Bedford-Stuyvesant/East New York area. Similarly, in Philadelphia, 70 percent of the families came from just three fairly tightly clustered neighborhoods. So these families aren't coming from all over the place, they're tending to come from a fairly tight set of areas.      What are the characteristics of these neighborhoods? First, they have very high concentrations of African Americans and women with children, particularly children under the age of 6. So these are women who have lots of child care responsibilities and are probably less likely to be in the labor market because their kids are not yet of school age.      These neighborhoods have much higher rates of housing crowding and families doubling up, and sub-families, so multiple families are living in a unit intended for one family.      Now, this doubling up and crowding occurs even though these areas have the lowest rents in both of these cities. They are the lowest rent neighborhoods, and they also have the highest rates of vacancy. So there are vacant units where these families live, vacant units next to them, but they are doubling up. Why are they doubling up? Because even though these are the lowest rent areas, these families are paying much higher percentages of their income on housing than families in other parts of the city. So they double up as a way of coping with the fact that their income doesn't cover their housing costs. These are the neighborhoods where homeless families come from.     Page 28         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    Interestingly, we also found that housing abandonment was a very strong predictor of where homeless families have lived. This should be a very important indication to you as you consider, for example, the impact of welfare reform on some of these neighborhoods. There are landlords in these neighborhoods who basically can't afford to cover the maintenance costs and the taxes on these properties, and they have more vacancies because the families are all doubling up into units to try to afford the rents. Essentially what happens is that many of these landlords end up giving up with these properties, sending the keys to City Hall. In the case of New York City, for example, this has created an enormous problem where the city now has to manage all of these abandoned properties. The city receives no property tax revenues from these buildings, and now they have to manage and operate these buildings at tremendous cost. Moreover, many of the families who live in these buildings end up in the shelter system. About 20 percent of the families who come into New York shelters come from these buildings, and that's an additional public cost. So it creates a ripple effect of public costs that are borne by the cities and by local governments as a result of the failure, essentially, of these housing markets to survive because these families have such low incomes.      Last, I want to focus on this issue of the single adults. I've spoken a lot about families this morning. We did another study which was based on patterns of shelter use among the single adult population; again, that's that 40 percent of the population that does not have children with them. And we've heard a lot today about characteristics implied about that group.      What we did was, we said, ''All right, let's look at how many times these individuals come into the shelter system, and how long they stay when they do come in, and are there characteristics that distinguish them?'' And our study produced three groups. We call them the ''transitionally'' homeless, the ''episodically'' homeless, and the ''chronically'' homeless.     Page 29         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    The ''transitionally'' homeless, as shown in this graph here, they stay in shelter, usually they enter one time, they stay about 50 days, they leave, and they don't come back. That represents 80 percent of the shelter-using population.      The other population, the ''episodically'' homeless, they tend to come in four or five times over the course of a 3-year period. They rack up about 250 days, but they only represent about 10 percent of the population.      And the last group, the ''chronically'' homeless, they are also about 10 percent of the population, but interestingly, they consume 50 percent of the resources in the shelter system. So about 10 percent of the population is using up half of the resources. So on any given day, half of the shelter population is in this chronic group.      Now, what are the policy implications of these three groups? Let me start with the ''chronically'' homeless first because I think that this speaks directly to the legislation which is pending here.      Obviously, the chronically homeless are not in an emergency situation. They're in the shelter system; they stay about 700 days out of a 3-year opportunity. They are a fairly stable population in terms of where they're living, but essentially, shelter is functioning as permanent housing for this population. I think this is an unwise use of these resources, that half of the emergency shelter resources are essentially being spent to provide permanent housing in shelters for a population that has a lot of special needs.       Page 30         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC   When we look at the characteristics of these populations, and unfortunately this graph isn't a little bigger so that you could see it, but it's included with my written testimony, we found that about 80 percent of this population has some serious health problem; either substance abuse, which is about 50 percent of the population; a mental health problem, about a third of them have a mental health problem; or a medical condition, another third have that. All told, about 85 percent of this group has a serious health condition. And I think that the provisions in the bill which would require increasing amounts of money for permanent housing should be targeted for this population. That's where the biggest net savings would be in terms of shelter costs because this population is using up all of the shelter resources, and it's inappropriate to call this an ''emergency housing problem.''      The second group, the ''episodically'' homeless, this is the group we think is the street homeless population. They probably shuttle in and out of other institutions in between shelter stays. They are probably quite costly to the corrections and health systems that they interact with, as well as to the shelter system. They represent a significant problem from the perspective of the public. This is the group that I think transitional housing should be targeted for. Obviously, shelter is not enough to help these individuals. They're not stable enough for permanent housing. They have many of the same characteristics of the chronically homeless in terms of health problems, but they're much younger. So it is a younger population, not willing to live in the shelter system and all of the restrictions that it imposes.      But these are folks who are very appropriate for residential treatment programs, which can be coming through traditional HHS programs or through Medicaid-funded services or, if they are funded through homeless program funding, transitional housing. But currently, transitional housing is usually not targeted toward this population. You end up getting healthy families who could otherwise make it in the housing market or who are going to end up there anyway, living in transitional housing. It is not targeted toward this very hard-to-serve population. Providers don't often want to focus on this hard-to-serve population, but I think it might be worth considering targeting those resources for that purpose.     Page 31         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    And last, this ''transitionally'' homeless population I think represents both good news and bad news. On the one hand, the good news is that the shelter system, by measures that we have, seems to work. If 80 percent of the people come in and use it on an emergency basis, they stay for 50 days and they don't come back, that's success, I think, on those measures. So we should be glad that it's doing that.      But the bad news is that so many people end up using the emergency shelter system. Our traditional safety net programs, income maintenance programs, obviously aren't working if, in New York City, for example, last year 20,000 individuals who don't have a lot of health problems, they have more than the general population, for sure, but they're not as seriously disabled in any way as these other populations, that so many of them end up having to go into a shelter in the first place.      And I think this is what raises a lot of concerns about what's going to happen with welfare reform. A lot of States are cutting general assistance, if they even have the program. They are cutting Medicaid eligibility for this population. You're going to see a lot more people who are going to have emergencies, who don't have a lot of mental health problems or substance abuse problems, who are going to end up coming into the shelter and using it as an emergency resource.      For that reason I think it is important to protect some resources for shelter, although I don't know what the specific percentage should be. I know that's what you need to consider, but I don't know what that must be. But I think certainly, in light of what's about to happen with these welfare and Medicaid cuts, we should be concerned that a lot of folks are probably going to end up coming in the system.     Page 32         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    The bad news is, I think, made worse by the fact that a lot of these folks are going to lose Medicaid eligibility. What's happening is that the shelter system is becoming the secondary health and welfare system. I was in a shelter in Detroit, and they actually had a unit, a part of the shelter, that was called the ''post-hospital discharge unit'' and people literally were brought there by ambulances. It has like 16 beds in a space about this big, and you have people in hospital gowns laying on rubber mattresses. They were eating lunch that day that consisted of Frosted Flakes in pie tins. It was quite gruesome. I thought, ''Am I seeing the future of health care here?'' We see that now this very indigent single adult population, which always had Medicaid, which always could go to a hospital, could get detox, could get these services, now they're not going to be eligible for those programs. And the ones that are, that are in managed care programs, the managed care programs are going to be discharging them earlier, and they love to take advantage of the free care provided by shelters.      So I think that's what you need to be concerned about, is that shelters are being overloaded with an enormous amount of services, and it ends up actually creating an incentive for other systems to dump their clients into the homeless system. That's true especially in the case of substance abuse programs, mental health programs, and people coming from the jails. Everywhere I go in this country and talk to homeless providers, they are very concerned about the increasing number of people who are coming out of the prison system and ending up in the shelter system. I don't think the public would be very happy to know that the guy who is panhandling on the street, and they're already uncomfortable being approached by a panhandler, would like to know that he just got out of a State or Federal prison.      So I think those are things that are worthy of consideration.     Page 33         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    Last, I just want to encourage, and actually applaud, your provision in the legislation which includes some funding for States and cities to create data base systems that will help them to track this problem. That's going to be crucial for understanding what the impact is of all these welfare and Medicaid cuts; and if they indeed end up putting a lot of people into the homeless system, we're going to need some better facts. I think that we've heard a lot of rhetoric this morning, and that's what happens when there are not good facts at hand. The kind of data which we have in New York and Philadelphia has been enormously useful, I think, in giving us some exact figures of this nature, and I think as we have more of that data around the country, it will inform your deliberations and policy in the future, and I think that's going to be critical.      So thank you.      [The prepared statement of Dr. Dennis Culhane can be found on page 68 in the appendix.]      Chairman  LAZIO.

I do want to help you try to sort out why you get different facts on the proportion of people who are mentally ill and the proportion of people who have substance abuse problems and the proportion who are families, from Dennis and from some other sources.      The main difference has to do with whether you are looking at a point in time or whether you are looking over time. And what Dennis has almost uniquely in the country is the capacity to look at how many people have come in to homeless shelters over the course of a year, over the course of 2 years, now up to 6 years in Philadelphia and New York. And therefore, what he has the capacity to do is to understand how many short-term people there are in relation to the long-termers. In any single moment of time, the long-termers fill up more slots. It's the same in welfare. In the welfare caseload, half the people at any given time are long-term welfare dependent; half the people at any given time in the homeless population are long-term homeless. But when you look at people cycling through, there are many, many more short-termers than there are long-termers. So when the average turnover, the average length of stay, in shelters in Philadelphia is 60 days, it means every bed is occupied by six people during the course of a year. That is why you get 10 percent, in Dennis' figures of the long-term      Page 35         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC  chronics, and why you get 50 percent, even in my figures, for national data of a single point in time.      We are going to have a second national study with data from 1996. My figures are from 1987, so you can look at them, but you need to know that they are from 1987. There now has been a second national study done that is a sample of the whole country, including rural areas and suburban areas, whereas the 1987 study was only urban, and those data will be available in about a year. But they have been collected already. So we will know much more.      On a one-time basis about homelessness in this decade, the new 1996 study does include quite a lot of ways in which we can try to estimate lengths of homelessness, but it still is a cross-sectional study.      So having said that, I should say that our data, mine and Dr. Culhane's, agree very strongly on the proportion of our long-term homeless, and also the characteristics of the long-term homeless; which I mean 4 years or more since they last had a permanent home. That doesn't mean that they've never been anywhere that's called ''housing'' in between; it's just since they last had a place they called ''home.'' Eighty-four percent of those people have had either treatment for mental illness, in-patient treatment for chemical dependency, or both. I include in my testimony a chart or table that shows you the characteristics of people who have one or the other, or both types of treatment, and compares those to the people who do not have either. Fundamentally, you are looking at many more males, this is 1987, before crack; probably females have gone up since then, much more single, over 90 percent are single; they have been homeless for a very long time, so the overlap is really substantial.     Page 36         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    The overlap is also very substantial serving time in State or Federal prisons on felony convictions. You look at the people who have done felony time you see that they are even more likely than the general homeless population at a single point in time to have either mental illness or substance abuse problems, especially substance abuse.      I want to focus my testimony on these long-term homeless with chronic disabilities because I think that that is where the bulk of the homeless money should be going. I totally understand that if you look at it over time, those are not the highest numbers of people who experience homelessness in the course of a year, but, as much of Dennis' testimony would point out, that is much more on the side of being a housing problem and potentially solvable with housing money, which in my opinion should not be coming out of homeless money. There's much more housing money than there is homeless money. And since that is within the bailiwick of this subcommittee, the fact is that Section 8 and public housing stuff is covering only about a third of the eligible families at the moment, and going down all the time. And the issues of actually being able to find and afford housing are much more pertinent to the short-term homeless, primarily families. There are major issues of being able to find and afford housing for the chronics, but a housing voucher is not the only thing needed to keep them in housing. So therefore I want to recommend that the homeless housing dollars focus on people who probably need long-term or permanent assistance.      One of the things that I wanted to point out is that the long-term disabled homeless are highly geographically concentrated. They are in the big cities; they are not in the suburbs. Some of them are in rural areas, and if they are in rural areas, they are going to be in locations where there are facilities or hospitals or prisons where they get discharged and they end up in those communities.     Page 37         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    So it would be very advisable to target the funds, certainly the permanent housing funds, and even a major part of the other funds, to the major cities and to those particular rural areas where there are specific problems. This could potentially be accomplished by cutting out, I know this is going to be really popular, the urban counties from the eligibility of the 320 jurisdictions that currently get this kind of money, and giving that money to States to distribute in areas of greatest need.      The second thing that I want to discuss is, do we know what to do with the long-term chronic homeless? And the answer to that, amazingly enough, is yes. We really do, actually, know what to do for the long-term chronic homeless, thanks to research that has gone on over the past decade under the McKinney demonstration programs for the chronically mentally ill and substance abusers. We do know that we can create housing programs that work. We do know that we can find, convince to enter, and retain about 80 percent of chronically mentally ill and substance abusing long-term homeless people in these programs.      We also absolutely know that without services, they do not work.      The critical services are not services that are available from any other agency, and this is very different from the situation that you find in the two-thirds of supported housing that is going to families, the transitional housing that is going to families, where the services like child care and employment are available from other agencies. The critical services for chronic homeless people with disabilities are negotiating with landlords and neighbors, handling situations of decompensation where somebody stops taking their meds or starts drinking again or starts drugging again, assuring that the rent is paid, that the housing is clean, supplying tangible goods where necessary such as furniture, transportation, or food, and again I want to stress that these services are not available from any other location. Quite a lot of research, including recent research on ''shelter plus care'' as well as the McKinney demonstration programs, suggests that without those services, people leave the housing. Not only do they leave the housing, but the housing is lost because they do not leave in pleasant ways. They leave in ways where they've had fights with neighbors, where the housing is damaged in serious ways, where they have alienated landlords; and the consequence is that the program has to start all over with another landlord because that unit is no longer available to the people in the program.     Page 38         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    So it is actually a lot cheaper and a lot easier on the program to provide the necessary services to keep people stably in the housing than it is to have the programs have to start all over and have the people back out on the street.      There is a good part of my written testimony where I talk about who has responsibility for people with chronic and severe disabilities who may become homeless, and the basic answer is, nobody. There are obvious places where the responsibility is assigned, but it is also equally obvious that nobody is taking that responsibility. The Federal Government had never had primary care responsibility for this population. It has demonstration projects and research responsibilities, and it did have some small amount of money which, in comparison to what States put in, is trivial, which in the 1980's was block-granted to the States, usually to the State mental health authority under the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Block Grant.      State government agencies, including health, mental health, substance abuse, and corrections, obviously do have responsibility for this population but tend to have interpreted that responsibility only as, ''When they are in my hands, I will feed them; but as soon as they leave my walls, I don't have any further responsibility for them.'' And this is in the face of actually reducing the walls considerably, so that as we have heard many times, the actual number of beds and capacity of State systems for these people have shrunk drastically over the years.      In addition to the reductions in actual services, because whatever else you may say about mental hospitals, they did put roofs over people's heads; they fed them and they kept them busy, there have been drastic reductions in income support programs related to this specific population. SSI has now been cut for people with primary diagnoses of substance abuse. Many of the programs that I was talking about that were successful in getting people off the streets relied on SSI income and the State supplement for housing to run those programs. So they now don't have an income stream for that population.     Page 39         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    In addition, General Assistance in many States has been cut for the able-bodied homeless, many of whom actually are disabled. If they have a good caseworker, they can get on SSI; it takes about a year, assuming that they don't have a primary diagnosis of substance abuse. But what has happened in those States that have tracked what happened to disabled people who have been on GA is that they many of them end up in shelter.      So I think that this has several implications for how McKinney program funds should be used. The first I have already said, which is that the program should be focused on the needs of the severely and chronically disabled among the homeless first; second, that the program should be targeted by geography to the major cities, and then let States decide on how the remainder gets distributed around the balance of States. Some States actually put some of their money, their 30 percent, back into the major cities, recognizing that that's where the major need lies.      Second, you have a proposal to do a national competition for the permanent housing part of the money, which I would actually strongly suggest that you make at the State level. One of the things that has happened in the last couple of years is that through what's called the ''SuperNOFA'' process, the HUD supported housing programs actually have mostly gotten combined, and they are being handed out to jurisdictions on the basis of their capacity to demonstrate need, produce a continuum of care plan, and show how they are going to use the funds to fill that continuum of care. I would very much urge that the benefits of that, believe it or not, it actually does work, are not jettisoned with this proposal, and that you still retain that focus and the requirement that there be a rational plan for how to use this money, and that the part that goes to permanent housing could either be a set-aside within each State, which could be done on a State-level competition, or that potentially HUD regional offices could do the judging of which proposals should be funded.     Page 40         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    The most important aspect of how you allocate permanent housing funds is that you want to do it against need, and you want the money to go where it belongs. If you leave the competition at the national level, the national people have no way of judging who needs it most. They're back in the same national competition of potentially giving a lot of money to the best proposal writers rather than targeting it where it belongs.      Obviously, I think that you should not cap services; or if you're going to cap them, cap them only for the things like child care and employment services, which can be gotten elsewhere. You should keep as much as you possibly can any of the advantages of the SuperNOFA.      One of the problems of block grants in the past has been that the money goes out there and there is no accountability for it. The legislation does not require any kind of reporting, so we have lost at the national level the capacity to know how any of this money gets used. That is counter to the sentiments and the basic premises of this Congress, I think, and I would very, very strongly urge that you retain within your bill earmarking for specific kinds of services, and that you retain accountability. I am very strongly in favor of the additional incentive for data systems at the locality.      Thank you very much.      [The prepared statement of Dr. Martha Burt can be found on page 50 in the appendix.]      Chairman  LAZIO.  Thank you.       Page 41         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC   Each of the four of you is presenting a very different perspective, and I'm just filtering it through a policymaker's ear. It's making it extraordinarily difficult, frankly, to be able to formulate policy based on good data because we are relying on you all, who have been out in the field doing surveys and also having practical experience, to come together and give us some common vision as to where we need to be going.      With that being said, let me ask you a few questions.      Dr. Burt argues, really, for more earmarking, increased caps, and focusing on those people who are homeless who also have either addictive or mental illness challenges.      What I am unclear about is Dr. Culhane's survey results, which indicate that there is a great deal of youth, of families of young people, that end up being counted as part of the homeless population. Can you try to reconcile that for me, number one; and number two, can you tell me, in the survey results that you have, does the head of the household also have either addictive or mental illness problems, and to what extent, for families, non-singles?      Dr.  CULHANE.  Right. Now, the rates among families for these behavioral health/mental health/substance abuse problems is much, much lower than it is for the single adult population. The substance abuse rate is more than 50 percent less, so it's less than half the rate that it is among single adults; but still, it is higher than the general population. And 90 percent of the families don't have any major mental health problem, for example. I think it's even more than that. So it's a different population in that respect.      I think what Dr. Burt was referring to, and what I was concurring with in my testimony, is that the chronically homeless are using up most of the resources in the shelter system, and so if there are permanent housing resources in the bill, they should be dedicated to that population----     Page 42         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    Dr.  BURT.  That's what I meant.      Dr.  CULHANE.  Yes, and I concur. That would free up more resources at the local level that are currently being spent on shelter, for dealing with the sort of temporary housing emergencies that bring families and other less disabled individuals into the system. That's where I think we need to really concede that we have two different populations here. The families and many of the singles really only need temporary assistance, some of which is shelter; but many of them could avoid having to stay in a shelter altogether if there were more community-based services that dealt with their housing crisis problems.      Chairman  LAZIO.  But some of those families, according to what you've just testified, also have a head of household who needs supportive services.      Dr.  CULHANE.  But they're definitely a minority of that population. They are about 10 percent of that population. So in 90 percent of the families, that's not the case.      What you have happening is that these families come in because they have a genuine housing problem. We look at these neighborhoods that they're coming from, and these houses are falling apart. The buildings are falling apart, and they're living in crowded situations. It's very easy to understand why so many families have an emergency that brings them there. But once they get there, they end up staying not because they continue to have an emergency, but because they're waiting for a housing subsidy. So you have people in New York City, families who stay there, essentially, 200 days on average because they're waiting to get a Section 8 certificate that, of course is disappearing, but they're waiting to get placed into subsidized housing.     Page 43         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    So that's another problem you have to worry about, I think. The more we use a shelter, stay as a requirement for becoming eligible for subsidized housing, the more you're going to have families coming in to do that. So I think that really it might be worthwhile thinking about how you create community-based homelessness prevention programs that deal with the emergencies that families have, that connect them with existing resources, that leverage the programs that are funded by mainstream agencies, and, frankly, where most of the money is. Most of the money that is being spent in these communities is not being spent in homeless programs, and I think that you have to try to create an incentive for communities to deal with those issues rather than having people come into the shelter system and then wait around for a housing subsidy.      Chairman  LAZIO.  Well, let me ask you this, since I know you've written on public and Section 8 housing. One of the problems that we've had with public housing is federal preferences, in which we end up concentrating a good deal of the problem in certain developments, which overwhelms the community.      What's the right way, in your opinion, of linking non-supportive housing for families that have income problems, and not other difficulties?      Dr.  CULHANE.  My suggestion would be that you should fund housing assistance organizations in these communities who are already doing a very little bit of emergency assistance to families, which help them relocate. So some relocation assistance in the event that they have a housing emergency would be useful. You could also provide them with some loan programs where families are given a loan for the first month's and last month's rent and security deposit. You can provide these organizations with an incentive to connect these families to other services.     Page 44         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    I don't see the shelter as necessarily solving many of the problems that these families have, and I don't think you should put the housing subsidies after shelter. You should not do that. You should try to create other programs----      Chairman  LAZIO.  Could you repeat that please?      Dr.  CULHANE.  Yes. Right now, basically, you have to go into a shelter to become eligible for some of these housing programs or, as you said, to get priority. That, I know, is no longer true in the case of public housing. But that has created a perverse incentive for families to stay in the system. What you should do is think about how you can provide emergency housing assistance to this population, because there are no long-term subsidies for these people. And there are so many families that have these emergencies, you're not going to be able to provide long-term subsidies. So you have to think about what kind of low-cost service that can serve many more people that you can provide, and that means some kind of emergency assistance that helps keep families housed. I mean, it's basically like paying for a good real estate agent to help relocate these families and help them, in some cases, make a doubled-up situation viable, dealing with falling-apart housing conditions, dealing with legal issues that they may have with landlords. That's the kind of thing I think you should be considering for the homeless families in particular.      I don't know, Marti, if you wanted to speak to that.      Dr.  BURT.  Yes. Actually, I think that many of us are not so far apart as it sounds to begin with. I think I completely agree with Dr. O'Flaherty that we need more housing; I mean, people can't afford the housing that's out there, and particularly in the neighborhoods where homeless families are coming from. The housing situations are terrible, but that shouldn't be coming out of the homeless money. The problem is----     Page 45         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    Chairman  LAZIO.  May I interrupt you briefly? We need to be dealing with some level of reality. I think everyone realizes that we're not meeting the full needs of housing in the country.      Dr.  BURT.  Right.      Chairman  LAZIO.  The issue has been, particularly recently, whether housing has become sort of a lottery for the fortunate who are, obviously, all low-income. The idea that we're going to triple or quadruple housing expenditures is not likely, in my opinion.      Dr.  BURT.  So you're going to have more families coming into shelter.      Chairman  LAZIO.  Let us deal with what we have. We can bemoan it and wring our hands, or we can try and deal with what we have and do the best with what we have.      What is the appropriate role for other agencies, like HHS or Labor, who have funding streams? Should they be coordinated more closely so that we get more value for the investment that we make?      Dr.  BURT.  They can certainly be more coordinated, but what they do not have is housing resources. And in the research that has been done on programs that have a primary focus on case management and mental health support or substance abuse treatment or whatever, but can only ''help people find housing,'' because the program does not actually control any housing resources, they don't find it. Or, if they do find an apartment, and they can't keep people in it.     Page 46         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Chairman  LAZIO.  But isn't that a zero sum game to the extent that you take funding for supportive services out of the bricks and mortar? You're going to have fewer dollars to invest in housing, especially permanent solutions to housing, for the very population that you're talking about, the population that is 10 percent but spending 50 percent of the dollars.      Dr.  BURT.  But if you build bricks and mortar and you don't have the services, they will destroy it.      Chairman  LAZIO.  I think everybody agrees with that, but the question is, do you take that out of the HUD pool? Or do you try and coordinate that with HHS or Labor or the other agencies, and focus limited, scarce resources for bricks and mortar from HUD on construction?      Dr.  BURT.  If you look at the experience of the Shelter Plus Care Program, where there is a matching requirement but where there is not a lot of service money in it from HUD to provide those services and where the requirement is to do that coordination and to find that match from non-HUD resources, they have an incredibly hard time finding it. What they have the hardest time finding it for is not the treatment services but the kind of services that I listed that actually keep people in the housing.      Chairman  LAZIO.  Let me ask you, Dr. Torrey.      Dr.  TORREY.  Let me comment, first of all, on Dr. Culhane's figures. First of all, we know that the persons on the streets who are not using shelters, the persons living on the streets are strongly disproportionate to the substance abusers and the seriously mentally ill. So since he is just dealing with people in the shelters, by definition, he is counting fewer of the severely mentally ill.     Page 47         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    Second, he is dealing with self-report, and if I ask 50 percent of the seriously mentally ill homeless if there is anything wrong with them, they will tell me no, because in their mind the CIA really did put those electrodes in their heads. So when you are dealing with self-report, you automatically are decreasing your percentage.      And third, the migratory, the transitional group, I have seen many of the transitional group who have been in his New York City shelters and Philadelphia shelters, because now they're here, and three weeks from now they're going to be in Los Angeles because they're trying to keep one step ahead of the CIA or the KGB or whatever.      And answering your question specifically, yes, and that's part of my testimony, is you need to tie your programs to the HHS, to the Labor stream, and there needs to be priority given to the long-term chronically mentally ill who are participating in treatment programs. You have a finite pot; you have a finite amount of money; you have finite housing. And realistically, you are right, that's what we're going to have to deal with.      So if you really want to make a dent on the homeless, then you have to give priority to the alcoholics who are on Antabuse, to the substance abusers who are in drug rehab programs, and to the severely mentally ill who are actually getting medications at the time they go into the housing. Then you will start to make a dent on it. To do it by yourself, without tying into the HHS, without tying into the Labor funding, and block-granting it to the States, I think you're not going to see any difference 5 or 10 years from now.      Chairman  LAZIO.  Thank you.     Page 48         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    Mr. Jackson.      Mr.  JACKSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.      I would like to ask a question of Dr. Culhane and Dr. Burt. Let me first begin by thanking all of the panelists for, I think, a quite outstanding testimony. There are probably parts of each of your testimonies that I agree with, and some parts that I probably disagree with. I really appreciated Dr. Torrey's analysis that our subcommittee alone, focusing on brick and mortar, cannot address and solve the problems of homelessness by ourselves. Even in light of that, since the 1960's we have had a housing crisis in the number of units that we have built nationally, and since that time we have fallen far short of the number of homes that we have been able to create with the role that the Government has played by addressing housing issues. So it's a ''both/and'' and I think that your testimony was helpful and very enlightening.      My first question is to Dr. Culhane and Dr. Burt. I am interested in what you anticipate the impact of the Welfare Reform Act will be on homelessness in our country, taking into account that already impoverished people are going to be denied public assistance, leaving them even more needy, if you will, in terms of their housing needs? You are probably aware of that bill; 2 years and you're off, and I believe 5 years mandatory ending to those benefits by the Federal Government.      I am interested in your assessment of that bill.      Dr.  CULHANE.  Well, obviously it's not going to decrease the number of people who have housing emergencies or who show up at shelters. It's likely going to increase it; the question is, how much? What we can say is that we know, for example, among poor families, families with young children, we have about 10 percent of the poor children as being in a shelter in a 1-year period in both of these cities. So I would suspect that if you had an increase. And if it does increase, even by 50 percent, you're now up to a range of like 15 to 20 percent for poor children, just in 1 year, ending up in a shelter system, not to mention what might happen over several years.     Page 49         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    So we're going to be in a situation where you could have possibly one-third of the poor kids in this country will end up having some kind of shelter experience in a 2- or 3-year period, which is a pretty damning fact.      The problem is particularly acute for African American families and their communities because, really, people showing up in shelters is just the end result of what's going to happen at the community level. What's really going to happen is, you reduce income for these families, and it's going to have a real bad impact on the housing market and on the viability of the private stock, in particular, where essentially a lot of landlords are just barely making it and breaking even at this point, and I think you could see a wave of abandonment occur as essentially people who own this housing can't make taxes and maintain those properties anymore. And that's going to have very bad neighborhood-level effects. That's the other thing; it has crime and all sorts of other things increase as the quality of the neighborhood deteriorates.      So I would say that that's another thing to consider, is the community-level impact.      Dr.  BURT.  I'm not sure whether you're aware of it, but The Urban Institute is at the moment, and for the next 5 years, involved in a major national project to look at the impacts of welfare reform on the well-being of children and families. One of the systems that we are going to be looking at is the emergency services system and the homeless system, and child welfare as well, because those are among the concerns that we have about the consequences of welfare reform, which is basically going to hit families.      I think the answer is that we don't know yet. Everybody is worried; everybody is speculating. Dennis has speculated in the same direction that virtually everybody else is doing. I think the only actual facts that you have are to look at those States like Pennsylvania and Michigan that have done studies of the consequences of cutting able-bodied single people off of GA, and the answer is that they end up in shelters more.     Page 50         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    Mr.  JACKSON.  I appreciate that, Dr. Culhane and Dr. Burt.      I would like to ask a follow-up question to Dr. Culhane, and then I would like to ask a question of Dr. O'Flaherty.      You discussed the impact of higher rents on one's ability to maintain their housing. In your research, did you find that a person or family becomes in greater risk of homelessness as they dedicate more of their monthly income to rent?      Dr.  CULHANE.  Yes. That was one of the primary variables at the neighborhood level that predicts to a neighborhood generating homelessness, that these are neighborhoods where, despite the fact that they're the lowest-rent neighborhoods in both of these cities, the families in them are paying a higher percentage of their income toward rent than families anywhere else in the city. So they can't move anywhere where it's cheaper and they're still paying the highest percentage of their income toward their housing costs.      This leads them to be doubling up and crowding. And those are both preconditions for homelessness, or a housing emergency, if you are doubling-up or crowding. This occurs despite the fact that housing is available in these neighborhoods. There is a disproportionately high rate of vacancies in these neighborhoods, but that again points to the problem I was just referring to, which is that it is going to make it more difficult for owners to maintain these buildings because they have more vacancies and they can't make their costs.      Mr.  JACKSON.  OK. I appreciate that.     Page 51         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    Dr. O'Flaherty, you made a very compelling case about the evolving definition of homelessness. You even talked, I think, briefly about perspectives, depending on what your vantage point is, your perspective or definition of homelessness can be shaped by that vantage point, from vagrancy to ''can I pump your gas'' to ''hey, there's someone who smells.''      I am interested and maybe I didn't hear it clearly in your testimony about your definition. You seem to have a passion for this issue. What is your definition in light of your analysis of looking at it from perspectives? And compare that definition, too, if you will, quickly, to how you perceive our definition of homelessness as it actually appears to be.      Dr.  O'FLAHERTY.  I don't have a definition. I believe that the sensible way to approach the issue is to deal with a number of well defined groups. There are people sleeping on the streets; there are families in shelters; there are people staying in missions; there are people staying in single adult shelters; there are squatters; there are people staying in ''abandoned buildings.'' I would define these, I can define these; normal people can talk about them. I would also add a group of people, the people you see on the street, panhandlers, recyclers, groups of these. These are well defined groups, reasonably well defined groups. I'm not exactly sure where ''squatters'' end and begin, but these are good definitions. And I would say that we should talk about squatters, we should talk about families in shelters, we should talk about families in lousy housing, we should talk about people in detox centers, just as what they are. There's no need for adding them together. I don't see any reasons for adding them together. And then with each group we should say, ''What is the problem here? How do we address the problem here?''      Mr.  JACKSON.  I am interested in how you see the efforts of this institution and the Federal Government and how you at least perceive our definition of the homeless issue to be, because if you see them in various categories, then certainly our efforts, based upon our limited definition, could be focused on only a single category and not on the multiplicity of categories that you have suggested.     Page 52         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    How do you perceive----      Dr.  O'FLAHERTY.  I perceive your efforts as pretending to be focused on one category, but in fact being scatter-shot and not that well defined because you aren't admitting that there are different groups that you would like to focus on, and different reasons to focus on different groups.      I think most public opinion is driven by people they see on the street. I have heard lots of people talking about people they see on the street. For the most part, none of us here today have talked about people you see on the street. The people you see on the street are a distinct problem from the families that are in shelters. To use one word and to hold, I don't care how many bills you deal with; it's just a question of paper, but how you allocate resources between people you see on the street and families in shelters is a decision you should make, and you should make it explicitly rather than pretending that when you say you deal with ''homeless,'' and that's all you're dealing with, you have to specify.      The other thing is, if you're doing these studies, you're also going to have serious problems unless you specify it very well. There are serious problems, for instance, if you just look at comparisons of what people call ''shelters.'' It's not clear at all that people call the same thing ''shelters.'' Dr. Martha Burt, in the census, did surveys of shelters six months apart. The numbers from those surveys are wildly discrepant. They were both excellent surveys, both done very well----      Dr.  BURT.  Actually, they're right on, only 200 off----     Page 53         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    Dr.  O'FLAHERTY.  No, not city by city. City by city, the shelter rate to correlation is about .5.      Mr.  JACKSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.      Chairman  LAZIO.  Thank you very much.      Mr. Kennedy.      Mr.  KENNEDY.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.      I want to apologize to our witnesses and to the other members of the panel for being late. I've been circling around this city for the last hour or so.      I do want to thank all of our witnesses for your testimony. I want to particularly thank Mr. Lazio for holding this hearing. I think it is important, and an important step to show that this subcommittee is going to be more engaged in the actual policies that we pursue in this country with regard to housing in general and homelessness specifically.      I think that when we look at the number of people that require housing in America, the fastest growing number of Americans of any category in America is now the poorest of the poor. And as a result of actions that we took in the last Congress, we see the general housing budget cut by over 25 percent; we see the homelessness budget cut by about 26 percent. And this is not just on the Republicans. When I look at the homeless budget proposed by the Administration of only $823-million, it simply isn't enough.     Page 54         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    I would caution all of you to be somewhat careful about getting diverted into side arguments about families versus mentally ill versus other kinds of issues. While it's important, we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that the overall budget that we are generating with regard to how much money we're willing to spend on homelessness issues is of primary importance. We ought to keep this Congress and the people of America focused on the fact that we have millions of Americans that are simply not getting the kind of shelter that has been the promise of our Nation for several decades.      I think it is important that you keep in mind, when you come to an opportunity like this, to hammer home the necessity for all of us to keep our eye on the major issue before us, which is whether or not we have the conscience in this country to take care of the mentally ill and families, that we need to spend more money making sure that we are providing for the poorest and most vulnerable amongst us.      I would just say to my friend, Mr. Lazio, who I think is showing the kind of interest and leadership on this issue that many of us were hoping for in terms of his interest in writing this bill, that the amount of money that he has put in is more than the Administration's, for which I thank him. But I don't think that we ought to take a sense that that is the reality of where the American people are. I think the American people would be willing to support a much greater amount in terms of homeless assistance.      But I also have some other concerns. I have a letter here which I would like to submit for the record, Mr. Chairman, from the Pine Street Inn in Boston----       Page 55         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC   Chairman  LAZIO.  Without objection, it will be included in the record.      [The referenced letter can be found on page 42 in the appendix.]       Mr.  KENNEDY. ----One of the finest homeless shelters in our country, which has a range of homeless programs that are associated with it. But they have voiced some concern about using the CDBG formula for the distribution of the funds because of the fact that while that attains an evenhanded approach with regard to the distribution of funds, it does not necessarily take into account where the homeless are. I think what we ought to be doing is making sure that the funds are spent where the homeless are, not just making sure that every State or every community is treated equitably. I think that's a laudable goal in some programs, but in something like homelessness I think you really do have to make sure that you're providing the funds where homeless people live, despite the issues of where they might migrate to.      The second issue that I wanted to just bring up is the notion of the caps, the 10 percent on the emergency shelter, and the services cap. While I think that those can be laudable goals, there are concerns that I have heard from some of the homeless that requiring a 10 percent cap can be a very difficult cap to actually attain. I would hope that we could try to find some flexibility. We all want to see a limit on the amount that goes into that, but I think that mandating that by regulation or by law could ignore the realities that many of these organizations actually face on the ground.      I think also, by distributing these funds through the State governments, the difficulty is that they in many cases are now going to be strapped with dealing with the whole welfare reform issue. This might very well fall into a secondary sort of manner in terms of importance, and I think that's something that we ought to take into account as well.     Page 56         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    So I want to thank you, Rick, for showing such interest, and let you know that I think in general people have supported the idea of getting away from all the mandated programs. I think of a few years ago when we looked at the McKinney Act, we had about 33 different programs that we were mandating, and each one of them got about 27 cents.      So I think the idea of going to the block grant makes some sense. But I think that trying to build in some flexibility for the kinds of realities that these folks are facing on the ground would probably help the legislation as well.      If any of you have a comment, or if the Chairman wants to comments on those concerns, I would be happy to hear them.      Dr.  TORREY.  First of all, I think the Pine Street Inn is a good example. I've been in the Pine Street Inn, and as far as I know, it's the largest  de facto  mental institution in the City of Boston now in terms of the number of homeless mentally ill in there.      I think you are absolutely right, Mr. Kennedy. I think the American people are willing to support putting more money into these programs if they think it's going to make any difference, and I think the concern of the American people generally is that they feel the money that has gone into these programs and is going into these programs hasn't made any difference. We see more mentally ill, total; we see more homeless; we see more substance abusing among the homeless. That is increasing rather than decreasing.      Mr.  KENNEDY.  Well, just hang on one second, sir. While that might be true, the reason why you're seeing so many more people with mental illness is because we don't put money into community homes. A lot of these people used to be taken care of by institutions. We saw what the institutions did; we were outraged as a Nation; and so we said, ''We'll deinstitutionalize the mentally ill.'' So we deinstitutionalized the mentally ill and we haven't put any money into community mental health.     Page 57         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    So the fact that that now falls on your shoulders doesn't, I think, give you the right to come in here and suggest that that's a problem that we ought to take a walk from. We need to be able to deal with this issue, and that means that you have to deal with it.      I'm sorry that you have to feel that the reality is that the money has to come out of the homeless budget, but it does have to come out of a budget. If that's the budget where we can find the money to take care of these folks, then I'd appreciate it if you would stop knocking it.      Dr.  TORREY.  I'm not knocking it, sir, and I'm not telling you to take a walk.      Mr.  KENNEDY.  Well, it sure sounded like it.      Dr.  TORREY.  I'm telling you that what you do has to be coordinated with people who have responsibility for the seriously mentally ill and the substance abusers, that by yourself you can't do it.      Mr.  KENNEDY.  That's fine. Well, I appreciate that.      Chairman  LAZIO.  Yes, sir?      Dr.  O'FLAHERTY.  I found what Mr. Kennedy said very interesting. I think he did a very good job of answering one of Mr. Jackson's questions about a good definition of ''homelessness''; he means, what sort of activities outrage people by lack of housing and things like that, and I think it was a very good approach that Mr. Kennedy was taking.     Page 58         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    I think the way that he's going leads pretty closely to one of the things that I said before he got here, that if you take that kind of view, the way to go is to increase Section 8 and increase it in some directions, decrease it in others. If the problem is that there are people that are having grossly inadequate housing, then one direction, one way; make Section 8 an entitlement and reduce the amount.      Mr.  KENNEDY.  Fair enough. I would like to see more Section 8s, but in any event, that's fine. That's fine.      Dr.  CULHANE.  Just to speak to the issue of special needs housing in particular, let's use the example of Philadelphia. There are about 20,000 people who have a serious mental illness in the City of Philadelphia. That's by epidemiological data. The City of Philadelphia only has 1,000 housing units that are dedicated, with supports, for people who have serious mental illness. So there is a gap there of about 19,000.      Now, not all these individuals need to live in a supported unit. Half of them are already living with their families. But about 3,000 of that 20,000 ended up being homeless and in a shelter in Philadelphia in a 3-year period. That's about 10 percent, over 10 percent, of the group.      So I think just to cover that population, there's a shortfall of a couple thousand units, just in the City of Philadelphia.      New York State and New York City over the last 5 years created a program, the New York, New York Program, that built about 5,000 units of supported housing, and the number of single adults who are homeless in New York City dropped by 50 percent in that 5-year period. That's the only place in the country that I've ever heard about that had an actual drop in the number of people who were homeless in any period of time, and the number of sheltered adults went from 42,000 in 1988 to about 21,000 in 1995.     Page 59         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    Mr.  KENNEDY.  Has that changed too, Dennis, or not?      Dr.  CULHANE.  Now it's changed. Now it's going up again. So last year was the first time that that downward trend was reversed, and there was a 16 percent increase in the average daily census.      But they went from having 9,500 people in shelter on a given day, in the single population, down to 5,000. That's a pretty dramatic reduction, a cut in half, basically, on the dollars that had to be spent on shelter, because they were in supported housing. And those people, they stay in that housing. They have 85 percent retention rates, as Marti was talking about. These are successful programs.      That just goes to show that an investment of that kind of resource can have a dramatic impact on the number of people who are homeless and in shelters, and New York's a good example.      Dr.  BURT.  Right.      I think part of what I was saying in terms of advising you to target money on the chronically mentally ill and the chronic substance abusers is that we're talking about a finite population, and if you solve their housing problems with supported housing, which means services attached to them, you will solve it and you will have this effect.      The problems of the families are severe and I am not in any way saying that they are not important, but they are infinite. There is a pool of families out there who are desperate and who will continue, and do continue, and Dennis' numbers show you that they continue to come in. They come in more if you have to be in a shelter before you get public housing, and now most places aren't doing that so they've dropped their rolls drastically. They will continue to come in because their situation will continue to be desperate, and there will be new ones there. As soon as you solve one of their problems, as soon as you give one of them a housing unit, you will have another. The faster you give one of them a housing unit, the faster you will have two more there, because they're desperate.     Page 60         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    So, as Dr. O'Flaherty has been recommending, you have to segment the population and so have we, basically. You can, with your permanent housing resources for homelessness, deal with the chronically long-term homeless with severe disabilities who will not leave homelessness without it, who can be stably housed, and who will not be replaced with others like themselves.      Dr. Torrey's ''the one from L.A. will be in New York'' is true, but the ''one from New York will also be in L.A.'' So if you house them in both places, they will stay where they are and where you give them housing.      You have a very, very different problem with the much, much larger pool of families who are in desperate situations, and they will keep coming. And the more you make shelters a rich resource for them, the more they will come. So we have to come up with some alternative approaches for how to solve the problems that they have with their housing situations, without making shelter be the only place where they get any kind of services.      Mr.  KENNEDY.  Well, of course. I think there's no question that that's true. If I misunderstood your point, Dr. Torrey, I would apologize. I think that there's no question that we want to get people out of shelters and into both transitional and permanent housing. I want to say that the Chairman last year did support an amendment that I offered to try to increase the number of Section 8s.      So I think that these are important issues, but I think that you've also got to make sure that you keep your eye on the sort of general issue, that of the need for us to continue to support homeless programs in general. That drumbeat has got to be sounded over and over again. You're seeing a 25 percent reduction last year; you're going to see another major reduction if the Administration gets its way this year.     Page 61         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    And so what I don't want us to do is to argue about what's in the pie. We also have to argue about how big this pie really is, and I think the slices issue is an important one. But when you're in here and you're seeing these programs cut, you've got to make sure that people get the message that there's simply not enough resources that are going into fighting this problem. When we see people, Democrats and Republicans, condemning the amount of money we spend on housing in general, and everybody walks before some monstrosity of public housing and then condemns the whole thing, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy that we end up with more and more people seeking homelessness assistance.      So I do think that we've got to deal with the issue of transitioning out of shelters, but I also think it's important to keep our eye on the main issue of how much money we commit to the problem.      Anyway, Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.      Chairman  LAZIO.  I thank you.      As usual, you have identified one of the areas in which we can make some improvements in the bill, and we're going to be doing that with respect to the CDBG formula. I think that was one of the weaknesses of the bill, and it is my intention to move toward, probably, the emergency shelter grant formula as a more important formula for that. But I will be happy to continue to work with you on that.      The second point that I want to make briefly is that there has been a good deal of discussion about communities with mental health challenges. This year, for the second year in a row, the President's budget recommends a cut in the only program that really fosters new development, the Section 811 program for the disabled. You've been very supportive in the past, and I think we need to continue to try to urge our colleagues to increase, as opposed to decrease, funding in that important program.     Page 62         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    The third thing I want to note is to note for the record, tomorrow we are scheduled to have a hearing on H.R. 2, the Housing Opportunity and Responsibility Act of 1997. It is scheduled for 9:30; but in order to accommodate those Members who have made arrangements to participate in the Family Bipartisan Retreat, which is coming up this weekend, the afternoon's first panel may immediately follow Secretary Cuomo's appearance in the morning, depending on time. I expect the afternoon session to be completed by 3:30 p.m.; otherwise, the witness list that was issued on March 3rd remains the same.      Mr.  KENNEDY.  So we're going to go straight through?      Chairman  LAZIO.  We're going to try, as long as we can arrange all the witnesses and there is no major problem for any Member. If there are any problems and you alert me to them, we'll try to work that out.      I want to thank the panel for taking the time to inform this subcommittee, and also, of course, the travel time that it took to get here and your preparation for your remarks. I very much appreciate it.      Thank you. This hearing is adjourned.      [Whereupon, at 10:56 a.m., the hearing was adjourned, to reconvene at the call of the chair.]      [Insert offset folios 1 to 50 here.]     Page 63         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC
GX016-34-11251229	"FOR         RELEASE:  JULY         29, 1997            CLAIMS         THAT HERBAL ECSTACY IS ABSOLUTELY SAFE AND WILL NOT CAUSE         SIDE EFFECTS ARE FALSE, FTC SAYS             Settlement         Would Require Safety Warning in Future Ads           Claims that Herbal Ecstacy, a supplement product that         has been widely promoted as a natural herbal         ""high,"" is absolutely safe and will cause no         side effects are false, the Federal Trade Commission said         in accepting a settlement with a California company and         its owner. The FTC charged that the company's marketing         of Ecstacy, which included ads in media with large youth         audiences, made explicit and unqualified false claims         about safety, and did not disclose the health and safety         risks of using the product. The company, Global World         Media Corp. and Sean Shayan, the company's owner, have         agreed that all future safety claims for any food, drug,         or dietary supplement must be truthful, and that their         advertising and labeling of Ecstacy will warn consumers         about the potentially serious safety risks of taking the         product. They have also agreed to refrain from promoting         Ecstacy or any similar product for its mind-altering         effects in media with a predominant youth audience.            ""This case involves deceptive advertising that         raises serious safety concerns,"" said Jodie         Bernstein, Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer         Protection. ""Despite evidence of those health risks         and at least one death of a college student in Florida,         which was directly attributed to taking a large dose of a         product similar to Ecstacy, the company continued to         promote this product as a safe and natural high and have         encouraged the young people who buy Ecstacy to take         exceedingly high doses."" Bernstein added, ""This         kind of conduct and abuse of consumers' interest in         botanical products also does a disservice to members of         the dietary supplements industry who are acting         responsibly to promote the legitimate benefits of their         products.""            According to the FTC, Herbal Ecstacy's principal         ingredient is the herb ephedra, also known as Ma-Huang, a         botanical source of ephedrine alkaloids which can have         dangerous effects on the nervous system and heart. The         U.S. Food and Drug Administration has compiled hundreds         of reports of injury associated with supplements         containing ephedrine alkaloids, a number of these         complaints have involved Ecstacy. FDA has published a         proposed rule that would impose strict limits on serving         size and would require warnings in labeling for all         ephedra supplements. Various states also have barred or         restricted the marketing of products like Ecstacy.            Ecstacy advertising advised consumers to take as many         as five Ecstacy tablets at a time, nearly eight times the         amount of ephedra allowed in the FDA proposed rulemaking,         the FTC said. Consumers who called the company's         toll-free number were told to take even higher doses if         they didn't achieve the advertised mind-altering effects.         Advertising included television and radio spots, Internet         advertising, and magazine ads, as well as brochures,         catalogues, and point-of-sale displays. Advertising         appeared on certain local cable systems on  Nickelodeon          and  MTV  which have substantial youth audiences,         the FTC said.            The FTC's complaint charges that Global World and         Shayan advertised that ""herbal ecstacy is 100%         natural & absolutely safe."" In truth, use of         Ecstacy in the doses recommended or in other forseeable         amounts is not absolutely safe and may cause side         effects, the FTC alleged. Therefore, the representations         made by the company are false or misleading and         unsubstantiated, the complaint states. The FTC also         charged that the company included in its ads an         endorsement pertaining to the safety and lack of side         effects of Ectascy made by Dr. Steven Jonson of Tel Aviv,         Israel who, in fact, is a fictitious person.            The proposed consent agreement to settle these         allegations, announced today for public comment, would         prohibit Global World and Shayan from claiming that         Ecstacy or any other food, drug, or dietary supplement is         safe or will cause no side effects unless the claim is         true and substantiated by scientific evidence. They also         would be prohibited from making any representation that         any product containing ephedrine alkaloids can be         consumed in an amount that exceeds any level to be         established by the FDA.            In addition, Global World and Shayan would be required         to make the following warning in all future advertising         and labeling of any ephedrine-alkaloid-containing         product:  WARNING: This product contains ephedrine         which can have dangerous effects on the central nervous         system and heart and could result in serious injury. Risk         of injury increases with dose.  Should the FDA         require a different warning on labeling in the future, it         would be substituted for the above language.            The agreement would prohibit misrepresentations of         testimonials or endorsements of any product. It also         would require Global World and Shayan to refrain from         marketing Ecstacy or any other ephedrine product as an         alternative to an illegal drug or for its euphoric,         psychotropic or sexual effects (including through the         name ""Ecstacy"") in material directed to         consumers under the age of 21.            Finally, the agreement includes, among other         requirements, provisions requiring Global World and         Shayan to notify their employees and distributors about         the order requirements and terminate those who fail to         comply.            The Commission vote to accept the proposed consent         agreement for public comment was 5-0.            An analysis of the proposed consent agreement will be         published in the Federal Register shortly. The agreement         will be subject to public comment for 60 days, after         which the Commission will decide whether to make it         final. Comments should be addressed to the FTC, Office of         the Secretary, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.,         Washington, D.C. 20580.            NOTE : A consent agreement is for         settlement purposes only and does not constitute an         admission of a law violation. When the Commission issues         a consent order on a final basis, it carries the force of         law with respect to future actions. Each violation of         such an order may result in a civil penalty of $11,000.

Access to the Internet greatly expands the information services we offer.     The LIBRARY has no control over the information accessed and cannot be held responsible for the content or quality of the information retrieved.  We do not monitor access to the Internet, or control the content found.  Some questionable sites can be accessed. Because we do not provice filtering, it is the responsibility of the parents or guardians, not the library, to monitor their children.     Use of the Internet is the sole responsibility of the user.  The library staff can get you started, and direct you to appropriate sites, but they do not have the time to teach you how to use the Internet. Violations of library guideline and engaging in certain prohibited practices in Internet use may lead to the suspension or revocation of Internet access through the library.    We ask that patrons be aware that the library is a public place, and internet terminals can be viewed by other patrons in the library.  The library recognizes that although certain material may not be offensive to some, the staff does reserve the right to ask a patron not to access a site that displays material that may be offensive to other library users or staff members.    LIBRARY POLICIES FOR THE USE OF THE INTERNET            You must sign up at the desk to use the Internet.       You are limited to one hour, unless no one is waiting.       Children 14 and under must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. Parents of minor children must assume responsibility of their children's use of the Internet.       Parents of children older than 14 and under the age of 18 (15-17) must come to the library and sign a permission slip which will be kept on file at the library.       You should be familiar with using a mouse and Windows 95/98.       The Internet is only another unverified source.  Like all sources, it must be judged by you, the user, for credibility and accuracy.       Access to the Internet and use of this machine is a privilege.  Do not abuse it, or you may lose your privileges permanently.       Intentional destruction of changing of files will result in suspension in Internet privileges.       You will not engage in any illegal or legally questionable activities, including ""hacking"", transmitting copyrighted material without approval; or harassing other users.       Downloading files will be done on 3.5 inch formatted disks, and not on the hard drive.  Any unauthorized files found on the hard drive will be purged periodically by the staff.  The Library will not be responsible for any damage to disks, or any viruses that may be picked up by downloading programs.  It is suggested you obtain a virus program for your home computer.          The Library is not responsible for any fees incurred by use of the Internet.       The Library does not offer e-mail accounts.  If you know your e-mail address, you may retrieve your mail.         The Library does discourages chatroom activities.       The first 5 copies made from the Internet are free.  A fee of 10 is charged for every black and white page thereafter.

GX227-66-13076923	The Library's Mission and the Internet         It is the mission of the San Diego Public Library to respond to the informational          needs of San Diego’s diverse communities by providing equal access          to extensive and relevant resources that meet the educational, cultural,          business and recreational interests of the public. In keeping with its          mission, the Library provides users with access to the Internet. The vast          network of information and resources available on the Internet enables          the Library to provide information services beyond the confines of its          own collection.    Internet Access Services          The Central Library and all Branch Libraries provide access to the Internet          during hours the library is open. Staff members are available to introduce          library users to Internet searching. Library users may also consult basic          Internet resources identified by reference staff members, however, patrons          are expected to use Internet workstations without library staff assistance.          At branch libraries, staff assistance may be very limited.     Access          The Internet is a worldwide computer network which provides access to a massive          body of information. Not all Internet sources provide accurate, complete          or current information, and some may contain material of a controversial          or mature nature. The San Diego Public Library has installed filters on          all its public computers to filter child pornography, adult/sexually-oriented          materials and obscenity. The library cannot protect users from information          they may find offensive. Library patrons access the Internet at their          own discretion and they are responsible for any access points they reach.          Parents and guardians of minor children, not the Library or staff, are          responsible for their children’s use of the Internet through the          Library’s connection.    Filters          On all public terminals, a commercially produced filter is installed to block          access to adult/sexually oriented material available through the Internet          that might be deemed objectionable. Each library facility shall have a          sign informing the public that terminals are filtered (appendix A). In          addition, an internet Disclaimer may be placed on terminals displaying          the following:     INTERNET DISCLAIMER POLICY          Internet workstations are equipped with, a commercially produced          filter. Its purpose is to block access to material accessible through          the Internet that might be deemed objectionable. It does this by using          context sensitive filtering to recognize specific keywords and to block          particular Internet sites. This filter is set to block the category “Adult/Sexually          Oriented.”           Given the nature of how information and sites become accessible through          the Internet, the San Diego Public Library System cannot, and does not          guarantee that the filter will block all material deemed objectionable.          Furthermore, staff of the San Diego Public Library System cannot be responsible          for supervising minors while they are using the Internet workstation.          Parents and other guardians of minor children are encouraged to learn          about the many benefits and potential problems that may arise as a result          of Internet access, and discuss them with their children    Rights and Obligations of Users          The Library strives to balance the rights of patrons to access various types          of information resources with the rights of users to work in a public          environment free from disruptive sounds and visuals. There are information          resources on the Internet that are inappropriate for viewing in a public          setting. Because the Library is a public place shared by people of all          ages, library staff reserves the right to end Internet sessions when such          material is displayed.                   Adults age 17 or older may request staff to disable the Internet filter            on any public workstation in the adult Internet area except Express            Internet workstations. Internet workstations in children’s areas            may not have filters disabled. All library policies and guidelines remain            in effect and staff will end Internet sessions if inappropriate sites            are accessed.           Patrons are expected to use the Internet workstation without Library            staff assistance. Schedules for instruction or assistance, when available,            are posted in the Library. Staff may be available to assist in accessing            reference resources on the Internet.           The Library does not provide e-mail accounts.

GX081-49-12213061	Docket Management             Docket: 95N-0304        - Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids Comment Number: EC        -302         Accepted        - Volume 307                                          Comment Record       Commentor        Ms. Jennifer Hutcheson        Date/Time        2003-03-17 15:24:40          Organization        Goen Technologies        Category         Dietary Supplement Industry                      Comments for FDA General       Questions             1. General Comments         To whom it may concern:      Hello, I am a concerned citizen and Id like to express how I feel about this controversy regarding ephedra. A few years ago, when I was at a party in college, someone broke out a purple bottle of herbal ecstasy and started handing them out three to each person. A few minutes later, my friend complained of rapid heartbeat and nausea. The bottle contained ephedra, kola nut, and a few other herbs. Obviously, these people were taking ephedra to get high. Those purple pills my friend took contained about 100 milligrams of ephedra, which is a dangerous amount to take at one time. Her reaction, however, was not severe, but uncomfortable.    In January of this year I accepted a job as a medical writer from Goen Technologies, makers of the supplement TrimSpa, which offers both a regular formula, containing ephedra, and an ephedra-free product. Knowing that ephedra made my friend sick that day made me feel cautious about this herb. However, after working here for almost three months, I must say that I am thoroughly convinced that TrimSpa is an ethical, honest company with the highest possible care for their customers. In contrast to the irresponsible marketing and formulation of the herbal ecstasy, this product contains only 12 milligrams of active ephedra per pill. In one day, thats 36 milligrams of active ephedra. This is an extremely low amount, as most weight-loss formulas containing ephedra use double or triple this much. I started taking TrimSpa to lose weight the first week I started work.  I consider myself a healthy, active person, and I wanted to lose 10-15 pounds. So far, in three months, Ive lost 8 pounds solely from taking TrimSpa. Its been cold, so I have not been exercising in the morning as I usually do. As far as side effects go, I feel what I can compare to the way I feel when I drink a 10-ounce cup of Dunkin Donuts coffee. Thats it. In fact, I feel better, healthier, and more in charge of my own health now that Im taking this herb.    And what about other options for weight loss? What are they? Phen-fen is gone, as it should be, and other drugs, such as Meridia, are for obese people. I only want to lose a few pounds and feel healthier and happier. There is no doubt that we Americans need to confront our weight-loss demons. We are getting fatter and fatter each day. According to the Surgeon General, in NJ where I live less than 10% of people were obese in 1991. In 2000, over 20% of people are obese. And these statistics are self-reported, and everyone knows that people routinely under-estimate their weight. So the actual prevalence is likely higher that 20%.    When I was growing up in the 1980s, in school it was drilled into my head to Just Say No to drugs and alcohol. The message got through to me; drugs dont solve problems, they just create new problems to go with the old. After the Just Say No lecture, we all marched down to the cafeteria where we ate fried chicken nuggets, french fries, corn, chocolate milk, and ice cream. It seems clear to me now that yes, drugs and alcohol are dangerous, but food can be just as seductive and crippling when children are not given correct information and guidance in their choices. The fact is that those chicken nuggets and ice cream WILL KILL people. In fact, being obese causes early death nearly on the same scale as smoking cigarettes does. Being fat kills 300,000 Americans a year, while smoking kills 400,000. Soon these numbers will be equal!    If you do the math, you will see that in 1991, when less than 10% of NJ resident were obese, I was 17 years old. Ten years later, more than 20% in NJ are obese. Could it be that these children, the Just Say No generation, kept eating fatty foods after they graduated from school? The answer is obvious. We were never taught to take care of and respect our bodies.   Now, by taking a thermogenic weight loss pill containing a low dose of ephedra and caffeine, there is finally some hope for overweight and obese people. People have lost over 100 pounds by using this formula. Billions of doses of this formula are consumed each year, and serious adverse events are RARE, no matter whose standards are employed! The RAND Report, which was published last month, could only link ephedra to 2 deaths in the past 10 or more years! This is the best scientific evidence available to date. I cant understand why the media is using the RAND Report to criticize ephedra, when in fact, this report actually EXONERATES the herb.    I wont launch into statistics, but you are all aware that aspirin, lightning, drowning, prescription drugs, even dog bites, kill more people each year than have ever died from ephedra! When it is used responsibly, it is safe! It simply is not fair or relevant to demonize all makers of ephedra products based on the lousy concern for safety of a few irresponsible companies.   To tell you the truth, I feel anger when I think about the bad rep ephedra has. It is silly, based on ridiculous information, and it seems everyone, including the FDA, has jumped on the anti-ephedra bandwagon. I wish someone would step up to the plate and tell the truth. Herbal ecstasy dealers should be put out of business! But dont penalize responsible companies who are doing the right thing. Ask the 300,000 people who will die this year from being fat what is deadlya weight-loss pill that works or a lifetime of eating fatty food! Theyll tell you the truth.   So ban ephedra and caffeine combinations for weight loss, and let us all get as fat as houses. Pass the bologna and butter sandwiches. Well all just sit on our couches, watching Emeril, remembering to Just Say No to the evils of drugs and alcohol while we gorge ourselves on potato chips and Burger King commercials. Viva la Big Mac!    Thank you for allowing me to express my opinion on this matter.                          Jennifer Hutcheson                                       EC        -302

Bechler died from multiple organ failure due to heat stroke, and a dietary supplement containing ephedra was a contributing factor, according to Joshua Perper, M.D., chief medical examiner in Broward County, Fla.    Soon after Bechler's death at age 23, minor league baseball banned ephedra, joining other sports organizations that had already banned its use--the National Football League, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, and the International Olympic Committee.    Health officials recently cautioned American consumers against using ephedra-containing products, especially if strenuous exercise is involved, or in combination with other stimulants such as caffeine. Because ephedra is an adrenaline-like stimulant, it can have potentially dangerous effects on the nervous system and heart.    A naturally occurring substance derived from ma huang, a Chinese herbal medicine, ephedra has been promoted to help people lose weight, enhance athletic performance, and increase energy. Its principal active ingredient is a chemical called ephedrine.    Because ephedra is an herb, it is considered a dietary supplement regulated under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. Under that law, the FDA does not review dietary supplements for safety and effectiveness before they are marketed. Rather, the law allows the FDA to prohibit sale of a dietary supplement only if it ""presents a significant or unreasonable risk of injury.""    Synthetic ephedrine, however, is regulated as a drug. Ephedrine-containing products taken orally can be sold over-the-counter (OTC) without premarket approval as long as they conform to the final monograph for OTC drug products used for temporary relief of asthma symptoms. Final monographs cover the formulation, use, and labeling of OTC drug products. Prescription medicines with ephedrine for uses other than those covered by the monograph require premarket review for safety and effectiveness.    Synthetic ephedrine can be found in OTC and prescription drugs taken orally for temporary relief of shortness of breath, chest tightness, and wheezing due to bronchial asthma. Synthetic ephedrine can also be used as a topical nasal decongestant (nose drops, sprays, or jelly) for temporary relief of nasal congestion due to colds, hay fever, sinusitis, or other upper respiratory allergies. As a regulated drug product, synthetic ephedrine has mandatory warnings and labeling for short-term use. It also isn't allowed to be used in combination with caffeine or other stimulants that could interact with it. The controlled availability of synthetic ephedrine drug products under FDA regulation has not been reported to be associated with the same level of severe adverse events that have been reported with dietary supplements containing ephedra.    Still, Barbara Michal, a paralegal in San Bernardino, Calif., says she's extremely concerned about the OTC availability of ma huang, ephedra, and ephedrine, whether in herbal form in dietary supplements or as synthetic ephedrine in drugs. She founded a nonprofit group called Halt Ephedrine Abuse Today (HEAT) after her son Kristopher died in 1997, at age 24, of sudden cardiac arrest due to an accidental ephedrine overdose.    ""I got a frantic call from Kristopher's wife, Nicole, saying that he collapsed,"" says Michal. ""All the paramedics could tell me was that he was down for 10 minutes and that they were working on him,"" she says. ""I drove for three hours to get there--knowing without really knowing that my son was dead.""    Michal says Kristopher was using one of two over-the-counter products containing synthetic ephedrine at different times: maximum strength Efedrin and Mini Two Way Action, formerly called Mini Thins. ""The products are labeled as asthma aids, but I've known people who bought them from gas stations, truck stops, convenience stores and liquor stores, and used them as stimulants,"" Michal says. ""Kristopher took them for a pick-me-up and, like many people, had no idea of the risks. For one thing, if he wasn't drinking Mountain Dew, he was drinking coffee. I have since learned that caffeine makes ephedrine even more dangerous."" Both beverages contain caffeine.    HHS Announces New Actions    In February 2003, researchers at the RAND Corporation released results of a federally sponsored study that examined available information on products containing the herb ephedra and the drug ephedrine. The study included a review of more than 1,500 adverse event reports related to ephedra that were voluntarily reported to the FDA, and 125 such reports related to products containing synthetic ephedrine.    The researchers concluded that ephedra is associated with risks of side effects such as heart palpitations, psychiatric and upper gastrointestinal effects, and symptoms of hyperactivity such as tremor and insomnia, especially when taken with other stimulants.    RAND's review of some 15,000 additional reports submitted by Metabolife International in the summer of 2002 revealed two deaths, four heart attacks, nine strokes, one seizure, and five psychiatric cases involving ephedra, in which no other contributing factors were identified. RAND called such cases ""sentinel events"" because they may indicate a safety problem, but don't prove that ephedra caused the adverse event. The review also found some evidence of ephedra's modest effect on short-term weight loss and scant evidence of its effect on performance enhancement in certain physical activities.    In February 2003, the Department of Health and Human Services and the FDA announced    a series of actions designed to protect Americans from potentially serious risks    of dietary supplements containing ephedra. These include:         Seeking rapid public comment on the new information on health risks associated      with dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. This will establish      an up-to-date public record to support new restrictions on products containing      ephedrine alkaloids.       Seeking rapid public comment on whether currently available information      and medical literature present a ""significant or unreasonable risk of illness      or injury"" from dietary supplements containing ephedra. In seeking comment,      the FDA reopened a 1997 proposed rule titled ""Dietary Supplements Containing      Ephedrine Alkaloids."" That rule would have required a warning statement for      these products, as well as restrictions on dosage. The FDA withdrew parts      of this 1997 proposed rule because of concerns expressed by the General Accounting      Office about the information used to establish dose limits.       Seeking public comment on a mandatory warning label on any ephedra products      that continue to be marketed. The proposed warning label warns about the risks      of serious adverse events, including heart attack, seizure, stroke, and death,      and further cautions that the risk can increase with dose, with strenuous      exercise, and when used with other stimulants, such as caffeine. The proposed      label specifies those who should never use these products, such as women who      are pregnant or breast-feeding. It also lists other conditions, such as diabetes      and the use of certain medications, that rule out the use of products containing      ephedra.       Taking actions against ephedra products making unsubstantiated claims about      sports performance enhancement. The FDA has sent more than two dozen warning      letters to firms marketing dietary supplements that contain ephedrine alkaloids.      The letters explain that any claims products make on the structure and function      of the human body must be truthful and not misleading. The agency letters      also warn companies that they must not make claims about their products' ability      to treat or cure a disease or condition, such as obesity. Under the Federal      Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, dietary supplements with disease claims are      considered unapproved new drugs and therefore subject to prompt regulatory      actions, including injunctions against firms and seizures of their products.     The FDA continues to work closely with the Federal Trade Commission to ensure that makers of dietary supplements containing ma huang or ephedra don't make false and misleading claims.    Commissioner of Food and Drugs Mark B. McClellan, M.D., Ph.D., says the steps announced show the FDA's commitment to taking the most effective actions possible under current law. ""The standard for regulating the safety of dietary supplements is largely untested,"" McClellan says, ""but we are committed to finding the right public health solution.""

[May 31, 2002]  OPINION OF THE COURT  Before: BECKER, Chief Circuit Judge, FULLAM and BARTLE, District Judges.  EDWARD R. BECKER, Chief Circuit Judge.  I. Preliminary Statement  This case challenges an act of Congress that makes the use of filtering software by public libraries a condition of the receipt of federal funding. The Internet, as is well known, is a vast, interactive medium based on a decentralized network of computers around the world. Its most familiar feature is the World Wide Web (the ""Web""), a network of computers known as servers that provide content to users. The Internet provides easy access to anyone who wishes to provide or distribute information to a worldwide audience; it is used by more than 143 million Americans. Indeed, much of the world's knowledge accumulated over centuries is available to Internet users almost instantly. Approximately 10% of the Americans who use the Internet access it at public libraries. And approximately 95% of all public libraries in the United States provide public access to the Internet.  While the beneficial effect of the Internet in expanding the amount of information available to its users is self-evident, its low entry barriers have also led to a perverse result-facilitation of the widespread dissemination of hardcore pornography within the easy reach not only of adults who have every right to access it (so long as it is not legally obscene or child pornography), but also of children and adolescents to whom it may be quite harmful. The volume of pornography on the Internet is huge, and the record before us demonstrates that public library patrons of all ages, many from ages 11 to 15, have regularly sought to access it in public library settings. There are more than 100,000 pornographic Web sites that can be accessed for free and without providing any registration information, and tens of thousands of Web sites contain child pornography.  Libraries have reacted to this situation by utilizing a number of means designed to insure that patrons avoid illegal (and unwanted) content while also enabling patrons to find the content they desire. Some libraries have trained patrons in how to use the Internet while avoiding illegal content, or have directed their patrons to ""preferred"" Web sites that librarians have reviewed. Other libraries have utilized such devices as recessing the computer monitors, installing privacy screens, and monitoring implemented by a ""tap on the shoulder"" of patrons perceived to be offending library policy. Still others, viewing the foregoing approaches as inadequate or uncomfortable (some librarians do not wish to confront patrons), have purchased commercially available software that blocks certain categories of material deemed by the library board as unsuitable for use in their facilities. Indeed, 7% of American public libraries use blocking software for adults. Although such programs are somewhat effective in blocking large quantities of pornography, they are blunt instruments that not only ""underblock,"" i.e., fail to block access to substantial amounts of content that the library boards wish to exclude, but also, central to this litigation, ""overblock,"" i.e., block access to large quantities of material that library boards do not wish to exclude and that is constitutionally protected.  Most of the libraries that use filtering software seek to block sexually explicit speech. While most libraries include in their physical collection copies of volumes such as The Joy of Sex and The Joy of Gay Sex, which contain quite explicit photographs and descriptions, filtering software blocks large quantities of other, comparable information about health and sexuality that adults and teenagers seek on the Web. One teenager testified that the Internet access in a public library was the only venue in which she could obtain information important to her about her own sexuality. Another library patron witness described using the Internet to research breast cancer and reconstructive surgery for his mother who had breast surgery. Even though some filtering programs contain exceptions for health and education, the exceptions do not solve the problem of overblocking constitutionally protected material. Moreover, as we explain below, the filtering software on which the parties presented evidence in this case overblocks not only information relating to health and sexuality that might be mistaken for pornography or erotica, but also vast numbers of Web pages and sites that could not even arguably be construed as harmful or inappropriate for adults or minors.  The Congress, sharing the concerns of many library boards, enacted the Children's Internet Protection Act (""CIPA""), Pub. L. No. 106-554, which makes the use of filters by a public library a condition of its receipt of two kinds of subsidies that are important (or even critical) to the budgets of many public libraries-grants under the Library Services and Technology Act, 20 U.S.C. § 9101 et seq. (""LSTA""), and so-called ""E-rate discounts"" for Internet access and support under the Telecommunications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 254. LSTA grant funds are awarded, inter alia, in order to: (1) assist libraries in accessing information through electronic networks, and (2) provide targeted library and information services to persons having difficulty using a library and to underserved and rural communities, including children from families with incomes below the poverty line. E-rate discounts serve the similar purpose of extending Internet access to schools and libraries in low- income communities. CIPA requires that libraries, in order to receive LSTA funds or E-rate discounts, certify that they are using a ""technology protection measure"" that prevents patrons from accessing ""visual depictions"" that are ""obscene,"" ""child pornography,"" or in the case of minors, ""harmful to minors."" 20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(1)(A) (LSTA); 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(B) & (C) (E-rate).  The plaintiffs, a group of libraries, library associations, library patrons, and Web site publishers, brought this suit against the United States and others alleging that CIPA is facially unconstitutional because: (1) it induces public libraries to violate their patrons' First Amendment rights contrary to the requirements of South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 107 S. Ct. 2793, 97 L. Ed. 2d 171 (1987); and (2) it requires libraries to relinquish their First Amendment rights as a condition on the receipt of federal funds and is therefore impermissible under the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions. In arguing that CIPA will induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment, the plaintiffs contend that given the limits of the filtering technology, CIPA's conditions effectively require libraries to impose content-based restrictions on their patrons' access to constitutionally protected speech. According to the plaintiffs, these content-based restrictions are subject to strict scrutiny under public forum doctrine, see Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 837, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700 (1995), and are therefore permissible only if they are narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest and no less restrictive alternatives would further that interest, see Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 874, 117 S. Ct. 2329, 138 L. Ed. 2d 874 (1997).1 The government responds that CIPA will not induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment, since it is possible for at least some public libraries to constitutionally comply with CIPA's conditions. Even if some libraries' use of filters might violate the First Amendment, the government submits that CIPA can be facially invalidated only if it is impossible for any public library to comply with its conditions without violating the First Amendment.  Pursuant to CIPA, a three-judge Court was convened to try the issues. Pub. L. No. 106-554. Following an intensive period of discovery on an expedited schedule to allow public libraries to know whether they need to certify compliance with CIPA by July 1, 2002, to receive subsidies for the upcoming year, the Court conducted an eight-day trial at which we heard 20 witnesses, and received numerous depositions, stipulations and documents. The principal focus of the trial was on the capacity of currently available filtering software. The plaintiffs adduced substantial evidence not only that filtering programs bar access to a substantial amount of speech on the Internet that is clearly constitutionally protected for adults and minors, but also that these programs are intrinsically unable to block only illegal Internet content while simultaneously allowing access to all protected speech.  As our extensive findings of fact reflect, the plaintiffs demonstrated that thousands of Web pages containing protected speech are wrongly blocked by the four leading filtering programs, and these pages represent only a fraction of Web pages wrongly blocked by the programs. The plaintiffs' evidence explained that the problems faced by the manufacturers and vendors of filtering software are legion. The Web is extremely dynamic, with an estimated 1.5 million new pages added every day and the contents of existing Web pages changing very rapidly. The category lists maintained by the blocking programs are considered to be proprietary information, and hence are unavailable to customers or the general public for review, so that public libraries that select categories when implementing filtering software do not really know what they are blocking.  There are many reasons why filtering software suffers from extensive over-and underblocking, which we will explain below in great detail. They center on the limitations on filtering companies' ability to:  (1) accurately collect Web pages that potentially fall into a blocked category (e.g., pornography); (2) review and categorize Web pages that they have collected; and (3) engage in regular re-review of Web pages that they have previously reviewed. These failures spring from constraints on the technology of automated classification systems, and the limitations inherent in human review, including error, misjudgment, and scarce resources, which we describe in detail infra at 58-74. One failure of critical importance is that the automated systems that filtering companies use to collect Web pages for classification are able to search only text, not images. This is crippling to filtering companies' ability to collect pages containing ""visual depictions"" that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors, as CIPA requires. As will appear, we find that it is currently impossible, given the Internet's size, rate of growth, rate of change, and architecture, and given the state of the art of automated classification systems, to develop a filter that neither underblocks nor overblocks a substantial amount of speech.  The government, while acknowledging that the filtering software is imperfect, maintains that it is nonetheless quite effective, and that it successfully blocks the vast majority of the Web pages that meet filtering companies' category definitions (e.g., pornography). The government contends that no more is required. In its view, so long as the filtering software selected by the libraries screens out the bulk of the Web pages proscribed by CIPA, the libraries have made a reasonable choice which suffices, under the applicable legal principles, to pass constitutional muster in the context of a facial challenge. Central to the government's position is the analogy it advances between Internet filtering and the initial decision of a library to determine which materials to purchase for its print collection. Public libraries have finite budgets and must make choices as to whether to purchase, for example, books on gardening or books on golf. Such content-based decisions, even the plaintiffs concede, are subject to rational basis review and not a stricter form of First Amendment scrutiny. In the government's view, the fact that the Internet reverses the acquisition process and requires the libraries to, in effect, purchase the entire Internet, some of which (e.g., hardcore pornography) it does not want, should not mean that it is chargeable with censorship when it filters out offending material.  The legal context in which this extensive factual record is set is complex, implicating a number of constitutional doctrines, including the constitutional limitations on Congress's spending clause power, the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, and subsidiary to these issues, the First Amendment doctrines of prior restraint, vagueness, and overbreadth. There are a number of potential entry points into the analysis, but the most logical is the spending clause jurisprudence in which the seminal case is South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 107 S. Ct. 2793, 97 L. Ed. 2d 171 (1987). Dole outlines four categories of constraints on Congress's exercise of its power under the Spending Clause, but the only Dole condition disputed here is the fourth and last, i.e., whether CIPA requires libraries that receive LSTA funds or E-rate discounts to violate the constitutional rights of their patrons. As will appear, the question is not a simple one, and turns on the level of scrutiny applicable to a public library's content-based restrictions on patrons' Internet access. Whether such restrictions are subject to strict scrutiny, as plaintiffs contend, or only rational basis review, as the government contends, depends on public forum doctrine.  The government argues that, in providing Internet access, public libraries do not create a public forum, since public libraries may reserve the right to exclude certain speakers from availing themselves of the forum. Accordingly, the government contends that public libraries' restrictions on patrons' Internet access are subject only to rational basis review.  Plaintiffs respond that the government's ability to restrict speech on its own property, as in the case of restrictions on Internet access in public libraries, is not unlimited, and that the more widely the state facilitates the dissemination of private speech in a given forum, the more vulnerable the state's decision is to restrict access to speech in that forum. We agree with the plaintiffs that public libraries' content-based restrictions on their patrons' Internet access are subject to strict scrutiny. In providing even filtered Internet access, public libraries create a public forum open to any speaker around the world to communicate with library patrons via the Internet on a virtually unlimited number of topics. Where the state provides access to a ""vast democratic forum[ ],"" Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 868, 117 S. Ct. 2329, 138 L. Ed. 2d 874 (1997), open to any member of the public to speak on subjects ""as diverse as human thought,"" id. at 870, 117 S. Ct. 2329 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), the state's decision selectively to exclude from the forum speech whose content the state disfavors is subject to strict scrutiny, as such exclusions risk distorting the marketplace of ideas that the state has facilitated. Application of strict scrutiny finds further support in the extent to which public libraries' provision of Internet access uniquely promotes First Amendment values in a manner analogous to traditional public fora such as streets, sidewalks, and parks, in which content-based restrictions are always subject to strict scrutiny.  Under strict scrutiny, a public library's use of filtering software is permissible only if it is narrowly tailored to further a compelling government interest and no less restrictive alternative would serve that interest. We acknowledge that use of filtering software furthers public libraries' legitimate interests in preventing patrons from accessing visual depictions of obscenity, child pornography, or in the case of minors, material harmful to minors. Moreover, use of filters also helps prevent patrons from being unwillingly exposed to patently offensive, sexually explicit content on the Internet.  We are sympathetic to the position of the government, believing that it would be desirable if there were a means to ensure that public library patrons could share in the informational bonanza of the Internet while being insulated from materials that meet CIPA's definitions, that is, visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or in the case of minors, harmful to minors. Unfortunately this outcome, devoutly to be wished, is not available in this less than best of all possible worlds. No category definition used by the blocking programs is identical to the legal definitions of obscenity, child pornography, or material harmful to minors, and, at all events, filtering programs fail to block access to a substantial amount of content on the Internet that falls into the categories defined by CIPA. As will appear, we credit the testimony of plaintiffs' expert Dr. Geoffrey Nunberg that the blocking software is (at least for the foreseeable future) incapable of effectively blocking the majority of materials in the categories defined by CIPA without overblocking a substantial amount of materials. Nunberg's analysis was supported by extensive record evidence. As noted above, this inability to prevent both substantial amounts of underblocking and overblocking stems from several sources, including limitations on the technology that software filtering companies use to gather and review Web pages, limitations on resources for human review of Web pages, and the necessary error that results from human review processes.  Because the filtering software mandated by CIPA will block access to substantial amounts of constitutionally protected speech whose suppression serves no legitimate government interest, we are persuaded that a public library's use of software filters is not narrowly tailored to further any of these interests. Moreover, less restrictive alternatives exist that further the government's legitimate interest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity, child pornography, and material harmful to minors, and in preventing patrons from being unwillingly exposed to patently offensive, sexually explicit content. To prevent patrons from accessing visual depictions that are obscene and child pornography, public libraries may enforce Internet use policies that make clear to patrons that the library's Internet terminals may not be used to access illegal speech. Libraries may then impose penalties on patrons who violate these policies, ranging from a warning to notification of law enforcement, in the appropriate case. Less restrictive alternatives to filtering that further libraries' interest in preventing minors from exposure to visual depictions that are harmful to minors include requiring parental consent to or presence during unfiltered access, or restricting minors' unfiltered access to terminals within view of library staff. Finally, optional filtering, privacy screens, recessed monitors, and placement of unfiltered Internet terminals outside of sight-lines provide less restrictive alternatives for libraries to prevent patrons from being unwillingly exposed to sexually explicit content on the Internet.  In an effort to avoid the potentially fatal legal implications of the overblocking problem, the government falls back on the ability of the libraries, under CIPA's disabling provisions, see CIPA §1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(3)), CIPA § 1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(D)), to unblock a site that is patently proper yet improperly blocked. The evidence reflects that libraries can and do unblock the filters when a patron so requests. But it also reflects that requiring library patrons to ask for a Web site to be unblocked will deter many patrons because they are embarrassed, or desire to protect their privacy or remain anonymous. Moreover, the unblocking may take days, and may be unavailable, especially in branch libraries, which are often less well staffed than main libraries. Accordingly, CIPA's disabling provisions do not cure the constitutional deficiencies in public libraries' use of Internet filters.  Under these circumstances we are constrained to conclude that the library plaintiffs must prevail in their contention that CIPA requires them to violate the First Amendment rights of their patrons, and accordingly is facially invalid, even under the standard urged on us by the government, which would permit us to facially invalidate CIPA only if it is impossible for a single public library to comply with CIPA's conditions without violating the First Amendment. In view of the limitations inherent in the filtering technology mandated by CIPA, any public library that adheres to CIPA's conditions will necessarily restrict patrons' access to a substantial amount of protected speech, in violation of the First Amendment. Given this conclusion, we need not reach plaintiffs' arguments that CIPA effects a prior restraint on speech and is unconstitutionally vague. Nor do we decide their cognate unconstitutional conditions theory, though for reasons explained infra at note 36, we discuss the issues raised by that claim at some length.  For these reasons, we will enter an Order declaring Sections1712(a)(2) and 1721(b) of the Children's Internet Protection Act, codified at 20 U.S.C. § 9134(f) and 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6), respectively, to be facially invalid under the First Amendment and permanently enjoining the defendants from enforcing those provisions.  II. Findings of Fact  A. Statutory Framework  1. Nature and Operation of the E-rate and LSTA Programs  In the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (""1996 Act""), Congress directed the Federal Communications Commission (""FCC"") to take the steps necessary to establish a system of support mechanisms to ensure the delivery of affordable telecommunications service to all Americans. This system, referred to as ""universal service,"" is codified in section 254 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the 1996 Act. See 47 U.S.C. § 254. Congress specified several groups as beneficiaries of the universal service support mechanism, including consumers in high-cost areas, low-income consumers, schools and libraries, and rural health care providers. See 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(1). The extension of universal service to schools and libraries in section 254(h) is commonly referred to as the Schools and Libraries Program, or ""E-rate"" Program.  Under the E-rate Program, ""[a]ll telecommunications carriers serving a geographic area shall, upon a bona fide request for any of its services that are within the definition of universal service . . ., provide such services to elementary schools, secondary schools, and libraries for educational purposes at rates less than the amounts charged for similar services to other parties."" 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(1)(B). Under FCC regulations, providers of ""interstate telecommunications"" (with certain exceptions, see 47 C.F.R. § 54.706(d)), must contribute a portion of their revenue for disbursement among eligible carriers that are providing services to those groups or areas specified by Congress in section 254. To be eligible for the discounts, a library must: (1) be eligible for assistance from a State library administrative agency under the Library Services and Technology Act, see infra; (2) be funded as an independent entity, completely separate from any schools; and (3) not be operating as a for-profit business. See 47 C.F.R. § 54.501(c). Discounts on services for eligible libraries are set as a percentage of the pre-discount price, and range from 20% to 90%, depending on a library's level of economic disadvantage and its location in an urban or rural area. See 47 C.F.R. § 54.505. Currently, a library's level of economic disadvantage is based on the percentage of students eligible for the national school lunch program in the school district in which the library is located.  The Library Services and Technology Act (""LSTA""), Subchapter II of the Museum and Library Services Act, 20 U.S.C. § 9101 et seq., was enacted by Congress in 1996 as part of the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 104-208. The LSTA establishes three grant programs to achieve the goal of improving library services across the nation. Under the Grants to States Program, LSTA grant funds are awarded, inter alia, in order to assist libraries in accessing information through electronic networks and pay for the costs of acquiring or sharing computer systems and telecommunications technologies. See 20 U.S.C. § 9141(a). Through the Grants to States program, LSTA funds have been used to acquire and pay costs associated with Internet-accessible computers located in libraries.  2. CIPA  The Children's Internet Protection Act (""CIPA"") was enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001, which consolidated and enacted several appropriations bills, including the Miscellaneous Appropriations Act, of which CIPA was a part. See Pub. L. No. 106-554. CIPA addresses three distinct types of federal funding programs: (1) aid to elementary and secondary schools pursuant to Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, see CIPA § 1711 (amending Title 20 to add § 3601); (2) LSTA grants to states for support of libraries, see CIPA § 1712 (amending the Museum and Library Services Act, 20 U.S.C. § 9134); and (3) discounts under the E-rate program, see CIPA § 1721(a) & (b) (both amending the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)). Only sections 1712 and 1721(b) of CIPA, which apply to libraries, are at issue in this case.  As explained in more detail below, CIPA requires libraries that participate in the LSTA and E-rate programs to certify that they are using software filters on their computers to protect against visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or in the case of minors, harmful to minors. CIPA permits library officials to disable the filters for patrons for bona fide research or other lawful purposes, but disabling is not permitted for minor patrons if the library receives E-rate discounts.  a. CIPA's Amendments to the E-rate Program  Section 1721(b) of CIPA imposes conditions on a library's participation in the E-rate program. A library ""having one or more computers with Internet access may not receive services at discount rates,"" CIPA § 1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(A)(i)), unless the library certifies that it is ""enforcing a policy of Internet safety that includes the operation of a technology protection measure with respect to any of its computers with Internet access that protects against access through such computers to visual depictions that are-(I) obscene; (II) child pornography; or (III) harmful to minors,"" and that it is ""enforcing the operation of such technology protection measure during any use of such computers by minors."" CIPA § 1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(B)).2 CIPA defines a ""technology protection measure"" as ""a specific technology that blocks or filters access to visual depictions that are obscene, . . . child pornography, . . . or harmful to minors."" CIPA § 1703(b)(1) (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(7)(I)).  To receive E-rate discounts, a library must also certify that filtering software is in operation during adult use of the Internet. More specifically, with respect to adults, a library must certify that it is ""enforcing a policy of Internet safety that includes the operation of a technology protection measure with respect to any of its computers with Internet access that protects against access through such computers to visual depictions that are-(I) obscene; or (II) child pornography,"" and that it is ""enforcing the operation of such technology protection measure during any use of such computers."" CIPA § 1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(C)). Interpreting the statutory terms ""any use,"" the FCC has concluded that ""CIPA makes no distinction between computers used only by staff and those accessible to the public."" In re Federal State Joint Board on Universal Service: Children's Internet Protection Act, CC Docket No. 96-45, Report and Order, FCC 01-120, ¶ 30 (Apr. 5, 2001).  With respect to libraries receiving E-rate discounts, CIPA further specifies that ""[a]n administrator, supervisor, or other person authorized by the certifying authority . . . may disable the technology protection measure concerned, during use by an adult, to enable access for bona fide research or other lawful purpose."" CIPA § 1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(D)).  b. CIPA's Amendments to the LSTA Program  Section 1712 of CIPA amends the Museum and Library Services Act (20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)) to provide that no funds made available under the Act ""may be used to purchase computers used to access the Internet, or to pay for direct costs associated with accessing the Internet,"" unless such library ""has in place"" and is enforcing ""a policy of Internet safety that includes the operation of a technology protection measure with respect to any of its computers with Internet access that protects against access through such computers to visual depictions"" that are ""obscene"" or ""child pornography,"" and, when the computers are in use by minors, also protects against access to visual depictions that are ""harmful to minors."" CIPA § 1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(1)). Section 1712 contains definitions of ""technology protection measure,"" ""obscene,"" ""child pornography,"" and ""harmful to minors,"" that are substantially similar to those found in the provisions governing the E-rate program. CIPA § 1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(7)); see also supra note 2.  As under the E-rate program, ""an administrator, supervisor or other authority may disable a technology protection measure . . . to enable access for bona fide research or other lawful purposes."" CIPA § 1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(3)). Whereas CIPA's amendments to the E-rate program permit disabling for bona fide research or other lawful purposes only during adult use, the LSTA provision permits disabling for both adults and minors.  B. Identity of the Plaintiffs  1. Library and Library Association Plaintiffs  Plaintiffs American Library Association, Alaska Library Association, California Library Association, Connecticut Library Association, Freedom to Read Foundation, Maine Library Association, New England Library Association, New York Library Association, and Wisconsin Library Association are non-profit organizations whose members include public libraries that receive either E-rate discounts or LSTA funds for the provision of Internet access. Because it is a prerequisite to associational standing, we note that the interests that these organizations seek to protect in this litigation are central to their raison d'être.  Plaintiffs Fort Vancouver Regional Library District, in southwest Washington state; Multnomah County Public Library, in Multnomah County, Oregon; Norfolk Public Library System, in Norfolk, Virginia; Santa Cruz Public Library Joint Powers Authority, in Santa Cruz, California; South Central Library System (""SCLS""), centered in Madison, Wisconsin; and the Westchester Library System, in Westchester County, New York, are public library systems with branch offices in their respective localities that provide Internet access to their patrons.  The Fort Vancouver Regional Library District, for over three years from 1999-2001, received $135,000 in LSTA grants and $19,500 in E-rate discounts for Internet access. The Multnomah County Public Library received $70,000 in E-rate discounts for Internet access this year, and has applied for $100,000 in E-rate discounts for the upcoming year. The Norfolk Public Library System received $90,000 in E-rate discounts for Internet access this year, and has received a $200,000 LSTA grant to put computer labs in eight of its libraries. The Santa Cruz Public Library Joint Powers Authority received $20,560 in E-rate discounts for Internet access in 2001-02. The SCLS received between $3,000 and $5,000 this year in E-rate discounts for Internet access.  The Fort Vancouver Regional Library District Board is a public board whose members are appointed by elected county commissioners. The Multnomah County Library is a county department, whose board is appointed by the county chair and confirmed by the other commissioners. The SCLS is an aggregation of 51 independently governed statutory member public libraries, whose relationship to SCLS is defined by state law. The governing body of the SCLS is the Library Board of Trustees, which consists of 20 members nominated by county executives and ratified by county boards of supervisors.  2. Patron and Patron Association Plaintiffs  Plaintiffs Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, Friends of the Philadelphia City Institute Library, and the Pennsylvania Alliance for Democracy are nonprofit organizations whose members include individuals who access the Internet at public libraries that receive E-rate discounts or LSTA funds for the provision of public Internet access. We note for the purpose of associational standing that the interests that these organizations seek to protect in this litigation are germane to their purposes.  Plaintiffs Emmalyn Rood, Mark Brown, Elizabeth Hrenda, C. Donald Weinberg, Sherron Dixon, by her father and next friend Gordon Dixon, James Geringer, Marnique Tynesha Overby, by her next friend Carolyn C. Williams, William J. Rosenbaum, Carolyn C. Williams, and Quiana Williams, by her mother and next friend Sharon Bernard, are adults and minors who use the Internet at public libraries that, to the best of their knowledge, do not filter patrons' access to the Internet. Several of these plaintiffs do not have Internet access from home.  Emmalyn Rood is a sixteen-year-old who uses the Multnomah County Public Library. When she was 13, she used the Internet at the Multnomah County Public Library to research issues relating to her sexual identity. Ms. Rood did not use her home or school computer for this research, in part because she wished her searching to be private. Although the library offered patrons the option of using filtering software, Ms. Rood did not use that option because she had had previous experience with such programs blocking information that was valuable to her, including information relating to gay and lesbian issues.  Plaintiff Mark Brown used the Internet at the Philadelphia Free Library to research breast cancer and reconstructive surgery for his mother who had breast surgery. Mr. Brown's research at the library provided him and his mother with essential information about his mother's medical condition and potential treatments.  3. Web Publisher Plaintiffs  Plaintiff Afraid to Ask, Inc., based in Saunderstown, Rhode Island, publishes a health education Web site, www.AfraidtoAsk.com. Dr. Jonathan Bertman, the president and medical director of Afraid to Ask, is a family practice physician in rural Rhode Island and a clinical assistant professor of family medicine at Brown University. Afraid to Ask.com's mission is to provide detailed information on sensitive health issues, often of a sexual nature, such as sexually transmitted diseases, male and female genitalia, and birth control, sought by people of all ages who would prefer to learn about sensitive health issues anonymously, i.e., they are ""afraid to ask."" As part of its educational mission, Afraidto Ask.com often uses graphic images of sexual anatomy to convey information. Its primary audience is teens and young adults. Based on survey data collected on the site, half of the people visiting the site are under 24 years old and a quarter are under 18. AfraidtoAsk.com is blocked by several leading blocking products as containing sexually explicit content.  Plaintiff Alan Guttmacher Institute has a Web site that contains information about its activities and objectives, including its mission to protect the reproductive choices of women and men. Plaintiff Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. (""Planned Parenthood"") is a national voluntary organization in the field of reproductive health care. Planned Parenthood owns and operates several Web sites that provide a range of information about reproductive health, from contraception to prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, to finding an abortion provider, and to information about the drug Mifepristone. Plaintiff Safersex.org is a Web site that offers free educational information on how to practice safer sex.  Plaintiff Ethan Interactive, Inc., d/b/a Out In America, is an online content provider that owns and operates 64 free Web sites for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered persons worldwide. Plaintiff PlanetOut Corporation is an online content provider for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered persons. Plaintiff the Naturist Action Committee (""NAC"") is the nonprofit political arm of the Naturist Society, a private organization that promotes a way of life characterized by the practice of nudity. The NAC Web site provides information about Naturist Society activities and about state and local laws that may affect the rights of Naturists or their ability to practice Naturism, and includes nude photographs of its members.  Plaintiff Wayne L. Parker was the Libertarian candidate in the 2000 U.S. Congressional election for the Fifth District of Mississippi (and is running again in 2002). He publishes a Web site that communicates information about his campaign and that provides information about his political views and the Libertarian Party to the public. Plaintiff Jeffrey Pollock was the Republican candidate in the 2000 U.S. Congressional election for the Third District of Oregon. He operates a Web site that is now promoting his candidacy for Congress in 2002.3  C. The Internet  1. Background  As we noted at the outset, the Internet is a vast, interactive medium consisting of a decentralized network of computers around the world. The Internet presents low entry barriers to anyone who wishes to provide or distribute information. Unlike television, cable, radio, newspapers, magazines or books, the Internet provides an opportunity for those with access to it to communicate with a worldwide audience at little cost. At least 400 million people use the Internet worldwide, and approximately 143 million Americans were using the Internet as of September 2001. Nat'l Telecomm.& Info. Admin., A Nation Online: How Americans Are Expanding Their Use of the Internet (February 2002), available at http://www.ntia.doc. gov/ntiahome/dn/.  The World Wide Web is a part of the Internet that consists of a network of computers, called ""Web servers,"" that host ""pages"" of content accessible via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or ""HTTP."" Anyone with a computer connected to the Internet can search for and retrieve information stored on Web servers located around the world. Computer users typically access the Web by running a program called a ""browser"" on their computers. The browser displays, as individual pages on the computer screen, the various types of content found on the Web and lets the user follow the connections built into Web pages-called ""hypertext links,"" ""hyperlinks,"" or ""links""-to additional content. Two popular browsers are Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator.  A ""Web page"" is one or more files a browser graphically assembles to make a viewable whole when a user requests content over the Internet. A Web page may contain a variety of different elements, including text, images, buttons, form fields that the user can fill in, and links to other Web pages. A ""Web site"" is a term that can be used in several different ways. It may refer to all of the pages and resources available on a particular Web server. It may also refer to all the pages and resources associated with a particular organization, company or person, even if these are located on different servers, or in a subdirectory on a single server shared with other, unrelated sites. Typically, a Web site has as an intended point of entry, a ""home page,"" which includes links to other pages on the same Web site or to pages on other sites. Online discussion groups and chat rooms relating to a variety of subjects are available through many Web sites.  Users may find content on the Web using engines that search for requested keywords. In response to a keyword request, a search engine will display a list of Web sites that may contain relevant content and provide links to those sites. Search engines and directories often return a limited number of sites in their search results (e.g., the Google search engine will return only 2,000 sites in response to a search, even if it has found, for example, 530,000 sites in its index that meet the search criteria).  A user may also access content on the Web by typing a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into the address line of the browser. A URL is an address that points to some resource located on a Web server that is accessible over the Internet. This resource may be a Web site, a Web page, an image, a sound or video file, or other resource. A URL can be either a numeric Internet Protocol or ""IP"" address, or an alphanumeric ""domain name"" address. Every Web server connected to the Internet is assigned an IP address. A typical IP address looks like ""13.1.64.14."" Typing the URL ""http:// 13.1.64.14 /"" into a browser will bring the user to the Web server that corresponds to that address. For convenience, most Web servers have alphanumeric domain name addresses in addition to IP addresses. For example, typing in ""http://www.paed.uscourts.gov"" will bring the user to the same Web server as typing in ""http://204.170.64.143.""  Every time a user attempts to access material located on a Web server by entering a domain name address into a Web browser, a request is made to a Domain Name Server, which is a directory of domain names and IP addresses, to ""resolve,"" or translate, the domain name address into an IP address. That IP address is then used to locate the Web server from docile which content is being requested. A Web site may be accessed by using either its domain name address or its IP address.  A domain name address typically consists of several parts. For example, the alphanumeric URL http://www. paed.uscourts.gov/documents/opinions can be broken down into three parts. The first part is the transfer protocol the computer will use in accessing the content (e.g., ""http"" for Hypertext Transfer Protocol); next is the name of the host server on which the information is stored (e.g., www.paed.uscourts.gov); and then the name of the particular file or directory on that server (e.g., /documents/opinions ).  A single Web page may be associated with more than one URL. For example, the URLs http://www.new yorktimes.com and http://www.nytimes.com will both take the user to the New York Times home page. The topmost directory in a Web site is often referred to as that Web site's root directory or root URL. For example, in http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents, the root URL is http:// www.paed.uscourts.gov. There may be hundreds or thousands of pages under a single root URL, or there may be one or only a few.  There are a number of Web hosting companies that maintain Web sites for other businesses and individuals, which can lead to vast amounts of diverse content being located at the same IP address. Hosting services are offered either for a fee, or in some cases, for free, allowing any individual with Internet access to create a Web site. Some hosting services are provided through the process of ""IP-based hosting,"" where each domain name is assigned a unique IP number. For example, www.baseball.com might map to the IP address ""10.3.5.9"" and www.XXX.com might map to the IP address ""10.0.42.5."" Other hosting services are provided through the process of ""name-based hosting,"" where multiple domain name addresses are mapped to a single IP address. If the hosting company were using this method, both www.baseball.com and www.XXX. com could map to a single IP address, e.g., ""10.3.5.9."" As a result of the ""name-based hosting"" process, up to tens of thousands of pages with heterogeneous content may share a single IP address.  2. The Indexable Web, the ""Deep Web""; Their Size and Rates of Growth and Change  The universe of content on the Web that could be indexed, in theory, by standard search engines is known as the ""publicly indexable Web."" The publicly indexable Web is limited to those pages that are accessible by following a link from another Web page that is recognized by a search engine. This limitation exists because online indexing techniques used by popular search engines and directories such as Yahoo, Lycos and AltaVista, are based on ""spidering"" technology, which finds sites to index by following links from site to site in a continuous search for new content. If a Web page or site is not linked by others, then spidering will not discover that page or site.  Furthermore, many larger Web sites contain instructions, through software, that prevent spiders from investigating that site, and therefore the contents of such sites also cannot be indexed using spidering technology. Because of the vast size and decentralized structure of the Web, no search engine or directory indexes all of the content on the publicly indexable Web. We credit current estimates that no more than 50% of the content currently on the publicly indexable Web has been indexed by all search engines and directories combined. No currently available method or combination of methods for collecting URLs can collect the addresses of all URLs on the Web.  The portion of the Web that is not theoretically indexable through the use of ""spidering"" technology, because other Web pages do not link to it, is called the ""Deep Web."" Such sites or pages can still be made publicly accessible without being made publicly indexable by, for example, using individual or mass emailings (also known as ""spam"") to distribute the URL to potential readers or customers, or by using types of Web links that cannot be found by spiders but can be seen and used by readers. ""Spamming"" is a common method of distributing to potential customers links to sexually explicit content that is not indexable.  Because the Web is decentralized, it is impossible to say exactly how large it is. A 2000 study estimated a total of 7.1 million unique Web sites, which at the Web's historical rate of growth, would have increased to 11 million unique sites as of September 2001. Estimates of the total number of Web pages vary, but a figure of 2 billion is a reasonable estimate of the number of Web pages that can be reached, in theory, by standard search engines. We need not make a specific finding as to a figure, for by any measure the Web is extremely vast, and it is constantly growing. The indexable Web is growing at a rate of approximately 1.5 million pages per day. The size of the un-indexable Web, or the ""Deep Web,"" while impossible to determine precisely, is estimated to be two to ten times that of the publicly indexable Web.  In addition to growing rapidly, Web pages and sites are constantly being removed, or changing their content. Web sites or pages can change content without changing their domain name addresses or IP addresses. Individual Web pages have an average life span of approximately 90 days.  3. The Amount of Sexually Explicit Material on the Web  There is a vast amount of sexually explicit material available via the Internet and the Web. Sexually explicit material on the Internet is easy to access using any public search engine, such as, for example, Google or AltaVista. Although much of the sexually explicit material available on the Web is posted on commercial sites that require viewers to pay in order to gain access to the site, a large number of sexually explicit sites may be accessed for free and without providing any registration information. Most importantly, some Web sites that contain sexually explicit content have innocuous domain names and therefore can be reached accidentally. A commonly cited example is http://www. whitehouse.com. Other innocent-sounding URLs that retrieve graphic, sexually explicit depictions include http://www.boys.com, http://www.girls.com, http:// www. coffeebeansupply.com, and http://www.BookstoreUSA. com. Moreover, commercial Web sites that contain sexually explicit material often use a technique of attaching pop-up windows to their sites, which open new windows advertising other sexually explicit sites without any prompting by the user. This technique makes it difficult for a user quickly to exit all of the pages containing sexually explicit material, whether he or she initially accessed such material intentionally or not.  The percentage of Web pages on the indexed Web containing sexually explicit content is relatively small. Recent estimates indicate that no more than 1-2% of the content on the Web is pornographic or sexually explicit. However, the absolute number of Web sites offering free sexually explicit material is extremely large, approximately 100,000 sites.  D. American Public Libraries  The more than 9,000 public libraries in the United States are typically funded (at least in large part) by state or local governments. They are frequently overseen by a board of directors that is either elected or is appointed by an elected official or a body of elected officials. We heard testimony from librarians and library board members working in eight public library systems in different communities across the country, some of whom are also plaintiffs in this case. They hailed from the following library systems: Fort Vancouver, Washington; Fulton County, Indiana; Greenville, South Carolina; a regional consortium of libraries centered in Madison, Wisconsin; Multnomah County, Oregon; Norfolk, Virginia; Tacoma, Washington; and Westerville, Ohio. The parties also took depositions from several other librarians and library board members who did not testify during the trial, and submitted a number of other documents regarding individual libraries' policies.  1. The Mission of Public Libraries, and Their Reference and Collection Development Practices  American public libraries operate in a wide variety of communities, and it is not surprising that they do not all view their mission identically. Nor are their practices uniform. Nevertheless, they generally share a common mission-to provide patrons with a wide range of information and ideas.  Public libraries across the country have endorsed the American Library Association's (""ALA"") ""Library Bill of Rights"" and/or ""Freedom to Read Statement,"" including every library testifying on behalf of the defendants in this case. The ""Library Bill of Rights,"" first adopted by the ALA in 1948, provides, among other things, that ""[b]ooks and other library resources should be provided for the interest, information, and enlightenment of all people of the community the library serves."" It also states that libraries ""should provide materials and information presenting all points of view on current and historical issues"" and that library materials ""should not be proscribed or removed because of partisan or doctrinal disapproval.""  The ALA's ""Freedom to Read"" statement, adopted in 1953 and most recently updated in July 2000, states, among other things, that ""[i]t is in the public interest for publishers and librarians to make available the widest diversity of views and expressions, including those that are unorthodox or unpopular with the majority."" It also states that ""[i]t is the responsibility of . . . librarians . . . to contest encroachments upon th[e] freedom [to read] by individuals or groups seeking to impose their own standards or tastes upon the community at large.""  Public libraries provide information not only for educational purposes, but also for recreational, professional, and other purposes. For example, Ginnie Cooper, Director of the Multnomah County Library, testified that some of the library's most popular items include video tapes of the British Broadcasting Corporation's ""Fawlty Towers"" series, and also print and ""books on tape"" versions of science fiction, romance, and mystery novels. Many public libraries include sexually explicit materials in their print collection, such as The Joy of Sex and The Joy of Gay Sex. Very few public libraries, however, collect more graphic sexually explicit materials, such as XXX-rated videos, or Hustler magazine. 4  The mission of public librarians is to provide their patrons with a wide array of information, and they surely do so. Reference librarians across America answer more than 7 million questions weekly. If a patron has a specialized need for information not available in the public library, the professional librarian will use a reference interview to find out what information is needed to help the user, including the purpose for which an item will be used. Reference librarians are trained to assist patrons without judging the patron's purpose in seeking information, or the content of the information that the patron is seeking.  Many public libraries routinely provide patrons with access to materials not in their collections through the use of bibliographic access tools and interlibrary loan programs. Public libraries typically will assist patrons in obtaining access to all materials except those that are illegal, even if they do not collect those materials in their physical collection. In order to provide this access, a librarian may attempt to find material not included in the library's own collection in other libraries in the system, through interlibrary loan, or through a referral, perhaps to a government agency or a commercial bookstore. Interlibrary loan is expensive, however, and is therefore used infrequently.  Public librarians also apply professional standards to their collection development practices. Public libraries generally make material selection decisions and frame policies governing collection development at the local level. Collection development is a key subject in the curricula of Masters of Library Science programs and is defined by certain practices. In general, professional standards guide public librarians to build, develop and create collections that have certain characteristics, such as balance in its coverage and requisite and appropriate quality. To this end, the goal of library collections is not universal coverage, but rather to find those materials that would be of the greatest direct benefit or interest to the community. In making selection decisions, librarians consider criteria including the content of the material, its accuracy, the title's niche in relation to the rest of the collection, the authority of the author, the publisher, the work's presentation, and how it compares with other material available in the same genre or on the same subject.  In pursuing the goal of achieving a balanced collection that serves the needs and interests of their patrons, librarians generally have a fair amount of autonomy, but may also be guided by a library's collection development policy. These collection development policies are often drawn up in conjunction with the libraries' governing boards and with representatives from the community, and may be the result of public hearings, discussions and other input.  Although many librarians use selection aids, such as review journals and bibliographies, as a guide to the quality of potential acquisitions, they do not generally delegate their selection decisions to parties outside of the public library or its governing body. One limited exception is the use of third-party vendors or approval plans to acquire print and video resources. In such arrangements, third-party vendors provide materials based on the library's description of its collection development criteria. The vendor sends materials to the library, and the library retains the materials that meet its collection development needs and returns the materials that do not. Even in this arrangement, however, the librarians still retain ultimate control over their collection development and review all of the materials that enter their library's collection.  2. The Internet in Public Libraries  The vast majority of public libraries offer Internet access to their patrons. According to a recent report by the U.S. National Commission on Libraries and Information Science, approximately 95% of all public libraries provide public access to the Internet. John C. Bertot & Charles R. McClure, Public Libraries and the Internet 2000: Summary Findings and Data Tables, Report to National Commission on Libraries and Information Science, at 3. The Internet vastly expands the amount of information available to patrons of public libraries. The widespread availability of Internet access in public libraries is due, in part, to the availability of public funding, including state and local funding and the federal funding programs regulated by CIPA.  Many libraries face a large amount of patron demand for their Internet services. At some libraries, patron demand for Internet access during a given day exceeds the supply of computer terminals with access to the Internet. These libraries use sign-in and time limit procedures and/or establish rules regarding the allowable uses of the terminals, in an effort to ration their computer resources. For example, some of the libraries whose librarians testified at trial prohibit the use of email and chat functions on their public Internet terminals.  Public libraries play an important role in providing Internet access to citizens who would not otherwise possess it. Of the 143 million Americans using the Internet, approximately 10%, or 14.3 million people, access the Internet at a public library. Internet access at public libraries is more often used by those with lower incomes than those with higher incomes. About 20.3% of Internet users with household family income of less than $15,000 per year use public libraries for Internet access. Approximately 70% of libraries serving communities with poverty levels in excess of 40% receive E-rate discounts.  a. Internet Use Policies in Public Libraries  Approximately 95% of libraries with public Internet access have some form of ""acceptable use"" policy or ""Internet use"" policy governing patrons' use of the Internet. These policies set forth the conditions under which patrons are permitted to access and use the library's Internet resources. These policies vary widely. Some of the less restrictive policies, like those held by Multnomah County Library and Fort Vancouver Regional Library, do not prohibit adult patrons from viewing sexually explicit materials on the Web, as long as they do so at terminals with privacy screens or recessed monitors, which are designed to prevent other patrons from seeing the material that they are viewing, and as long as it does not violate state or federal law to do so. Other libraries prohibit their patrons from viewing all ""sexually explicit"" or ""sexually graphic"" materials.  Some libraries prohibit the viewing of materials that are not necessarily sexual, such as Web pages that are ""harmful to minors,"" ""offensive to the public,"" ""objectionable,"" ""racially offensive,"" or simply ""inappropriate."" Other libraries restrict access to Web sites that the library just does not want to provide, even though the sites are not necessarily offensive. For example, the Fulton County Public Library restricts access to the Web sites of dating services. Similarly, the Tacoma Public Library's policy does not allow patrons to use the library's Internet terminals for personal email, for online chat, or for playing games.  In some cases, libraries instituted Internet use policies after having experienced specific problems, whereas in other cases, libraries developed detailed Internet use policies and regulatory measures (such as using filtering software) before ever offering public Internet access. Essentially four interests motivate libraries to institute Internet use policies and to apply the methods described above to regulate their patrons' use of the Internet.  First, libraries have sought to protect patrons (especially children) and staff members from accidentally viewing sexually explicit images, or other Web pages containing content deemed harmful, that other patrons are viewing on the Internet. For example, some librarians who testified described situations in which patrons left sexually explicit images minimized on an Internet terminal so that the next patron would see them when they began using it, or in which patrons printed sexually explicit images from a Web site and left them at a public printer.  Second, libraries have attempted to protect patrons from unwittingly or accidentally accessing Web pages that they do not wish to see while they are using the Internet. For example, the Memphis Shelby County (Tennessee) Public Library's Internet use policy states that the library ""employs filtering technology to reduce the possibility that customers may encounter objectionable content in the form of depictions of full nudity and sexual acts.""  Third, libraries have sought to keep patrons (again, especially children) from intentionally accessing sexually explicit materials or other materials that the library deems inappropriate. For example, a study of the Tacoma Public Library's Internet use logs for the year 2000 showed that users between the ages of 11 and 15 accounted for 41% of the filter blocks that occurred on library computers. The study, which we credit, concluded that children and young teens were actively seeking to access sexually explicit images in the library. The Greenville Library's Board of Directors was particularly concerned that patrons were accessing ob-scene materials in the public library in violation of South Carolina's obscenity statute.  Finally, some libraries have regulated patrons' Internet use to attempt to control patrons' inappropriate (or illegal) behavior that is thought to stem from viewing Web pages that contain sexually explicit materials or content that is otherwise deemed unacceptable.  We recognize the concerns that led several of the public libraries whose librarians and board members testified in this case to start using Internet filtering software. The testimony of the Chairman of the Board of the Greenville Public Library is illustrative. In December 1999, there was considerable local press coverage in Greenville concerning adult patrons who routinely used the library to surf the Web for pornography. In response to public outcry stemming from the newspaper report, the Board of Trustees held a special board meeting to obtain information and to communicate with the public concerning the library's provision of Internet access. At this meeting, the Board learned for the first time of complaints about children being exposed to pornography that was displayed on the library's Internet terminals.  In late January to early February of 2000, the library installed privacy screens and recessed terminals in an effort to restrict the display of sexually explicit Web sites at the library. In February, 2000, the Board informed the library staff that they were expected to be familiar with the South Carolina obscenity statute and to enforce the policy prohibition on access to obscene materials, child pornography, or other materials prohibited under applicable local, state, and federal laws. Staff were told that they were to enforce the policy by means of a ""tap on the shoulder."" Prior to adopting its current Internet Use Policy, the Board adopted an ""Addendum to Current Internet Use Policy."" Under the policy, the Board temporarily instituted a two-hour time limit per day for Internet use; reduced substantially the number of computers with Internet access in the library; reconfigured the location of the computers so that librarians had visual contact with all Internet- accessible terminals; and removed the privacy screens from terminals with Internet access.  Even after the Board implemented the privacy screens and later the ""tap-on-the-shoulder"" policy combined with placing terminals in view of librarians, the library experienced a high turnover rate among reference librarians who worked in view of Internet terminals. Finding that the policies that it had tried did not prevent the viewing of sexually explicit materials in the library, the Board at one point considered discontinuing Internet access in the library. The Board finally concluded that the methods that it had used to regulate Internet use were not sufficient to stem the behavioral problems that it thought were linked to the availability of pornographic materials in the library. As a result, it implemented a mandatory filtering policy.  We note, however, that none of the libraries proffered by the defendants presented any systematic records or quantitative comparison of the amount of criminal or otherwise inappropriate behavior that occurred in their libraries before they began using Internet filtering software compared to the amount that happened after they installed the software. The plaintiffs' witnesses also testified that because public libraries are public places, incidents involving inappropriate behavior in libraries (sexual and otherwise) existed long before libraries provided access to the Internet.  b. Methods for Regulating Internet Use  The methods that public libraries use to regulate Internet use vary greatly. They can be organized into four categories: (1) channeling patrons' Internet use; (2) separating patrons so that they will not see what other patrons are viewing; (3) placing Internet terminals in public view and having librarians observe patrons to make sure that they are complying with the library's Internet use policy; and (4) using Internet filtering software.  The first category-channeling patrons' Internet use-frequently includes offering training to patrons on how to use the Internet, including how to access the information that they want and to avoid the materials that they do not want. Another technique that some public libraries use to direct their patrons to pages that the libraries have determined to be accurate and valuable is to establish links to ""recommended Web sites"" from the public library's home page (i.e., the page that appears when patrons begin a session at one of the library's public Internet terminals). Librarians select these recommended Web sites by using criteria similar to those employed in traditional collection development. However, unless the library determines otherwise, selection of these specific sites does not preclude patrons from attempting to access other Internet Web sites.  Libraries may extend the ""recommended Web sites"" method further by limiting patrons' access to only those Web sites that are reviewed and selected by the library's staff. For example, in 1996, the Westerville, Ohio Library offered Internet access to children through a service called the ""Library Channel."" This service was intended to be a means by which the library could organize the Internet in some fashion for presentation to patrons. Through the Library Channel, the computers in the children's section of the library were restricted to 2,000 to 3,000 sites selected by librarians. After three years, Westerville stopped using the Library Channel system because it overly constrained the children's ability to access materials on the Internet, and because the library experienced several technical problems with the system.  Public libraries also use several different techniques to separate patrons during Internet sessions so that they will not see what other patrons are viewing. The simplest way to achieve this result is to position the library's public Internet terminals so that they are located away from traffic patterns in the library (and from other terminals), for example, by placing them so that they face a wall. This method is obviously constrained by libraries' space limitations and physical layout. Some libraries have also installed privacy screens on their public Internet terminals. These screens make a monitor appear blank unless the viewer is looking at it head-on.5 Although the Multnomah and Fort Vancouver Libraries submitted records showing that they have received few complaints regarding patrons' unwilling exposure to materials on the Internet, privacy screens do not always prevent library patrons or employees from inadvertently seeing the materials that another patron is viewing when passing directly behind a terminal. They also have the drawback of making it difficult for patrons to work together at a single terminal, or for librarians to assist patrons at terminals, because it is difficult for two people to stand side by side and view a screen at the same time. Some library patrons also find privacy screens to be a hindrance and have attempted to remove them in order to improve the brightness of the screen or to make the view better.  Another method that libraries use to prevent patrons from seeing what other patrons are viewing on their terminals is the installation of ""recessed monitors."" Recessed monitors are computer screens that sit below the level of a desk top and are viewed from above. Although recessed monitors, especially when combined with privacy screens, eliminate almost all of the possibility of a patron accidentally viewing the contents on another patron's screen, they suffer from the same drawbacks as privacy screens, that is, they make it difficult for patrons to work together or with a librarian at a single terminal. Some librarians also testified that recessed monitors are costly, but did not indicate how expensive they are compared to privacy screens or filtering software. A related technique that some public libraries use is to create a separate children's Internet viewing area, where no adults except those accompanying children in their care may use the Internet terminals. This serves the objective of keeping children from inadvertently viewing materials appropriate only for adults that adults may be viewing on nearby terminals.  A third set of techniques that public libraries have used to enforce their Internet use policies takes the opposite tack from the privacy screens/recessed monitors approach by placing all of the library's public Internet terminals in prominent and visible locations, such as near the library's reference desk. This approach allows librarians to enforce their library's Internet use policy by observing what patrons are viewing and employing the tap-on-the-shoulder policy. Under this approach, when patrons are viewing materials that are inconsistent with the library's policies, a library staff member approaches them and asks them to view something else, or may ask them to end their Internet session. A patron who does not comply with these requests, or who repeatedly views materials not permitted under the library's Internet use policy, may have his or her Internet or library privileges suspended or revoked. But many librarians are uncomfortable with approaching patrons who are viewing sexually explicit images, finding confrontation unpleasant. Hence some libraries are reluctant to apply the tap-on-the-shoulder policy.  The fourth category of methods that public libraries employ to enforce their Internet use policies, and the one that gives rise to this case, is the use of Internet filtering software. According to the June 2000 Survey of Internet Access Management in Public Libraries, approximately 7% of libraries with public Internet access had mandated the use of blocking programs by adult patrons. Some public libraries provide patrons with the option of using a blocking program, allowing patrons to decide whether to engage the program when they or their children access the Internet. Other public libraries require their child patrons to use filtering software, but not their adult patrons.  Filtering software vendors sell their products on a subscription basis. The cost of a subscription varies with the number of computers on which the filtering software will be used. In 2001, the cost of the Cyber Patrol filtering software was $1,950 for 100 terminal licenses. The Greenville County Library System pays $2,500 per year for the N2H2 filtering software, and a subscription to the Websense filter costs Westerville Public Library approximately $1,200 per year.  No evidence was presented on the cost of privacy screens, recessed monitors, and the tap-on-the- shoulder policy, relative to the costs of filtering software. Nor did any of the libraries proffered by the government present any quantitative evidence on the relative effectiveness of use of privacy screens to prevent patrons from being unwillingly exposed to sexually explicit material, and the use of filters, discussed below. No evidence was presented, for example, comparing the number of patron complaints in those libraries that have tried both methods.  The librarians who testified at trial whose libraries use Internet filtering software all provide methods by which their patrons may ask the library to unblock specific Web sites or pages. Of these, only the Tacoma Public Library allows patrons to request that a URL be unblocked without providing any identifying information; Tacoma allows patrons to request a URL by sending an email from the Internet terminal that the patron is using that does not contain a return email address for the user. David Biek, the head librarian at the Tacoma Library's main branch, testified at trial that the library keeps records that would enable it to know which patrons made unblocking requests, but does not use that information to connect users with their requests. Biek also testified that he periodically scans the library's Internet use logs to search for:  (1) URLs that were erroneously blocked, so that he may unblock them; or (2) URLs that should have been blocked, but were not, in order to add them to a blocked category list. In the course of scanning the use logs, Biek has also found what looked like attempts to access child pornography. In two cases, he communicated his findings to law enforcement and turned over the logs in response to a subpoena.  At all events, it takes time for librarians to make decisions about whether to honor patrons' requests to unblock Web pages. In the libraries proffered by the defendants, unblocking decisions sometimes take between 24 hours and a week. Moreover, none of these libraries allows unrestricted access to the Internet pending a determination of the validity of a Web site blocked by the blocking programs. A few of the defendants' proffered libraries represented that individual librarians would have the discretion to allow a patron to have full Internet access on a staff computer upon request, but none claimed that allowing such access was mandatory, and patron access is supervised in every instance. None of these libraries makes differential unblocking decisions based on the patrons' age. Unblocking decisions are usually made identically for adults and minors. Unblocking decisions even for adults are usually based on suitability of the Web site for minors.  It is apparent that many patrons are reluctant or unwilling to ask librarians to unblock Web pages or sites that contain only materials that might be deemed personal or embarrassing, even if they are not sexually explicit or pornographic. We credit the testimony of Emmalyn Rood, discussed above, that she would have been unwilling as a young teen to ask a librarian to disable filtering software so that she could view materials concerning gay and lesbian issues. We also credit the testimony of Mark Brown, who stated that he would have been too embarrassed to ask a librarian to disable filtering software if it had impeded his ability to research treatments and cosmetic surgery options for his mother when she was diagnosed with breast cancer.  The pattern of patron requests to unblock specific URLs in the various libraries involved in this case also confirms our finding that patrons are largely unwilling to make unblocking requests unless they are permitted to do so anonymously. For example, the Fulton County Library receives only about 6 unblocking requests each year, the Greenville Public Library has received only 28 unblocking requests since August 21, 2000, and the Westerville, Ohio Library has received fewer than 10 unblocking requests since 1999. In light of the fact that a substantial amount of overblocking occurs in thesevery libraries, see infra Subsection II.E.4, we find that the lack of unblocking requests in these libraries does not reflect the effectiveness of the filters, but rather reflects patrons' reluctance to ask librarians to unblock sites.  E. Internet Filtering Technology  1. What Is Filtering Software, Who Makes It, and What Does It Do?  Commercially available products that can be configured to block or filter access to certain material on the Internet are among the ""technology protection measures"" that may be used to attempt to comply with CIPA. There are numerous filtering software products available commercially. Three network-based filtering products-SurfControl's Cyber Patrol, N2H2's Bess/ i2100, and Secure Computing's SmartFilter-currently have the lion's share of the public library market. The parties in this case deposed representatives from these three companies. Websense, another network-based blocking product, is also currently used in the public library market, and was discussed at trial.  Filtering software may be installed either on an individual computer or on a computer network. Network-based filtering software products are designed for use on a network of computers and funnel requests for Internet content through a centralized network device. Of the various commercially available blocking products, network-based products are the ones generally marketed to institutions, such as public libraries, that provide Internet access through multiple terminals.  Filtering programs function in a fairly simple way. When an Internet user requests access to a certain Web site or page, either by entering a domain name or IP address into a Web browser, or by clicking on a link, the filtering software checks that domain name or IP address against a previously compiled ""control list"" that may contain up to hundreds of thousands of URLs. The three companies deposed in this case have control lists containing between 200,000 and 600,000 URLs. These lists determine which URLs will be blocked.  Filtering software companies divide their control lists into multiple categories for which they have created unique definitions. SurfControl uses 40 such categories, N2H2 uses 35 categories (and seven ""exception"" categories), Websense uses 30 categories, and Secure Computing uses 30 categories. Filtering software customers choose which categories of URLs they wish to enable. A user ""enables"" a category in a filtering program by configuring the program to block all of the Web pages listed in that category.  The following is a list of the categories offered by each of these four filtering programs. SurfControl's Cyber Patrol offers the following categories: Adult/ Sexually Explicit; Advertisements; Arts & Entertainment; Chat; Computing & Internet; Criminal Skills; Drugs, Alcohol & Tobacco; Education; Finance & Investment; Food & Drink; Gambling; Games; Glamour & Intimate Apparel; Government & Politics; Hacking; Hate Speech; Health & Medicine; Hobbies & Recreation; Hosting Sites; Job Search & Career Development; Kids' Sites; Lifestyle & Culture; Motor Vehicles; News; Personals & Dating; Photo Searches; Real Estate; Reference; Religion; Remote Proxies; Sex Education; Search Engines; Shopping; Sports; Streaming Media; Travel; Usenet News; Violence; Weapons; and Web-based Email.  N2H2 offers the following categories: Adults Only; Alcohol; Auction; Chat; Drugs; Electronic Commerce; Employment Search; Free Mail; Free Pages; Gambling; Games; Hate/Discrimination; Illegal; Jokes; Lingerie; Message/Bulletin Boards; Murder/Suicide; News; Nudity; Personal Information; Personals; Pornography; Profanity; Recreation/Entertainment; School Cheating Information; Search Engines; Search Terms; Sex; Sports; Stocks; Swimsuits; Tasteless/Gross; Tobacco; Violence; and Weapons. The ""Nudity"" category purports to block only ""non-pornographic"" images. The ""Sex"" category is intended to block only those depictions of sexual activity that are not intended to arouse. The ""Tasteless/Gross"" category includes contents such as ""tasteless humor"" and ""graphic medical or accident scene photos."" Additionally, N2H2 offers seven ""exception categories."" These exception categories include Education, Filtered Search Engine, For Kids, History, Medical, Moderated, and Text/Spoken Only. When an exception category is enabled, access to any Web site or page via a URL associated with both a category and an exception, for example, both ""Sex"" and ""Education,"" will be allowed, even if the customer has enabled the product to otherwise block the category ""Sex."" As of November 15, 2001, of those Web sites categorized by N2H2 as ""Sex,"" 3.6% were also categorized as ""Education,"" 2.9% as ""Medical,"" and 1.6% as ""History.""  Websense offers the following categories: Abortion Advocacy; Advocacy Groups; Adult Material; Business & Economy; Drugs; Education; Entertainment; Gambling; Games; Government; Health; Illegal/Questionable; Information Technology; Internet Communication; Job Search; Militancy/Extremist; News & Media; Productivity Management; Bandwidth Management; Racism/ Hate; Religion; Shopping; Society & Lifestyle; Special Events; Sports; Tasteless; Travel; Vehicles; Violence; and Weapons. The ""Adult"" category includes ""full or partial nudity of individuals,"" as well as sites offering ""light adult humor and literature"" and ""[s]exually explicit language."" The ""Sexuality/Pornography"" category includes, inter alia, ""hard-core adult humor and literature"" and ""[s]exually explicit language."" The ""Tasteless"" category includes ""hard-to-stomach sites, including offensive, worthless or useless sites, grotesque or lurid depictions of bodily harm."" The ""Hacking"" category blocks ""sites providing information on or promoting illegal or questionable access to or use of communications equipment and/or software.""  SmartFilter offers the following categories: Anonymizers/Translators; Art & Culture; Chat; Criminal Skills; Cults/Occult; Dating; Drugs; Entertainment; Extreme/Obscene/Violence; Gambling; Games; General News; Hate Speech; Humor; Investing; Job Search; Lifestyle; Mature; MP3 Sites; Nudity; On-line Sales; Personal Pages; Politics, Opinion & Religion; Portal Sites; Self Help/Health; Sex; Sports; Travel; Usenet News; and Webmail.  Most importantly, no category definition used by filtering software companies is identical to CIPA's definitions of visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors. And category definitions and categorization decisions are made without reference to local community standards. Moreover, there is no judicial involvement in the creation of filtering software companies' category definitions and no judicial determination is made before these companies categorize a Web page or site.  Each filtering software company associates each URL in its control list with a ""tag"" or other identifier that indicates the company's evaluation of whether the content or features of the Web site or page accessed via that URL meets one or more of its category definitions. If a user attempts to access a Web site or page that is blocked by the filter, the user is immediately presented with a screen that indicates that a block has occurred as a result of the operation of the filtering software. These ""denial screens"" appear only at the point that a user attempts to access a site or page in an enabled category.  All four of the filtering programs on which evidence was presented allow users to customize the category lists that exist on their own PCs or servers by adding or removing specific URLs. For example, if a public librarian charged with administering a library's Internet terminals comes across a Web site that he or she finds objectionable that is not blocked by the filtering program that his or her library is using, then the librarian may add that URL to a category list that exists only on the library's network, and it would thereafter be blocked under that category. Similarly, a customer may remove individual URLs from category lists. Importantly, however, no one but the filtering companies has access to the complete list of URLs in any category. The actual URLs or IP addresses of the Web sites or pages contained in filtering software vendors' category lists are considered to be proprietary information, and are unavailable for review by customers or the general public, including the proprietors of Web sites that are blocked by filtering software.6  Filtering software companies do not generally notify the proprietors of Web sites when they block their sites. The only way to discover which URLs are blocked and which are not blocked by any particular filtering company is by testing individual URLs with filtering software, or by entering URLs one by one into the ""URL checker"" that most filtering software companies provide on their Web sites. Filtering software companies will entertain requests for recategorization from proprietors of Web sites that discover their sites are blocked. Because new pages are constantly being added to the Web, filtering companies provide their customers with periodic updates of category lists. Once a particular Web page or site is categorized, however, filtering companies generally do not re-review the contents of that page or site unless they receive a request to do so, even though the content on individual Web pages and sites changes frequently.  2. The Methods that Filtering Companies Use to Compile Category Lists  While the way in which filtering programs operate is conceptually straightforward-by comparing a requested URL to a previously compiled list of URLs and blocking access to the content at that URL if it appears on the list-accurately compiling and categorizing URLs to form the category lists is a more complex process that is impossible to conduct with any high degree of accuracy. The specific methods that filtering software companies use to compile and categorize control lists are, like the lists themselves, proprietary information. We will therefore set forth only general information on the various types of methods that all filtering companies deposed in this case use, and the sources of error that are at once inherent in those methods and unavoidable given the current architecture of the Internet and the current state of the art in automated classification systems. We base our understanding of these methods largely on the detailed testimony and expert report of Dr. Geoffrey Nunberg, which we credit. The plaintiffs offered, and the Court qualified, Nunberg as an expert witness on automated classification systems.7  When compiling and categorizing URLs for their category lists, filtering software companies go through two distinct phases. First, they must collect or ""harvest"" the relevant URLs from the vast number of sites that exist on the Web. Second, they must sort through the URLs they have collected to determine under which of the company's self-defined categories (if any), they should be classified. These tasks necessarily result in a tradeoff between overblocking (i.e., the blocking of content that does not meet the category definitions established by CIPA or by the filtering software companies), and underblocking (i.e., leaving off of a control list a URL that contains content that would meet the category definitions defined by CIPA or the filtering software companies).  a. The ""Harvesting"" Phase  Filtering software companies, given their limited resources, do not attempt to index or classify all of the billions of pages that exist on the Web. Instead, the set of pages that they attempt to examine and classify is restricted to a small portion of the Web. The companies use a variety of automated and manual methods to identify a universe of Web sites and pages to ""harvest"" for classification. These methods include: entering certain key words into search engines; following links from a variety of online directories (e.g., generalized directories like Yahoo or various specialized directories, such as those that provide links to sexually explicit content); reviewing lists of newly-registered domain names; buying or licensing lists of URLs from third parties; ""mining"" access logs maintained by their customers; and reviewing other submissions from customers and the public. The goal of each of these methods is to identify as many URLs as possible that are likely to contain content that falls within the filtering companies' category definitions.  The first method, entering certain keywords into commercial search engines, suffers from several limitations. First, the Web pages that may be ""harvested"" through this method are limited to those pages that search engines have already identified. However, as noted above, a substantial portion of the Web is not even theoretically indexable (because it is not linked to by any previously known page), and only approximately 50% of the pages that are theoretically indexable have actually been indexed by search engines. We are satisfied that the remainder of the indexable Web, and the vast ""Deep Web,"" which cannot currently be indexed, includes materials that meet CIPA's categories of visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, and harmful to minors. These portions of the Web cannot presently be harvested through the methods that filtering software companies use (except through reporting by customers or by observing users' log files), because they are not linked to other known pages. A user can, however, gain access to a Web site in the unindexed Web or the Deep Web if the Web site's proprietor or some other third party informs the user of the site's URL. Some Web sites, for example, send out mass email advertisements containing the site's URL, the spamming process we have described above.  Second, the search engines that software companies use for harvesting are able to search text only, not images. This is of critical importance, because CIPA, by its own terms, covers only ""visual depictions."" 20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(1)(A)(i); 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(5)(B)(i). Image recognition technology is immature, ineffective, and unlikely to improve substantially in the near future. None of the filtering software companies deposed in this case employs image recognition technology when harvesting or categorizing URLs. Due to the reliance on automated text analysis and the absence of image recognition technology, a Web page with sexually explicit images and no text cannot be harvested using a search engine. This problem is complicated by the fact that Web site publishers may use image files rather than text to represent words, i.e., they may use a file that computers understand to be a picture, like a photograph of a printed word, rather than regular text, making automated review of their textual content impossible. For example, if the Playboy Web site displays its name using a logo rather than regular text, a search engine would not see or recognize the Playboy name in that logo.  In addition to collecting URLs through search engines and Web directories (particularly those specializing in sexually explicit sites or other categories relevant to one of the filtering companies' category definitions), and by mining user logs and collecting URLs submitted by users, the filtering companies expand their list of harvested URLs by using ""spidering"" software that can ""crawl"" the lists of pages produced by the previous four methods, following their links downward to bring back the pages to which they link (and the pages to which those pages link, and so on, but usually down only a few levels). This spidering software uses the same type of technology that commercial Web search engines use.  While useful in expanding the number of relevant URLs, the ability to retrieve additional pages through this approach is limited by the architectural feature of the Web that page-to-page links tend to converge rather than diverge. That means that the more pages from which one spiders downward through links, the smaller the proportion of new sites one will uncover; if spidering the links of 1000 sites retrieved through a search engine or Web directory turns up 500 additional distinct adult sites, spidering an additional 1000 sites may turn up, for example, only 250 additional distinct sites, and the proportion of new sites uncovered will continue to diminish as more pages are spidered.  These limitations on the technology used to harvest a set of URLs for review will necessarily lead to substantial underblocking of material with respect to both the category definitions employed by filtering software companies and CIPA's definitions of visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors.  b. The ""Winnowing"" or Categorization Phase  Once the URLs have been harvested, some filtering software companies use automated key word analysis tools to evaluate the content and/or features of Web sites or pages accessed via a particular URL and to tentatively prioritize or categorize them. This process may be characterized as ""winnowing"" the harvested URLs. Automated systems currently used by filtering software vendors to prioritize, and to categorize or tentatively categorize the content and/or features of a Web site or page accessed via a particular URL operate by means of (1) simple key word searching, and (2) the use of statistical algorithms that rely on the frequency and structure of various linguistic features in a Web page's text. The automated systems used to categorize pages do not include image recognition technology. All of the filtering companies deposed in the case also employ human review of some or all collected Web pages at some point during the process of categorizing Web pages. As with the harvesting process, each technique employed in the winnowing process is subject to limitations that can result in both overblocking and underblocking.  First, simple key-word-based filters are subject to the obvious limitation that no string of words can identify all sites that contain sexually explicit content, and most strings of words are likely to appear in Web sites that are not properly classified as containing sexually explicit content. As noted above, filtering software companies also use more sophisticated automated classification systems for the statistical classification of texts. These systems assign weights to words or other textual features and use algorithms to determine whether a text belongs to a certain category. These algorithms sometimes make reference to the position of a word within a text or its relative proximity to other words. The weights are usually determined by machine learning methods (often described as ""artificial intelligence""). In this procedure, which resembles an automated form of trial and error, a system is given a ""training set"" consisting of documents preclassified into two or more groups, along with a set of features that might be potentially useful in classifying the sets. The system then ""learns"" rules that assign weights to those features according to how well they work in classification, and assigns each new document to a category with a certain probability.  Notwithstanding their ""artificial intelligence"" description, automated text classification systems are unable to grasp many distinctions between types of content that would be obvious to a human. And of critical importance, no presently conceivable technology can make the judgments necessary to determine whether a visual depiction fits the legal definitions of obscenity, child pornography, or harmful to minors.  Finally, all the filtering software companies deposed in this case use some form of human review in their process of winnowing and categorizing Web pages, although one company admitted to categorizing some Web pages without any human review. SmartFilter states that ""the final categorization of every Web site is done by a human reviewer."" Another filtering company asserts that of the 10,000 to 30,000 Web pages that enter the ""work queue"" to be categorized each day, two to three percent of those are automatically categorized by their PornByRef system (which only applies to materials classified in the pornography category), and the remainder are categorized by human review. SurfControl also states that no URL is ever added to its database without human review.  Human review of Web pages has the advantage of allowing more nuanced, if not more accurate, interpretations than automated classification systems are capable of making, but suffers from its own sources of error. The filtering software companies involved here have limited staff, of between eight and a few dozen people, available for hand reviewing Web pages. The reviewers that are employed by these companies base their categorization decisions on both the text and the visual depictions that appear on the sites or pages they are assigned to review. Human reviewers generally focus on English language Web sites, and are generally not required to be multi-lingual.  Given the speed at which human reviewers must work to keep up with even a fraction of the approximately 1.5 million pages added to the publicly indexable Web each day, human error is inevitable. Errors are likely to result from boredom or lack of attentiveness, overzealousness, or a desire to ""err on the side of caution"" by screening out material that might be offensive to some customers, even if it does not fit within any of the company's category definitions. None of the filtering companies trains its reviewers in the legal definitions concerning what is obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors, and none instructs reviewers to take community standards into account when making categorization decisions.  Perhaps because of limitations on the number of human reviewers and because of the large number of new pages that are added to the Web every day, filtering companies also widely engage in the practice of categorizing entire Web sites at the ""root URL,"" rather than engaging in a more fine-grained analysis of the individual pages within a Web site. For example, the filtering software companies deposed in this case all categorize the entire Playboy Web site as Adult, Sexually Explicit, or Pornography. They do not differentiate between pages within the site containing sexually explicit images or text, and for example, pages containing no sexually explicit content, such as the text of interviews of celebrities or politicians. If the ""root"" or ""top-level"" URL of a Web site is given a category tag, then access to all content on that Web site will be blocked if the assigned category is enabled by a customer.  In some cases, whole Web sites are blocked because the filtering companies focus only on the content of the home page that is accessed by entering the root URL. Entire Web sites containing multiple Web pages are commonly categorized without human review of each individual page on that site. Web sites that may contain multiple Web pages and that require authentication or payment for access are commonly categorized based solely on a human reviewer's evaluation of the pages that may be viewed prior to reaching the authentication or payment page.  Because there may be hundreds or thousands of pages under a root URL, filtering companies make it their primary mission to categorize the root URL, and categorize subsidiary pages if the need arises or if there is time. This form of overblocking is called ""inheritance,"" because lower-level pages inherit the categorization of the root URL without regard to their specific content. In some cases, ""reverse inheritance"" also occurs, i.e., parent sites inherit the classification of pages in a lower level of the site. This might happen when pages with sexual content appear in a Web site that is devoted primarily to non-sexual content. For example, N2H2's Bess filtering product classifies every page in the Salon.com Web site, which contains a wide range of news and cultural commentary, as ""Sex, Profanity,"" based on the fact that the site includes a regular column that deals with sexual issues.  Blocking by both domain name and IP address is another practice in which filtering companies engage that is a function both of the architecture of the Web and of the exigencies of dealing with the rapidly expanding number of Web pages. The category lists maintained by filtering software companies can include URLs in either their human-readable domain name address form, their numeric IP address form, or both. Through ""virtual hosting"" services, hundreds of thousands of Web sites with distinct domain names may share a single numeric IP address. To the extent that filtering companies block the IP addresses of virtual hosting services, they will necessarily block a substantial amount of content without reviewing it, and will likely overblock a substantial amount of content.  Another technique that filtering companies use in order to deal with a structural feature of the Internet is blocking the root level URLs of so-called ""loophole"" Web sites. These are Web sites that provide access to a particular Web page, but display in the user's browser a URL that is different from the URL with which the particular page is usually associated. Because of this feature, they provide a ""loophole"" that can be used to get around filtering software, i.e., they display a URL that is different from the one that appears on the filtering company's control list. ""Loophole"" Web sites include caches of Web pages that have been removed from their original location, ""anonymizer"" sites, and translation sites.  Caches are archived copies that some search engines, such as Google, keep of the Web pages they index. The cached copy stored by Google will have a URL that is different from the original URL. Because Web sites often change rapidly, caches are the only way to access pages that have been taken down, revised, or have changed their URLs for some reason. For example, a magazine might place its current stories under a given URL, and replace them monthly with new stories. If a user wanted to find an article published six months ago, he or she would be unable to access it if not for Google's cached version.  Some sites on the Web serve as a proxy or intermediary between a user and another Web page. When using a proxy server, a user does not access the page from its original URL, but rather from the URL of the proxy server. One type of proxy service is an ""anonymizer."" Users may access Web sites indirectly via an anonymizer when they do not want the Web site they are visiting to be able to determine the IP address from which they are accessing the site, or to leave ""cookies"" on their browser.8 Some proxy servers can be used to attempt to translate Web page content from one language to another. Rather than directly accessing the original Web page in its original language, users can instead indirectly access the page via a proxy server offering translation features.  As noted above, filtering companies often block loophole sites, such as caches, anonymizers, and translation sites. The practice of blocking loophole sites necessarily results in a significant amount of overblocking, because the vast majority of the pages that are cached, for example, do not contain content that would match a filtering company's category definitions. Filters that do not block these loophole sites, however, may enable users to access any URL on the Web via the loophole site, thus resulting in substantial underblocking.  c. The Process for ""Re-Reviewing""  Web Pages After Their Initial Categorization  Most filtering software companies do not engage in subsequent reviews of categorized sites or pages on a scheduled basis. Priority is placed on reviewing and categorizing new sites and pages, rather than on re-reviewing already categorized sites and pages. Typically, a filtering software vendor's previous categorization of a Web site is not re-reviewed for accuracy when new pages are added to the Web site. To the extent the Web site was previously categorized as a whole, the new pages added to the site usually share the categorization assigned by the blocking product vendor. This necessarily results in both over- and underblocking, because, as noted above, the content of Web pages and Web sites changes relatively rapidly.  In addition to the content on Web sites or pages changing rapidly, Web sites themselves may disappear and be replaced by sites with entirely different content. If an IP address associated with a particular Web site is blocked under a particular category and the Web site goes out of existence, then the IP address likely would be reassigned to a different Web site, either by an Internet service provider or by a registration organization, such as the American Registry for Internet Numbers, see http://www.arin.net. In that case, the site that received the reassigned IP address would likely be miscategorized. Because filtering companies do not engage in systematic re-review of their category lists, such a site would likely remain miscategorized unless someone submitted it to the filtering company for re-review, increasing the incidence of over- and underblocking.  This failure to re-review Web pages primarily increases a filtering company's rate of overblocking. However, if a filtering company does not re-review Web pages after it determines that they do not fall into any of its blocking categories, then that would result in underblocking (because, for example, a page might add sexually explicit content).  3. The Inherent Tradeoff Between Overblocking and Underblocking  There is an inherent tradeoff between any filter's rate of overblocking (which information scientists also call ""precision"") and its rate of underblocking (which is also referred to as ""recall""). The rate of overblocking or precision is measured by the proportion of the things a classification system assigns to a certain category that are appropriately classified. The plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Nunberg, provided the hypothetical example of a classification system that is asked to pick out pictures of dogs from a database consisting of 1000 pictures of animals, of which 80 were actually dogs. If it returned 100 hits, of which 80 were in fact pictures of dogs, and the remaining 20 were pictures of cats, horses, and deer, we would say that the system identified dog pictures with a precision of 80%. This would be analogous to a filter that overblocked at a rate of 20%.  The recall measure involves determining what proportion of the actual members of a category the classification system has been able to identify. For example, if the hypothetical animal-picture database contained a total of 200 pictures of dogs, and the system identified 80 of them and failed to identify 120, it would have performed with a recall of 40%. This would be analogous to a filter that underblocked 60% of the material in a category.  In automated classification systems, there is always a tradeoff between precision and recall. In the animal-picture example, the recall could be improved by using a looser set of criteria to identify the dog pictures in the set, such as any animal with four legs, and all the dogs would be identified, but cats and other animals would also be included, with a resulting loss of precision. The same tradeoff exists between rates of overblocking and underblocking in filtering systems that use automated classification systems. For example, an automated system that classifies any Web page that contains the word ""sex"" as sexually explicit will underblock much less, but overblock much more, than a system that classifies any Web page containing the phrase ""free pictures of people having sex"" as sexually explicit.  This tradeoff between overblocking and underblocking also applies not just to automated classification systems, but also to filters that use only human review. Given the approximately two billion pages that exist on the Web, the 1.5 million new pages that are added daily, and the rate at which content on existing pages changes, if a filtering company blocks only those Web pages that have been reviewed by humans, it will be impossible, as a practical matter, to avoid vast amounts of underblocking. Techniques used by human reviewers such as blocking at the IP address level, domain name level, or directory level reduce the rates of underblocking, but necessarily increase the rates of overblocking, as discussed above.  To use a simple example, it would be easy to design a filter intended to block sexually explicit speech that completely avoids overblocking. Such a filter would have only a single sexually explicit Web site on its control list, which could be reviewed daily to ensure that its content does not change. While there would be no overblocking problem with such a filter, such a filter would have a severe underblocking problem, as it would fail to block all the sexually explicit speech on the Web other than the one site on its control list. Similarly, it would also be easy to design a filter intended to block sexually explicit speech that completely avoids underblocking. Such a filter would operate by permitting users to view only a single Web site, e.g., the Sesame Street Web site. While there would be no underblocking problem with such a filter, it would have a severe overblocking problem, as it would block access to millions of non-sexually explicit sites on the Web other than the Sesame Street site.  While it is thus quite simple to design a filter that does not overblock, and equally simple to design a filter that does not underblock, it is currently impossible, given the Internet's size, rate of growth, rate of change, and architecture, and given the state of the art of automated classification systems, to develop a filter that neither underblocks nor overblocks a substantial amount of speech. The more effective a filter is at blocking Web sites in a given category, the more the filter will necessarily overblock. Any filter that is reasonably effective in preventing users from accessing sexually explicit content on the Web will necessarily block substantial amounts of non-sexually explicit speech.  4. Attempts to Quantify Filtering Programs' Rates of Over-and Underblocking  The government presented three studies, two from expert witnesses, and one from a librarian fact witness who conducted a study using Internet use logs from his own library, that attempt to quantify the over- and underblocking rates of five different filtering programs. The plaintiffs presented one expert witness who attempted to quantify the rates of over- and underblocking for various programs. Each of these attempts to quantify rates of over- and underblocking suffers from various methodological flaws.  The fundamental problem with calculating over- and underblocking rates is selecting a universe of Web sites or Web pages to serve as the set to be tested. The studies that the parties submitted in this case took two different approaches to this problem. Two of the studies, one prepared by the plaintiffs' expert witness Chris Hunter, a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, and the other prepared by the defendants' expert, Chris Lemmons of eTesting Laboratories, in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, approached this problem by compiling two separate lists of Web sites, one of URLs that they deemed should be blocked according to the filters' criteria, and another of URLs that they deemed should not be blocked according to the filters' criteria. They compiled these lists by choosing Web sites from the results of certain key word searches.9 The problem with this selection method is that it is neither random, nor does it necessarily approximate the universe of Web pages that library patrons visit.  The two other studies, one by David Biek, head librarian at the Tacoma Public Library's main branch, and one by Cory Finnell of Certus Consulting Group, of Seattle, Washington, chose actual logs of Web pages visited by library patrons during specific time periods as the universe of Web pages to analyze. This method, while surely not as accurate as a truly random sample of the indexed Web would be (assuming it would be possible to take such a sample), has the virtue of using the actual Web sites that library patrons visited during a specific period. Because library patrons selected the universe of Web sites that Biek and Finnell's studies analyzed, this removes the possibility of bias resulting from the study author's selection of the universe of sites to be reviewed. We find that the Lemmons and Hunter studies are of little probative value because of the methodology used to select the sample universe of Web sites to be tested. We will therefore focus on the studies conducted by Finnell and Biek in trying to ascertain estimates of the rates of over- and underblocking that takes place when filters are used in public libraries.  The government hired expert witness Cory Finnell to study the Internet logs compiled by the public libraries systems in Tacoma, Washington; Westerville, Ohio; and Greenville, South Carolina. Each of these libraries uses filtering software that keeps a log of information about individual Web site requests made by library patrons. Finnell, whose consulting firm specializes in data analysis, has substantial experience evaluating Internet access logs generated on networked systems. He spent more than a year developing a reporting tool for N2H2, and, in the course of that work, acquired a familiarity with the design and operation of Internet filtering products.  The Tacoma library uses Cyber Patrol filtering software, and logs information only on sites that were blocked. Finnell worked from a list of all sites that were blocked in the Tacoma public library in the month of August 2001. The Westerville library uses the Websense filtering product, and logs information on both blocked sites and non-blocked sites. When the logs reach a certain size, they are overwritten by new usage logs. Because of this overwriting feature, logs were available to Finnell only for the relatively short period from October 1, 2001 to October 3, 2001. The Greenville library uses N2H2's filtering product and logs both blocked sites and sites that patrons accessed. The logs contain more than 500,000 records per day. Because of the volume of the records, Finnell restricted his analysis to the period from August 2, 2001 to August 15, 2001.  Finnell calculated an overblocking rate for each of the three libraries by examining the host Web site containing each of the blocked pages. He did not employ a sampling technique, but instead examined each blocked Web site. If the contents of a host Web site or the pages within the Web site were consistent with the filtering product's definition of the category under which the site was blocked, Finnell considered it to be an accurate block. Finnell and three others, two of whom were temporary employees, examined the Web sites to determine whether they were consistent with the filtering companies' category definitions. Their review was, of course, necessarily limited by:  (1) the clarity of the filtering companies' category definitions; (2) Finnell's and his employees' interpretations of the definitions; and (3) human error. The study's reliability is also undercut by the fact that Finnell failed to archive the blocked Web pages as they existed either at the point that a patron in one of the three libraries was denied access or when Finnell and his team reviewed the pages. It is therefore impossible for anyone to check the accuracy and consistency of Finnell's review team, or to know whether the pages contained the same content when the block occurred as they did when Finnell's team reviewed them. This is a key flaw, because the results of the study depend on individual determinations as to overblocking and underblocking, in which Finnell and his team were required to compare what they saw on the Web pages that they reviewed with standard definitions provided by the filtering company.  Tacoma library's Cyber Patrol software blocked 836 unique Web sites during the month of August. Finnell determined that 783 of those blocks were accurate and that 53 were inaccurate.10 The error rate for Cyber Patrol was therefore estimated to be 6.34%, and the true error rate was estimated with 95% confidence to lie within the range of 4.69% to 7.99%.11 Finnell and his team reviewed 185 unique Web sites that were blocked by Westerville Library's Websense filter during the logged period and determined that 158 of them were accurate and that 27 of them were inaccurate. He therefore estimated the Websense filter's overblocking rate at 14.59% with a 95% confidence interval of 9.51% to 19.68%. Additionally, Finnell examined 1,674 unique Web sites that were blocked by the Greenville Library's N2H2 filter during the relevant period and determined that 1,520 were accurate and that 87 were inaccurate. This yields an estimated overblocking rate of 5.41% and a 95% confidence interval of 4.33% to 6.55%.  Finnell's methodology was materially flawed in that it understates the rate of overblocking for the following reasons. First, patrons from the three libraries knew that the filters were operating, and may have been deterred from attempting to access Web sites that they perceived to be ""borderline"" sites, i.e., those that may or may not have been appropriately filtered according to the filtering companies' category definitions. Second, in their cross-examination of Finnell, the plaintiffs offered screen shots of a number of Web sites that, according to Finnell, had been appropriately blocked, but that Finnell admitted contained only benign materials. Finnell's explanation was that the Web sites must have changed between the time when he conducted the study and the time of the trial, but because he did not archive the images as they existed when his team reviewed them for the study, there is no way to verify this. Third, because of the way in which Finnell counted blocked Web sites-i.e., if separate patrons attempted to reach the same Web site, or one or more patrons attempted to access more than one page on a single Web site, Finnell counted these attempts as a single block, see supra note 10-his results necessarily understate the number of times that patrons were erroneously denied access to information.  At all events, there is no doubt that Finnell's estimated rates of overblocking, which are based on the filtering companies' own category definitions, significantly understate the rate of overblocking with respect to CIPA's category definitions for filtering for adults. The filters used in the Tacoma, Westerville, and Greenville libraries were configured to block, among other things, images of full nudity and sexually explicit materials. There is no dispute, however, that these categories are far broader than CIPA's categories of visual depictions that are obscene, or child pornography, the two categories of material that libraries subject to CIPA must certify that they filter during adults' use of the Internet.  Finnell's study also calculated underblocking rates with respect to the Westerville and Greenville Libraries (both of which logged not only their blocked sites, but all sites visited by their patrons), by taking random samples of URLs from the list of sites that were not blocked. The study used a sample of 159 sites that were accessed by Westerville patrons and determined that only one of them should have been blocked under the software's category definitions, yielding an underblocking rate of 0.6%. Given the size of the sample, the 95% confidence interval is 0% to 1.86%. The study examined a sample of 254 Web sites accessed by patrons in Greenville and found that three of them should have been blocked under the filtering software's category definitions. This results in an estimated underblocking rate of 1.2% with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 0% to 2.51%.  We do not credit Finnell's estimates of the rates of underblocking in the Westerville and Greenville public libraries for several reasons. First, Finnell's estimates likely understate the actual rate of underblocking because patrons, who knew that filtering programs were operating in the Greenville and Westerville Libraries, may have refrained from attempting to access sites with sexually explicit materials, or other contents that they knew would probably meet a filtering program's blocked categories. Second, and most importantly, we think that the formula that Finnell used to calculate the rate of underblocking in these two libraries is not as meaningful as the formula that information scientists typically use to calculate a rate of recall, which we describe above in Subsection II.E.3. As Dr. Nunberg explained, the standard method that information scientists use to calculate a rate of recall is to sort a set of items into two groups, those that fall into a particular category (e.g., those that should have been blocked by a filter) and those that do not. The rate of recall is then calculated by dividing the number of items that the system correctly identified as belonging to the category by the total number of items in the category.  In the example above, we discussed a database that contained 1000 photographs. Assume that 200 of these photographs were pictures of dogs. If, for example, a classification system designed to identify pictures of dogs identified 80 of the dog pictures and failed to identify 120, it would have performed with a recall rate of 40%. This would be analogous to a filter that underblocked at a rate of 60%. To calculate the recall rate of the filters in the Westerville and Greenville public libraries in accordance with the standard method described above, Finnell should have taken a sample of sites from the libraries' Internet use logs (including both sites that were blocked and sites that were not), and divided the number of sites in the sample that the filter incorrectly failed to block by the total number of sites in the sample that should have been blocked. What Finnell did instead was to take a sample of sites that were not blocked, and divide the total number of sites in this sample by the number of sites in the sample that should have been blocked. This made the denominator that Finnell used much larger than it would have been had he used the standard method for calculating recall, consequently making the underblocking rate that he calculated much lower than it would have been under the standard method.12  Moreover, despite the relatively low rates of underblocking that Finnell's study found, librarians from several of the libraries proffered by defendants that use blocking products, including Greenville, Tacoma, and Westerville, testified that there are instances of underblocking in their libraries. No quantitative evidence was presented comparing the effectiveness of filters and other alternative methods used by libraries to prevent patrons from accessing visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or in the case of minors, harmful to minors.  Biek undertook a similar study of the overblocking rates that result from the Tacoma Library's use of the Cyber Patrol software. He began with the 3,733 individual blocks that occurred in the Tacoma Library in October 2000 and drew from this data set a random sample of 786 URLs. He calculated two rates of overblocking, one with respect to the Tacoma Library's policy on Internet use-that the pictorial content of the site may not include ""graphic materials depicting full nudity and sexual acts which are portrayed obviously and exclusively for sensational or pornographic purposes""-and the other with respect to Cyber Patrol's own category definitions. He estimated that Cyber Patrol overblocked 4% of all Web pages in October 2000 with respect to the definitions of the Tacoma Library's Internet Policy and 2% of all pages with respect to Cyber Patrol's own category definitions.13  It is difficult to determine how reliable Biek's conclusions are, because he did not keep records of the raw data that he used in his study; nor did he archive images of the Web pages as they looked when he made the determination whether they were properly classified by the Cyber Patrol program. Without this information, it is impossible to verify his conclusions (or to undermine them). And Biek's study certainly understates Cyber Patrol's overblocking rate for some of the same reasons that Finnell's study likely understates the true rates of overblocking used in the libraries that he studied.  We also note that Finnell's study, which analyzed a set of Internet logs from the Tacoma Library during which the same filtering program was operating with the same set of blocking categories enabled, found a significantly higher rate of overblocking than the Biek study did. Biek found a rate of overblocking of approximately 2% while the Finnell study estimated a 6.34% rate of overblocking. At all events, the category definitions employed by CIPA, at least with respect to adult use-visual depictions that are obscene or child pornography-are narrower than the materials prohibited by the Tacoma Library policy, and therefore Biek's study understates the rate of overblocking with respect to CIPA's definitions for adults.  In sum, we think that Finnell's study, while we do not credit its estimates of underblocking, is useful because it states lower bounds with respect to the rates of overblocking that occurred when the Cyber Patrol, Websense, and N2H2 filters were operating in public libraries. While these rates are substantial-between nearly 6% and 15%-we think, for the reasons stated above, that they greatly understate the actual rates of overblocking that occurs, and therefore cannot be considered as anything more than minimum estimates of the rates of overblocking that happens in all filtering programs.  5. Methods of Obtaining Examples of Erroneously Blocked Web Sites  The plaintiffs assembled a list of several thousand Web sites that they contend were, at the time of the study, likely to have been erroneously blocked by one or more of four major commercial filtering programs: SurfControl Cyber Patrol 6.0.1.47, N2H2 Internet Filtering 2.0, Secure Computing SmartFilter 3.0.0.01, and Websense Enterprise 4.3.0. They compiled this list using a two- step process. First, Benjamin Edelman, an expert witness who testified before us, compiled a list of more than 500,000 URLs and devised a program to feed them through all four filtering programs in order to compile a list of URLs that might have been erroneously blocked by one or more of the programs.14 Second, Edelman forwarded subsets of the list that he compiled to librarians and professors of library science whom the plaintiffs had hired to review the blocked sites for suitability in the public library context.  Edelman assembled the list of URLs by compiling Web pages that were blocked by the following categories in the four programs: Cyber Patrol: Adult/ Sexually Explicit; N2H2: Adults Only, Nudity, Pornography, and Sex, with ""exceptions"" engaged in the categories of Education, For Kids, History, Medical, Moderated, and Text/Spoken Only; SmartFilter: Sex, Nudity, Mature, and Extreme; Websense: Adult Content, Nudity, and Sex.  Edelman then assembled a database of Web sites for possible testing. He derived this list by automatically compiling URLs from the Yahoo index of Web sites, taking them from categories from the Yahoo index that differed significantly from the classifications that he had enabled in each of the blocking programs (taking, for example, Web sites from Yahoo's ""Government"" category). He then expanded this list by entering URLs taken from the Yahoo index into the Google search engine's ""related"" search function, which provides the user with a list of similar sites. Edelman also included and excluded specific Web sites at the request of the plaintiffs' counsel.  Taking the list of more than 500,000 URLs that he had compiled, Edelman used an automated system that he had developed to test whether particular URLs were blocked by each of the four filtering programs. This testing took place between February and October 2001. He recorded the specific dates on which particular sites were blocked by particular programs, and, using commercial archiving software, archived the contents of the home page of the blocked Web sites (and in some instances the pages linked to from the home page) as it existed when it was blocked.15 Through this process, Edelman, whose testimony we credit, compiled a list of 6,777 URLs that were blocked by one or more of the four programs. Because these sites were chosen from categories from the Yahoo directory that were unrelated to the filtering categories that were enabled during the test (i.e., ""Government"" vs. ""Nudity""), he reasoned that they were likely erroneously blocked. As explained in the margin, Edelman repeated his testing and discovered that Cyber Patrol had unblocked most of the pages on the list of 6,777 after he had published the list on his Web site. His records indicate that an employee of SurfControl (the company that produces Cyber Patrol software) accessed his site and presumably checked out the URLs on the list, thus confirming Edelman's judgment that the majority of URLs on the list were erroneously blocked.16  Edelman forwarded the list of blocked sites to Dr. Joseph Janes, an Assistant Professor in the Information School of the University of Washington who also testified at trial as an expert witness. Janes reviewed the sites that Edelman compiled to determine whether they are consistent with library collection development, i.e., whether they are sites to which a reference librarian would, consistent with professional standards, direct a patron as a source of information.17  Edelman forwarded Janes a list of 6,775 Web sites, almost the entire list of blocked sites that he collected, from which Janes took a random sample of 859 using the SPSS statistical software package. Janes indicated that he chose a sample size of 859 because it would yield a 95% confidence interval of plus or minus 2.5%. Janes recruited a group of 16 reviewers, most of whom were current or former students at the University of Washington's Information School, to help him identify which sites were appropriate for library use. We describe the process that he used in the margin.18 Due to the inability of a member of Janes's review team to complete the reviewing process, Janes had to cut 157 Web sites out of the sample, but because the Web sites were randomly assigned to reviewers, it is unlikely that these sites differed significantly from the rest of the sample. That left the sample size at 699, which widened the 95% confidence interval to plus or minus 2.8%.  Of the total 699 sites reviewed, Janes's team concluded that 165 of them, or 23.6% percent of the sample, were not of any value in the library context (i.e., no librarian would, consistent with professional standards, refer a patron to these sites as a source of information). They were unable to find 60 of the Web sites, or 8.6% of the sample. Therefore, they concluded that the remaining 474 Web sites, or 67.8% of the sample, were examples of overblocking with respect to materials that are appropriate sources of information in public libraries. Applying a 95% confidence interval of plus or minus 2.8%, the study concluded that we can be 95% confident that the actual percentage of sites in the list of 6,775 sites that are appropriate for use in public libraries is somewhere between 65.0% and 70.6%. In other words, we can be 95% certain that the actual number of sites out of the 6,775 that Edelman forwarded to Janes that are appropriate for use in public libraries (under Janes's standard) is somewhere between 4,403 and 4,783.  The government raised some valid criticisms of Janes's methodology, attacking in particular the fact that, while sites that received two ""yes"" votes in the first round of voting were determined to be of sufficient interest in a library context to be removed from further analysis, sites receiving one or two ""no"" votes were sent to the next round. The government also correctly points out that results of Janes's study can be generalized only to the population of 6,775 sites that Edelman forwarded to Janes. Even taking these criticisms into account, and discounting Janes's numbers appropriately, we credit Janes's study as confirming that Edelman's set of 6,775 Web sites contains at least a few thousand URLs that were erroneously blocked by one or more of the four filtering programs that he used, whether judged against CIPA's definitions, the filters' own category criteria, or against the standard that the Janes study used. Edelman tested only 500,000 unique URLs out of the 4000 times that many, or two billion, that are estimated to exist in the indexable Web. Even assuming that Edelman chose the URLs that were most likely to be erroneously blocked by commercial filtering programs, we conclude that many times the number of pages that Edelman identified are erroneously blocked by one or more of the filtering programs that he tested.  Edelman's and Janes's studies provide numerous specific examples of Web pages that were erroneously blocked by one or more filtering programs. The Web pages that were erroneously blocked by one or more of the filtering programs do not fall into any neat patterns; they range widely in subject matter, and it is difficult to tell why they may have been overblocked. The list that Edelman compiled, for example, contains Web pages relating to religion, politics and government, health, careers, education, travel, sports, and many other topics. In the next section, we provide examples from each of these categories.  6. Examples of Erroneously Blocked Web Sites  Several of the erroneously blocked Web sites had content relating to churches, religious orders, religious charities, and religious fellowship organizations. These included the following Web sites: the Knights of Columbus Council 4828, a Catholic men's group associated with St. Patrick's Church in Fallon, Nevada, http:// msnhomepages.talkcity.com/SpiritSt/kofc4828, which was blocked by Cyber Patrol in the ""Adult/Sexually Explicit"" category; the Agape Church of Searcy, Arkansas, http://www.agapechurch.com, which was blocked by Websense as ""Adult Content""; the home page of the Lesbian and Gay Havurah of the Long Beach, California Jewish Community Center, http:// www.compupix.com/gay/havurah.htm, which was blocked by N2H2 as ""Adults Only, Pornography,"" by Smartfilter as ""Sex,"" and by Websense as ""Sex""; Orphanage Emmanuel, a Christian orphanage in Honduras that houses 225 children, http://home8.inet.tele. dk/rfb5y(2)27viva, which was blocked by Cyber Patrol in the ""Adult/Sexually Explicit"" category; Vision Art Online, which sells wooden wall hangings for the home that contain prayers, passages from the Bible, and images of the Star of David, http://www. visionartonline.com, which was blocked in Websense's ""Sex"" category; and the home page of Tenzin Palmo, a Buddhist nun, which contained a description of her project to build a Buddhist nunnery and international retreat center for women, http://www.tenzinpalmo.com, which was categorized as ""Nudity"" by N2H2.  Several blocked sites also contained information about governmental entities or specific political candidates, or contained political commentary. These included: the Web site for Kelley Ross, a Libertarian candidate for the California State Assembly, http:// www.friesian.com/ross/ca40, which N2H2 blocked as ""Nudity""; the Web site for Bob Coughlin, a town selectman in Dedham, Massachusetts, http://www.bob coughlin.org, which was blocked under N2H2's ""Nudity"" category; a list of Web sites containing information about government and politics in Adams County, Pennsylvania, http://www.geocities.com/ adamscopa, which was blocked by Websense as ""Sex""; the Web site for Wisconsin Right to Life, http:// www.wrtl.org, which N2H2 blocked as ""Nudity""; a Web site that promotes federalism in Uganda, http://federo. com, which N2H2 blocked as ""Adults Only, Pornography""; ""Fight the Death Penalty in the USA,"" a Danish Web site dedicated to criticizing the American system of capital punishment, http://www.fdp.dk, which N2H2 blocked as ""Pornography""; and ""Dumb Laws,"" a humor Web site that makes fun of outmoded laws, http://www.dumblaws.com, which N2H2 blocked under its ""Sex"" category.  Erroneously blocked Web sites relating to health issues included the following: a guide to allergies, http://www.x-sitez.com/allergy, which was categorized as ""Adults Only, Pornography"" by N2H2; a health question and answer site sponsored by Columbia University, http://www.goaskalice.com.columbia.edu, which was blocked as ""Sex"" by N2H2, and as ""Mature"" by Smartfilter; the Western Amputee Support Alliance Home Page, http://www.usinter.net/wasa, which was blocked by N2H2 as ""Pornography""; the Web site of the Willis-Knighton Cancer Center, a Shreveport, Louisiana cancer treatment facility, http://cancerftr.wkmc. com, which was blocked by Websense under the ""Sex"" category; and a site dealing with halitosis, http:// www.dreamcastle.com/tungs, which was blocked by N2H2 as ""Adults, Pornography,"" by Smartfilter as ""Sex,"" by Cyber Patrol as ""Adult/Sexually Explicit,"" and by Websense as ""Adult Content.""  The filtering programs also erroneously blocked several Web sites having to do with education and careers. The filtering programs blocked two sites that provide information on home schooling. ""Hom Edu Station-the Internet Source for Home Education,"" http://www.perigee.net/mcmullen/homedu station/, was categorized by Cyber Patrol as ""Adult/Sexually Explicit."" Smartfilter blocked ""Apricot: A Web site made by and for home schoolers,"" http:// apricotpie.com, as ""Sex."" The programs also miscategorized several career-related sites. ""Social Work Search,"" http://www. socialworksearch.com/, is a directory for social workers that Cyber Patrol placed in its ""Adult/Sexually Explicit"" category. The ""Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Southern Nevada,"" http://www.lambdalv.com, ""a forum for the business community to develop relationships within the Las Vegas lesbian, gay, transsexual, and bisexual community"" was blocked by N2H2 as ""Adults Only, Pornography."" A site for aspiring dentists, http://www.vvm.com/bond/home.htm, was blocked by Cyber Patrol in its ""Adult/Sexually Explicit"" category.  The filtering programs erroneously blocked many travel Web sites, including: the Web site for the Allen Farmhouse Bed & Breakfast of Alleghany County, North Carolina, http://planet-nc.com/Beth/index.html, which Websense blocked as ""Adult Content""; Odysseus Gay Travel, a travel company serving gay men, http:// www.odyusa.com, which N2H2 categorized as ""Adults Only, Pornography""; Southern Alberta Fly Fishing Outfitters, http://albertaflyfish.com, which N2H2 blocked as ""Pornography""; and ""Nature and Culture Conscious Travel,"" a tour operator in Namibia, http:// www.trans-namibia-tours.com, which was categorized as ""Pornography"" by N2H2.  The filtering programs also miscategorized a large number of sports Web sites. These included: a site devoted to Willie O'Ree, the first African American player in the National Hockey League, http:// www. missioncreep.com/mw/oree.html, which Websense blocked under its ""Nudity"" category; the home page of the Sydney University Australian Football Club, http:// www.tek.com.au/suafc, which N2H2 blocked as ""Adults Only, Pornography,"" Smartfilter blocked as ""Sex,"" Cyber Patrol blocked as ""Adult/Sexually Explicit"" and Websense blocked as ""Sex""; and a fan's page devoted to the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team, http://www. torontomapleleafs.atmypage.com, which N2H2 blocked under the ""Pornography"" category.  7. Conclusion: The Effectiveness of Filtering Programs  Public libraries have adopted a variety of means of dealing with problems created by the provision of Internet access. The large amount of sexually explicit speech that is freely available on the Internet has, to varying degrees, led to patron complaints about such matters as unsought exposure to offensive material, incidents of staff and patron harassment by individuals viewing sexually explicit content on the Internet, and the use of library computers to access illegal material, such as child pornography. In some libraries, youthful library patrons have persistently attempted to use the Internet to access hardcore pornography.  Those public libraries that have responded to these problems by using software filters have found such filters to provide a relatively effective means of preventing patrons from accessing sexually explicit material on the Internet. Nonetheless, out of the entire universe of speech on the Internet falling within the filtering products' category definitions, the filters will incorrectly fail to block a substantial amount of speech. Thus, software filters have not completely eliminated the problems that public libraries have sought to address by using the filters, as evidenced by frequent instances of underblocking. Nor is there any quantitative evidence of the relative effectiveness of filters and the alternatives to filters that are also intended to prevent patrons from accessing illegal content on the Internet.  Even more importantly (for this case), although software filters provide a relatively cheap and effective, albeit imperfect, means for public libraries to prevent patrons from accessing speech that falls within the filters' category definitions, we find that commercially available filtering programs erroneously block a huge amount of speech that is protected by the First Amendment. Any currently available filtering product that is reasonably effective in preventing users from accessing content within the filter's category definitions will necessarily block countless thousands of Web pages, the content of which does not match the filtering company's category definitions, much less the legal definitions of obscenity, child pornography, or harmful to minors. Even Finnell, an expert witness for the defendants, found that between 6% and 15% of the blocked Web sites in the public libraries that he analyzed did not contain content that meets even the filtering products' own definitions of sexually explicit content, let alone CIPA's definitions.  This phenomenon occurs for a number of reasons explicated in the more detailed findings of fact supra. These include limitations on filtering companies' ability to: (1) harvest Web pages for review; (2) review and categorize the Web pages that they have harvested; and (3) engage in regular re-review of the Web pages that they have previously reviewed. The primary limitations on filtering companies' ability to harvest Web pages for review is that a substantial majority of pages on the Web are not indexable using the spidering technology that Web search engines use, and that together, search engines have indexed only around half of the Web pages that are theoretically indexable. The fast rate of growth in the number of Web pages also limits filtering companies' ability to harvest pages for review. These shortcomings necessarily result in significant underblocking.  Several limitations on filtering companies' ability to review and categorize the Web pages that they have harvested also contribute to over- and underblocking. First, automated review processes, even those based on ""artificial intelligence,"" are unable with any consistency to distinguish accurately material that falls within a category definition from material that does not. Moreover, human review of URLs is hampered by filtering companies' limited staff sizes, and by human error or misjudgment. In order to deal with the vast size of the Web and its rapid rates of growth and change, filtering companies engage in several practices that are necessary to reduce underblocking, but inevitably result in overblocking. These include: (1) blocking whole Web sites even when only a small minority of their pages contain material that would fit under one of the filtering company's categories (e.g., blocking the Salon.com site because it contains a sex column); (2) blocking by IP address (because a single IP address may contain many different Web sites and many thousands of pages of heterogenous content); and (3) blocking loophole sites such as translator sites and cache sites, which archive Web pages that have been removed from the Web by their original publisher.  Finally, filtering companies' failure to engage in regular re-review of Web pages that they have already categorized (or that they have determined do not fall into any category) results in a substantial amount of over- and underblocking. For example, Web publishers change the contents of Web pages frequently. The problem also arises when a Web site goes out of existence and its domain name or IP address is reassigned to a new Web site publisher. In that case, a filtering company's previous categorization of the IP address or domain name would likely be incorrect, potentially resulting in the over- or underblocking of many thousands of pages.  The inaccuracies that result from these limitations of filtering technology are quite substantial. At least tens of thousands of pages of the indexable Web are overblocked by each of the filtering programs evaluated by experts in this case, even when considered against the filtering companies' own category definitions. Many erroneously blocked pages contain content that is completely innocuous for both adults and minors, and that no rational person could conclude matches the filtering companies' category definitions, such as ""pornography"" or ""sex.""  The number of overblocked sites is of course much higher with respect to the definitions of obscenity and child pornography that CIPA employs for adults, since the filtering products' category definitions, such as ""sex"" and ""nudity,"" encompass vast amounts of Web pages that are neither child pornography nor obscene. Thus, the number of pages of constitutionally protected speech blocked by filtering products far exceeds the many thousands of pages that are overblocked by reference to the filtering products' category definitions.  No presently conceivable technology can make the judgments necessary to determine whether a visual depiction fits the legal definitions of obscenity, child pornography, or harmful to minors. Given the state of the art in filtering and image recognition technology, and the rapidly changing and expanding nature of the Web, we find that filtering products' shortcomings will not be solved through a technical solution in the foreseeable future.19 In sum, filtering products are currently unable to block only visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors (or, only content matching a filtering product's category definitions) while simultaneously allowing access to all protected speech (or, all content not matching the blocking product's category definitions). Any software filter that is reasonably effective in blocking access to Web pages that fall within its category definitions will necessarily erroneously block a substantial number of Web pages that do not fall within its category definitions.  III. Analytic Framework for the Opinion: The Centrality of Dole and the Role of the Facial Challenge  Both the plaintiffs and the government agree that, because this case involves a challenge to the constitutionality of the conditions that Congress has set on state actors' receipt of federal funds, the Supreme Court's decision in South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 107 S. Ct. 2793, 97 L. Ed. 2d 171 (1987), supplies the proper threshold analytic framework. The constitutional source of Congress's spending power is Article I, § 8, cl. 1, which provides that ""Congress shall have Power . . . to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States."" In Dole, the Court upheld the constitutionality of a federal statute requiring the withholding of federal highway funds from any state with a drinking age below 21. Id. at 211-12, 107 S. Ct. 2793. In sustaining the provision's constitutionality, Dole articulated four general constitutional limitations on Congress's exercise of the spending power.  First, ""the exercise of the spending power must be in pursuit of 'the general welfare.'"" Id. at 207, 107 S. Ct. 2793. Second, any conditions that Congress sets on states' receipt of federal funds must be sufficiently clear to enable recipients ""to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of their participation."" Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Third, the conditions on the receipt of federal funds must bear some relation to the purpose of the funding program. Id. And finally, ""other constitutional provisions may provide an independent bar to the conditional grant of federal funds."" Id. at 208, 107 S. Ct. 2793. In particular, the spending power ""may not be used to induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional. Thus, for example, a grant of federal funds conditioned on invidiously discriminatory state action or the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment would be an illegitimate exercise of the Congress' broad spending power."" Id. at 210, 107 S. Ct. 2793.  Plaintiffs do not contend that CIPA runs afoul of the first three limitations. However, they do allege that CIPA is unconstitutional under the fourth prong of Dole because it will induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment.20 Plaintiffs therefore submit that the First Amendment ""provide[s] an independent bar to the conditional grant of federal funds"" created by CIPA. Id. at 208, 107 S. Ct. 2793. More specifically, they argue that by conditioning public libraries' receipt of federal funds on the use of software filters, CIPA will induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment rights of Internet content-providers to disseminate constitutionally protected speech to library patrons via the Internet, and the correlative First Amendment rights of public library patrons to receive constitutionally protected speech on the Internet.21  The government concedes that under the Dole framework, CIPA is facially invalid if its conditions will induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment. The government and the plaintiffs disagree, however, on the meaning of Dole's ""inducement"" requirement in the context of a First Amendment facial challenge to the conditions that Congress places on state actors' receipt of federal funds. The government contends that because plaintiffs are bringing a facial challenge, they must show that under no circumstances is it possible for a public library to comply with CIPA's conditions without violating the First Amendment. The plaintiffs respond that even if it is possible for some public libraries to comply with CIPA without violating the First Amendment, CIPA is facially invalid if it ""will result in the impermissible suppression of a substantial amount of protected speech.""  Because it was clear in Dole that the states could comply with the challenged conditions that Congress attached to the receipt of federal funds without violating the Constitution, the Dole Court did not have occasion to explain fully what it means for Congress to use the spending power to ""induce [recipients] to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional."" Dole, 483 U.S. at 210, 107 S. Ct. 2793; see id. at 211, 107 S. Ct. 2793 (""Were South Dakota to succumb to the blandishments offered by Congress and raise its drinking age to 21, the State's action in so doing would not violate the constitutional rights of anyone.""). Although the proposition that Congress may not pay state actors to violate citizens' First Amendment rights is unexceptionable when stated in the abstract, it is unclear what exactly a litigant must establish to facially invalidate an exercise of Congress's spending power on this ground.  In general, it is well-established that a court may sustain a facial challenge to a statute only if the plaintiff demonstrates that the statute admits of no constitutional application. See United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S. Ct. 2095, 95 L. Ed. 2d 697 (1987) (""A facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.""); see also Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 612, 108 S. Ct. 2562, 101 L. Ed. 2d 520 (1988) (""It has not been the Court's practice, in considering facial challenges to statutes of this kind, to strike them down in anticipation that particular applications may result in unconstitutional use of funds."") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  First Amendment overbreadth doctrine creates a limited exception to this rule by permitting facial invalidation of a statute that burdens a substantial amount of protected speech, even if the statute may be constitutionally applied in particular circumstances. ""The Constitution gives significant protection from overbroad laws that chill speech within the First Amendment's vast and privileged sphere. Under this principle, [a law] is unconstitutional on its face if it prohibits a substantial amount of protected expression."" Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, -- U.S. --, --, 122 S. Ct. 1389, 1399, 152 L.Ed.2d 403, -- (2002); see also Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 612, 93 S. Ct. 2908, 37 L. Ed. 2d 830 (1973). This more liberal test of a statute's facial validity under the First Amendment stems from the recognition that where a statute's reach contemplates a number of both constitutional and unconstitutional applications, the law's sanctions may deter individuals from challenging the law's validity by engaging in constitutionally protected speech that may nonetheless be proscribed by the law. Without an overbreadth doctrine, ""the contours of regulation would have to be hammered out case by case-and tested only by those hardy enough to risk criminal prosecution to determine the proper scope of regulation."" Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 487, 85 S. Ct. 1116, 14 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1965); see also Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491, 503, 105 S. Ct. 2794, 86 L. Ed. 2d 394 (1985) (""[A]n individual whose own speech or expressive conduct may validly be prohibited or sanctioned is permitted to challenge a statute on its face because it also threatens others not before the court-those who desire to engage in legally protected expression but who may refrain from doing so rather than risk prosecution or undertake to have the law declared partially invalid."").  Plaintiffs argue that the overbreadth doctrine is applicable here, since CIPA ""threatens to chill free speech-because it will censor a substantial amount of protected speech, because it is vague, and because the law creates a prior restraint. . . ."" Unlike the statutes typically challenged as facially overbroad, however, CIPA does not impose criminal penalties on those who violate its conditions. Cf. Free Speech Coalition, -- U.S. at --, 122 S. Ct. at 1398 (""With these severe penalties in force, few legitimate movie producers or book publishers, or few other speakers in any capacity, would risk distributing images in or near the uncertain reach of this law.""). Thus, the rationale for permitting facial challenges to laws that may be constitutionally applied in some instances is less compelling in cases such as this, which involve challenges to Congress's exercise of the spending power, than in challenges to criminal statutes.  Nonetheless, ""even minor punishments can chill protected speech,"" id., and absent the ability to challenge CIPA on its face, public libraries that depend on federal funds may decide to comply with CIPA's terms, thereby denying patrons access to substantial amounts of constitutionally protected speech, rather than refusing to comply with CIPA's terms and consequently losing the benefits of federal funds. See 47 C.F.R.  § 54.520(e)(1) (""A school or library that knowingly fails to ensure the use of computers in accordance with the certifications required by this section, must reimburse any funds and discounts received under the federal universal support service support mechanism for schools and libraries for the period in which there was noncompliance.""). Even in cases where the only penalty for failure to comply with a statute is the withholding of federal funds, the Court has sustained facial challenges to Congress's exercise of the spending power. See, e.g., Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 121 S. Ct. 1043, 149 L. Ed. 2d 63 (2001) (declaring unconstitutional on its face a federal statute restricting the ability of legal services providers who receive federal funds to engage in activity protected by the First Amendment).  The Court's unconstitutional conditions cases, such as Velazquez, are not strictly controlling, since they do not require a showing that recipients who comply with the conditions attached to federal funding will, as state actors, violate others' constitutional rights, as is the case under the fourth prong of Dole. However, they are highly instructive.  The Supreme Court's pronouncements in the unconstitutional conditions cases on what is necessary for a plaintiff to mount a successful First Amendment facial challenge to an exercise of Congress's spending power have not produced a seamless web. For example, in Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 111 S. Ct. 1759, 114 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1991), the Court rejected a First Amendment facial challenge to federal regulations prohibiting federally funded healthcare clinics from providing counseling concerning the use of abortion as a method of family planning, explaining that:  Petitioners are challenging the facial validity of the regulations. Thus, we are concerned only with the question whether, on their face, the regulations are both authorized by the Act and can be construed in such a manner that they can be applied to a set of individuals without infringing upon constitutionally protected rights. Petitioners face a heavy burden in seeking to have the regulations invalidated as facially unconstitutional. . . . The fact that the regulations might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render them wholly invalid.  Id. at 183, 111 S. Ct. 1759 (internal quotation marks, alterations, and citation omitted). In contrast, NEA v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 118 S. Ct. 2168, 141 L. Ed. 2d 500 (1998), which also involved a facial First Amendment challenge to an exercise of Congress's spending power, articulated a somewhat more liberal test of facial validity than Rust, explaining that ""[t]o prevail, respondents must demonstrate a substantial risk that application of the provision will lead to the suppression of speech."" Id. at 580, 118 S. Ct. 2168.  Against this background, it is unclear to us whether, to succeed in facially invalidating CIPA on the grounds that it will ""induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional,"" Dole, 483 U.S. at 210, 107 S. Ct. 2793, plaintiffs must show that it is impossible for public libraries to comply with CIPA's conditions without violating the First Amendment, or rather simply that CIPA will effectively restrict library patrons' access to substantial amounts of constitutionally protected speech, therefore causing many libraries to violate the First Amendment. However, we need not resolve this issue. Rather, we may assume without deciding, for purposes of this case, that a facial challenge to CIPA requires plaintiffs to show that any public library that complies with CIPA's conditions will necessarily violate the First Amendment and, as explained in detail below, we believe that CIPA's constitutionality fails even under this more restrictive test of facial validity urged on us by the government. Because of the inherent limitations in filtering technology, public libraries can never comply with CIPA without blocking access to a substantial amount of speech that is both constitutionally protected and fails to meet even the filtering companies' own blocking criteria. We turn first to the governing legal principles to be applied to the facts in order to determine whether the First Amendment permits a library to use the filtering technology mandated by CIPA.  First Amendment overbreadth doctrine creates a limited exception to this rule by permitting facial invalidation of a statute that burdens a substantial amount of protected speech, even if the statute may be constitutionally applied in particular circumstances. ""The Constitution gives significant protection from overbroad laws that chill speech within the First Amendment's vast and privileged sphere. Under this principle, [a law] is unconstitutional on its face if it prohibits a substantial amount of protected expression."" Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, -- U.S. --, --, 122 S. Ct. 1389, 1399, 152 L.Ed.2d 403, -- (2002); see also Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 612, 93 S. Ct. 2908, 37 L. Ed. 2d 830 (1973). This more liberal test of a statute's facial validity under the First Amendment stems from the recognition that where a statute's reach contemplates a number of both constitutional and unconstitutional applications, the law's sanctions may deter individuals from challenging the law's validity by engaging in constitutionally protected speech that may nonetheless be proscribed by the law. Without an overbreadth doctrine, ""the contours of regulation would have to be hammered out case by case-and tested only by those hardy enough to risk criminal prosecution to determine the proper scope of regulation."" Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 487, 85 S. Ct. 1116, 14 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1965); see also Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491, 503, 105 S. Ct. 2794, 86 L. Ed. 2d 394 (1985) (""[A]n individual whose own speech or expressive conduct may validly be prohibited or sanctioned is permitted to challenge a statute on its face because it also threatens others not before the court-those who desire to engage in legally protected expression but who may refrain from doing so rather than risk prosecution or undertake to have the law declared partially invalid."").  Plaintiffs argue that the overbreadth doctrine is applicable here, since CIPA ""threatens to chill free speech-because it will censor a substantial amount of protected speech, because it is vague, and because the law creates a prior restraint. . . ."" Unlike the statutes typically challenged as facially overbroad, however, CIPA does not impose criminal penalties on those who violate its conditions. Cf. Free Speech Coalition, -- U.S. at --, 122 S. Ct. at 1398 (""With these severe penalties in force, few legitimate movie producers or book publishers, or few other speakers in any capacity, would risk distributing images in or near the uncertain reach of this law.""). Thus, the rationale for permitting facial challenges to laws that may be constitutionally applied in some instances is less compelling in cases such as this, which involve challenges to Congress's exercise of the spending power, than in challenges to criminal statutes.  Nonetheless, ""even minor punishments can chill protected speech,"" id., and absent the ability to challenge CIPA on its face, public libraries that depend on federal funds may decide to comply with CIPA's terms, thereby denying patrons access to substantial amounts of constitutionally protected speech, rather than refusing to comply with CIPA's terms and consequently losing the benefits of federal funds. See 47 C.F.R. § 54.520(e)(1) (""A school or library that knowingly fails to ensure the use of computers in accordance with the certifications required by this section, must reimburse any funds and discounts received under the federal universal support service support mechanism for schools and libraries for the period in which there was noncompliance.""). Even in cases where the only penalty for failure to comply with a statute is the withholding of federal funds, the Court has sustained facial challenges to Congress's exercise of the spending power. See, e.g., Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 121 S. Ct. 1043, 149 L. Ed. 2d 63 (2001) (declaring unconstitutional on its face a federal statute restricting the ability of legal services providers who receive federal funds to engage in activity protected by the First Amendment).  The Court's unconstitutional conditions cases, such as Velazquez, are not strictly controlling, since they do not require a showing that recipients who comply with the conditions attached to federal funding will, as state actors, violate others' constitutional rights, as is the case under the fourth prong of Dole. However, they are highly instructive.  The Supreme Court's pronouncements in the unconstitutional conditions cases on what is necessary for a plaintiff to mount a successful First Amendment facial challenge to an exercise of Congress's spending power have not produced a seamless web. For example, in Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 111 S. Ct. 1759, 114 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1991), the Court rejected a First Amendment facial challenge to federal regulations prohibiting federally funded healthcare clinics from providing counseling concerning the use of abortion as a method of family planning, explaining that:  Petitioners are challenging the facial validity of the regulations. Thus, we are concerned only with the question whether, on their face, the regulations are both authorized by the Act and can be construed in such a manner that they can be applied to a set of individuals without infringing upon constitutionally protected rights. Petitioners face a heavy burden in seeking to have the regulations invalidated as facially unconstitutional. . . . The fact that the regulations might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render them wholly invalid.  Id. at 183, 111 S. Ct. 1759 (internal quotation marks, alterations, and citation omitted). In contrast, NEA v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 118 S. Ct. 2168, 141 L. Ed. 2d 500 (1998), which also involved a facial First Amendment challenge to an exercise of Congress's spending power, articulated a somewhat more liberal test of facial validity than Rust, explaining that ""[t]o prevail, respondents must demonstrate a substantial risk that application of the provision will lead to the suppression of speech."" Id. at 580, 118 S. Ct. 2168.  Against this background, it is unclear to us whether, to succeed in facially invalidating CIPA on the grounds that it will ""induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional,"" Dole, 483 U.S. at 210, 107 S. Ct. 2793, plaintiffs must show that it is impossible for public libraries to comply with CIPA's conditions without violating the First Amendment, or rather simply that CIPA will effectively restrict library patrons' access to substantial amounts of constitutionally protected speech, therefore causing many libraries to violate the First Amendment. However, we need not resolve this issue. Rather, we may assume without deciding, for purposes of this case, that a facial challenge to CIPA requires plaintiffs to show that any public library that complies with CIPA's conditions will necessarily violate the First Amendment and, as explained in detail below, we believe that CIPA's constitutionality fails even under this more restrictive test of facial validity urged on us by the government. Because of the inherent limitations in filtering technology, public libraries can never comply with CIPA without blocking access to a substantial amount of speech that is both constitutionally protected and fails to meet even the filtering companies' own blocking criteria. We turn first to the governing legal principles to be applied to the facts in order to determine whether the First Amendment permits a library to use the filtering technology mandated by CIPA.  IV. Level of Scrutiny Applicable to Content-based Restrictions on Internet Access in Public Libraries  In analyzing the constitutionality of a public library's use of Internet filtering software, we must first identify the appropriate level of scrutiny to apply to this restriction on patrons' access to speech. While plaintiffs argue that a public library's use of such filters is subject to strict scrutiny, the government maintains that the applicable standard is rational basis review. If strict scrutiny applies, the government must show that the challenged restriction on speech is narrowly tailored to promote a compelling government interest and that no less restrictive alternative would further that interest. United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 813, 120 S. Ct. 1878, 146 L. Ed. 2d 865 (2000). In contrast, under rational basis review, the challenged restriction need only be reasonable; the government interest that the restriction serves need not be compelling; the restriction need not be narrowly tailored to serve that interest; and the restriction ""need not be the most reasonable or the only reasonable limitation."" Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 808, 105 S. Ct. 3439, 87 L. Ed. 2d 567 (1985).  Software filters, by definition, block access to speech on the basis of its content, and content-based restrictions on speech are generally subject to strict scrutiny. See Playboy, 529 U.S. at 813, 120 S. Ct. 1878 (""[A] content-based speech restriction . . . can stand only if it satisfies strict scrutiny.""). Strict scrutiny does not necessarily apply to content-based restrictions on speech, however, where the restrictions apply only to speech on government property, such as public libraries. ""[I]t is . . . well settled that the government need not permit all forms of speech on property that it owns and controls."" Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 678 (1992). We perforce turn to a discussion of public forum doctrine.  A. Overview of Public Forum Doctrine  The government's power to restrict speech on its own property is not unlimited. Rather, under public forum doctrine, the extent to which the First Amendment permits the government to restrict speech on its own property depends on the character of the forum that the government has created. See Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 105 S. Ct. 3439, 87 L. Ed. 2d 567 (1985). Thus, the First Amendment affords greater deference to restrictions on speech in those areas considered less amenable to free expression, such as military bases, see Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828, 96 S. Ct. 1211, 47 L. Ed. 2d 505 (1976), jail grounds, see Adderley v. Florida, 385 U.S. 39, 87 S. Ct. 242, 17 L. Ed. 2d 149 (1966), or public airport terminals, see Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 112 S. Ct. 2701, 120 L. Ed. 2d 541 (1992), than to restrictions on speech in state universities, see Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700 (1995), or streets, sidewalks and public parks, see Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 108 S. Ct. 2495, 101 L. Ed. 2d 420 (1988); Hague v. CIO, 307 U.S. 496, 59 S. Ct. 954, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939).  The Supreme Court has identified three types of fora for purposes of identifying the level of First Amendment scrutiny applicable to content-based restrictions on speech on government property: traditional public fora, designated public fora, and nonpublic fora. Traditional public fora include sidewalks, squares, and public parks:  [S]treets and parks . . . have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions. Such use of the streets and public places has, from ancient times, been a part of the privileges, immunities, rights, and liberties of citizens.  Hague, 307 U.S. at 515, 59 S.Ct. 954. ""In these quintessential public forums, . . . [f]or the State to enforce a content-based exclusion it must show that its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end."" Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educs. Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 45, 103 S. Ct. 948, 74 L. Ed. 2d 794 (1983); see also Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, 505 U.S. at 678, 112 S. Ct. 2701 (""[R]egulation of speech on government property that has traditionally been available for public expression is subject to the highest scrutiny.""); Frisby, 487 U.S. at 480, 108 S. Ct. 2495 (""[W]e have repeatedly referred to public streets as the archetype of a traditional public forum."").  A second category of fora, known as designated (or limited) public fora, ""consists of public property which the State has opened for use by the public as a place for expressive activity."" Perry, 460 U.S. at 46, 103 S. Ct. 948. Whereas any content-based restriction on the use of traditional public fora is subject to strict scrutiny, the state is generally permitted, as long as it does not discriminate on the basis of viewpoint, to limit a designated public forum to certain speakers or the discussion of certain subjects. See Perry, 460 U.S. at 45 n.7, 103 S. Ct. 948. Once it has defined the limits of a designated public forum, however, ""[r]egulation of such property is subject to the same limitations as that governing a traditional public forum."" Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, 505 U.S. at 678, 112 S. Ct. 2701. Examples of designated fora include university meeting facilities, see Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 102 S. Ct. 269, 70 L. Ed. 2d 440 (1981), school board meetings, see City of Madison Joint School Dist. v. Wisc. Employment Relations Comm'n, 429 U.S. 167, 97 S. Ct. 421, 50 L. Ed. 2d 376 (1976), and municipal theaters, see Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546, 95 S. Ct. 1239, 43 L. Ed. 2d 448 (1975).  The third category, nonpublic fora, consists of all remaining public property. ""Limitations on expressive activity conducted on this last category of property must survive only a much more limited review. The challenged regulation need only be reasonable, as long as the regulation is not an effort to suppress the speaker's activity due to disagreement with the speaker's view."" Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, 505 U.S. at 679, 112 S. Ct. 2701.  B. Contours of the Relevant Forum: the Library's Collection as a Whole or the Provision of Internet Access?  To apply public forum doctrine to this case, we must first determine whether the appropriate forum for analysis is the library's collection as a whole, which includes both print and electronic resources, or the library's provision of Internet access. Where a plaintiff seeks limited access, for expressive purposes, to governmentally controlled property, the Supreme Court has held that the relevant forum is defined not by the physical limits of the government property at issue, but rather by the specific access that the plaintiff seeks:  Although . . . as an initial matter a speaker must seek access to public property or to private property dedicated to public use to evoke First Amendment concerns, forum analysis is not completed merely by identifying the government property at issue. Rather, in defining the forum we have focused on the access sought by the speaker. When speakers seek general access to public property, the forum encompasses that property. In cases in which limited access is sought, our cases have taken a more tailored approach to ascertaining the perimeters of a forum within the confines of the government property.  Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 801, 105 S. Ct. 3439, 87 L. Ed. 2d 567 (1985).  Thus, in Cornelius, where the plaintiffs were legal defense and political advocacy groups seeking to participate in the Combined Federal Campaign charity drive, the Court held that the relevant forum, for First Amendment purposes, was not the entire federal workplace, but rather the charity drive itself. Id. at 801, 105 S. Ct. 3439. Similarly, in Perry Education Association v. Perry Local Educators' Association, 460 U.S. 37, 103 S. Ct. 948, 74 L. Ed. 2d 794 (1983), which addressed a union's right to access a public school's internal mail system and teachers' mailboxes, the Court identified the relevant forum as the school's mail system, not the public school as a whole. In Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 102 S. Ct. 269, 70 L. Ed. 2d 440 (1981), in which a student group challenged a state university's restrictions on use of its meeting facilities, the Court identified the relevant forum as the meeting facilities to which the plaintiffs sought access, not the state university generally. And in Christ's Bride Ministries, Inc. v. SEPTA, 148 F.3d 242 (3d Cir. 1998), involving a First Amendment challenge to the removal of advertisements from subway and commuter rail stations, the Third Circuit noted that the forum at issue was not the rail and subway stations as a whole, but rather the advertising space within the stations. Id. at 248. Although these cases dealt with the problem of identifying the relevant forum where speakers are claiming a right of access, we believe that the same approach applies to identifying the relevant forum where the parties seeking access are listeners or readers.  In this case, the patron plaintiffs are not asserting a First Amendment right to compel public libraries to acquire certain books or magazines for their print collections. Nor are the Web site plaintiffs claiming a First Amendment right to compel public libraries to carry print materials that they publish. Rather, the right at issue in this case is the specific right of library patrons to access information on the Internet, and the specific right of Web publishers to provide library patrons with information via the Internet. Thus, the relevant forum for analysis is not the library's entire collection, which includes both print and electronic media, such as the Internet, but rather the specific forum created when the library provides its patrons with Internet access.  Although a public library's provision of Internet access does not resemble the conventional notion of a forum as a well-defined physical space, the same First Amendment standards apply. See Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 830, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700 (1995) (holding that a state university's student activities fund ""is a forum more in a metaphysical than a spatial or geographic sense, but the same principles are applicable""); see also Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 801, 105 S. Ct. 3439 (identifying the Combined Federal Campaign charity drive as the relevant unit of analysis for application of public forum doctrine).  C. Content-based Restrictions in Designated Public Fora  Unlike nonpublic fora such as airport terminals, see Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 112 S. Ct. 2701, 120 L. Ed. 2d 541 (1992), military bases, see Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828, 96 S. Ct. 1211, 47 L. Ed. 2d 505 (1976), jail grounds, see Adderley v. Florida, 385 U.S. 39, 87 S. Ct. 242, 17 L. Ed. 2d 149 (1966), the federal workplace, see Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 805, 105 S. Ct. 3439, 87 L. Ed. 2d 567 (1985), and public transit vehicles, see Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298, 94 S. Ct. 2714, 41 L. Ed. 2d 770 (1974), the purpose of a public library in general, and the provision of Internet access within a public library in particular, is ""for use by the public . . . for expressive activity,"" Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educs. Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 45, 103 S. Ct. 948, 74 L. Ed. 2d 794 (1983), namely, the dissemination and receipt by the public of a wide range of information. We are satisfied that when the government provides Internet access in a public library, it has created a designated public forum. See Mainstream Loudoun v. Bd. of Trustees of the Loud oun County Library, 24 F. Supp. 2d 552, 563 (E. D. Va. 1998); cf. Kreimer v. Bureau of Police, 958 F.2d 1242, 1259 (3d Cir. 1992) (holding that a public library is a limited public forum).  Relying on those cases that have recognized that government has leeway, under the First Amendment, to limit use of a designated public forum to narrowly specified purposes, and that content-based restrictions on speech that are consistent with those purposes are subject only to rational basis review, the government argues for application of rational basis review to public libraries' decisions about which content to make available to their patrons via the Internet. See Rosenberger, 515 U.S. 819, 829, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700 (1995) (""The necessities of confining a forum to the limited and legitimate purposes for which it was created may justify the State in reserving it for certain groups or for the discussion of certain topics.""); Perry, 460 U.S. at 46 n.7, 103 S. Ct. 948 (1983) (""A public forum may be created for a limited purpose such as use by certain groups . . . or for the discussion of certain subjects."").  In particular, the government forcefully argues that a public library's decision to limit the content of its digital offerings on the Internet should be subject to no stricter scrutiny than its decisions about what content to make available to its patrons through the library's print collection. According to the government, just as a public library may choose to acquire books about gardening but not golf, without having to show that this content-based restriction on patrons' access to speech is narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest, so may a public library make content-based decisions about which speech to make available on the Internet, without having to show that such a restriction satisfies strict scrutiny.  Plaintiffs respond that the government's ability to restrict the content of speech in a designated public forum by restricting the purpose of the designated public forum that it creates is not unlimited. Cf. Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 547, 121 S. Ct. 1043, 149 L. Ed. 2d 63 (2001) (""Congress cannot recast a condition on funding as a mere definition of its program in every case, lest the First Amendment be reduced to a simple semantic exercise.""). As Justice Kennedy has explained:  If Government has a freer hand to draw content-based distinctions in limiting a forum than in excluding someone from it, the First Amendment would be a dead letter in designated public forums; every exclusion could be recast as a limitation. . . . The power to limit or redefine forums for a specific legitimate purpose does not allow the government to exclude certain speech or speakers from them for any reason at all.  Denver Area Telecomm. Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U.S. 727, 801, 116 S. Ct. 2374, 135 L. Ed. 2d 888 (1996) (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment).  Although we agree with plaintiffs that the First Amendment imposes some limits on the state's ability to adopt content-based restrictions in defining the purpose of a public forum, precisely what those limits are is unclear, and presents a difficult problem in First Amendment jurisprudence. The Supreme Court's ""cases have not yet determined . . . that government's decision to dedicate a public forum to one type of content or another is necessarily subject to the highest level of scrutiny. Must a local government, for example, show a compelling state interest if it builds a band shell in the park and dedicates it solely to classical music (but not to jazz)? The answer is not obvious."" Denver, 518 U.S. at 750, 116 S. Ct. 2374 (plurality opinion); see also Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546, 572-73, 95 S. Ct. 1239, 43 L. Ed. 2d 448 (1975) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (""May an opera house limit its productions to operas, or must it also show rock musicals? May a municipal theater devote an entire season to Shakespeare, or is it required to book any potential producer on a first come, first served basis?"").  We believe, however, that certain principles emerge from the Supreme Court's jurisprudence on this question. In particular, and perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, the more narrow the range of speech that the government chooses to subsidize (whether directly, through government grants or other funding, or indirectly, through the creation of a public forum) the more deference the First Amendment accords the government in drawing content-based distinctions.  At one extreme lies the government's decision to fund a particular message that the government seeks to disseminate. In this context, content-based restrictions on the speech that government chooses to subsidize are clearly subject to at most rational basis review, and even viewpoint discrimination is permissible. For example, ""[w]hen Congress established a National Endowment for Democracy to encourage other countries to adopt democratic principles, 22 U.S.C. § 4411(b), it was not constitutionally required to fund a program to encourage competing lines of political philosophy such as communism and fascism."" Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 194, 111 S. Ct. 1759, 114 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1991); see also Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 541, 121 S. Ct. 1043 (""[V]iewpoint-based funding decisions can be sustained in instances in which the government is itself the speaker, or in instances, like Rust, in which the government used private speakers to transmit information pertaining to its own program."") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Although not strictly controlling, the Supreme Court's unconstitutional conditions cases, such as Rust and Velazquez, are instructive for purposes of analyzing content-based restrictions on the use of public fora. This is because the limitations that government places on the use of a public forum can be conceptualized as conditions that the government attaches to the receipt of a benefit that it offers, namely, the use of government property. Public forum cases thus resemble those unconstitutional conditions cases involving First Amendment challenges to the conditions that the state places on the receipt of a government benefit. See Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 544, 121 S. Ct. 1043 (""As this suit involves a subsidy, limited forum cases . . . may not be controlling in the strict sense, yet they do provide some instruction."").  Even when the government does not fund the dissemination of a particular government message, the First Amendment generally permits government, subject to the constraints of viewpoint neutrality, to create public institutions such as art museums and state universities, dedicated to facilitating the dissemination of private speech that the government believes to have particular merit. Thus, in NEA v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 118 S. Ct. 2168, 141 L. Ed .2d 500 (1998), the Court upheld the use of content-based restrictions in a federal program awarding grants to artists on the basis of, inter alia, artistic excellence. ""The very assumption of the NEA is that grants will be awarded according to the artistic worth of competing applications, and absolute neutrality is simply inconceivable."" Id. at 585, 118 S. Ct. 2168 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Similarly, as Justice Stevens explained in his concurring opinion in Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 102 S. Ct. 269, 70 L. Ed. 2d 440 (1981), the First Amendment does not necessarily subject to strict scrutiny a state university's use of content-based means of allocating scarce resources, including limited public fora such as its meeting facilities:  Because every university's resources are limited, an educational institution must routinely make decisions concerning the use of the time and space that is available for extracurricular activities. In my judgment, it is both necessary and appropriate for those decisions to evaluate the content of a proposed student activity. I should think it obvious, for example, that if two groups of 25 students requested the use of a room at a particular time-one to view Mickey Mouse cartoons and the other to rehearse an amateur performance of Hamlet-the First Amendment would not require that the room be reserved for the group that submitted its application first. Nor do I see why a university should have to establish a ""compelling state interest"" to defend its decision to permit one group to use the facility and not the other.  Id. at 278, 102 S. Ct. 269 (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment).22  The more broadly the government facilitates private speech, however, the less deference the First Amendment accords to the government's content-based restrictions on the speech that it facilitates. Thus, where the government creates a designated public forum to facilitate private speech representing a diverse range of viewpoints, the government's decision selectively to single out particular viewpoints for exclusion is subject to strict scrutiny. Compare Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 834, 115 S. Ct. 2510 (applying heightened First Amendment scrutiny to viewpoint-based restrictions on the use of a limited public forum where the government ""does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers""), with Finley, 524 U.S. at 586, 118 S. Ct. 2168 (""In the context of arts funding, in contrast to many other subsidies, the Government does not indiscriminately encourage a diversity of views from private speakers."") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Similarly, although the government may create a designated public forum limited to speech on a particular topic, if the government opens the forum to members of the general public to speak on that topic while selectively singling out for exclusion particular speakers on the basis of the content of their speech, that restriction is subject to strict scrutiny. For instance, in City of Madison Joint School District No. 8 v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, 429 U.S. 167, 97 S. Ct. 421, 50 L. Ed. 2d 376 (1976), the Court held that where a school board opens its meetings for public participation, it may not, consistent with the First Amendment, prohibit teachers other than union representatives from speaking on the subject of pending collective-bargaining negotiations. See id. at 175, 97 S. Ct. 421 (noting that the state ""has opened a forum for direct citizen involvement""); see also Ark. Educ. Television Comm'n v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666, 680, 118 S. Ct. 1633, 140 L. Ed. 2d 875 (1998) (distinguishing, for purposes of determining the appropriate level of First Amendment scrutiny, a televised debate in which a public broadcasting station exercises editorial discretion in selecting participating candidates from a debate that has ""an open-microphone format"").  Finally, content-based restrictions on speech in a designated public forum are most clearly subject to strict scrutiny when the government opens a forum for virtually unrestricted use by the general public for speech on a virtually unrestricted range of topics, while selectively excluding particular speech whose content it disfavors. Thus, in Conrad, the Court held that a local government violated the First Amendment when it denied a group seeking to perform the rock musical ""Hair"" access to a general-purpose municipal theater open for the public at large to use for performances. See also Denver, 518 U.S. at 802, 116 S. Ct. 2374 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment) (suggesting that strict scrutiny would not apply to a local government's decision to ""build[] a band shell in the park and dedicate[] it solely to classical music (but not jazz),"" but would apply to ""the Government's creation of a band shell in which all types of music might be performed except for rap music"").  Similarly, in FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U.S. 364, 104 S. Ct. 3106, 82 L. Ed. 2d 278 (1984), the Court subjected to heightened scrutiny a federal program that funded a wide range of public broadcasting stations that disseminated speech on a wide range of subjects, where the federal program singled out for exclusion speech whose content amounted to editorializing. As the Court later explained:  In FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U.S. 364, 104 S. Ct. 3106, 82 L. Ed. 2d 278 (1984) the Court was instructed by its understanding of the dynamics of the broadcast industry in holding that prohibitions against editorializing by public radio networks were an impermissible restriction, even though the Government enacted the restriction to control the use of public funds. The First Amendment forbade the Government from using the forum in an unconventional way to suppress speech inherent in the nature of the medium.  Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 543, 121 S.Ct. 1043.  In sum, the more widely the state opens a forum for members of the public to speak on a variety of subjects and viewpoints, the more vulnerable is the state's decision selectively to exclude certain speech on the basis of its disfavored content, as such exclusions distort the marketplace of ideas that the state has created in establishing the forum. Cf. Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 544, 121 S. Ct. 1043 (""Restricting LSC attorneys in advising their clients and in presenting arguments and analyses to the courts distorts the legal system by altering the traditional role of the attorneys in much the same way broadcast systems or student publication networks were changed in the limited forum cases. . . ."").  Thus, we believe that where the state designates a forum for expressive activity and opens the forum for speech by the public at large on a wide range of topics, strict scrutiny applies to restrictions that single out for exclusion from the forum particular speech whose content is disfavored. ""Laws designed or intended to suppress or restrict the expression of specific speakers contradict basic First Amendment principles."" United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 812, 120 S. Ct. 1878, 146 L .Ed. 2d 865 (2000); see also Denver, 518 U.S. at 782, 116 S. Ct. 2374 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment) (noting the flaw in a law that ""singles out one sort of speech for vulnerability to private censorship in a context where content-based discrimination is not otherwise permitted""). Compare Forbes, 523 U.S. at 679, 118 S. Ct. 1633 (holding that the state does not create a public forum when it ""allows selective access for individual speakers rather than general access for a class of speakers"") (emphasis added), with Police Dep't of the City of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 96, 92 S. Ct. 2286, 33 L. Ed. 2d 212 (1972) (""Selective exclusions from a public forum may not be based on content alone, and may not be justified by reference to content alone."") (emphasis added).  We note further that to the extent that the government creates a public forum expressly designed to facilitate the dissemination of private speech, opens the forum to any member of the public to speak on any [sic] virtually any topic, and then selectively targets certain speech for exclusion based on its content, the government is singling out speech in a manner that resembles the discriminatory taxes on the press that the Supreme Court subjected to heightened First Amendment scrutiny in Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221, 107 S. Ct. 1722, 95 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1987), and Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue, 460 U.S. 575, 103 S. Ct. 1365, 75 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1983), which we explain in the margin.23  D. Reasons for Applying Strict Scrutiny  1. Selective Exclusion From a ""Vast Democratic Forum""  Applying these principles to public libraries, we agree with the government that generally the First Amendment subjects libraries' content-based decisions about which print materials to acquire for their collections to only rational review. In making these decisions, public libraries are generally free to adopt collection development criteria that reflect not simply patrons' demand for certain material, but also the library's evaluation of the material's quality. See Bernard W. Bell, Filth, Filtering, and the First Amendment: Ruminations on Public Libraries' Use of Internet Filtering Software, 53 Fed. Comm. L. J. 191, 225 (2001) (""Librarians should have the discretion to decide that the library is committed to intellectual inquiry, not to the satisfaction of the full range of human desires.""). Thus, a public library's decision to use the last $100 of its budget to purchase the complete works of Shakespeare even though more of its patrons would prefer the library to use the same amount to purchase the complete works of John Grisham, is not, in our view, subject to strict scrutiny. Cf. NEA v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 118 S. Ct. 2168, 141 L. Ed. 2d 500 (1998) (subjecting only to rational basis review the government's decision to award NEA grants on the basis of, inter alia, artistic excellence).  Nonetheless, we disagree with the government's argument that public libraries' use of Internet filters is no different, for First Amendment purposes, from the editorial discretion that they exercise when they choose to acquire certain books on the basis of librarians' evaluation of their quality. The central difference, in our view, is that by providing patrons with even filtered Internet access, the library permits patrons to receive speech on a virtually unlimited number of topics, from a virtually unlimited number of speakers, without attempting to restrict patrons' access to speech that the library, in the exercise of its professional judgment, determines to be particularly valuable. Cf. Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 834, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700 (1995) (applying strict scrutiny to viewpoint-based restrictions where the state ""does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers""). See generally supra Section IV.C.  In those cases upholding the government's exercise of editorial discretion in selecting certain speech for subsidization or inclusion in a state-created forum, the state actor exercising the editorial discretion has at least reviewed the content of the speech that the forum facilitates. Thus, in Finley the NEA examined the content of those works of art that it chose to subsidize, and in Arkansas Educational Television Commission v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666, 118 S. Ct. 1633, 140 L. Ed .2d 875 (1998), the public broadcaster specifically reviewed and approved each speaker permitted to participate in the debate. See id. at 673, 118 S. Ct. 1633 (""In the case of television broadcasting, . . . broad rights of access for outside speakers would be antithetical, as a general rule, to the discretion that stations and their editorial staff must exercise to fulfill their journalistic purpose and statutory obligations.""); Finley, 524 U.S. at 586, 118 S. Ct. 2168 (""The NEA's mandate is to make esthetic judgments, and the inherently content-based 'excellence' threshold for NEA support sets it apart from the subsidy at issue in Rosenberger-which was available to all student organizations that were 'related to the educational purpose of the University . . . .'"") (quoting Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 824, 115 S. Ct. 2510); see also Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 804, 105 S. Ct. 3439, 87 L. Ed. 2d 567 (1985) (""The Government's consistent policy has been to limit participation in the [Combined Federal Campaign] to 'appropriate' voluntary agencies and to require agencies seeking admission to obtain permission from federal and local Campaign officials. . . . [T]here is no evidence suggesting that the granting of the requisite permission is merely ministerial.""). The essence of editorial discretion requires the exercise of professional judgment in examining the content that the government singles out as speech of particular value.  This exercise of editorial discretion is evident in a library's decision to acquire certain books for its collection. As the government's experts in library science testified, in selecting a book for a library's collection, librarians evaluate the book's quality by reference to a variety of criteria such as its accuracy, the title's niche in relation to the rest of the collection, the authority of the author, the publisher, the work's presentation, and how it compares with other material available in the same genre or on the same subject. Thus, the content of every book that a library acquires has been reviewed by the library's collection development staff or someone to whom they have delegated the task, and has been judged to meet the criteria that form the basis for the library's collection development policy. Although some public libraries use ""approval plans"" to delegate the collection development to third-party vendors which provide the library with recommended materials that the library is then free to retain or return to the vendor, the same principle nonetheless attains.  In contrast, in providing patrons with even filtered Internet access, a public library invites patrons to access speech whose content has never been reviewed and recommended as particularly valuable by either a librarian or a third party to whom the library has delegated collection development decisions. Although several of the government's librarian witnesses who testified at trial purport to apply the same standards that govern the library's acquisition of print materials to the library's provision of Internet access to patrons, when public libraries provide their patrons with Internet access, they intentionally open their doors to vast amounts of speech that clearly lacks sufficient quality to ever be considered for the library's print collection. Unless a library allows access to only those sites that have been preselected as having particular value, a method that, as noted above, was tried and rejected by the Westerville Ohio Public Library, see supra at 46- 47, 103 S. Ct. 948, even a library that uses software filters has opened its Internet collection ""for indiscriminate use by the general public."" Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educs. Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 47, 103 S. Ct. 948, 74 L. Ed. 2d 794 (1983). ""[M]ost Internet forums-including chat rooms, newsgroups, mail exploders, and the Web-are open to all comers."" Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 880, 117 S. Ct. 2329, 138 L. Ed. 2d 874 (1997).  The fundamental difference between a library's print collection and its provision of Internet access is illustrated by comparing the extent to which the library opens its print collection to members of the public to speak on a given topic and the extent to which it opens its Internet terminals to members of the public to speak on a given topic. When a public library chooses to carry books on a selected topic, e.g. chemistry, it does not open its print collection to any member of the public who wishes to write about chemistry. Rather, out of the myriad of books that have ever been written on chemistry, each book on chemistry that the library carries has been reviewed and selected because the person reviewing the book, in the exercise of his or her professional judgment, has deemed its content to be particularly valuable. In contrast, when a public library provides Internet access, even filtered Internet access, it has created a forum open to any member of the public who writes about chemistry on the Internet, regardless of how unscientific the author's methods or of how patently false the author's conclusions are, regardless of the author's reputation or grammar, and regardless of the reviews of the scientific community.  Notwithstanding protestations in CIPA's legislative history to the contrary,24 members of the general public do define the content that public libraries make available to their patrons through the Internet. Any member of the public with Internet access could, through the free Web hosting services available on the Internet, tonight jot down a few musings on any subject under the sun, and tomorrow those musings would become part of public libraries' online offerings and be available to any library patron who seeks them out.  In providing its patrons with Internet access, a public library creates a forum for the facilitation of speech, almost none of which either the library's collection development staff or even the filtering companies have ever reviewed. Although filtering companies review a portion of the Web in classifying particular sites, the portion of the Web that the filtering companies actually review is quite small in relation to the Web as a whole. The filtering companies' harvesting process, described in our findings of fact, is intended to identify only a small fraction of Web sites for the filtering companies to review. Put simply, the state cannot be said to be exercising editorial discretion permitted under the First Amendment when it indiscriminately facilitates private speech whose content it makes no effort to examine. Cf. Bell, supra, at 226 (""[C]ourts should take a much more jaundiced view of library policies that block Internet access to a very limited array of subjects than they take of library policies that reserve Internet terminals for very limited use."").  While the First Amendment permits the government to exercise editorial discretion in singling out particularly favored speech for subsidization or inclusion in a state-created forum, we believe that where the state provides access to a ""vast democratic forum[ ],"" Reno, 521 U.S. at 868, 117 S. Ct. 2329, open to any member of the public to speak on subjects ""as diverse as human thought,"" id. at 870, 117 S. Ct. 2329, and then selectively excludes from the forum certain speech on the basis of its content, such exclusions are subject to strict scrutiny. These exclusions risk fundamentally distorting the unique marketplace of ideas that public libraries create when they open their collections, via the Internet, to the speech of millions of individuals around the world on a virtually limitless number of subjects.25  A public library's content-based restrictions on patrons' Internet access thus resemble the content- based restrictions on speech subsidized by the government, whether through direct funding or through the creation of a designated public forum, that the Supreme Court has subjected to strict scrutiny, as discussed above in Section IV.C. Although the government may subsidize a particular message representing the government's viewpoint without having to satisfy strict scrutiny, see Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 111 S. Ct. 1759, 114 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1991), strict scrutiny applies to restrictions that selectively exclude particular viewpoints from a public forum designed to facilitate a wide range of viewpoints, see Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700 (1995). Similarly, although the state's exercise of editorial discretion in selecting particular speakers for participation in a state-sponsored forum is subject to rational basis review, see Ark. Educ. Television Comm'n v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666, 118 S. Ct. 1633, 140 L. Ed. 2d 875 (1998), selective exclusions of particular speakers from a forum otherwise open to any member of the public to speak are subject to strict scrutiny, see City of Madison Joint School Dist. No. 8 v. Wis. Employment Relations Comm'n, 429 U.S. 167, 97 S. Ct. 421, 50 L. Ed. 2d 376 (1976).  And while the government may, subject only to rational basis review, make content-based decisions in selecting works of artistic excellence to subsidize, see NEA v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 118 S. Ct. 2168, 141 L. Ed. 2d 500 (1998), the Supreme Court has applied heightened scrutiny where the government opens a general-purpose municipal theater for use by the public, but selectively excludes disfavored content, see Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546, 95 S. Ct. 1239, 43 L. Ed. 2d 448 (1975), where the government facilitates the speech of public broadcasters on a virtually limitless number of topics, but prohibits editorializing, see FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U.S. 364, 104 S. Ct. 3106, 82 L. Ed. 2d 278 (1984), and where the government funds a wide range of legal services but restricts funding recipients from challenging welfare laws, see Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 121 S. Ct. 1043, 149 L. Ed. 2d 63 (2001). Similarly, where a public library opens a forum to an unlimited number of speakers around the world to speak on an unlimited number of topics, strict scrutiny applies to the library's selective exclusions of particular speech whose content the library disfavors.  2. Analogy to Traditional Public Fora  Application of strict scrutiny to public libraries' use of software filters, in our view, finds further support in the extent to which public libraries' provision of Internet access promotes First Amendment values in an analogous manner to traditional public fora, such as sidewalks and parks, in which content-based restrictions on speech are always subject to strict scrutiny. The public library, by its very nature, is ""designed for freewheeling inquiry."" Bd. of Education v. Pico, 457 U.S. 853, 915, 102 S. Ct. 2799, 73 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1982) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). As such, the library is a ""mighty resource in the free marketplace of ideas,"" Minarcini v. Strongsville City Sch. Dist., 541 F.2d 577, 582 (6th Cir. 1976), and represents a ""quintessential locus of the receipt of information."" Kreimer v. Bureau of Police for Morristown, 958 F.2d 1242, 1255 (3d Cir. 1992); see also Sund v. City of Wichita Falls, 121 F. Supp. 2d 530, 547 (N.D. Tex. 2000) (""The right to receive information is vigorously enforced in the context of a public library . . . .""); cf. Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 681, 112 S. Ct. 2701, 120 L. Ed. 2d 541 (1992) (""[A] traditional public forum is property that has as 'a principal purpose . . . the free exchange of ideas.'"") (quoting Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 800, 105 S. Ct. 3439, 87 L. Ed. 2d 567 (1985)).  We acknowledge that the provision of Internet access in a public library does not enjoy the historical pedigree of streets, sidewalks, and parks as a vehicle of free expression. Nonetheless, we believe that it shares many of the characteristics of these traditional public fora that uniquely promote First Amendment values and accordingly warrant application of strict scrutiny to any content-based restriction on speech in these fora. Regulation of speech in streets, sidewalks, and parks is subject to the highest scrutiny not simply by virtue of history and tradition, but also because the speech- facilitating character of sidewalks and parks makes them distinctly deserving of First Amendment protection. Many of these same speech-promoting features of the traditional public forum appear in public libraries' provision of Internet access.  First, public libraries, like sidewalks and parks, are generally open to any member of the public who wishes to receive the speech that these fora facilitate, subject only to narrow limitations. See Kreimer, 958 F.2d at 1260 (noting that a public library does not retain unfettered discretion ""to choose whom it will permit to enter the Library,"" but upholding the library's right to exclude patrons who harass patrons or whose offensive personal hygiene precludes the library's use by other patrons). Moreover, like traditional public fora, public libraries are funded by taxpayers and therefore do not charge members of the public each time they use the forum. The only direct cost to library patrons who wish to receive information, whether via the Internet or the library's print collection, is the time spent reading.  By providing Internet access to millions of Americans to whom such access would otherwise be unavailable, public libraries play a critical role in bridging the digital divide separating those with access to new information technologies from those that lack access. See generally National Telecommunications and Information Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Falling Through the Net: Defining the Digital Divide (1999), available at http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/ fttn99/contents.html. Cf. Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 546, 121 S. Ct. 1043 (invalidating a content-based restriction on the speech of federally funded legal services corporations and noting that given the financial hardship of legal services corporations' clients, ""[t]he restriction on speech is even more problematic because in cases where the attorney withdraws from a representation, the client is unlikely to find other counsel""). Public libraries that provide Internet access greatly expand the educational opportunities for millions of Americans who, as explained in the margin, would otherwise be deprived of the benefits of this new medium.26  Just as important as the openness of a forum to listeners is its openness to speakers. Parks and sidewalks are paradigmatic loci of First Amendment values in large part because they permit speakers to communicate with a wide audience at low cost. One can address members of the public in a park for little more than the cost of a soapbox, and one can distribute handbills on the sidewalk for little more than the cost of a pen, paper, and some photocopies. See Martin v. City of Struthers, 319 U.S. 141, 146, 63 S. Ct. 862, 87 L. Ed. 1313 (1943) (""Door to door distribution of circulars is essential to the poorly financed causes of little people.""); Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law § 12-24 at 987 (2d ed. 1988) (""The 'public forum' doctrine holds that restrictions on speech should be subject to higher scrutiny when, all other things being equal, that speech occurs in areas playing a vital role in communication-such as in those places historically associated with first amendment activities, such as streets, sidewalks, and parks-especially because of how indispensable communication in these places is to people who lack access to more elaborate (and more costly) channels.""); Daniel A. Farber, Free Speech without Romance: Public Choice and the First Amendment, 105 Harv. L. Rev. 554, 574 n.86 (1991) (noting that traditional public fora ""are often the only place where less affluent groups and individuals can effectively express their message""); Harry Kalven, Jr., The Concept of the Public Forum: Cox v. Louisiana, 1965 Sup. Ct. Rev. 1, 30 (""[T]he parade, the picket, the leaflet, the sound truck, have been the media of communication exploited by those with little access to the more genteel means of communication."").  Similarly, given the existence of message boards and free Web hosting services, a speaker can, via the Internet, address the public, including patrons of public libraries, for little more than the cost of Internet access. As the Supreme Court explained in Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 117 S. Ct. 2329, 138 L. Ed. 2d 874 (1997), ""the Internet can hardly be considered a 'scarce' expressive commodity. It provides relatively unlimited, low-cost capacity for communication of all kinds."" Id. at 870, 117 S. Ct. 2329. Although the cost of a home computer and Internet access considerably exceeds the cost of a soapbox or a few hundred photocopies, speakers wishing to avail themselves of the Internet may gain free access in schools, workplaces, or the public library. As Professor Lessig has explained:        The ""press"" in 1791 was not the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal. It did not comprise large organizations of private interests, with millions of readers associated with each organization. Rather, the press then was much like the Internet today. The cost of a printing press was low, the readership was slight, and anyone (within reason) could become a publisher-and in fact an extraordinary number did. When the Constitution speaks of the rights of the ""press,"" the architecture it has in mind is the architecture of the Internet.  Lawrence Lessig, Code 183 (1999).  While public libraries' provision of Internet access shares many of the speech-promoting qualities of traditional public fora, it also facilitates speech in ways that traditional public fora cannot.27 In particular, whereas the architecture of real space limits the audience of a pamphleteer or soapbox orator to people within the speaker's immediate vicinity, the Internet renders the geography of speaker and listener irrelevant:  Through the use of chat rooms, any person with a phone line can become a town crier with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox. Through the use of Web pages, mail exploders, and newsgroups, the same individual can become a pamphleteer.  Reno, 521 U.S. at 870, 117 S. Ct. 2329. By providing patrons with Internet access, public libraries in effect open their doors to an unlimited number of potential speakers around the world, inviting the speech of any member of the public who wishes to communicate with library patrons via the Internet.  Due to the low costs for speakers and the irrelevance of geography, the volume of speech available to library patrons on the Internet is enormous and far exceeds the volume of speech available to audiences in traditional public fora. See id. at 868, 117 S. Ct. 2329 (referring to ""the vast democratic forums of the Internet""). Indeed, as noted in our findings of fact, the Web is estimated to contain over one billion pages, and is said to be growing at a rate of over 1.5 million pages per day. See id. at 885, 117 S. Ct. 2329 (noting ""[t]he dramatic expansion of this new marketplace of ideas""). This staggering volume of content on the Internet ""is as diverse as human thought,"" id. at 870, 117 S. Ct. 2329, and ""is thus comparable, from the reader's viewpoint, to ... a vast library including millions of readily available and indexed publications,"" id. at 853, 117 S. Ct. 2329. As a result of the Internet's unique speech-facilitating qualities, ""it is hard to find an aspiring social movement, new or old, of left, right, or center, without a website, a bulletin board, and an email list."" Kreimer, supra n.27, at 125. ""[T]he growth of the Internet has been and continues to be phenomenal."" Reno, 521 U.S. at 885, 117 S. Ct. 2329.  This extraordinary growth of the Internet illustrates the extent to which the Internet promotes First Amendment values in the same way that the historical use of traditional public fora for speaking, handbilling, and protesting testifies to their effectiveness as vehicles for free speech. Cf. Martin, 319 U.S. at 145, 63 S. Ct. 862 (""The widespread use of this method of communication [door-to-door distribution of leaflets] by many groups espousing various causes attests its major importance.""); Schneider v. State, 308 U.S. 147, 164, 60 S. Ct. 146, 84 L. Ed. 155 (1939) (""[P]amphlets have proved most effective instruments in the dissemination of opinion."").  The provision of Internet access in public libraries, in addition to sharing the speech-enhancing qualities of fora such as streets, sidewalks, and parks, also supplies many of the speech-enhancing properties of the postal service, which is open to the public at large as both speakers and recipients of information, and provides a relatively low-cost means of disseminating information to a geographically dispersed audience. See Lamont v. Postmaster Gen., 381 U.S. 301, 85 S. Ct. 1493, 14 L. Ed. 2d 398 (1965) (invalidating a content-based prior restraint on the use of the mails); see also Blount v. Rizzi, 400 U.S. 410, 91 S. Ct. 423, 27 L. Ed. 2d 498 (1971) (same). Indeed, the Supreme Court's description of the postal system in Lamont seems equally apt as a description of the Internet today: ""the postal system . . . is now the main artery through which the business, social, and personal affairs of the people are conducted. . . ."" 381 U.S. at 305 n.3, 85 S. Ct. 1493.  In short, public libraries, by providing their patrons with access to the Internet, have created a public forum that provides any member of the public free access to information from millions of speakers around the world. The unique speech-enhancing character of Internet use in public libraries derives from the openness of the public library to any member of the public seeking to receive information, and the openness of the Internet to any member of the public who wishes to speak. In particular, speakers on the Internet enjoy low barriers to entry and the ability to reach a mass audience, unhindered by the constraints of geography.28 Moreover, just as the development of new media ""presents unique problems, which inform our assessment of the interests at stake, and which may justify restrictions that would be unacceptable in other contexts,"" United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 813, 120 S. Ct. 1878, 146 L. Ed .2d 865 (2000), the development of new media, such as the Internet, also presents unique possibilities for promoting First Amendment values, which also inform our assessment of the interests at stake, and which we believe, in the context of the provision of Internet access in public libraries, justify the application of heightened scrutiny to content-based restrictions that might be subject to only rational review in other contexts, such as the development of the library's print collection. Cf. id. at 818, 120 S. Ct. 1878 (""Technology expands the capacity to choose; and it denies the potential of this revolution if we assume the Government is best positioned to make these choices for us."").  A faithful translation of First Amendment values from the context of traditional public fora such as sidewalks and parks to the distinctly non-traditional public forum of Internet access in public libraries requires, in our view, that content-based restrictions on Internet access in public libraries be subject to the same exacting standards of First Amendment scrutiny as content-based restrictions on speech in traditional public fora such as sidewalks, town squares, and parks:  The architecture of the Internet, as it is right now, is perhaps the most important model of free speech since the founding. . . . Two hundred years after the framers ratified the Constitution, the Net has taught us what the First Amendment means. . . . The model for speech that the framers embraced was the model of the Internet-distributed, noncentralized, fully free and diverse.  Lessig, Code, at 167, 185. Indeed, ""[m]inds are not changed in streets and parks as they once were. To an increasing degree, the more significant interchanges of ideas and shaping of public consciousness occur in mass and electronic media."" Denver Area Educ. Telecomms. Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U.S. 727, 802-03, 116 S. Ct. 2374, 135 L.Ed.2d 888 (1996) (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment).  In providing patrons with even filtered Internet access, a public library is not exercising editorial discretion in selecting only speech of particular quality for inclusion in its collection, as it may do when it decides to acquire print materials. By providing its patrons with Internet access, public libraries create a forum in which any member of the public may receive speech from anyone around the world who wishes to disseminate information over the Internet. Within this ""vast democratic forum[ ],"" Reno, 521 U.S. at 868, 117 S. Ct. 2329, which facilitates speech that is ""as diverse as human thought,"" id. at 870, 117 S. Ct. 2329, software filters single out for exclusion particular speech on the basis of its disfavored content. We hold that these content-based restrictions on patrons' access to speech are subject to strict scrutiny.  V. Application of Strict Scrutiny  Having concluded that strict scrutiny applies to public libraries' content-based restrictions on patrons' access to speech on the Internet, we must next determine whether a public library's use of Internet software filters can survive strict scrutiny. To survive strict scrutiny, a restriction on speech ""must be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling Government interest. If a less restrictive alternative would serve the Government's purpose, the legislature must use that alternative."" United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 813, 120 S. Ct. 1878, 146 L. Ed. 2d 865 (2000) (citation omitted); see also Fabulous Assocs., Inc. v. Pa. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 896 F.2d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 1990) (holding that a content-based burden on speech is permissible ""only if [the government] shows that the restriction serves a compelling interest and that there are no less restrictive alternatives"").  The application of strict scrutiny to a public library's use of filtering products thus requires three distinct inquiries. First, we must identify those compelling government interests that the use of filtering software promotes. It is then necessary to analyze whether the use of software filters is narrowly tailored to further those interests. Finally, we must determine whether less restrictive alternatives exist that would promote the state interest.  A. State Interests  We begin by identifying those legitimate state interests that a public library's use of software filters promotes.  1. Preventing the Dissemination of Obscenity, Child Pornography, and Material Harmful to Minors  On its face, CIPA is clearly intended to prevent public libraries' Internet terminals from being used to disseminate to library patrons visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or in the case of minors, harmful to minors. See CIPA § 1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(1)(A) & (B)), § 1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(B) & (C)) (requiring any library that receives E-rate discounts to certify that it is enforcing ""a policy of Internet safety that includes the operation of a technology protection measure with respect to any of its computers with Internet access that protects against access through such computers to visual depictions"" that are ""obscene"" or ""child pornography,"" and, when the computers are in use by minors, also protects against access to visual depictions that are ""harmful to minors"").  The government's interest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity, child pornography, or, in the case of minors, material harmful to minors, is well-established. Speech that is obscene, under the legal definition of obscenity set forth in the margin, is unprotected under the First Amendment, and accordingly the state has a compelling interest in preventing its distribution.29 See Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 18, 93 S. Ct. 2607, 37 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1973) (""This Court has recognized that the States have a legitimate interest in prohibiting dissemination or exhibition of obscene material.""); Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 563, 89 S. Ct. 1243, 22 L. Ed. 2d 542 (1969) (""[T]he First and Fourteenth Amendments recognize a valid governmental interest in dealing with the problem of obscenity.""); Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 485, 77 S. Ct. 1304, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1498 (1957) (""We hold that obscenity is not within the area of constitutionally protected speech of press."").  The First Amendment also permits the state to prohibit the distribution to minors of material that, while not obscene with respect to adults, is obscene with respect to minors. See Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 637, 88 S. Ct. 1274, 20 L. Ed. 2d 195 (1968) (holding that it is constitutionally permissible ""to accord minors under 17 a more restricted right than that assured to adults to judge and determine for themselves what sex material they may read or see""). Proscribing the distribution of such material to minors is constitutionally justified by the government's well-recognized interest in safeguarding minors' well-being. See Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 869-70, 117 S. Ct. 2329, 138 L. Ed .2d 874 (1997) (""[T]here is a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors which extend[s] to shielding them from indecent messages that are not obscene by adult standards . . . ."") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 756-57, 102 S. Ct. 3348, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1113 (1982) (""It is evident beyond the need for elaboration that a State's interest in safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of a minor is compelling."") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 640, 88 S. Ct. 1274 (""The State . . . has an independent interest in the well-being of its youth."").  The government's compelling interest in protecting the well-being of its youth justifies laws that criminalize not only the distribution to minors of material that is harmful to minors, but also the possession and distribution of child pornography. See Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 111, 110 S. Ct. 1691, 109 L. Ed. 2d 98 (1990) (holding that a state ""may constitutionally proscribe the possession and viewing of child pornography""); Ferber, 458 U.S. at 757, 763, 102 S. Ct. 3348 (noting that ""[t]he prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of children constitutes a government objective of surpassing importance,"" and holding that ""child pornography [is] a category of material outside the protection of the First Amendment"").  Thus, a public library's use of software filters survives strict scrutiny if it is narrowly tailored to further the state's well-recognized interest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity and child pornography, and in preventing minors from being exposed to material harmful to their well-being.  2. Protecting the Unwilling Viewer  Several of the libraries that use filters assert that filters serve the libraries' interest in preventing patrons from being unwillingly exposed to sexually explicit speech that the patrons find offensive. Nearly every library proffered by either the government or the plaintiffs received complaints, in varying degrees of frequency, from library patrons who saw other patrons accessing sexually explicit material on the library's Internet terminals.  In general, First Amendment jurisprudence is reluctant to recognize a legitimate state interest in protecting the unwilling viewer from speech that is constitutionally protected. ""Where the designed benefit of a content-based speech restriction is to shield the sensibilities of listeners, the general rule is that the right of expression prevails, even where no less restrictive alternative exists. We are expected to protect our own sensibilities simply by averting our eyes."" Playboy, 529 U.S. at 813, 120 S. Ct. 1878 (2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 209, 95 S. Ct. 2268, 45 L. Ed. 2d 125 (1975) (""[W]hen the government, acting as censor, undertakes selectively to shield the public from some kinds of speech on the ground that they are more offensive than others, the First Amendment strictly limits its power."").  For example, in Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 29 L. Ed. 2d 284 (1971), the Supreme Court reversed defendant's conviction for wearing, in a municipal courthouse, a jacket bearing the inscription ""Fuck the Draft."" The Court noted that ""much has been made of the claim that Cohen's distasteful mode of expression was thrust upon unwilling or unsuspecting viewers, and that the State might therefore legitimately act as it did in order to protect the sensitive from otherwise unavoidable exposure to appellant's crude form of protest."" Id. at 21, 91 S. Ct. 1780. This justification for suppressing speech failed, however, because it ""would effectively empower a majority to silence dissidents simply as a matter of personal predilections."" Id. The Court concluded that ""[t]hose in the Los Angeles courthouse could effectively avoid further bombardment of their sensibilities simply by averting their eyes."" Id.  Similarly, in Erznoznik, the Court invalidated on its face a municipal ordinance prohibiting drive-in movie theaters from showing films containing nudity if they were visible from a public street or place. The city's ""primary argument [was] that it may protect its citizens against unwilling exposure to materials that may be offensive."" 422 U.S. at 208, 95 S. Ct. 2268. The Court soundly rejected this interest in shielding the unwilling viewer:  The plain, if at times disquieting, truth is that in our pluralistic society, constantly proliferating new and ingenious forms of expression, we are inescapably captive audiences for many purposes. Much that we encounter offends our esthetic, if not our political and moral, sensibilities. Nevertheless, the Constitution does not permit government to decide which types of otherwise protected speech are sufficiently offensive to require protection for the unwilling listener or viewer. Rather, absent . . . narrow circumstances . . . the burden normally falls upon the viewer to avoid further bombardment of his sensibilities simply by averting his eyes.  422 U.S. at 210-11, 95 S. Ct. 2268 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The state's interest in protecting unwilling viewers from exposure to patently offensive material is accounted for, to some degree, by obscenity doctrine, which originated in part to permit the state to shield the unwilling viewer. ""The Miller standard, like its predecessors, was an accommodation between the State's interests in protecting the sensibilities of unwilling recipients from exposure to pornographic material and the dangers of censorship inherent in unabashedly content-based laws."" Ferber, 458 U.S. at 756, 102 S. Ct. 3348 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Miller, 413 U.S. at 18-19, 93 S. Ct. 2607 (""This Court has recognized that the States have a legitimate interest in prohibiting dissemination or exhibition of obscene material when the mode of dissemination carries with it a significant danger of offending the sensibilities of unwilling recipients or of exposure to juveniles."") (citation omitted). To the extent that speech has serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value, and therefore is not obscene under the Miller test of obscenity, the state's interest in shielding unwilling viewers from such speech is tenuous.  Nonetheless, the Court has recognized that in certain limited circumstances, the state has a legitimate interest in protecting the public from unwilling exposure to speech that is not obscene. This interest has justified restrictions on speech ""when the speaker intrudes on the privacy of the home, or the degree of captivity makes it impractical for the unwilling viewer or auditor to avoid exposure."" Erznoznik, 422 U.S. at 209, 95 S. Ct. 2268 (citations omitted). Thus, in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726, 98 S. Ct. 3026, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1073 (1978), the Court relied on the state's interest in shielding viewers' sensibilities to uphold a prohibition against profanity in radio broadcasts:  Patently offensive, indecent material presented over the airwaves confronts the citizen, not only in public, but also in the privacy of the home, where the individual's right to be left alone plainly outweighs the First Amendment rights of an intruder. Because the broadcast audience is constantly tuning in and out, prior warnings cannot completely protect the listener or viewer from unexpected program content.  Id. at 748, 98 S. Ct. 3026 (citation omitted); accord Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 485, 108 S. Ct. 2495, 101 L. Ed. 2d 420 (1988) (""Although in many locations, we expect individuals simply to avoid speech they do not want to hear, the home is different.""); see also Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298, 302, 94 S. Ct. 2714, 41 L. Ed. 2d 770 (1974) (plurality opinion) (upholding a content-based restriction on the sale of advertising space in public transit vehicles and noting that ""[t]he streetcar audience is a captive audience"").  Although neither the Supreme Court nor the Third Circuit has recognized a compelling state interest in shielding the sensibilities of unwilling viewers, beyond laws intended to preserve the privacy of individuals' homes or to protect captive audiences, we do not read the case law as categorically foreclosing recognition, in the public library setting, of the state's interest in protecting unwilling viewers. See Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 749 n.27, 98 S. Ct. 3026 (""Outside the home, the balance between the offensive speaker and the unwilling audience may sometimes tip in favor of the speaker, requiring the offended listener to turn away."") (emphasis added). Under certain circumstances, therefore a public library might have a compelling interest in protecting library patrons and staff from unwilling exposure to sexually explicit speech that, although not obscene, is patently offensive.  3. Preventing Unlawful or Inappropriate Conduct  Several of the librarians proffered by the government testified that unfiltered Internet access had led to occurrences of criminal or otherwise inappropriate conduct by library patrons, such as public masturbation, and harassment of library staff and patrons, sometimes rising to the level of physical assault. As in the case with patron complaints, however, the government adduced no quantitative data comparing the frequency of criminal or otherwise inappropriate patron conduct before the library's use of filters and after the library's use of filters. The sporadic anecdotal accounts of the government's library witnesses were countered by anecdotal accounts by the plaintiffs' library witnesses, that incidents of offensive patron behavior in public libraries have long predated the advent of Internet access.  Aside from a public library's interest in preventing patrons from using the library's Internet terminals to receive obscenity or child pornography, which constitutes criminal conduct, we are constrained to reject any compelling state interest in regulating patrons' conduct as a justification for content-based restrictions on patrons' Internet access. ""[T]he Court's First Amendment cases draw vital distinctions between words and deeds, between ideas and conduct."" Ashcroft, -- U.S. at --, 122 S. Ct. at 1403. First Amendment jurisprudence makes clear that speech may not be restricted on the ground that restricting speech will reduce crime or other undesirable behavior that the speech is thought to cause, subject to only a narrow exception for speech that ""is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action."" Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 447, 89 S. Ct. 1827, 23 L. Ed. 2d 430 (1969) (per curiam). ""The mere tendency of speech to encourage unlawful acts is insufficient reason for banning it."" Ashcroft, -- U.S. at --, 122 S. Ct. at 1403.  Outside of the narrow ""incitement"" exception, the appropriate method of deterring unlawful or otherwise undesirable behavior is not to suppress the speech that induces such behavior, but to attach sanctions to the behavior itself. ""Among free men, the deterrents ordinarily to be applied to prevent crime are education and punishment for violations of the law, not abridgement of the rights of free speech."" Kingsley Int'l Pictures Corp. v. Regents of the Univ. of the State of New York, 360 U.S. 684, 689, 79 S. Ct. 1362, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1512 (1959) (quoting Whitney v. Cal., 274 U.S. 357, 378, 47 S. Ct. 641, 71 L. Ed. 1095 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring)); see also Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. 514, 529, 121 S. Ct. 1753, 149 L. Ed. 2d 787 (2001) (""The normal method of deterring unlawful conduct is to impose an appropriate punishment on the person who engages in it."").  4. Summary  In sum, we reject a public library's interest in preventing unlawful or otherwise inappropriate patron conduct as a basis for restricting patrons' access to speech on the Internet. The proper method for a library to deter unlawful or inappropriate patron conduct, such as harassment or assault of other patrons, is to impose sanctions on such conduct, such as either removing the patron from the library, revoking the patron's library privileges, or, in the appropriate case, calling the police. We believe, however, that the state interests in preventing the dissemination of obscenity, child pornography, or in the case of minors, material harmful to minors, and in protecting library patrons from being unwillingly exposed to offensive, sexually explicit material, could all justify, for First Amendment purposes, a public library's use of Internet filters, provided that use of such filters is narrowly tailored to further those interests, and that no less restrictive means of promoting those interests exist. Accordingly, we turn to the narrow tailoring question.  B. Narrow Tailoring  Having identified the relevant state interests that could justify content-based restrictions on public libraries' provision of Internet access, we must determine whether a public library's use of software filters is narrowly tailored to further those interests. ""It is not enough to show that the Government's ends are compelling; the means must be carefully tailored to achieve those ends."" Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126, 109 S. Ct. 2829, 106 L. Ed. 2d 93 (1989). ""[M]anifest imprecision of [a] ban . . . reveals that its proscription is not sufficiently tailored to the harms it seeks to prevent to justify . . . substantial interference with . . . speech."" FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U.S. 364, 392, 104 S. Ct. 3106, 82 L. Ed. 2d 278 (1984).  The commercially available filters on which evidence was presented at trial all block many thousands of Web pages that are clearly not harmful to minors, and many thousands more pages that, while possibly harmful to minors, are neither obscene nor child pornography. See supra, Subsection II.E.7. Even the defendants' own expert, after analyzing filtering products' performance in public libraries, concluded that of the blocked Web pages to which library patrons sought access, between 6% and 15% contained no content that meets even the filtering products' own definitions of sexually explicit content, let alone the legal definitions of obscenity or child pornography, which none of the filtering companies that were studied use as the basis for their blocking decisions. Moreover, in light of the flaws in these studies, discussed in detail in our findings of fact above, these percentages significantly underestimate the amount of speech that filters erroneously block, and at best provide a rough lower bound on the filters' rates of overblocking. Given the substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech blocked by the filters studied, we conclude that use of such filters is not narrowly tailored with respect to the government's interest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity, child pornography, and material harmful to minors.  To be sure, the quantitative estimates of the rates of overblocking apply only to those four commercially available filters analyzed by plaintiffs' and defendants' expert witnesses. Nonetheless, given the inherent limitations in the current state of the art of automated classification systems, and the limits of human review in relation to the size, rate of growth, and rate of change of the Web, there is a tradeoff between underblocking and overblocking that is inherent in any filtering technology, as our findings of fact have demonstrated. We credit the testimony of plaintiffs' expert witness, Dr. Geoffrey Nunberg, that no software exists that can automatically distinguish visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors, from those that are not. Nor can software, through keyword analysis or more sophisticated techniques, consistently distinguish web pages that contain such content from web pages that do not.  In light of the absence of any automated method of classifying Web pages, filtering companies are left with the Sisyphean task of using human review to identify, from among the approximately two billion web pages that exist, the 1.5 million new pages that are created daily, and the many thousands of pages whose content changes from day to day, those particular web pages to be blocked. To cope with the Web's extraordinary size, rate of growth, and rate of change, filtering companies that rely solely on human review to block access to material falling within their category definitions must use a variety of techniques that will necessarily introduce substantial amounts of overblocking. These techniques include blocking every page of a Web site that contains only some content falling within the filtering companies' category definitions, blocking every Web site that shares an IP-address with a Web site whose content falls within the category definitions, blocking ""loophole sites,"" such as anonymizers, cache sites, and translation sites, and allocating staff resources to reviewing content of uncategorized pages rather than re-reviewing pages, domain names, or IP-addresses that have been already categorized to determine whether their content has changed. While a filtering company could choose not to use these techniques, due to the overblocking errors they introduce, if a filtering company does not use such techniques, its filter will be ineffective at blocking access to speech that falls within its category definitions.  Thus, while it would be easy to design, for example, a filter that blocks only ten Web sites, all of which are either obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors, and therefore completely avoids overblocking, such a filter clearly would not comply with CIPA, since it would fail to offer any meaningful protection against the hundreds of thousands of Web sites containing speech in these categories. As detailed in our findings of fact, any filter that blocks enough speech to protect against access to visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, and harmful to minors, will necessarily overblock substantial amounts of speech that does not fall within these categories.  This finding is supported by the government's failure to produce evidence of any filtering technology that avoids overblocking a substantial amount of protected speech. Where, as here, strict scrutiny applies to a content-based restriction on speech, the burden rests with the government to show that the restriction is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. See Playboy, 529 U.S. at 816, 120 S. Ct. 1878 (""When the Government restricts speech, the Government bears the burden of proving the constitutionality of its actions.""); see also R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 382, 112 S. Ct. 2538, 120 L. Ed. 2d 305 (1992) (""Content-based regulations are presumptively invalid.""). Thus, it is the government's burden, in this case, to show the existence of a filtering technology that both blocks enough speech to qualify as a technology protection measure, for purposes of CIPA, and avoids overblocking a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech.  Here, the government has failed to meet its burden. Indeed, as discussed in our findings of fact, every technology protection measure used by the government's library witnesses or analyzed by the government's expert witnesses blocks access to a substantial amount of speech that is constitutionally protected with respect to both adults and minors. In light of the credited testimony of Dr. Nunberg, and the inherent tradeoff between overblocking and underblocking, together with the government's failure to offer evidence of any technology protection measure that avoids overblocking, we conclude that any technology protection measure that blocks a sufficient amount of speech to comply with CIPA's requirement that it ""protect[ ] against access through such computers to visual depictions that are-(I) obscene; (II) child pornography; or (III) harmful to minors"" will necessarily block substantial amounts of speech that does not fall within these categories. CIPA § 1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(1)(A)). Hence, any public library's use of a software filter required by CIPA will fail to be narrowly tailored to the government's compelling interest in preventing the dissemination, through Internet terminals in public libraries, of visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors.  Where, as here, strict scrutiny applies, the government may not justify restrictions on constitutionally protected speech on the ground that such restrictions are necessary in order for the government effectively to suppress the dissemination of constitutionally unprotected speech, such as obscenity and child pornography. ""The argument . . . that protected speech may be banned as a means to ban unprotected speech . . . . turns the First Amendment upside down. The Government may not suppress lawful speech as the means to suppress unlawful speech."" Ashcroft, -- U.S. at --, 122 S. Ct. at 1404. This rule reflects the judgment that ""[t]he possible harm to society in permitting some unprotected speech to go unpunished is outweighed by the possibility that protected speech of others may be muted. . . ."" Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. at 612, 93 S. Ct. 2908.  Thus, in Ashcroft, the Supreme Court rejected the government's argument that a statute criminalizing the distribution of constitutionally protected ""virtual"" child pornography, produced through computer imaging technology without the use of real children, was necessary to further the state's interest in prosecuting the dissemination of constitutionally unprotected child pornography produced using real children, since ""the possibility of producing images by using computer imaging makes it very difficult for [the government] to prosecute those who produce pornography using real children."" Ashcroft, -- U.S. at --, 122 S. Ct. at 1404; see also Stanley, 394 U.S. at 567-58, 89 S. Ct. 1243 (holding that individuals have a First Amendment right to possess obscene material, even though the existence of this right makes it more difficult for the states to further their legitimate interest in prosecuting the distribution of obscenity). By the same token, even if the use of filters is effective in preventing patrons from receiving constitutionally unprotected speech, the government's interest in preventing the dissemination of such speech cannot justify the use of the technology protection measures mandated by CIPA, which necessarily block substantial amounts of constitutionally protected speech.  CIPA thus resembles the Communications Decency Act, which the Supreme Court facially invalidated in Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 117 S. Ct. 2329, 138 L. Ed. 2d 874 (1997). Although on its face, the CDA simply restricted the distribution to minors of speech that was constitutionally unprotected with respect to minors, as a practical matter, given Web sites' difficulties in identifying the ages of Internet users, the CDA effectively prohibited the distribution to adults of material that was constitutionally protected with respect to adults.30 Similarly, although on its face, CIPA, like the CDA, requires the suppression of only constitutionally unprotected speech, it is impossible as a practical matter, given the state of the art of filtering technology, for a public library to comply with CIPA without also blocking significant amounts of constitutionally protected speech. We therefore hold that a library's use of a technology protection measure required by CIPA is not narrowly tailored to the government's legitimate interest in preventing the dissemination of visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or in the case of minors, harmful to minors.  For the same reason that a public library's use of software filters is not narrowly tailored to further the library's interest in preventing its computers from being used to disseminate visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, and harmful to minors, a public library's use of software filters is not narrowly tailored to further the library's interest in protecting patrons from being unwillingly exposed to offensive, sexually explicit material. As discussed in our findings of fact, the filters required by CIPA block substantial numbers of Web sites that even the most puritanical public library patron would not find offensive, such as http://federo.com, a Web site that promotes federalism in Uganda, which N2H2 blocked as ""Adults Only, Pornography,"" and http://www.vvm.com/bond/home .htm, a site for aspiring dentists, which was blocked by Cyberpatrol as ""Adult/Sexually Explicit."" We list many more such examples in our findings of fact, see supra, and find that such erroneously blocked sites number in at least the thousands.  Although we have found large amounts of overblocking, even if only a small percentage of sites blocked are erroneously blocked, either with respect to the state's interest in preventing adults from viewing material that is obscene or child pornography and in preventing minors from viewing material that is harmful to minors, or with respect to the state's interest in preventing library patrons generally from being unwillingly exposed to offensive, sexually explicit material, this imprecision is fatal under the First Amendment. Cf. Reno, 521 U.S. at 874, 117 S. Ct. 2329 (""[T]he CDA lacks the precision that the First Amendment requires when a statute regulates the content of speech.""); League of Women Voters, 468 U.S. at 398, 104 S. Ct. 3106 (""[E]ven if some of the hazards at which [the challenged provision] was aimed are sufficiently substantial, the restriction is not crafted with sufficient precision to remedy those dangers that may exist to justify the significant abridgement of speech worked by the provision's broad ban. . . ."").  While the First Amendment does not demand perfection when the government restricts speech in order to advance a compelling interest, the substantial amounts of erroneous blocking inherent in the technology protection measures mandated by CIPA are more than simply de minimis instances of human error. ""The line between speech unconditionally guaranteed and speech which may legitimately be regulated, suppressed, or punished is finely drawn.

(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Where the government draws content-based restrictions on speech in order to advance a compelling government interest, the First Amendment demands the precision of a scalpel, not a sledgehammer. We believe that a public library's use of the technology protection measures mandated by CIPA is not narrowly tailored to further the governmental interests at stake.  Although the strength of different libraries' interests in blocking certain forms of speech may vary from library to library, depending on the frequency and severity of problems experienced by each particular library, we conclude, based on our findings of fact, that any public library's use of a filtering product mandated by CIPA will necessarily fail to be narrowly tailored to address the library's legitimate interests. Because it is impossible for a public library to comply with CIPA without blocking substantial amounts of speech whose suppression serves no legitimate state interest, we therefore hold that CIPA is facially invalid, even under the more stringent standard of facial invalidity urged on us by the government, which would require upholding CIPA if it is possible for just a single library to comply with CIPA's conditions without violating the First Amendment. See supra Part III.  C. Less Restrictive Alternatives  The constitutional infirmity of a public library's use of software filters is evidenced not only by the absence of narrow tailoring, but also by the existence of less restrictive alternatives that further the government's legitimate interests. See Playboy, 529 U.S. at 813, 120 S. Ct. 1878 (""If a less restrictive alternative would serve the Government's purpose, the legislature must use that alternative.""); Sable, 492 U.S. at 126, 109 S. Ct. 2829 (""The Government may . . . regulate the content of constitutionally protected speech in order to promote a compelling interest if it chooses the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest."").  As is the case with the narrow tailoring requirement, the government bears the burden of proof in showing the ineffectiveness of less restrictive alternatives. ""When a plausible, less restrictive alternative is offered to a content-based speech restriction, it is the Government's obligation to prove that the alternative will be ineffective to achieve its goals.""

LaRue, Esq.  Senior Director of Legal Studies  Family Research Council      The author, David Burt, is a public librarian in Lake Oswego, Oregon, a loving husband, father, and good friend. Despite his full life and schedule, he has become a tireless and effective activist working to keep America's libraries safe for children and adults and free from the destructive presence of illegal pornography and sexual predators.    As a librarian, David knows and supports the mission and purpose of a public library, best expressed in the mission statement of the Los Angeles Public Library: ""The Los Angeles Public Library strives to inform, enrich, and empower every individual in its community by creating and promoting free and easy access to a vast array of ideas and information and by supporting lifelong learning in a welcoming environment."" No one could imagine that such a noble purpose was meant to include a pedophile operating a child pornography website and soliciting sexual liaisons with children in that very library.    Aware that pornography is becoming a staple in one library after another because adults and children are accessing it through unfiltered library computer terminals, David could no longer reconcile the mission of public libraries with what was happening. Equally distressing to him was the absolute refusal of the American Library Association (ALA) to admit a problem existed or to exercise its enormous political and financial clout to keep America's libraries from becoming virtual dirty bookstores open to children and funded by taxpayers. Thankfully, a growing number of public librarians and officials have recognized the magnitude of the problem and are acting to stop it, despite the resistance of the ALA.    David's activism has exponentially increased since he created his website, www.filteringfacts.org, where he continues to gather, archive, and disseminate information as well as provide assistance to those who share his concerns and efforts to stop the misuse and perversion of public libraries.    While 74 percent of public libraries provide some access to the Internet and related services through interactive computer services, only 15 percent of those libraries utilize some type of blocking technology on at least some of their public workstations. The most significant reason that so few libraries have utilized blocking technology is the policies, pressure, and practice of the ALA in advocating for unrestricted access by anyone, regardless of age, to all of the materials available on the Internet regardless of content, including the most deviant pornography. This includes child pornography, hardcore depictions of rape, sexual torture, sadomasochistic abuse, group sex, and sex involving urination, defecation, and bestiality.    Dangerous Access, 2000 Edition, reports on a project David initiated last year to follow up to his original Dangerous Access released in March 1999. With the help of the Family Research Council, David submitted Freedom of Information Act requests to all fifty state-library systems; responses were sent to him for study and analysis. Because of the explicit nature of many of the reported incidents that David highlights, reader discretion is advised; the material is clearly not suitable for children. David is the sole author of Dangerous Access, 2000 Edition: Uncovering Pornography in America's Libraries. As the reader will see in the following pages, David lays the blame at the doorstep of the ALA.    The following pages prove that library online-services are being used by adults and children to access illegal pornography and that libraries are scenes of public masturbation and other sex crimes, often with full knowledge of library staff, some of whom have refused to call police. The ALA has acknowledged that the First Amendment protects none of this material. It is the height of hubris and duplicity for the ALA and public librarians knowingly to provide this illegal material and attempt to wrap themselves in the Constitution. (An analysis of federal obscenity, child pornography, state material-harmful-to-minors law, and the ALA Bill of Rights and Code of Ethics is provided in Appendix B.)    All who want to enjoy the services provided by public libraries with the knowledge they and their children are safe ""in a welcoming environment"" owe David Burt their deepest thanks for his momentous work. If Americans fail to act upon it and do nothing to stop the degradation and abuse of public libraries, it will be to their shame and loss.    INTRODUCTION    A six-month investigation of documents obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests to public libraries has uncovered more than two thousand documented incidents of patrons, many of them children, accessing pornography, obscenity, and child pornography in the nation's public libraries. Many of the incidents were highly disturbing, as librarians witnessed adults instructing children in how to find pornography, adults trading in child pornography, and incidents involving both adults and minors engaging in public masturbation at Internet terminals. Analysis of computer logs from just three urban libraries revealed thousands of incidents that went unreported, indicating that the 2,062 incidents represent only a fraction of the total incidents nationwide. The total number of incidents each year nationwide is likely to be between four hundred thousand and two million.    Nearly all of the nation's public library systems were contacted with freedom-of-information requests, but 71 percent of the public library systems ignored the requests. Both the American Library Association and a number of state libraries sent messages to public libraries suggesting ways that libraries could avoid compliance with the requests. Several state librarians actually told public libraries in their states not to comply.    The incidents suggest that Internet policies alone do not deter crime on library Internet stations. The incidents supplied by libraries included 172 incidents where librarians described crimes being committed, such as the accessing of child pornography, the accessing of material described by the librarians as ""obscene,"" public masturbation, and adults exposing children to pornography. In only six of these incidents (3.5 percent) were the police notified.    Obtained along with the incident reports were the Internet access logs of three public libraries that employ filters in Tacoma, Washington; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Dayton, Ohio. The logs reveal that among those sites blocked by filters, only 0.01-0.07 percent were nonsexual in nature. In other words, 99.93-99.99 percent of the time, the filter did not block innocent sites.    The failure of many libraries to prevent these incidents combined with the demonstrated effectiveness of filtering software supports the appropriateness of legislation to require the use of filters in public libraries.    WHY THIS REPORT WAS NECESSARY    According to a 1999 study in Nature, there are approximately 12 million pages of pornographic content on the Internet, accounting for 1.5 percent of all Internet content.1 The anonymous environment of the public library offers the ideal place to access this sea of pornography. Children who want to avoid supervised access to the Internet at home and school, men who do not wish to risk their pornography habits being discovered by their wives and children, transients without any other access to Internet pornography, pedophiles wishing to download illegal child pornography, and sexual perpetrators wishing to expose others to pornography would all be attracted to a public library to obtain free access to the Internet.    Many librarians report situations in their libraries where ""porn surfers"" create serious problems. Michael Schuyler, systems' librarian for the Kitsap, Washington, Regional Library System, describes the experience in his own library:    ""Porn Alley"" is what we call it here-a row of PCs facing away from thereference desk with full Internet access. It's inhabited from the moment we openuntil the moment we close by brazen folk who, with no shame, will look atpornography no matter who is around or how shocking it may seem.2    Orange County, Florida, Public Library director Dorothy Field described her own situation:    A number of people were coming into the library and accessing sites that wouldbe described as hard-core porn. I am not talking about Playboy and naked ladies. Iam talking about stuff in the back room of adult bookstores. They would view thisfor hours on end.3    The response of both the American Library Association and the ""free speechcommunity,"" organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union and People for the American Way, has been to discount such reports. Ann Symons, immediate past president of the American Library Association, recently said, ""The whole issue of protecting children has been blown way out of proportion by the media and those who seek to promote their own agendas.""4 Judith Krug, director of the ALA's Office of Intellectual Freedom, even went so far as to say that ""their number is so small that it is almost laughable,"" and ""only one child out of a trillion billion"" might use library computers to seek out pornography.5    Other free-speech organizations have taken a similar line. Larry Ottinger, staff counsel for the People for the American Way, called filtering ""an unconstitutional solution in search of a problem.""6 The ACLU has dismissed the many published accounts of patrons viewing pornography in libraries as ""a few unconfirmed press reports.""7    * * * * *    LIBRARY INCIDENTS INVOLVING  INTERNET PORNOGRAPHY      The data for this report was gathered during two periods. Filtering Facts published Dangerous Access, 1999 Edition, in March 1999 after gathering the details from 613 freedom-of-information requests filed with public libraries. Three months later, the Family Research Council funded a more comprehensive series of freedom-of-information requests. Using the mailing list of American Library Directory, 1997-98 Edition, more than fourteen thousand requests were mailed to the nation's 9,767 public library systems.    1999 Study 2000 Study  Request Sent to Public Libraries  613 9,767  Libraries Reporting No Incidents  PNA 2,333  Libraries Reporting Incidents  114 338      After the responses were received, the total number of incidents from all the 452 libraries that reported incidents were tabulated and classified. The incidents, along with a few news stories published independently of this study, totaled 2,062. These incidents involved library patrons viewing pornographic material as defined by the incident reports using the terms ""pornographic,"" ""porn,"" ""pictures of naked women,"" ""obscene material,"" ""sex picture,"" ""sexually explicit material"" ""adult web sites,"" and ""smut sites."" Also included in the total incident number were incidents that featured the names of sites being viewed by patrons that were obviously pornographic in nature. Patrons viewing ""inappropriate"" material were also included because the request letter specifically asked for incidents of ""patrons accessing pornographic or sexually explicit material""; these incidents are, therefore, thought to be of patrons accessing pornographic material. Phrases used in these incidents included ""inappropriate,"" ""not appropriate,"" ""objectionable,"" ""violating policy,"" and ""offensive.""

Three library systems supplied their respective incidents recorded in their computer logs:    Public Library  Number of Annual Incidents*  Tacoma, Washington,  Public Library 1,764 (actual)  Cincinnati, Ohio, Public Library 30,159 (attempted)**  Dayton, Ohio, Public Library 14,358 (actual & attempted)***      * An incident in a library computer log is defined as a single unique Internetsession.    ** Based on a fifty-two day sample. All recorded accesses were blocked.    *** Adults may override the filter. It is unknown how many blocks were overridden or the content of the sites blocked.    CHILDREN ACCESSING PORNOGRAPHY    A significant portion of the total incidents involved children. The category, ""Child Accessing Pornography,"" accounted for 472 incidents. There were 673 total incidents involving children; that is 33 percent of the total. Most of the children were young adolescents, but many of these children were quite young. In some incidents, older children were showing the younger children pornography. The following incidents involved young children:    A patron at the Houston Library noticed:    A set of brothers using two side by side display monitors. One child about twelve was teaching two others about ten and eight years old how to access the pornography sites.    A patron in Bremerton, Washington, complained:    While my daughter checked out the books, my attention was immediately drawn to this vivid full screen photo of a sensuous blonde with full frontal nudity! The 8-year-old boy operating the screen glanced around with a mixture of guilt and desperation written all over his face.    A staff member at the Kokomo Howard County Public Library in Indiana reported:    A young boy, about 9-11 years old, was signed up to use computer #1 for the Internet. He had purchased paper and was printing off pictures before we noticed that he was sitting at the wrong computer. Another patron who was signed up for computer #2 told us about the mistake. We asked the boy to move over to computer #1 and discovered that he had been printing colored pictures of obscene material. When the computer patron came over to use computer #2 we had to clear his sites in full view of the patron. We did not have any complaints and so we did not ask him to leave his sites. I discussed this incident with other staff members, so that we could watch him & monitor his behavior. We may want to take another look at our Internet policy.    A librarian at the Morton Grove Public Library in Illinois reported:    Patron reported that she had been working in a study carrel near the Internet terminals for approx. 2 hours. During that time she witnessed a male child, approx. 7 years old accessing adult oriented web sites at Internet station #3. When she would walk past him, he would quickly switch to another screen. The patron reported having seen staff stroll past a couple times. The patron brought this to the attention of desk staff. When I returned from lunch, I spoke with her. Her main concern is that the Internet terminals are much too far away from the staff/information desk. She said that even if the staff patrolled by every 10 minutes, it still wouldn't be enough because the kids are so fast. She said the Internet stations should be directly in front of the information desk so that staff can easily see what the kids are into at any given moment. She is concerned with all the children who use this tax-supported library, not just her own kids.    These incidents often upset library staff as well as patrons. A branch manager of the Yakima Regional Library in Washington wrote to her director:    This is a difficult letter to write. . . . On Monday of last week a group of about eight to ten teenage boys came to the library and asked me if they could get pornography on the Internet. I replied that they could . . . Several pictures were printed of naked women from the waist up. Later that afternoon, one of the younger boys (elementary age) said that the big boys had shown some dirty pictures on the computer . . . First, it is against my personal convictions to provide pornography or X- or R-rated pictures to children. When I applied to work at the library, running a porn shop was not in the job description. A second and greater issue is that we are supplying pornography to minors without their parents' permission or knowledge. A staff member at the Seattle Public Library sent a similar e-mail to co-workers: Every day children are viewing materials that [they] are by law denied access to in other venues. Traditionally the library has offered free unfettered access to all materials to any person regardless of age. The library also had control over what materials are available. The Internet is uncontrolled. The best and worst that humanity has to offer is there in vivid color and sound for anyone who can point, click, and type a few words. Why isn't the library providing protection from this kind of material? Immediate steps should be taken to form a policy on what children should and should not have access to.    More incidents involved older children, sometimes with very explicit pornography and chat rooms, as these library staff incident reports show:    A couple of our younger patrons were printing out porno from the Internet stations in the cubicles. They were between the ages of 10-12. These were explicit bondage photos. I discovered them quite by accident. It was closing and a printout was left in the printer. So, I would like to put an age of 14 restriction on the cubicles.    -Escondido, California, Library    At about 9:30 am, circulation forwarded a call to me from a mother concerned that her 12-year-old son had found ""very explicit"" and ""disgusting"" sexual pictures on our Internet computer, printed them and brought them home. She didn't seem to want to leave her name so I didn't push it. She claimed the child said an adult in the periodicals room showed her son where to find these pictures. I of course, clarified that she didn't mean a staff member. I explained that library policy is that we don't allow such things, etc. Once I got her to understand that the library has no control over what is on the Internet, she seemed to accept my answer.    -Grove City, Ohio, Library    A young lady about 13 years was using a chat terminal. As I walked by I noticed the word ""f---ing"" used a couple times. Next time I checked I noticed the screen said ""Now I'm touching your t--s."" Then it went on into ""Now I'm f---ing. . . ."" At that point I said to her that objectionable language shouldn't be used on the computers and she should switch to another chat site. She said she would and then logged off and left.    -Medina County, Ohio, Public Library    Shortly after the Columbine shootings in Littleton, Colorado, a librarian at the Bemis Public Library in Littleton expressed grave concerns to a supervisor about the possibility of another incident tied to the library:    Last Friday I met with a mother who was cleaning her 15-year-old son's room and looking around to see what he's been up to. What she discovered was a 2 inch thick stack of Internet downloads. The stack included 1. Credit card fraud-how to do it, 2. Counterfeiting money-how to do it, 3. How to make a portable grenade launcher, 4. How to make an auto exhaust flame thrower, 5. How to make dynamite, 6. Chemical equivalencies, 7. Light bulb bombs and tennis ball bombs, 8. How to hot wire cars, 9. Mail box bombs and smoke bombs, 10. Sexuallyexplicit pictures and sexually explicit stories like ""how many loads of c-can Kaitlyn swallow?"" In the wake of Columbine, his mother wanted to turn these and her son in for this. The investigation and interview of this boy revealed that ALL of these downloads came from the Bemis library. There is no computer in the child's home and his mother confirmed that the only place she takes him is the Bemis library where he told her he does his homework. The kids also offered that it is widely known that you can get anything from the Internet at the library without any password, username or other information. Is there anything that can be done about this? We have enough problems with juveniles without giving them a library to gain access to whatever illegal and crime related material they want. I would hate to see where someone was injured or killed from a tennis ball bomb that the suspect offers they learned to make from an Internet download at the library. Ironically, the Rocky Mountain News had an article on it today (p. 22A). I want to let you know this appears to be a growing problem.    Accessing Internet pornography led some children to other behaviors. The director of the Grayville Library in Illinois stated:    Five teenagers/young men lost computer privileges for accessing sexually explicit/pornographic web sites . . . Two of the young men actually entered the library after hours to access these locations. Needless to say, the matter was turned over to our local police.    Four children were even observed who appeared to be masturbating, one to bestiality. A Broward County, Florida, staff member reported that a    Young man probably 13 or 14 years old had accessed something having to do with sex with animals. He acted strangely, perhaps also masturbating. I asked him questions about what he was doing and after a while he left.    In Ft. Collins, Colorado, a staff member wrote:    Boy looking at pornography on the web and fondling himself. Sandy-haired boy of 11 or 12, hair cut short, rather chubby. A library customer telephoned the library to say that when he had been on a www station earlier he had looked up and seen a boy looking at ""hardcore"" pornography on station #9 and touching himself.    An incident report filed by a Ft. Vancouver, Washington, Public Library staff member noted the following:    After several prior incidents of sperm being found by staff in the restroom on the floor after a particular set of brothers have been using the Internet and restroom, I approached one of the patrons, asked him into my office and told him that we had seen a pattern of sperm and his Internet use. After examining his hands for an extended period of time, I said that ejaculation was an inappropriate activity in the library.    Internet pornography, pornographic chat rooms, and masturbation at the library played a key role in the attempted molestation of a four-year-old boy by a thirteen-yearold boy at the Phoenix Public Library, according to this police report:    On 6-29-98 at approximately 1430 hours, [S]ergeant Ruiz was contacted by a patrol sergeant reference an attempt sexual conduct with a minor, occurring at the Phoenix Public Library. . . .    Officer Jackson first talked with Cheryl ___, who informed him that she had arrived at the library approximately a little after 1:00 p.m. and her [four-year-old] son needed to use the restroom. She walked her son over to the restroom located on the second floor of the library and let her son go into the men's restroom by himself. Her son was gone for approximately 2 to 3 minutes when he came back outside and told his mother that there was a boy inside the bathroom who was willing to give him a quarter to ""suck his d---.""    Interview with Damian [Suspected perpetrator, age 13]. Damian told me he arrived at the library approximately 12 o'clock. He stated he had taken the bus from his house and that he comes to the public library daily. I asked Damian to tell me a little bit of what he does at the library. Damian stated that he always gets on the computer and gets on the Internet and goes into the chat room on the computer. He told me that his handle on the computer was Aqua 3000. He said he entered a chat room and began to talk with a subject who referred to himself as Macho Man 73, at which time this subject was making several remarks to Damian. Damian told me that the subject was typing in remarks such as he knows that his Mom smokes dope and that he was so skinny that you could hula hoop him through a cheerio. Damian stated that he changed from that chat room and went into a second chat room on the Internet and once again Macho Man 73 let him know that he knew that Damian was at the public library and asked him if he wanted to play truth or dare. Damian stated that he was willing to play that with this subject on the computer at which time the subject told him to go into the boys restroom which was located on the second floor and ask another little boy if he would let him suck his d---. Damian responded back into the computer to Macho Man 73 and stated that he would do it.    I once again asked Damian if what he had done was right or wrong. Damian state[d] that he knew that this was wrong and that he has never approached anybody like this before. I asked Damian then why did he do it this time, to which he responded that it was a dare from the Macho Man 73 guy on the computer and that he just wanted to do it. I then asked Damian what he meant by earlier in the conversation that he was going to the restroom by himself. Damian told me that he was going to the restroom after he had been looking at pornography on the Internet and he would masturbate himself while inside one of the stalls in the restroom. He told [me] that during this two to four hour period while at the library he would go a minimum of two times each visit and masturbate.    -Phoenix Police Department Report, June 29, 1998    Patrons seeking to protect their children in some cases reported meeting with indifference or exasperation from librarians. As one incident report revealed, a patron wrote to the Sacramento Public Library after this experience:    I was at the library with my children ages 7, 10, 12. A child was looking at an Internet file that I felt was not appropriate to view in a public place. On the screen was a photo of a nude woman lying with legs spread. Another person was touching her bottom with his/her tongue. This child's activity was in plain sight of everyone who happened by the computer area or was descending the stairway to the ""kids place."" My children along with others in the area were unwilling subjects to this unsuitable material. When I spoke to the staff person, I was informed that she had no control in this matter, that is was the parent's responsibility to control their children. Unfortunately, the parent of this child did not appear to be in the area at the time.    In another incident report, a patron at the Novi, Minnesota, Public Library wrote to her library about her experience:    On a Saturday afternoon when we visited the library, I observed a young man (around age 12 or 13) sit down at an Internet station. Within a matter of seconds he was viewing full screen, live action, pornography. He changed the screen a few times and viewed a variety of other pornographic material. I notified a librarian who told me ""there's nothing I can do"" and ""this happens all the time. . . . I am especially bothered by the men who come in here to do this.""    Another patron of Timberland Regional Library in Olympia, Washington, wrote:    More and more as I visit the library I see children sitting on the computers looking at very graphic pornography. This time I glanced over and saw a young teen viewing an explicit image and an eight or nine-year-old boy was happily looking over his shoulder. I told the librarian who simply shook her head and said there was nothing she could do about it.    These reactions by the librarians are consistent with how the ALA instructs librarians. A recent ALA pamphlet for librarians, Frequently Asked Internet Questions, addresses the question, ""What do I do when I find a child looking at sexually explicit information online?"" The answer given states: ""Public Libraries do not have policies that restrict the content or use of information provided by the library. Therefore, these policies also protect Internet use.""15    PUBLIC LIBRARIES AS CONDUITS FOR CHILD PORNOGRAPHY    One of the most serious problems with anonymous, unfiltered Internet access is the use of libraries as conduits for the distribution of child pornography. Filtering Facts documented forty-one of these incidents. Many public libraries employ policies that would seem to encourage the illegal transmission of child pornography.    Many public libraries not only have privacy screens, but also destroy patron sign-up sheets after use, and employ computer programs that delete any trace of user activity. These policies make it very difficult for law enforcement to catch pedophiles using public library Internet stations to download child pornography. Indeed, such an anonymous environment of Internet access would seem attractive to pedophiles, since there is little chance their crimes will be traced back to them. At the Multnomah County, Oregon, Public Library and the Los Angeles Central Library, pedophiles have taken advantage of the anonymity to run child pornography businesses using library computers. The Los Angeles Times reported:    A convicted child molester who routinely used computers at the Los Angeles Central Library to collect and distribute child pornography was arrested after planning what he thought would be a sexual liaison with six youngsters-one as young as 3, police said Thursday . . . ""He would go to the library as soon as it opened up and signed up to use each computer on each floor. . . From there he maintained his Web site, while e-mailing and communicating with members of his club. He sent me as many as 300 images of child pornography.""16    The response of librarians to the transmission of child pornography in their libraries at times encourage these activities. Only five of the forty-one (12 percent) incidents of child pornography were reported to the police. Librarians actually observed the child pornography on thirty-three of these occasions reported to Filtering Facts. Among the material librarians described seeing were ""nude pictures of young boys and girls"" (Brevard County, Florida), ""pictures of babies attempting sex"" (Jeffersonville, Indiana), ""pictures of naked little boys,"" (Grand Rapids, Michigan), and a photo that ""showed a child no more than five with a man's penis in her mouth,"" (Olympia, Washington). In one incident report, a patron at the Sunnyvale, California Library complained because the librarian did nothing:    During a visit at the copy machine once I was able to view one of the monitors for the Internet screen. The person was viewing child pornography. I complained tothe library staff and was informed that nothing could be done to stop this. I was very shocked and frustrated!    Some librarians confiscate the material, issue warnings, or bar the patron from the library, as this staff incident report from the San Diego Public Library reveals:    Patron was using the Internet along with 2 young boys. Mr. W. was standing behind them about 8 feet away. Patron turned around and said something to Mr. W., which he could not hear and he moved closer to ask what he said. Patron was verbally abusive to Mr. W. and used foul language. Mr. W. observed that patron was viewing nude pictures of young boys and girls on the Internet and he reported it to library staff. I escorted Mr. W. to another area in the library and returned and asked patron to leave because of his inappropriate use of library equipment. I reminded him that he had been warned several times about this kind of behavior. Patron refused to leave. At this time I told him if he didn't leave voluntarily, I would call the police and have him removed. Patron continued to use the Internet for about 10 more minutes before police arrived. I signed a trespass order against patron.    A staff report from the Skokie, Illinois, Public Library is similar:    Our biggest complaint has been ____. I did approach a man on the reference side who was bringing up pictures of babies attempting sex. I explained that this was inappropriate and we had several children in the building at the time. He said OK, but was trying to download to a disc.    Yet not all librarians are as responsive. At the Sonoma, California, Public Library, a staff member sent an e-mail message to his supervisor stating:    There are 3 men on my shift who come in regularly, perhaps daily. One views child porn of nude boys in tubs. . . . These images are clearly visible. . . . What does it mean to have child molester posters up in our staff lounge & yet we make daily Internet appointments for someone to watch kiddy porn in the library on the library comp? Isn't this crazy?    But the supervisor responded:    I don't like it either, but there is nothing we can do about it. The best thing for staff is to ignore it . . . please use your time in more constructive ways.17    One of the five incidents where the library actually notified police occurred at the Lakewood, Ohio, library. In an account from the Akron Beacon Journal:    But it was the library more than the police and prosecutor that alarmed Chris Link, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio. ""Traditionally, librarians have protected their records of lending activity to the point of being subpoenaed or going to jail,"" she said. But now, she said, ""librarians are scrutinizing what it is you look at and reporting you to the police."" In the case of kiddie porn, Link said, such scrutiny ""would seem to make sense"" until it is viewed in light of the government's history of searches for socialists and communists or members of certain student movements.8    The Callaway County Public Library in Missouri even actively resisted police efforts to investigate a patron accessing child pornography. Library staff refused to cooperate, even when issued subpoenas. The county attorney explained in a letter to the library:    When Fulton police received a report of a man going to the library, accessing the Internet on the library computer, using that library Internet access to view child pornography and then using the library equipment to print out child pornography at the library, an officer went to investigate. The officers and I were shocked that the library through you and Nancy resisted cooperation rather than doing everything you legally could to help.    Finally, the pedophile monitoring group, PedoWatch, has confirmed that on-line pedophiles are telling each other to use public libraries to download child pornography. PedoWatch is ""one of the oldest organizations on the Internet that is working with law enforcement worldwide to remove child pornography and child luring activity,"" and currently works with ""over 125 law enforcement officers"" to monitor the activities of online pedophiles. The director of PedoWatch, Julie Posey, wrote the following in response to a query from Filtering Facts:    Basically what happens out there is that pedophiles on the Internet ""network"" together. It is much like just about any other interest that a person may have. There are mailing lists, message boards, chat rooms and multitudes of other resources that they use. When a particular pedophile finds that the library is a safe secure place to view and download pornography, he shares this information with others with his same interests that he comes in contact with. Some libraries won't allow downloading so that information is passed on too. Remember that beforethere can be child pornography in the first place, there has to be a perpetrator and a victim. I have seen cases where pedophiles on the Internet use the library to talk with children and eventually lure them to have a face-to-face meeting. These children are then molested, photos taken and further exploited when he sends the child's pictures to masses on the Internet.19    ADULTS EXPOSING CHILDREN TO PORNOGRAPHY    There were 106 incidents of adults exposing children to pornography. In most of the incidents, the adult porn surfers appeared simply not to care who was around, even openly viewing pornography in children's departments, on terminals set aside for children. Several reported incidents contained letters from parents describing scenes they witnessed in public libraries:    My fifteen-year-old daughter returned from the library recently, visibly upset, and told me that the computers in the library were being used by patrons to view pornography. She personally observed graphic pictures on the screen and also stated that the computers in the children's section were being used by a minor to participate in an adult chat room.    -Seminole County, Florida, Library    I am writing this letter to inform you of a very real problem that demands yesterday's attention. Specifically, the problem is a blatant abuse of the PC's that have Internet access. I learned last week that my six year old daughter, while walking through the PC area, came across a young man who had movie footage of two men engaged in oral sex displayed on his PC screen. My ex-wife went directly to the front desk and reported this situation. A few minutes later she saw the man leave the library. What type of controls does the library have on the PC's? With all of the filtering devices available through the Net am I to understand one or more of the PC's are not filtered? Let me propose to you a simple solution. Turn the PC's in such a direction that allows the front desk a view of what is displayed on the screens. My other solutions are not quite as constructive.    -Brookfield, Illinois, Public Library    I am so appalled at the pornography displayed on the computers by adult users! My 11 year old son and I were flashed by one of these men with this obscenity on the screen. Why is this not prevented? The look on my son's face was horror!    -Lafayette, Louisiana, Public Library    The man next to my 13 year old daughter was in a party/chat room discussing extremely obscene material via the Internet . . . This man seemed to be very excited during his conversation on the Internet and I was uncomfortable leaving my daughter next to him.    -Orange County, Florida, Public Library    In most states, exposing children to pornography is a crime. Yet not one of these 106 incidents was reported to the police by library staff. Other incidents involved adults actually interacting with children and the use of pornography, as these three library staff incident reports illustrate:    Patron __ used the Internet from 9 to 12:45. He was observed in inappropriate sites, and was also observed showing younger children how to view power rangers on the Internet. Staff member Karen asked him not to allow children to view the Internet, then he was warned by staff member Donna about site[s] which could be construed as pornographic.    -Clermont County, Ohio, Public Library    White male with glasses and straight blond hair with balding on top. Man was ""skinny"" and wearing a white T-shirt. Three young boy[s] (8-9 years old) were waiting to use an Internet workstation. When the man using the workstation finished, he handed a paper to the boys with the following URL: persiankitty.com (see attached). The boys accessed the site and discovered that it was pornographic. They came to the Reference desk and explained the situation to_____ referred them to me. I asked them to repeat their story. According to the boys, the man gave them the paper with the UR[L] and told them, ""Look up this. You'll like it."" I cautioned the boys against talking with strangers. I told them to come to the Reference Desk if someone was bothering or worrying them. I thanked them for telling us about their situation. They didn't want to give their names or telephone numbers.    -Kern County, California, Public Library    A young boy (about 12-13) complained about an adult male who was viewing ""bad pictures"" on the Internet behind the reference desk and that the man was harassing the young boy about doing his homework on the Internet.    -Salt Lake County Public Library    PEDOPHILES LURING CHILDREN THROUGH LIBRARIES    There were five incidents of pedophiles attempting to use the library to molest children. All five cases involved Internet access. The first report was published in the Southwest Arkansas Times:    Jill Michelle Cronk, 26, was charged with third-degree carnal abuse for allegedly fondling a 14-year-old girl she had typed messages to over a lesbian chat line on the Internet. The girl corresponded with the woman on the Internet using a Fort Smith Public Library computer. Cronk, who had talked to the girl over the Internet for about a month, caught a flight to Fort Smith Tuesday afternoon and met the girl at the library branch on Market Trace, detective Cpl. Ron Scamardo said.20    The second report was submitted by staff at the St. Charles, Missouri City-County Library:    Stepmother called me, reported that Josh is 17, has been at Fulton for two years in treatment for sexual offenses. Josh was using their computer at home to view pornographic sites . . . a violation of his treatment plan. . . . She found him at the library and discovered what he was viewing [pornography] and reported it to staff. . . . When I finished my conversation with her he was in the company of a younger boy who looked about 10-years-old. . . . The police were called and discovered outstanding warrants against Josh.    The Charlotte News & Observer supplied the third report:    A Harnett County man has been charged with using the Internet on public terminals at the county library to offer his 7-year-old daughter for sex . . . He was using a free e-mail service to solicit people to have sex with his daughter, officials of the State Bureau of Investigation said. The incidents began in June and continued through October, when the e-mail account was discovered by the man's estranged wife . . . The warrant said the man told his wife he was using computers at the Harnett County Library. The suspect ""had access to numerous libraries and may have been using multiple sources to access his account,"" said Sabrina Currin, a sheriff's detective.21    A fourth case involving a thirteen-year-old boy's attempt to molest a four-yearold after viewing pornography and using a pornographic chartroom in the Phoenix Public Library is described earlier in the section ""Children Accessing Pornography.""    Two incident reports claimed perpetrators exposed themselves in front of children:    We had a report from a mother who had left her child, a girl about 7 years old, alone in the children's room. When she returned the little girl's screen had up a picture of male frontal nudity. There was an adult man sitting next to the girl. After the mother grabbed her child and left the area the little girl told her mother that the man had exposed himself to her. When the mother returned to the children's room the man was gone. The mother did not want to report it to the police.    -Jefferson County, Colorado, Public Library    A mother in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, writes of her daughter's experience at the Broward County Public Library:    In mid-September, I dropped my daughter off at the public library while I attended a morning class. When I picked her up, I could tell something was wrong, but it took her several minutes to tell me what had happened. She told me that she had seen a man sitting at a computer and he was looking at naked women. She then told me that she had seen him touching himself ""down there."" I immediately turned around and went back to the library. My daughter, who is 12-years-old, told me that she went to the information desk right away to report what she had seen, but the library staff member did not call the police. He did a search of the library, determined that the man had left the premises, and asked my daughter if she wanted to fill out an incident report. I spoke with this same library staff member. I told them I wanted the police and campus security called. One of the library staff said there was nothing the police could do, but I insisted that the police be called or I would call them myself. A report was taken by the police, campus security, and the library. My daughter was so traumatized by the incident, that she could not remember her address or phone number, and she had to be hospitalized the next day for post-traumatic stress and suicidal intentions with intent. Later the following week, I learned that this man had come back to the library again, and he was escorted off library property and given a ""no trespass"" warning. The library staff failed to obtain this man's name, address, phone number, or any other identifying information before giving him this warning. I also learned from a staff member, that this man had been reported doing the same thing on six prior occasions without the police being notified. It is the policy of the library that the police not be called for any criminal activity unless directly asked by a patron of the library to notify the police department. My daughter continues to have nightmares about this incident and she is currently in therapy and on medication. At one time, she loved going to the library, now she is terrified to enter the building.    The problem with pedophiles using library computers to lure children has become serious enough that it is even being explicitly mentioned in the terms of supervised release for Internet sex offenders, as this article from The Roanoke Times describes:    A man who called himself ""Dr. Evil"" was sentenced in U.S. District Court Wednesday to 37 months in prison on charges related to his attempt to lure a 13-year-old girl into a sexual encounter. Raymond P. Canupp, 41, of Charlotte, N.C., was also fined $3,000, and must serve three years of supervised release after he leaves prison, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Rusty Fitzgerald of Lynchburg. Canupp, who called himself ""Dr. Evil"" on the Internet, was caught in the BedfordCounty Sheriff's department's cyber sting operation. U.S. District Judge NormanK. Moon prohibited Canupp from owning a computer, possessing a computer, andeven being around a computer with an Internet hookup. ""For instance, he couldn't go to a cyber cafe and sign on and check his e-mail like you and I could,"" Fitzgerald said after the sentencing. The restriction also keeps Canupp away from libraries with online services, he said.22    ADULTS ACCESSING PORNOGRAPHY    The majority of the incidents involved adults. There were 962 incidents of adults accessing pornography. A number of these incidents described adults accessing material, such as bestiality, that could fall under obscenity laws. On twenty-five occasions, library staff reported seeing patrons accessing material the librarians themselves described as obscene. Again, even though accessing and displaying obscenity is a crime, it appears that in none of these incidents were police called. Porn surfing by adults has created such a hostile environment that some patrons no longer feel comfortable in the library, as these three letters from incident reports indicate:    We must also consider that the library should not become a ""hostile environment"" where patrons must guard against accidentally seeing something obscene. The privacy screens only blot out so much. I still recall how uncomfortable I felt six months ago when a younger teenager nervously watched me and everyone else who had walked past him and the computer he was using. Not comprehending his concerned look, I looked back at him and inadvertently saw the word CHEERLEADERS scroll across the screen, and then an image started to appear. I walked on, still being watched. I felt like I was somehow an intruder. Suddenly, after forty years of going to the library, it didn't seem such a safe and friendly place anymore.    -Sno-Isle Library System, Marysville, Washington    I am writing a letter expressing the fact that the public library has now become completely unusable for me and my family. My husband and I went into the public library in Silverdale to look at some house plans on the Internet. I was shocked to look over and see the man next to me looking at pornography. Right in the middle of our public library a man was watching sexually explicit acts. My children will never enter the library again until there is some kind of blocking on this. I will never vote for another library levy again because it is now unusable to me. My children are 8, 10, 12 and have used the library for years. But not again.    -Kitsap Regional Library, Bremerton, Washington    Is there any way you could move the Internet stations outside of the 4th floor study rooms? I am a student who studies here 5 days a week and almost daily the station is occupied by 1 or more men looking at pornographic and violent scenes on the Internet. These men are occasionally loud and they spend time staring into the study rooms while printing out pornography. I'd feel very uncomfortable if the door didn't lock and feel it necessary to bring a cell phone in with me every day.    -Denver Public Library    Library staff also reported they felt these conditions were creating an unsafe or unpleasant work environment, as these staff memos to supervisors show:    Since we do not have a filter system, we do have patrons that pull up pornography, and I tell you, I hate it. I don't care if someone chooses to look at pornography, or to not use that term, nekkid people having sex on the computer screen, in their own home, but please don't expect me to see it in my workplace. It really affects me when I have to go tell someone to remove that site from their screen because it is against policy. I don't mind telling them, but I end up getting a close up view of what they are looking at.    -Public Library of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County, North Carolina    I know this is not the first time I have expressed this, BUT I feel a need to express myself on this issue again. I am personally offended having to work in surroundings where pornography is openly viewed. Today I was photocopying the time sheets and I had a full view of the Internet workstation and could very clearly see 10 feet away what was being viewed. The privacy screens do not work from straight on. They only omit a sidelong view. I thought the info from Project Hope was very interesting in the Commission packet. I especially agree with their points on workstations in the children's area. Thanks for letting me vent.    -Sonoma County, California, Library    Tonight at 5:05 p.m., I confronted a man named____ on Internet #2. He was attempting to hide the screen he was viewing by pulling down the ""Please Sign in at Reference Desk"" sign, and peeking under. I met his gaze, looked at the screen and told him he needed to log off that terminal. There were over 40 windows of pornography open, and I told him to close them. Up at the desk, I informed him that he was no longer able to use the Internet in the library, as he had violated the policy. . . . I'm tired of confronting these men, and I'd be happy to put filters onall PCs.    -Irdell County, North Carolina, Public Library    Other staff memos and incident reports also depict uncomfortable librarians:    Viewing pornographic sites including bondage- naked women in chains. When spoken to, he shut down the site to a point where we couldn't back screen into sites. Jennifer complained that sites made her uncomfortable as she was using the other workstation.    -Saint Charles, Illinois, Public Library District    Patrons are viewing pornography and 1 man took great joy in embarrassing a staff member by leaving a picture of 3 women having sex on the screen and then calling her attention to it. It appears to be the same little group of people who are doing this. The material they are pulling up ranges from the average Playboy centerfold to explicit photographs of genitalia or people having sex. There are also photos of women in degrading situations.    -Kansas City, Kansas, Public Library    Type of Incident: Verbal/Sexual Harassment Date of Incident: Ongoing ___began using Netscape about 3 or 4 weeks ago. He tries to engage in conversation and frequently turns around and looks at me. He found out my name and calls me on a first name basis. He's asked where I live and I didn't tell him. What makes me particularly uneasy is I have to lean over to log him back on. A few times I've noticed him viewing partially clothed women on Netscape, which adds to the awkwardness. . . I'm not going to work the desk when he's there. Claudia and I have discussed this and we have discovered that Mr. ___ is also bothering other    staff discussing the ""only soft-core"" pornographic pictures he is printing out. We are trying to reschedule Claudia's hours so she can avoid him.    -Harford County, Maryland, Public Library    Finally, a group of forty-seven librarians and other library employees of theMinneapolis Public Library published this letter of protest in the Minneapolis Star Tribune:    Every day we, too, are subjected to pornography left (sometimes intentionally) on the screens and in the printers. We do not like it either. We feel harassed and intimidated by having to work in a public environment where we might, at any moment, be exposed to degrading or pornographic pictures.    While the American Library Association (ALA) and our Minneapolis Public Library administration have taken the firm stand that restricting Internet access in any way is unacceptable censorship, most of us working directly with the public disagree. The issue is not one of intellectual freedom, but rather whether obscene material should be publicly displayed. If a Penthouse magazine cover must be kept out of public view in a grocery store should not the same principle apply in a public library?    Compromise solutions do exist, and are being used successfully at other libraries. Sophisticated filters could provide intelligent monitoring on those terminals in high access areas of the library.    Contrary to the ""official"" line of the ALA, filters can be designed to allow searching of topics such as ""breast cancer,"" while at the same time blocking most pornographic sites. And for patrons wanting unrestricted access, a number of nonfiltered terminals could be located in a less-traveled area of the library. With such an arrangement no one's rights would be violated.    Libraries across the country are coming to the realization that they must deal responsibly with the problem of Internet pornography, or permanently lose patrons . . . .    At our reference desks we hear numerous complaints, often from parents with children or teenagers in tow, and many say they are not coming back unless the situation is improved. Yet letters and calls to our director and to the Library Board have gone unheeded.23    Some urban public libraries report that their Internet stations are almost taken over by porn surfers, as this news story shows:    In the Los Angeles Central Library, for instance, the machines are regularly steered to online photos of naked women, digitized videos of sex acts and ribald chat-room discussions. A few patrons even use stolen or made-up credit card numbers to visit pay-per-peep porn sites, according to a browser familiar with the scam. Despite a 30-minute time limit on Internet use at the Los Angeles Library, for example, legitimate researchers sometimes have to wait in line because the machines are tied up by people perusing personal ads or X-rated chat rooms. One of the sex browsers, an 18-year-old college student who declined to be identified (we'll call him Patron X), says he and at least half a dozen friends-plus assorted businessmen and ""street people""-routinely cruise the Central Library Internet for porn. That last part, computer-savvy homeless people, might seem hard to imagine, but Patron X says they're ""really good at this. . . . We trade secrets."" One of the most prized tricks: finding Internet sites that post credit-card-number formulas that can be used to get into live-action Web sites where customers must pay up to $10 a minute to type instructions to a stripper and watch her perform as requested.24    There were thirteen incidents where library users were engaged in public masturbation. Nine of these were adults, and four were children. (For details, see the previous section on ""Children Accessing Pornography."") Most of these incidents would violate state laws against indecent exposure or public lewdness. Once again, police were seldom called.    The Broward County, Florida, Library recorded four separate incidents of public masturbation, and only saw fit to bar a single user from the building. The records detail the following occurrences:    Masturbation while viewing porn sites. Main Library-RIS (3rd floor). Fort Lauderdale Police Officer on the scene. Sergeant___ approached me about a young man using the computers who was viewing porn sites. Patron had been escorted out the library earlier this week by an officer(?). I approached the young man to investigate the report. The young man was sitting at the computer masturbating. I called his attention to his action and he instead continued. Sergeant ___ then told him to leave. Sergeant ___ warned him not to return to this library or risk being arrested for trespassing. Sgt. ___ told him not to come on the property as well.    I was coming back from a break at 3:45 and ___ informed me that she had just called security due to an incident with a patron. ____ said that as she was escorting an elderly lady to the medical reference index table, she saw this young man watching a Java script movie of a man masturbating. ___ asked him to get off the web site. She went back to check a second time and she said the patron this time had his hands in his pants and continued to be in the unauthorized web site. Security escorted the patron outside the building. The defendant was given a verbal trespass warning on July 9th, 1998 by this officer after being asked by library staff to leave the library after he was observed looking at sexually explicit material and at the time of contact he appeared to be fondling himself. Subject had at that time his pants unbuttoned which was observed by librarian. Subject ___ continually re-enters library and did so today and was subsequently arrested.    Other library staff reported similar masturbation incidents:    This man is a regular user of Internet IP station where he views sites that feature female nudity. Frequently this man places his hand in his pants and has been observed doing this during the past several weeks. Today I approached him and asked that he not place his hand in his pants, stating that it was inappropriate behavior. I asked if he understood what I was saying-he shook his head ""yes"" but made no other communication.    -Highland Park, Illinois, Public Library    Just after we had opened a patron wanted to use the reference dept superstation. I walked over to the computer and noticed a condom lying right by the keyboard. It was not in a package and appeared to have been used. I had worked the evening before and had been the one to shut down the computer. If the condom would have been there then, I'm sure I would've noticed. I grabbed a handful of tissues and picked it up and threw it away. Then I sprayed cleaner on the area and wiped it up and apologized to the patron who had witnessed the whole thing.    -Kansas City, Kansas, Public Library    A regular customer told me he was working on computer #3 and the man next to him at #2 was masturbating. I approached the person and said we had a complaint and please remember that you are in a public place where the nude pictures on the screen might offend others. Person left a few minutes later.    -Ann Arbor, Michigan, Public Library    As I was walking in at the start of my shift, the librarian on duty took me to the back to tell me that the person we caught masturbating before was here and doing it again. I walked around the computer stations and noticed patron had a pornographic image up on the screen and was looking around very nervously. After watching for a few minutes I could see movement of the left hand which appears to be masturbation. So I approached patron and let it be known that that kind of behavior is against the library rules of behavior and that the library will not tolerate it. I told patron to leave and not to re-enter for another month. I took acopy of library ID and handed patron a copy of the rules of behavior.    -Ann Arbor. Michigan, Public Library    Today one of our long time porno viewers got out of hand. He was viewing some porno and masturbating. J.____ and I both agreed-it was obvious in many ways. Marlene ___ advised me to call after we discussed it. 6 month T.W. issued-no further incident.    -Orlando, Florida Public Library    This Indiana patron filed a similar complaint:    I have seen a man bring up teen porn with pictures of totally naked guys on the screen and rub himself in the genital region while viewing this. Children from the age group of 7 on up were in the Reference Dept during this time, including my 2 daughters. This incident happened 11/5/98 between 7-8 PM. I informed the librarian at the desk and she then informed the man that he had to get off of the Internet. I have seen this same man bring up Internet sites with pictures of naked men on other occasions.    -Michigan City, Indiana, Public Library    THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM    How extensive a problem is the viewing of pornography in public libraries? This is a difficult question to answer, because no scientific studies have ever been conducted addressing what public library patrons access on the Internet. When the author testified before the National Commission on Library and Information Science in December 1998, he requested that both the National Commission and the ALA conduct such studies.25 The request was ignored.    The 2,062 documented incidents in this report only tell a small part of the story. Only 29 percent of the public library systems in the country even responded to requests for information about the use of pornography, and these reports include only those incidents for which there was documentation that the library was willing to provide.    Actual measurements of Internet access in public libraries strongly suggest a much bigger problem than is reflected by the incident reports themselves. Internet access log-files from public libraries suggest that between 0.5 percent and 2.5 percent of public library Internet access is pornographic. Five public libraries took actual sampling data of what library patrons were accessing, based on logs generated by filtering or monitoring software. Three of these libraries also recorded the number of incidents, defined as a unique Internet session where a patron accessed or attempted to access blocked material. For a complete discussion of how this data was gathered and analyzed, see Appendix A.    Public Library Number of Annual Incidents Percent of Sites Classified as  Pornographic  Chicago Public Library N/A* 5.00  Tacoma Public Library 1,764 (actual) 0.95  Cincinnati Public Library 30,159 (attempted)** 0.53  Kalamazoo Public Library N/A* 0.50  Dayton Public Library 14,358  (actual & attempted)*** 0.36      * Gathered using monitoring software. No actual filtering took place.    ** Based on a 52-day sample. All recorded accesses were blocked.    *** Adults may override the filter. It is unknown how many blocks were overridden, or the content of the sites blocked.    The wide variation among libraries is almost certainly the result of different polices and procedures. The Chicago Public Library has unfiltered, unmonitored Internet access from workstations equipped with privacy screens. The Cincinnati Public Library has completely filtered workstations with no privacy screens and a monitoring policy. Tacoma and Dayton have ""partial filtering."" Dayton allows adults to override blocked sites; Tacoma displays blocked sites, but deletes all images. Kalamazoo has a monitoring ""tap on the shoulder"" policy.    Estimating the percentage of Internet use devoted to pornography in public libraries nationwide is problematic based on this sampling, for a number of reasons. The sample size, five, is small and is composed disproportionately of urban libraries. Urban libraries are thought to have higher incident rates because of the greater degree of personal anonymity than in smaller communities. Three of the five (60 percent) have partial or total filtering, compared to just 15 percent nationwide.26 Total or partial filtering obviously decreases the number of incidents.    Kalamazoo, Michigan, probably comes the closest to representing a typical public library. Located in the Midwest, it serves a medium-sized population (116,000) and has a ""tap on the shoulder"" policy where porn surfers are instructed to stop if seen. The percentage of pornographic web sites accessed (0.5 percent) may be typical for similar libraries.27 Other libraries, like Chicago, employ ""privacy screens,"" which no doubt encourage porn surfing, and likely record much higher rates, such as Chicago's 5 percent. These urban libraries with lax Internet policies make up a large chunk of the nation's thirty-nine thousand public library Internet terminals.28    Therefore, an estimate of between 0.5 percent and 2.5 percent of Internet use in public libraries is probably for pornographic purposes. This might sound trivial, and indeed the Chicago Public Library even stated that its own pornography rate of 5 percent ""allows us to paint the far-right agenda as much ado about not very much.""29 Yet when one considers--based on state statistics of annual Internet sessions- America's public libraries had approximately 82 million Internet sessions last year, the problem is not trivial.30 This would indicate an annual incident rate of between four hundred thousand and 2 million.    This suggests massive underreporting of incidents, and indeed comparison of the number of incidents written in incident reports and patron complaints to incidents recorded in log files strongly supports this conclusion:    Library Number of Written Incidents* Number of Annual  Log Incidents  Cincinnati, Ohio** 14 30,159  (Since January 1996) (attempted)   Dayton, Ohio*** 0 14,358  (actual & attempted)  Tacoma, Washington 8 1,764 (actual)      * An incident in a library computer log is defined as a single unique Internet session.    ** Based on a 52-day sample. All recorded accesses were blocked.    *** Adults may override the filter. It is unknown how many blocks were overridden, or the content of the sites blocked.    * * * * *    THE SOLUTION    The nature of the incidents and their volume speak for themselves. No further commentary is needed to highlight the seriousness of the problems open access to obscenity, child pornography, and material harmful to minors is causing in the nation's public libraries. It is to be hoped that this report will finally move the discussion beyond ""Is there a problem?"" to ""What is the solution?"" Public libraries have attempted a number of ways to address the pornography problem, but practical solutions revolve around picking one of two options: monitoring patrons or filtering Internet access.    WHY CURRENT INTERNET POLICIES DO NOT WORK    Most public libraries have an Internet policy. These policies range from terse statements about the library not being responsible, to detailed rules of behavior. A common policy is the so called ""tap on the shoulder"" policy, where library staff monitors use and gives a ""tap on the shoulder"" to anyone seen viewing pornography. As these library staff incident reports illustrate, this leads to a game of ""hide and seek"" with porn surfers:    He's here at the Internet! Just wanted to alert you. Someone said that he's getting quite slick. He goes back and forth between innocuous and offensive screens quickly if he thinks someone is looking. And he doesn't appreciate librarians behind him.    -St. Louis County, Missouri, Library    I just closed out another computer with a long list of porno sites. My problem with this man is that he always comes at lunchtime and goes to one of the computers down on the end (6 or 7). I noticed once before that he'd been viewing porno, so I tried to catch him today. But he knows how to toggle out by the time I get all they way down there. If I stand at a computer nearby he watches me until I leave. Then (after he leaves) I find this string of ""objectionable"" sites. Because our schedule varies, I'm not usually assigned in here at lunchtime. Should I pass this info along to the rest of the staff (or to the lunchtime person) so someone can try to catch him? Or should I consider this confidential information? (I hate having to deal with this stuff.)    -Medina County, Ohio, District Library    Reported that she had been working in a study carrel near the Internet terminals for approximately 2 hours. During that time she witnessed a male child, approximately 11 years in age, accessing adult-oriented web sites at Internet station #3. When she would walk past him, he would quickly switch to another screen. The patron reported having seen staff stroll past a couple of times.    -Skokie, Illinois, Public Library    I found him looking at a site titled ""Farm Sex."" As I approached, he must have sensed my coming because he clicked out. I told the reference desk what I saw and as I walked back toward the machine on the screen was another ""Farm Sex"" site with a photograph of a woman lying in the hay legs spread apart. When I got closer, I heard him mutter ""oh my gosh."" I told him that we had a talk yesterday about this same subject. He kept saying he didn't know how he got to these sites. After he left I looked in history and the site he was looking at was www.wilma.farmsex.net with several web sites listed beneath. This seems like a big waste of time for us to constantly monitor someone's Internet session for inappropriate material, especially when the sign says ""Research Only."" In my opinion, if we see someone looking at things that are not research related, they should not be using the machine.    -Davis County Library, Farmington, Utah    While police more often were called for the most serious type of crimes, such as attempted molestations, nearly all other crimes went unreported, as the chart below illustrates:    Crime Number Documented Number Reported to Police Percent Reported to Police  Accessing Child  Pornography 41 5 12      Accessing  Obscenity 25 0 0      Exposing  Children to  Porn 106 0 0      Public  masturbation  fondling 13 1 8      Total 172 6 3.5      Often sexual perpetrators in libraries do face consequences for their behaviors, but in comparison to arrest, they are trivial, as these library staff incident reports illustrate:    Viewing pornography. __ reported him to me. He said he had just clicked there. I was about to believe him when a print of a very inappropriate picture came out of the printer. I then looked at the stack he printed. All were of pornographically obscene subjects. I confiscated and tore them up. Please talk to and ban for 30 days.    -Rockford, Illinois, Public Library    Offense by patron displaying material reasonably construed to be obscene. 2nd offense = banned for 60 days. 3rd offense = banned forever.    -Delphos, Ohio, Public Library    _____ was in on Saturday afternoon. Enclosed are cover sheets of what he was viewing on the Internet and printing (www.hotpeep.com, www.bizar.com). Not only was he viewing inappropriate web sites, but he was doing so while sitting next to a girl who was about 11 years old. I explained to him the policy and asked him if he thought what he was looking at was appropriate viewing for the young girl sitting next to him. He did not answer.    -DeKalb County, Georgia, Public Library    Patron who had been previously warned about using the Internet to access pornography came in at about 12:45. Staff began to keep an eye on what he was doing and at about 1:45 I saw him looking at child pornography. I told him his search was inappropriate and that I was going to need to file an incident report about this. He said ""OK."" The name he gave me was ___. (I asked him to spell the last name.) He then immediately left the building. . . . Could find no patron record under the name he provided.    -Salt Lake City, Utah, Library    We reprimand maybe one person a month [for viewing obscene material]. Two reprimands and your Internet privileges are revoked for a month. Three and they're revoked permanently. We've only had to do this twice, and both the patrons were adult men who were accessing kiddy porn. This is illegal, so we probably should have called the cops.    -Tuscarawas County, Ohio, Public Library    Sexual perpetrators who frequent public libraries probably are aware that they run a low risk of apprehension in when 96.5 percent of the time the worst consequence they face if caught committing their criminal acts is being escorted from the library.    While some public libraries fail to inform the police of more serious crimes, one library saw fit to have this woman arrested, as reported in American Libraries:    Beverly Goldman, 24, was arrested January 13 for failing to appear in court after being charged with not returning seven children's books and videotapes she had checked out more than 16 months ago from Clearwater, Florida Public Library. Before taking her into custody, police allowed Goldman, who is seven months pregnant, to see her five- and six-year-olds off to school. She spent eight hours in jail before friends and relatives posted bail, and the library dropped charges after Goldman's family promised to pay the $127.86 she owed for the items, according to the January 14 Miami Herald.75    FILTERING SOFTWARE    Filters are much maligned because of their reputation for supposedly blocking innocent sites, particularly AIDS sites, gay sites, and breast-cancer sites. Yet the evidence suggests that the number of sites blocked accidentally by filters is extremely small. Several reports by the group Censorware Project each revealed only a few dozen or hundred wrongly blocked sites, out of millions of individual web sites.76 A 1998 survey of twenty-four public library administrators who used filters found that public libraries that filter receive only 1.6 complaints per month about wrongly blocked sites.77 The Memphis Public Library recently installed filtering software, and after several months reported problems were ""a nonevent"":    In a report given to the commission's education and libraries committee, [City Librarian Judith] Drescher stated, ""Since installation, the library has received no requests from the public to review and block a site. Library staff has submitted five sites for review, all of which were blocked.""78    Until now, there had been no actual data gathered from filters in public libraries and analyzed to examine the nature of web sites blocked from library patrons.    The data obtained from the Tacoma, Washington, Public Library and the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County support the other evidence gathered by the Censorware Project and Filtering Facts in the conclusion that the amount of innocent speech being blocked is indeed extremely small. (See Appendix A.) In Tacoma, 1,853 web-page accesses were inappropriately blocked out of 2,510,460 web pages accessed, or 0.07 percent. In Cincinnati, only 1485 files were inappropriately blocked out of 14,376,211 total files accessed, about 0.01 percent. Clearly, all the evidence to date indicates that the problem of filters blocking legitimate information is indeed extremely small.    Opponents of filtering sometimes argue that children using filtered Internet access will be at a competitive disadvantage because they will be denied crucial information. Children will become pregnant and catch venereal diseases because they were denied sexual education information. Gay teenagers will commit suicide because they will be unable to reach out to fellow gay teens on the Internet. Yet millions of children are required to use filters in public school settings, and there is not one confirmed instance that any of these things have happened.79 Of all the millions of children who rely on filtered Internet access in the home and in school, no child has committed suicide, become pregnant, contracted a disease, flunked a class, or even gotten a bad grade on a paper because they were required to use a filter. There is not one shred of evidence to suggest that any person has ever been meaningfully harmed in any way by being required to use filters.    All of these imaginary problems are in contrast to the many real, well documented incidents of real harm being inflicted on children by unfiltered Internet access in public libraries. Children are being accosted with porn, propositioned by pedophiles, and having their innocence stripped away even further in an already too grown up world. The failure of librarians to control these problems supports the appropriateness of laws requiring filtering software.    APPENDIX A    LIBRARY LOG ANALYSES    TACOMA PUBLIC LIBRARY    The Tacoma, Washington, Public Library supplied one-year's worth of blocked and unresolved web site accesses in 1,020 printed pages covering the period of July 1, 1998, through June 30, 1999. Analysis revealed 1,764 individual users sessions where patrons accessed commercial pornography sites. Patrons accessed 22,364 partially blocked websites, which accounted for .9 percent of all web pages. Nonsexual sites and DejaNews, a mega-site with a significant amount of pornographic content, being blocked accounted for 0.07 percent. In other words, 99.93 percent of the time the filter functioned properly.    Data Supplied by the Tacoma Public Library. The Tacoma Public Library has an unusual form of filtering. All access is screened by the filter, Cyber Patrol. But rather than placing a message on the screen saying ""blocked by Cyber Patrol,"" the library has a customized web browser that launches a text-only browser when a blocked website is encountered, to allow the viewer to read the text.    A sample entry in the Tacoma log looks like this: IC102 1999/06/15 15:51:51 16:11:54 PID BLOCKED. The first number, IC102 represents the workstation number. The second represents the date, the third the time that the logged session began ""15:51:51,"" the fourth the time of the blocked access, ""16:11:54,"" the message BLOCKED, and finally, the address of the website.    This information was used to determine the number of blocked sites, the number of separate incidents of accessing pornography, and the content of the blocked sites.    Number of Separate Incidents. Each page of the log files was scanned to identify separate incidents of patrons viewing pornography. A ""separate incident"" was defined as a unique user session from a unique station number, separated by at least two hours from any previous incident on the same workstation. Only commercial pornography sites were examined, so this left out hundreds of sexually related web sites that were not commercial pornography sites. There were a total of 1,764 of these incidents, compared to eight incidents for which there was written documentation, meaning that for every documented incident in Tacoma, more than two hundred went unreported.    Number of Blocked Web Sites. The number of blocked web sites was determined by taking a random sample of ten pages from each month of logs, for a total of 120 pages out of 1,020 or 11.76 percent. Based on the sample, 22,364 web pages were blocked during the year out of 2,510,460 total web pages accessed, or 0.9 percent.    Content of Blocked Web Sites. The bulk of the blocked sites were outright commercial pornography sites, and sexually explicit sites either not selling anything or featuring simple nudity or explicit sexual discussions. The nonsexual sites were composed mostly of one web site, www.dejanews.com. The blocking of DejaNews, a complete archive of Usenet posting has been controversial. The makers of Cyber Patrol claim they must block the entire site in order to block the numerous and explicit sexual discussion groups where pornographic pictures are exchanged. Apparently the library thought it too valuable a resource to completely block, as it disappears from the block logs in October, when the library apparently unblocked it.    Commercial Pornography Sites      Sexually Explicit Sites      Dead Links      Nonsexual Sites    and DejaNews    Number 12,385 6,180 1,947 1,853      Percent 55 28 9 8      CINCINNATI/HAMILTON COUNTY PUBLIC LIBRARY    The Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County, Ohio, supplied fifty-two days' worth of computer server logs that recorded attempts to access web sites blocked by the filter, ""Bess."" From July 27, 1999, to September 16, 1999, the logs recorded patrons attempting to access files, including images, from blocked web sites 76,570 times in at least 5,055 separate incidents.    Analysis of the blocked web sites indicates this represents at least 4,297 separate incidents where patrons attempted to access approximately 14,878 pornographic web pages over fifty-two days. Further analysis of the content of the blocked web sites showed that only 2 percent of the blocked sites were nonsexual in nature, and that this accounted for only 0.01 percent of all web accesses-or that 99.99 percent of the time the filter did not block innocent sites.    Data Supplied by the Cincinnati Library. The library system employs a filtering server computer that centrally handles all Internet requests. The filtering server is called Bess and is supplied by a Seattle company, N2H2. Every day Bess generates a group of summary statistics describing total Internet activity, along with attempts to access blocked sites. The summary includes nineteen different statistics, such as ""Search Engine Requests"" and ""Total Bytes."" Five of the nineteen statistics were examined to determine the amount of Internet requests that were blocked by the filter, the content of the requests being blocked, and estimations of how many web pages and individualsessions this represented. An abbreviated example of a daily server log is shown below:    Bess Proxy Server Statistics for Thursday, September 16, 1999      Total Requests: 308,870  HTML Requests: 77,734  Total Blocked Requests: 849 (0.27 percent)  Unique Blocked Clients: 115  Top Thirty Blocked URLs:  (39 / 5 percent) stats.hitbox.com/buttons/hitbox.  com0.gif  (28 / 3 percent) www.cyberlounge.com/dc.gif  (21 / 2 percent) www.partyhouse.com/banners/kara/  kasmod2f.gif           Top Thirty Blocked Domains:  (82 / 10 percent) stats.hitbox.com  (79 / 9 percent) www.partyhouse.com  (38 / 4 percent) www.xxx500.com      _ __Total Requests represents the total number of all web-related files, such as html pages, as well as gif and jpg image files requested by Internet users.    _ __HTML Requests represents the total number of html files, or individual web pages, requested by Internet users. The ratio of Total Requests to HTML Requests was 3.87.    _ __Total Blocked Requests represents the total of all Internet requests, including images, blocked by the filter. This indicates that Total Blocked Requests exaggerates the total number of web pages blocked by 3.87 times.    _ __Unique Blocked Clients represents the number of individual workstations from which Internet requests were blocked. A minimum number of unique user sessions where there were attempts to access blocked files can be drawn from this figure.    _ __Top Thirty Blocked URLs represents the thirty most often blocked Internet files. The majority of these blocked files are jpg and gif image files. The numbers to the right of the URL of each blocked file, such as (39 / 5 percent), represent the number of times that file was blocked on that day, and the percentage of total blocked files it represents.    _ __Top Thirty Blocked Domains represents the thirty most frequently blocked Internet domains or highest level web site addresses. This information was less useful than Top Thirty Blocked URLs, since the files being blocked were sometimes several directory levels down from the top of domain. For example, Top Thirty Blocked Domains would report the file www.angelfire.com/in2/exoticbikini/images/nl.gif being blocked as simply www.angelfire.com. Therefore, the content of Top Thirty Blocked URLs was analyzed rather than Top Thirty Blocked Domains.    Summary of the Statistics. Total numbers for four of the statistics for each of the fifty-two days were compiled in a manner displayed in the table on the next page:    Total Requests HTML Requests Total Blocked Requests Percent Blocked Unique Blocked Clients  14,376,211 3,717,383 76,570 0.53% 5,055    Total Requests were divided by HTML Requests to determine the ratio of total requests to actual web pages, 3.87. Applying this ratio to Total Blocked Requests indicates that approximately 19,837 actual web pages were blocked during the fifty-two days.    The 5,055 Unique Blocked Clients means that on at least 5,055 separate occasions users were blocked from accessing files. This almost certainly understates the number of separate occasions, since there were likely multiple incidents from the same workstation on the same day.    Each of the 1,500 URLs supplied in the Top Thirty Blocked URLs were analyzed for content. The total number of occurrences of blocked URLs that could be identified through the Top Thirty Blocked URLs statistic was 35,701. This represents 47 percent of the 76,570 Total Blocked Requests, and there is no reason to assume that this does not reasonably reflect the content of all blocked accesses. The number of times each URL was blocked was added to determine the totals for each content area. Some URLs were blocked hundreds of times. The complete data is contained in this table:    Commercial Pornography Sites  Sexual Sites  Dead Links  Undetermined  Nonsexual Sites  Total      Number 26,695 3,381 2,254 2,639 732 35,701  Percent 76 9 6 7 2 100      Analysis of Blocked Websites         Content of Blocked Web Sites. Every URL listed in the Top Thirty Blocked URLs statistic was checked for content. There were 1,500 separate entries, although a number of the URLs were listed multiple times.    Each URL was examined, along with the main domain home page and the immediate directory web pages.    For example, www.partyhouse.com/banners/kara/ kasmod2f.gif was examined, along with the main domain home page, www.partyhouse.com, and the immediate directory web pages in www.partyhouse. com/banners/kara. A determination was made as to which category the blocked portion of the web site belonged.    Commercial Pornography Sites were sites that: 1) featured ""Adults Only"" type warnings somewhere on the site, and 2) were engaged in selling pornographic photographs, text, or chat rooms. Examples of this type of site were xx.fsn.net, ""The Fetish Sex Network,"" and www.slut-o-rama.com.    Sexual Sites were either non-commercial pornography sites, sites that depicted nudity in a casual or artistic way, or sites that featured explicit sexual discussions. Examples of this type of site were energy4life.com and www.chocolatebikini.com both of which featured mild nudity.    Undeterminable URLs were portions of sites that served images or banners to meta-sites, and the directory or sub-page where the image was serving was notdeterminable. The majority of these URLs were from the meta-site www.geocities.com, which features thousands of individual user home pages, and serves these sites with image files such as www.geocities. com/toto?s=19190030.    Dead Links were sites or relevant portions of sites that returned a ""not found"" or ""error"" message.    Nonsexual Sites were sites that had no explicit sexual content at all. This included sites such as www.dylanology.com, a site devoted to Bob Dylan and www.defendoor.com, a door security product.    Number of Incidents. Because the logs do not link each access with an individual workstation, it is not possible to precisely determine how may separate incidents occurred. However, Bess records the Unique Blocked Clients statistic for the number of individual workstations where a blocked attempt occurred. The total number of Unique Blocked Clients for the fifty-two days was 5,055. Assuming that at least 85 percent of blocks were sexual or from commercial pornography sites, this translates into an estimate of at least 4,297 separate incidents where patrons attempted to access pornography. Since more than one session involving an attempt to access a blocked site almost certainly occurred on the same workstations, this number understates the total number of incidents.    Conclusions. The sample of 47 percent of all blocked URLs analyzed revealed only 732 times where a patron encountered a wrongly blocked site. This would translate into about 1,485 wrongly blocked accesses out of 14,376,211 total accesses, about 0.01 percent. What this means is that 99.99 percent of the time the filter blocked no innocent sites, and that the chance of a patron encountering a wrongly blocked site is about one in ten thousand.    Patrons at the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County made significant attempts to access hard-core pornography and obscenity through the Internet. While 0.53 percent of all web accesses may not sound significant, this translates into thousands of separate incidents in only a two month period, many of which very likely involved the illegal transmission of obscenity.    The fact that during the testing the library had complete filtering on all terminals and no privacy screens certainly decreased attempts to access pornographic web sites. It is worth noting that another large urban library system in the Midwest, the Chicago Public Library, performed a similar test during a similar period, the summer of 1999. The Chicago Public Library has unfiltered access and privacy screens, and its logs show 5 percent of access to be pornographic, or ten times the levels recorded by the Cincinnati library.    On December 12, 1999, the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County changed its policy to allow adults to have unfiltered Internet access at workstations that employ privacy screens. One of the sites patrons attempted to access hundreds of times was http://soiroom.hyperchat.com/rapfan, a ""Rape Fantasy"" chat room. On one day alone, August 8, 1999, there were 225 separate attempts to access this site. The most likely conclusion is that all 225 attempts were made by a lone individual compulsively trying to reach the ""Rape Fantasies"" chat room. Assuming this individual is an adult, he is now free to use the Cincinnati library to act out his ""Rape Fantasies.""    DAYTON/MONTGOMERY COUNTY PUBLIC LIBRARY    The Dayton and Montgomery County Public Library supplied seventeen months worth of computer server log daily summaries that recorded attempts to access web sites blocked by the filter Bess. A total of 342 days worth of log summaries were usable. From June 4, 1998, to October 24, 1999, the logs recorded patrons attempting to access files, including images, from blocked web sites 248,589 times in at least 14,358 separate incidents. Adults at the Dayton library have the ability by entering their patron barcodes to override the filter and look at anything they want. Unfortunately, only summary statistics were provided, so the content of the blocked web sites was unavailable for analysis, and there is no log of how often the filter was overridden.    Data Supplied by the Dayton Public Library. The Dayton and Montgomery County Public Library employs a filtering server computer that centrally handles all Internet requests. The filtering server, Bess, is supplied by a Seattle company, N2H2. Only 342 of the daily logs were usable, because many of the daily logs contained only partial information. Every day Bess generates a group of summary statistics describing total Internet activity, along with attempts to access blocked sites. The summary includes nineteen different statistics, such as ""Search Engine Requests"" and ""Total Bytes."" Five of the statistics were examined to determine the amount of Internet requests that were blocked by the filter and estimations of how many web pages and individual sessions this represented. An abbreviated example of a daily server log is shown below:    Date Total Request HTML Request Total Blcked Requests  1-Jun-98 157,185 40,294 333      Percent Blocked Requests Unique Blocked URLs Clients UniqueBlocked  0.0021 189 41    __ _Total Requests represents the total number of all web-related files, such as html pages, as well as gif and jpg image files requested by Internet users.    __ _HTML Requests represents the total number of html files, or individual web pages, requested by Internet users. The ratio of Total Requests to HTML Requests was 3.99.    _ __Total Blocked Requests represents the total of all Internet requests, including images, blocked by the filter. This indicates that Total Blocked Requests exaggerates the total number of web pages blocked by approximately 3.99 times.    _ __Unique Blocked Clients represents the number of individual workstations from which Internet requests were blocked. A minimum number of unique user sessions where there were attempts to access blocked files can be drawn from this figure.    Summary of the Statistics. Total numbers for four of the five statistics for the 342 days are shows below:    Total Requests HTML Requests Total Blocked Requests Percent Blocked Unique Blocked Clients  69,032,300 17,289,865 248,589 0.36% 14,358    Total Requests were divided by HTML requests to determine the ratio of total requests to actual web pages, 3.99. Applying this ratio to Total Blocked Requests indicates that approximately 62,303 actual web pages were blocked during the 342-day period.    The 14,358 Unique Blocked Clients means that on at least 14,358 separate occasions users were blocked from accessing files. This almost certainly understates the number of separate occasions, since there were likely multiple incidents from the same workstation on the same day.    Number of Incidents. Because the logs do not link each access with an individual workstation, it is not possible to determine precisely how may separate incidents occur. However, Bess records the Unique Blocked Clients statistic for the number of individual workstations where a blocked attempt occurred. The total number of Unique Blocked Clients for the 342 days was 14,358. Since more than one session involving an attempt to access a blocked site almost certainly occurred on the same workstations, this number understates the total number of incidents.    * * * * *    ABOUT THE FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL    Founded in 1981, the Family Research Council is an independent, non-profit education and research organization dedicated to ensuring that the interests of the family are considered and respected in the formation of public policy.

General Policy Statement    The Tacoma Public Library, an agency of the City of Tacoma, operating according to the Public Library Laws of the State of Washington under the management and control of its Board of Trustees, affirms the following objectives for the selection of materials.    To select, assemble, and make available to the public informational, educational, and recreational materials; to preserve materials which possess historic interest or worth; to assist in the development of an enlightened citizenry; to encourage self-education; and to promote and provide materials necessary for an enriched personal life. Tacoma Public Library makes its materials available for the purposes named above to all persons regardless of their age, sex, religion, race, origin, political views, social or economic status.    B. Intellectual Freedom    The Library subscribes fully to the American Library Association's Freedom to Read Statement (Appendix 1) and the Library Bill of Rights (Appendix 2).    C. Responsibility for Selection    Ultimate responsibility for selection of materials rests with the Library Director, operating within policies determined by the Library's Board of Trustees. The Director delegates the responsibility for selection of library materials to members of the staff.    D. Policy by Clientele    1. Adult    Adults who use the collection of materials at Tacoma Public Library are defined in age as being over 14 years old. They are men and women of all races and beliefs with widely differing tastes and needs. Materials selected for this diverse group of people include those of a recreational nature and cover the widest possible range of interests and reading levels.    2. Young Adults    Young adults (generally aged 12 through 18) will have materials specially selected to meet the particular recreational, emotional and informational concerns of this age group and will also be served from the general collection. Those materials which will help young adults understand themselves and others, broaden their viewpoints and knowledge of the world, stimulate their curiosity, expend their reading ability and enjoyment, and guide them in the transition from children's materials to adult materials are preferred.    3. Children    Children (generally preschool through age 12) are recognized as creative, inquiring individuals with unique capacities for intellectual and emotional growth. Materials are chosen to meet their diverse interests and needs but the resources of the entire Library are accessible to them. Materials for children are selected with the realization that they are an integral part of the total Library collection and are judged by the same criteria which apply to adult materials.    4. Disabled    The individuals in this group are not able to utilize materials published in the usual format. This inability is coupled with an interest in becoming an aware and informed person and in finding sources of educational and recreational materials. The library will meet the information needs of the group to the fullest extent possible, within budgetary constraints, and will refer individuals to other agencies equipped to meet a specialized need.    E. Policy by Collection Type    1. General Collection    a. Fiction    Novels will be purchased for the following  purposes:      1) To satisfy the need for recreational reading materials for persons of differing tastes, interests, purposes and reading skills.    2) To serve as educational tools and to enrich human understanding by dealing informatively with social, personal, racial, ethnic, or religious situations.    Since it is not possible to set up a standard of literary quality which will apply to all novels, the Library uses the following considerations as a guide when selecting fiction:    1) Is the novel competently written?    2) Does the novel has constructive and plausible characterizations?    3) Does the novel give an honest portrayal of the human experiences with which it deals""    4) Does the book contribute to the collection balance in regard to (a) types and styles of literature, (b) subjects treated, and (c) patron appeal?    Other selection considerations are:    5) A collection of standard and classic novels will be maintained as determined by long standing community needs and/or listing in an authoritative bibliography.    6) A collection of mysteries, science fiction, westerns and light romances will be maintained.    7) Experimental novels, while often controversial, will be considered for purchase as they reflect new trends, and styles of expression.    8) Books written about the Pacific Northwest or with the Pacific Northwest as a setting will be especially considered for purchase.    9) Books written obviously and exclusively for sensational or pornographic purposes will not be chosen, but the Library will not exclude a title because of objectionable language or vivid description of sex or violence if the author is dealing honestly and realistically with his/her theme. The Library recognizes that any given title may offend some persons; however, selections will not be made on the basis of any anticipated approval or disapproval; but solely on the merits of the work in relation to the collection, the Library's objectives, and the interest of the readers.    b. Non Fiction    The selection of circulating adult non-fiction materials will reflect the current needs, interests, and activities of the adult borrower. In addition to the materials selected which have been demonstrated to be of practical value to many adults, the Library will also select materials of a more specialized technical nature which experience has shown are required to meet the informational needs of some adult borrowers. Materials of a lighter vein are provided for entertainment purposes. This collection will contain materials of a wide variety of topics, levels of sophistication and treatment reflecting the needs and interests of the adult who uses the Tacoma Public Library.    Although the branch libraries are expected to maintain sufficient circulating materials of interest and use to their patrons, the Main Library will endeavor to act as a backup source of the entire system. To fulfill this function, the Main Library will select materials of sufficient quantity, variety and of a more specialized nature to supplement the branch collections.    Other criteria for the selection of non-fiction may include the following:    1) Purpose of item  2) Audience for whom intended  3) Reputation of the author  4) Quality of writing and visual art presented  5) Indexed in Library-owned materials  6) Insufficient material in subject area  7) Popular demand  8) Reputation of the publisher  9) Format of the material, its durability and quality of production  10) Accuracy of information presented  11) Special features in the book: Plates, Indexes, Tables, etc.  12) Not available elsewhere in the community  13) Price  14) Reviews in selection aids  15) Timelines      2. Foreign Language Collection    The aim of the Foreign Language Collection is to provide recreational and informational reading for the foreign-speaking population of the city and to make available materials to those learning a foreign language. Books selected for the Foreign Language Collection may include:    a. Classics in the original language    b. Works of significant authors, past and present    c. American classics and translations of books about American culture, literature and history    d. Materials on the history, culture and literature of the countries in which the language is spoken    3. Children's Collection    a. Primary emphasis is placed on the selection of diverse materials for all children    of the community (generally preschool through age 12) which will:    1) Make them aware of the pleasures and knowledge to be derived from the use of Library materials.    2) Provide knowledge of mankind's history and culture.    3) Provide materials which will assist in the development of reading skills.    b. The criteria stated in the adult selection policy apply to the selection of children's materials. These additional policies apply;    1) Subject, vocabulary, and format must be understandable to the children for whom the material is intended.    2) Materials which do not meet literary or production standards may be chosen to fulfill emotional needs, serve as an incentive to read or serve some other special purpose.    3) Books in series are evaluated on the individual merits of each title.    c. Duplication of titles is provided to meet demand. Adult and young adult materials may be duplicated.    d. Librarians may offer assistance, but parents or legal guardians are responsible for guiding their children in the selection of library materials.    4. Reference Collection    a. A collection of reference materials is maintained for patron and library staff use within the library. The Reference Collections will contain (but are not limited to) the following types of materials:    1) Encyclopedias, both general and specialized.    2) Handbooks and dictionaries in all the major fields of knowledge    3) Directories of people, institutions, firms and/or official bodies in all fields    4) Atlases and gazetteers    5) Statistical compendia    6) Indexes and abstracts covering both material already owned or being acquired and material not owned but available elsewhere    7) Bibliographies: National, book trade and subject    8) Biographical dictionaries of general, national or regional, professional or occupational types, with both retrospective and current coverage    9) Articles clipped from newspapers and periodicals    b. Reference materials are selected according to the same general criteria as non-fiction materials.    5. Non-Print Collection    The Library buys non-print materials in many different formats. These materials must meet the same general selection criteria as print materials with special consideration given to technical quality. In addition, each class of materials must demonstrate an appropriate use of its format. For example, slides should present information that is inherently visual in nature without needing motion to convey its message. Films should use the qualities of visual image, motion and sound in creative and informative or entertaining manner. The Library only buys non-print materials designed for school curriculum use when such materials are of interest to the general public.    Because of the special nature of non-print materials, the Library makes every effort to make appropriate equipment for their use available to the public. In cases where equipment cannot be made available for home use, it will be made available for in-Library use. Selection of equipment is based on durability, ease of operation, quality of performance, portability, ease of maintenance and repair, reputation of manufacturer, and cost.    6. Periodicals    a. Tacoma Public Library selects for purchase, or accepts as gifts, omit periodicals which support the recreational, informational, educational, professional and research needs of the total community. It strives to acquire those titles which will:    1) Reflect current thinking  2) Supplement the book collection  3) Supply recreational reading  4) Serve the staff as selection aids and as professional reading materials.  5) Add to current historical or regional information  b. Individual titles may be chosen for the following reasons:  1) Accuracy and objectivity  2) Accessibility of content through indexes  3) Demand  4) Need in reference work  5) Representation of a point of view needed in the collection  6) Local interest in subject matter  7) Price  8) Favorable reviews  7. Federal, State and Local Documents Collection    Tacoma Public Library is a selective depository for the United States Government materials and a full depository for Washington State documents. The Library is subject to federal and state regulations which apply to depository libraries.    Selection of items to be received from the Federal Government follows the same general principles as those for all other materials except that when possible, highly technical publications and agency publications intended for the originating agency's in-house use are not selected.    Tacoma and Pierce County documents are of particular significance and are solicited. Documents from other governmental agencies may be collected.    Duplicates of items of particular significance are solicited and provided to branches and, when appropriate, are distributed free of charge to the public.    8. Pamphlet Collection    Pamphlets are solicited or purchased because they provide useful, current information at a low cost. Tacoma Public Library maintains a Pamphlet Collection to supplement the general collection.    9. Special Collections    Materials of special interest may be purchased or solicited. Special collections of the Library include:    a. Tacoma City Archives    By resolution of the Tacoma City Council, the Tacoma Public Library has been designed as the archives for ""historic city documents."" This status has also been recognized by the Washington State Archives in that items judged by the State Archivist as being ""archival"" or ""potentially archival"" are transferred to the jurisdiction of the Tacoma Public Library by units of the government of the City of Tacoma.    b. Lincoln Collection    The Lincoln Collection of the Tacoma Public Library is based on the Library of Marion L. Saunders, which was purchased in 1948. To this collection has been added a number of federal documents and other items about the life and times of the sixteenth president.    c. Kaiser Collection    A collection of books, maps, posters, and pamphlets on World War I is named in honor of John B. Kaiser, director of the Library from 1914 to 1924.    d. Genealogy Collection    This collection contains items of genealogical interest and local history. The collection also includes depository items from the Tacoma Genealogical Society.    e. Northwest Collection    The Northwest Collection includes books, maps, manuscript materials, photographs and other items about the history, growth, and development of that portion of North America west of the Rocky Mountains and north of California, including Alaska.    10. Branch Collections    Branch Collections contain primarily circulating materials which are supplemented by more specialized materials available from the Main Library. Branch Collections contain limited reference materials, adequate to answer most questions.    F. Policy by Format    The Library will purchase materials in any appropriate print or non-print format which may include:    1. Hardback  2. Paperback  3. Softcover  4. Large Print  5. Microform  6. Videoform      G. Maintenance of Collection    1. Weeding and Discarding    In order to maintain a collection of value and use to the community, the following materials will be discarded: Library materials which have become worn out through use; materials that are no longer timely or accurate; materials that are of little use or questionable value; and excess copies of titles no longer in demand. All discarded materials are sold through a bid process.    2. Binding and Mending    Library materials needing repair will be mended if it is not possible to replace them or if the replacement cost is prohibitive. Library materials needing repair which are available for purchase will be evaluated according to the Library's need. They will either be discarded, used as they are, or replaced. Unless irreplaceable and distinctively worthwhile, paperbacks will not be mended except for the repair of separated covers.    3. Replacement and Duplication    Materials withdrawn will not automatically be replaced. The Library will purchase multiple copies of titles when a high rate of use is anticipated. Purchase in one collection type or format does not preclude its purchase in another type or format.    H. Gifts    The Library accepts gifts with the understanding that the material will be judged by the same standards of selection as those applied to the purchase of new materials. Those items which are useful to the Library will be retained. Unaccepted materials will be discarded.    The Library reserves the right to interfile gifts with other materials on the subject for the best public service.    The appraisal of a gift to the Library for tax purposes is left to the donor. The Library may provide a receipt indicating the number and type of items donated.    Funds for the purchase of a gift or memorial materials are encouraged. The responsibility for selection rests with the Library staff, although the donor's suggestions will be considered. Bookplates will be placed in each item if requested by the donor.    [D. Ex. 33]  [Tacoma Public Library Internet Use Policy]    Tacoma Public Library  Administrative Policy #10.53  Policy For Public Use of the Internet      Policy Statement    The Mission Statement of the Tacoma Public Library emphasizes sensitivity to community changes and needs, and commits the Library to the delivery of excellent services:    The mission of the Tacoma Public Library is to provide the highest quality public library services to fulfill the informational, educational, recreational and cultural needs of the citizens in the dynamic and changing community of Tacoma, which is comprised of many ethnic and economic backgrounds, and, further, to recognize changes that occur in society and to adapt these changes to the delivery of people-oriented library services.    To fulfill its mission, the Library has earned a reputation for adopting new information technologies into its information services program. The Library views the Internet, a vast and interconnected network of information providers, as an information technology with the potential to expand the universe of information available to the people of Tacoma far beyond the reach of the Library's own collection. Furthermore, the Library believes that it is essential that the Internet information resources be integrated with the other information systems of the Library. The Library also recognizes that the very nature of the Internet is evolving rapidly and, therefore, the Board of Trustees of the Tacoma Public Library intends this policy to be updated and amended from time to time as may be necessary.    1. Responsibility of Users    The Internet is global in scope, with a highly diverse user population and information content. The Internet is an unregulated medium and the Tacoma Public Library has no control over any part of the Internet beyond its own homepages. Because the Library is not able to exercise the same selection criteria to Internet resources that it applies to materials held in its collections, the Library may provide hardware and software mechanisms to restrict access to specific sources determined by Library staff to be inconsistent with its mission and collection development policies. Some information content on the Internet may be offensive to some people and some content may be illegal, out-of-date, or erroneous. It is the responsibility of the user, therefore, to determine what materials are appropriate and suitable for his or her use.    Parents may be concerned about the use of Internet Information services by their children. The Library affirms the right and responsibility of parents to supervise their children's use of library resources, including Internet services. The Library will make available to parents upon request such publications as ""Child Safety on the Information Superhighway"" as a guide to children using the Internet.    The library also recognizes that parental control and guidance cannot always be provided with regard to unintended viewing of images displayed in public places; that data collected and analyzed by the Library evidences the potential for considerable and pervasive intended and unintended display of sexually explicit images at Internet terminals in the Tacoma Public Library; that the Library has a compelling interest in preventing the display of sexually explicit images in view of children at the public Library; that the use of partitions and other devices to shield Internet terminals will only reduce the filed of view while still allowing the open public display of sexually explicit images; that limited filtering will be more effective in preventing public display of such images in the library; that the use of the library internet terminals without implementation of a filtering policy will carry with it a significant danger of exposure of children to such sexually explicit images. The Library, therefore, has implemented hardware and software mechanisms to restrict access to specific sexually explicit images, which hardware and software are designed to minimally intrude upon the rights of persons to exercise their constitutionally protected right to disseminate and receive speech.    By making use of Internet services at the Tacoma Public Library, patrons agree to abide by the provisions of this ""Policy for Public Use of the Internet.""    2. Levels of Service    A. In-Library Public Use    Access to a variety of Internet services, including Gopher, the World Wide Web, and connections to the catalogs of other libraries, is presently provided at selected terminals within the Library as a supplement to the Library Catalog and the other electronic information resources of the Library. The Library may offer other Internet services as deemed appropriate by the Library. Such additional services must meet the informational and service goals of the Library and it must be technically feasible to offer such services in a secure and cost-effective manner. The Library will not offer chat, electronic mail or gaming. At the beginning of each Internet session, the user will indicate assent to a ""Conditions of Use"" statement which appears on the screen and which is reproduced below.    ""Conditions of Use""    (This ""Conditions of Use"" statement will be shown on the screen when user logs on to selected Internet services. Acceptance of the conditions will be indicated when the user clicks the ""I agree"" button.)    The Internet is global in scope with a highly diverse user population and information content. The Tacoma Public Library has no control over any part of the Internet beyond its own homepages and is not able to exercise the same selection criteria to Internet resources that it applies to materials held in its collections. Some information content on the Internet may be offensive to some people and some content may be illegal, out-of-date, or erroneous. It is the responsibility of the user, therefore, to determine what material is appropriate and suitable for his or her use.    Parents may be concerned about the use of Internet information services by their children. The Library affirms the right and responsibility of parents to supervise their children's use of library resources, including Internet services. The Library will make available to parents upon request such publications as ""Child Safety on the Information Superhighway"" as a guide to children using the Internet.    By using Internet services through the Tacoma Public Library, users agree that the Library will not be responsible    1) for any indirect, consequential, special, or punitive damages or losses which may arise in their use of the Internet, and    2) for the accuracy, appropriateness, or suitability of any materials or information retrieved, displayed, or printed.    Users of Library Internet services should have no expectation of privacy while using the Internet. The Library reserves the right to refuse to post or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, that, in its sole discretion, are unacceptable or in violation of its policies. Electronic mail, chat and gaming are not authorized uses.    Use of the Internet through the Library shall be governed by and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and with the rules and policies of the Tacoma Public Library. All users of the Internet are required to have a valid Tacoma Public Library card.    By using Internet services through the Library, users agree to abide by the ""Policy for Public Use of the Internet"" Policy #10.53, adopted by the Tacoma Public Library Board of Trustees. Copies of this Policy are available upon request.    B. Dial-In Public Use    The Library may make available through a free dial-in service a variety of electronic information resources, including the Library Catalog and selected Internet services. Some dial-in services may or may not be available during hours when the Library is open due to licensing restrictions. Other licensing restrictions on particular services may require the user to have a valid Tacoma Public Library card and personal identification number (PIN). Dial-in access to Internet services will, as determined by the Board of Trustees of the Tacoma Public Library, require a valid Tacoma Public Library card. Dial-in users of selected Internet services will be presented with the Conditions of Users statement shown above. An individual is responsible for all use made of library card or PIN.    3. General Provisions    The Library may from time to time adopt regulations setting time limits on any of its workstations and dial-in ports in order to maximize the efficient and effective use of the Internet and other Library information resources.    Transaction logs and other system information that could be used to identify users with specific materials or subject matter are considered by the Library to be confidential, as provided for by Administration Policy 10.23, ""Confidentiality of Records Policy.""    The Library reserves the right to apply hardware and software control mechanisms to ensure that information provided through its Internet services is consistent with its mission and collection development policies. The Library's acquisition of Internet materials to be made available to Library patrons does not include graphic materials depicting full nudity and sexual acts which are portrayed obviously and exclusively for sensational or pornographic purposes.    The Internet terminals and software must be used as installed. Any person tampering with Library software to support Internet access beyond those services and software supplied by the Library, or in any other way adding to, modifying, or removing any system software or hardware, may have his or her use of Internet services limited or suspended, and may be banned from the Library, as provided for by Board Policy #10.49, ""Exclusion from Library Premises.""    A user may not use the computing resources of the Tacoma Public Library for any illegal or unauthorized act or in violation of any library rule or policy or of any local, state, or federal laws or regulations.    Library computing resources are to be shared among users. Therefore, an individual user or group of users may not engage in any behavior that unreasonably interferes with or disrupts the use of computing resources by others. Disruptions include, but are not limited to: distribution of unsolicited advertising; propagation of computer viruses, worms, or other computer programs that have the potential of damaging or destroying programs or data; harassment of other persons; and using computer resources to make unauthorized entry to any computer accessible via the network, including the host systems at the Tacoma Public Library.    Each network that a user connects to has its own set of policies and procedures. Actions which might be allowed on one network may be controlled or forbidden on another. It is the user's responsibility to abide by the policies and procedures of these other networks.    When downloading software, files or data, it is the user's responsibility to check for copyright protection or any licensing agreement and to comply with the requirements of that copyright or licensing agreement.    #10.53 Revised August 1999  Board Approved           [D.

Ex. 114]  [Greenville Public Library Collection  Development Policy]      Collection Development Policy  Approved by the Board of Trustees  May 24, 1999      GREENVILLE (S.C.) COUNTY LIBRARY    COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT    COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT POLICY    MISSION    The Library's collection is established to serve the needs of Greenville County Library users. Collection development at the Greenville County Library is aimed at the general public. The Greenville County Library is committed to providing materials for business information, educational support, cultural enrichment, and recreation for the wide variety of needs and interests in this community. It is the Library's responsibility to acquire quality material presenting all points of view on current and historical issues. The Library will neither promote nor censor any particular religious, moral, philosophical or political conviction or opinion. Material will not be excluded because of the race or nationality of the author, publisher, creator, etcetera. In addition, material will not be excluded because of the religious, social, or political views of the author, publisher, creator, etcetera. The Library's approach to intellectual openness is not an endorsement of all that is contained within its collection; rather it takes the position that the public interest is best served as the Library fills the role of provider-as opposed to being a determiner-of religious, moral, and political information. This ""Collection Development Policy"" supports the mission and goals of the Greenville County Library as established by the Library's Board of Trustees.    AUTHORITY FOR SELECTION    Final authority for the determination of policy in the selection and acquisition of all library books and other material-including all gifts-is vested in the Library's Board of Trustees.    Procedures relating to the purchase and disposal of published books, periodicals, technical pamphlets and other such material by the Greenville County Library, are exempt from the provisions of County Purchasing Ordinance 1510. Procedures for the purchase and disposal of such items must be submitted to the Greenville County Council by the Library Board of Trustees. The current procedures were approved by Greenville County Council on March 4, 1986. See separate document, ""Library Materials Disposal Procedures.""    RESPONSIBILITY FOR SELECTION    The Board of Trustees of the Greenville County Library determines the Collection Development Policy for the Library. The responsibility for administering this policy rests with the Director of the Library. The actual selection of material is accomplished through the Collection Development Council and other staff members as needed.    SCOPE OF THE COLLECTION    The scope of the Library's book and material collection encompasses the following:    Role of the Main Library: Extensive and in-depth reference and circulating collections are maintained at the Main Library in Greenville.    Role of the Branches: Collections of basic reference works, core collections of circulating books and other material, plus currently popular works, are maintained at the branch libraries.    Special Collections: Based on the services it is expected to perform, the responsibility of the Library is to provide circulating and reference material for the general public. Special collections are maintained only when indicated by the demonstrated needs of the community.    Awareness of Area Resources: The Library maintains an awareness of the purpose and resources of other libraries in the area and avoids needless duplication of their functions and/or material.    SELECTION CRITERIA    Criteria used in the selection process include the following:    1. Each type of material must be considered in terms of its own merit and the audience for whom it was intended. There is no single standard which can be applied in all cases when making an acquisition decision. Some material may be judged primarily in terms of artistic merit, scholarship, or value to humanity; other material is selected to satisfy the informational, recreational, and educational needs of the community. The Library's general policy is to select and acquire books and other material which best satisfy the clientele of the Library within the budgetary limitations imposed by its funding sources. Conscientious effort is made to meet the expressed needs of the community.    2. Some material evaluated may be in widespread or substantial local demand. Items having such demand may or may not meet other criteria contained in this policy; however, the volume and nature of requests by members of the public will be given serious consideration. Library users' requests for the acquisition of material are encouraged. Selection of requested information is made consistent with the Library's established ""Collection Development Policy,"" availability, cost, demand, and adequate citation.    3. Material will be judged as a whole rather than on isolated passages, illustrations, or other individual elements.    4. The books and other material-including all gifts-acquired by the Library are selected by using the following specific criteria, which are listed in no significant order:    * Authority of the author/producer based on education/training, field of specialization, professional reputation, etcetera;    * Content of the book or item based on objectivity, accuracy, point of view, authenticity, contribution to the subject area, etcetera;    * Style based on clarity, readability, artistic/literary excellence, manner of presentation, etcetera;    * Format based on physical condition and quality, ease of storage and maintenance, sturdiness of binding or packaging, quality of printing/recording/filming, size of item, etcetera;    * Value based on permanency, currency, educational information, recreational use, historical content, ephemeral nature, special interest, etcetera;    * Cost of the item based on whether the item is a good value, is unusually expensive, is too costly for the quality/demand of the item, etcetera;    * Demand and nature of the demand based on whether the item is a best seller, is of popular interest, supports educational curricula, is of local interest, etcetera;    * Scope and audience based on the potential use of the item, whether the content is appropriate for the intended users (e.g. reading level), etcetera;    * Evaluations based on critical reviews in reputable and accepted library review sources, etcetera;    * Reputation of the publisher/producer and of the distributor/jobber, etcetera;    * Quality and quantity of items already in the collection on the subject, etcetera;    * Professional judgment of the Library staff.    5. Material in special formats:    In addition to the selection criteria listed above, the following criteria are used for special formats:    * Audiovisual Material based on:  rtistic and technical quality of specific format  Durability of item  Durability of packaging for specific items  Quality of abridgment if work is abridged  Authenticity of treatment  Number of audiovisual items in same or related subject areas  Availability of the necessary equipment      * Electronic Databases and Online Services based on:  Accuracy of information  Initial cost and cost of ongoing updates and maintenance  User friendliness  Compatibility with existing library equipment and software      * New Technologies and Formats based on:  Accuracy and timeliness of information  Initial cost and related expenses  User friendliness  Duplication of information and/or service  Need      SELECTION AND VENDOR RELATIONS    Authority for the selection of sources and/or vendors of material is delegated to the Collection Development Council.    COLLECTION MAINTENANCE    Review and Evaluation: It is the responsibility of the Collection Development Council to work with other Library staff to review and evaluate the existing material of the Library's collection. Periodic and ongoing review of material is necessary in order to maintain an active collection of current interest and usefulness to Library patrons. Library staff members involved in the evaluation of each item for potential withdrawal and/or transfer shall follow the same criteria used for the selection and/or addition of all books and other material.    Transfers: Some material may be transferred within the system, i.e., a reference work is changed to a circulation item or an item is transferred from one agency to another.    Withdrawals: Systematic weeding is an integral part of the selection process which helps maintain the quality of the Library's collection. The same care, thought, and judgment is used in this process as in the original selection. Withdrawal policies are generally applicable throughout the entire collection and are in compliance with local, state and federal laws.    RECONSIDERATION OF LIBRARY MATERIAL    Any Greenville (S.C.) County Library user, by completing the proper form, may request that an item already included in the Library's collection be reviewed to determine if its meets the Library's ""Collection Development Policy."" Review committees will reevaluate the item and determine if it meets this policy. The decision may be appealed. See separate documents: ""Reconsideration of Library Material Procedures,"" and ""Request for The Reconsideration of Library Material.""    GIFTS AND DONATIONS    Gifts and donated material are evaluated for inclusion in the collection using the same criteria as that given to material considered for purchase. All material given to the Library becomes the sole property of the Library.    THE FREEDOM TO READ AND THE LIBRARY BILL OF RIGHTS    The role of a public library in a democratic society is to ensure open access to information and material for all as guaranteed by the ""First Amendment"" of The Constitution of The United States. The Library considers the Freedom To Read and The Library Bill of Rights important tools to help clarify this role, and it considers them to be an integral part of this policy, so long as they do not violate local, state, and federal laws. See separate documents: The Freedom to Read, and The Library Bill of Rights.    This policy supersedes ""The Library Materials Selection Policy,"" dated July 26, 1993.    This policy became effective on the date of adoption, May 24, 1999.    5-24-99 JS         [D. Ex. 119]  [Greenville Public Library Internet Use Policy]      Greenville County Library System    Internet Use Policy    Approved by Board of Trustees on July 17, 2000  Revised August 21, 2000; January 22, 2001;  May 21, 2001; and September 24, 2001      Section 1. Purpose for Providing Internet Use: The Greenville County Library (hereinafter ""Library"") provides limited access to the Internet in a non-public forum, as a service to our patrons. The Internet is a resource that enables Library patrons to connect to information beyond that contained in the Library's collection. The Library is not a commercial Internet service provider. It is the Library's policy to provide Internet access to the public within the limits of available space, equipment, time, personnel, and other resources. The Library cannot guarantee access to the Internet at any given time. The Library is not open to the public for all forms of expressive activity. In offering Internet access, it is not the intent of the Library to create a public forum with respect to the receipt and communication of information through the Internet.    The Library may recommend interesting, useful, and legal Internet destinations and resources for Library patrons to access and explore. However, the Internet is currently an ungoverned and unregulated source of both verified and unverified information. While the Internet does contain a wealth of useful material, it also provides access to sites containing material that some patrons may offensive or objectionable as well as access to sites that are illegal, unlawful, or obscene.    This Internet Policy is intended to affirm and serve to advance the following governmental interests:    (A) The protection of children from exposure to obscene material, child pornography, or material harmful to them; and    (B) The aid and support of parents and/or the guardians of children in the discharge of their primary responsibility for their children's well-being; and    (C) The prevention of the creation of a sexually hostile work environment for library Staff and patrons, and the prevention of discriminatory conduct; and    (D) The maintenance of discipline and order, and the limitation of disruptions in the study or work environment of the Library; and    (E) The minimization of providing access to illegal pornography; and    (F) The aid and support of Federal and state criminal and civil laws designed to deter and punish trafficking in obscenity, child pornography, stalking, and harassment by means of computer; and    (G) The promotion of respect for authority and traditional values, be they social, moral, or political; and    (H) With respect to minors, the exclusion of material which is ""pervasively vulgar"" or ""educationally unsuitable"" for the respective recipient age group.    (I) The preservation of the Right of the Nation and the States to Maintain a Decent Society.    In providing computer access as an information resource, such as the use of or providing access to or through the Internet, World Wide Web, or an interactive computer service (as defined in 47 U.S.C. § 230 (e)(1) and (2) and § 231 (e) (1) and (3)), the Library realizes that electronic display is more public in nature than other print media. It also recognizes that while it is impossible to monitor totally all the information or images that can be accessed on the Internet, some amount of control can be exercised. The Library will seek to facilitate, provide, and encourage Internet use in its facilities that is in accord with general community standards. The public dissemination of obscene material or child pornography is not necessary nor required under the Library's mission and is inconsistent with public policy and community standards. The Library also seeks to avoid and minimize the opportunity that unrestricted access to the Internet would result in exposure and exhibition of offensive sexual materials that could contribute to a hostile work environment or other sexual harassment or discipline problems within the Library environment    Recent news reports and studies indicate that the problem of children and adults (including registered sex offenders) accessing sexually explicit pornographic materials (including child pornography, bestiality, hard core adult pornography, and with respect to minors, pornography that is harmful to minors) in public libraries may result in situations potentially harmful to public health and safety. In particular, a 1999 report entitled ""Dangerous Access,"" released by Filtering Facts, a librarian organization that promotes the protection of children in public libraries, documents 503 incidents in which patrons have accessed pornography in public libraries. Children were involved in 245 of the incidents, and 20 involved child pornography, a molestation, and several attempted molestations. The report documents at least 195 incidents of children accessing pornography in public libraries, at an average age of 12 years. Many instances are reported where adults have exposed minor children to adult pornography and child pornography, such as would be done intentionally by pedophiles, child stalkers, or child pornography addicts. Most significantly, this Library's Board has identified more than 100 incidents in which patrons have viewed and displayed pornography. In a number of incidents, minor children and other unwilling patrons and Staff have been exposed to pornography and/or obscenity. Some of these exposures have been intentional. The viewing and displaying of pornography and/or obscenity has created an atmosphere that some patrons and Staff have described as negative and hostile.    The Library reserves the right to evaluate, test, use, and implement software and network control and filter mechanisms designed to limit or restrict access to sources of information or images deemed inappropriate for Library dissemination under the criteria set forth in Sections 2, 3 and 4, below. The Library reserves the right to restrict or attempt to restrict entry into the Library's computer terminals or network of any materials that may not or would not meet the Library's selection criteria or policy for the Library's physical book, film, magazine, or other collections, and the Library may use, employ, or delegate such judgments and functions to outside parties, consultants, Internet service providers or filter services, as well as to staff and directors of the Library. Finally, the Library reserves the right to claim and take advantage of the ""Good Samaritan"" immunity protections for voluntary use of screening and blocking mechanisms and procedures to restrict access to pornographic, violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable materials, whether nor not such material is otherwise constitutionally protected in other forums or places, as provided in federal law in Title 47, United States Code, Section 230 (c) (47 U.S.C. § 230 (c) (1) and (2)).    Section 2. Prohibited Access Criteria: The Library will implement software and/or network control mechanisms designed to limit or restrict access to sources of information or images that may be deemed to be Obscene, including hard-core pornography depicting sexual conduct where penetration of the genitals is clearly visible and other explicitly sexual pornographic representations of sexual conduct (""ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated, . . . masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals"") within the scope of federal and state obscenity laws and the constitutional test for obscenity provided by the United States Supreme Court in the ""Miller Test"" announced in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24-25 (1973), Smith v. United States, 431 U.S. 291, 300-02, 309 (1977), Pope v. Illinois, 481 U.S. 497, 500-01 (1987), etc.    Section 3. Prohibited Access Criteria: The Library will implement software and/or network control mechanisms designed to limit or restrict access to images that may be deemed to be Child Pornography, containing a visual representation of a minor under 18 years of age engaging in sexually explicit conduct, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2256.    (A) There is an inference, which may be rebutted, that a participant in sexual activity, depicted as a minor through its title, text, visual representation, or otherwise, is a minor.    (B) As used herein, sexual activity includes sexual acts by minors such as intercourse, oral sex, and includes ""lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area."" In determining when genital or pubic area exhibitions are ""lascivious,"" guidance shall be drawn by the following factors discussed in United States v. Dost, 636 F.Supp. 828, 832 (S. D. Cal. 1986), affirmed, sub nom, United States v. Wiegand, 812 F.2d 1239, 1244 (9th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 856 (1987):    1. examples of sexually suggestive or lewd photographs of children would be those in which the child is depicted as half or partially clothed, posed in such a way as to depict or suggest a willingness to engage in sexual activity or a sexually coy attitude.    2. In determining whether a visual depiction of a minor constitutes a lewd or lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area, the following factors, among any others, may be relevant in the particular case:    (a) whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child's genitalia or pubic area;    (b) whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually suggestive, i.e., in a place or pose generally associated with sexual activity;    (c) whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose, or in inappropriate attire, considering the age of the child;    (d) the child is fully or partially clothed, or nude;    (e) whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity;    (f) the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer. A visual depiction need not involve all of these factors to be a lewd or lascivious exhibition of a minor's genitals or pubic area. A determination may be made based on the overall content of the visual depiction, taking into account the age of the minor and the nature of the work and its context, promotion, or marketing.    Section 4. Prohibited Access Criteria: While a computer providing access to the Internet or other interactive computer service is being used by a minor or is being used in an area accessible to or frequented by minors, during such use the Library may also implement software and/or network control mechanisms designed to limit or restrict access to sources of pornographic information or images that may be deemed to be ""obscene as to minors"" or ""Harmful to Minors,"" as that term is used in federal (47 U.S.C. § 231 (e)(6)) and similar state laws, for the age groups of minors who may be exposed to such materials.    Section 5. Application of Selection Criteria: The Library reserves the right to implement software and/or network control mechanisms designed to limit or restrict access to material that does not meet the established selection criteria that the Library applies to all other material, including material that violates federal, state, or local laws.    Section 6. Access to Terminals without Software and/or Network Control Mechanisms: Should an adult patron desire to access a computer terminal without software and/or network control mechanisms, the adult patron shall be allowed access to a computer terminal without software and/or network control mechanisms under the following conditions:    a. At Main, access shall be available on at least one computer terminal near the Reference Desk, and at each branch access shall be available on at least one computer terminal near the staff desk;    b. Access shall be available only after the adult patron    1. Has signed up for and attempted to access a site on a computer terminal in the public area (those computers employing software and/or network control mechanisms); and    2. Has been denied access by the software and/or network control mechanism; and    3. Has employed the appeal procedure available at the computer terminal in the public area via the software and/or network control mechanism.    c. The adult patron shall not access information or images that meet the prohibited access criteria provided in sections 2 & 3 above.    d. The Internet Use Policy shall apply in every aspect at any computer terminal without software and/or network control mechanisms.    Section 7. Disclaimers Regarding Internet Use: The Library cannot verify or be held responsible for the accuracy, reliability, quality, timeliness, or legality of information found on the Internet. The Library has no control over the information contained on the Internet and is not responsible for its content. The Library cannot be held liable for the conduct of Internet users. The Library may not be able to control access to materials or protect patrons from materials they may find offensive. Library users access the Internet at their own discretion and risk, and they are responsible for evaluating the validity and appropriateness of information accessed. Users should be aware that the Internet is not a secure or private medium and that third parties may be able to obtain information regarding users' activities.    Section 8. Internet Safety Warning and Notice to Parents and Guardians: Because the Internet includes some information which parents and guardians may deem to be unsuitable for their children, parents and guardians must provide the necessary guidance and oversight of their children. Parents and guardians must ensure that they take all appropriate actions in respect to the use of the Internet at the Library by their minor children. The Library System and its staff cannot act in the place of a parent or guardian. The safety and security of minors using electronic mail, chat, instant messaging, and other forms of direct electronic communication are the responsibility of the parent/ guardian. Except as provided for in Section 6 of this Policy, all Internet enabled computers in public areas throughout the Library system shall have filtering software activated with the intent to provide for the safety and security of minors using Library services.    As a condition of Internet use at the Library, each user must agree to comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including without limitation, all rules and regulations which may be established from time to time by the Library. Further, each user must agree to take no action on the Internet which could cause the Library to incur any expense beyond the general access fees. By initiating use, the user agrees to the fullest extent permitted by law to hold the Library harmless from any liability for any wrongful conduct of the user, including without limitation, any such unauthorized expense, costs, and attorney's fees.    The Library reserves the right to refuse access to the Internet to any person or persons for the violation of this or any other policy of the Library, in accordance with applicable law. The following rules for the use of all Library Internet computers are adopted and established as an integral part of this policy:    Rules of Use for the Internet    1. Each user shall be deemed to agree, by advancing beyond the initial computer screens, to abide by the Library's Internet Use Policy.    2. Users must sign in to use the Internet.    3. Users must hold a library card issued by the Greenville County Library.    4. Users may sign-up for Internet access in increments of one hour based on availability of computers. Users may sign up for additional one-hour increments if computers continue to be available    5. Users may not send, receive, or display obscene materials, child pornography, and/or other materials prohibited under applicable local, state, and federal laws.    6. Users may not make unauthorized entry into other computational, informational, or communication services or resources.    7. Users may not misrepresent themselves or the Library by using computer accounts, access codes, numbers, passwords, signatures, or network identification assigned to others.    8. Users may not invade the privacy of others at any time or in any way.    9. Users may not use the Internet for illegal activities, including the violation of the rights of third parties, or activities inconsistent with the Library's tax-exempt status.    10. Users may not make any attempt to damage, alter, and/or bypass the Library System's computer equipment, software, or data, and/or the equipment, software, or data of others. In addition, users may not instruct or demonstrate to another user how to bypass web-filtering technology or other software control mechanisms. Any user who violates this rule in any manner may lose access to the Internet or lose other Library privileges. Other sanctions may apply as described elsewhere in this document.    11. Copyright: U.S. Copyright Law (Title 17, U.S. Code) prohibits the unauthorized reproduction or distribution of copyrighted materials, except as permitted by the principles of ""fair use."" Subject to fair use, users may neither reproduce copyrighted materials (text, images, programs, and/or data) nor distribute such materials by any means (including electronic mail) without the explicit written permission of the copyright holder. Responsibility for any consequences of copyright infringement lies with the user. The Library expressly disclaims any liability or responsibility resulting from such use.    12. Only Library staff may reboot, restart, or log onto the Library's Internet computers.    If the Library determines that a user would benefit from additional instruction in the use of the Internet, the Library reserves the right to request that a user attend an orientation and/or training session.    Further, the Library reserves the right to limit the volume of printing of materials by patrons and/or to impose charges for such printing.    Violation of the Library's Internet Use Policy and of any other rules and regulations may result in a loss of access to the Internet (including the World Wide Web) through the Library's Internet connection and/or a loss of other Library privileges. Unlawful activities may result in prosecution by local, state, and/or federal authorities.    Users may appeal the loss of access to the Internet under the provisions of the Library's Suspension of Privileges Policy.    Because of the unsettled state of applicable local, state, and federal laws, this policy is considered to be a working document and is being implemented on a trial basis. The Library reserves the right to make any changes in this policy at any time.    Section 9. Severability: If any section, sub-section, sentence, clause or any part of this Policy is for any reason, held or declared to be unconstitutional, inoperative or void, such holding or invalidity shall not affect the remaining portions of this Policy; and it shall be construed to have been the Board's intent to pass this Policy without such unconstitutional, inoperative or invalid part therein; and, the remainder of this Policy, after the exclusion of such part or parts, shall be held and deemed to be valid as if such excluded parts had not been included herein.    Section 10. Patron Privacy: The Greenville County Library System will not sell, rent, or otherwise distribute or disclose a patron's e-mail address, postal address, phone number, web sites visited, computer time used, borrower records or other personal information, individually or in aggregate, unless required to do so by court order.    This policy will become effective on August 21, 2000. (Revised 1/22/2001, May 21, 2001, and September 24, 2001 )         [Footer Omitted]         [D.

After several years as reference and special collections librarian at Fresno State College in California, I completed the Ph.D. degree at the Graduate School of Library & Information Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1972.    2. In my years at Texas that began in 1971 I have taught courses related to the history of archives, books, and libraries; issues in contemporary publishing; and Collection Development, a popular elective that I have taught since 1975. In conjunction with teaching the Collection Development course to literally hundreds of students, I have supervised numerous projects that assessed and evaluated library collections of all kinds. In addition to more than a dozen authored and edited volumes, I have published over 130 book chapters, articles, and reports-as well as more than 250 book reviews for scholarly and professional media. Since 1977 I have edited Libraries & Culture, a scholarly journal published quarterly by University of Texas Press. Among my books are American Library History: A Comprehensive Guide to the Literature (1989) and Encyclopedia of Library History (1994)-both co-authored.    3. I have been a continuous member of the American Library Association (ALA) since 1964 and have served as an elected officer and held appointments on several committees. I have served as chair of the ALA Library History Round Table that established an article award in my name two years ago. As a professor, and scholar I have devoted my career to educating new members of the profession. As a recognized scholar-editor in the field of American library history-and who, at the same time, teaches Collection Development and Management and participates in the assessment process for library collections and the evaluation of individual works-I believe that I am qualified to speak in support of the Defendants.    4. The U.S. Department of Justice has asked me to render an opinion on several issues that concern this case: (1) the historic mission and purpose of the public library, (2) the education and preparation of librarians to assume selection responsibilities, (3) the role of selection in the acquisition of library materials, (4) the publications that the profession has generated to assist its members in the responsibility of selection, (5) the role of professional judgment in selecting materials with diverse content, (6) the significance of reciprocal responsibilities of the library and its community of support, and (7) the implications that these trends hold for treatment and management of Internet resources dealt with in the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA). Each issue is considered briefly from an historical perspective with references to a selective list of standard sources appended.    5. First, in my opinion, the historic mission and purpose of the public library have been primarily educational in nature-both explicitly and implicitly. Education does not refer, of course, to learning only through textbooks and in classrooms, but through the whole corpus of human experience that has contributed to who we are as a people and a species.    6. The modern public library movement in the United States developed in the mid-nineteenth century in response to the need expressed by citizens in communities to support with tax revenues a collection of books, journals, and other materials that would benefit all groups in society. The concept of such a public institution gained popularity in Great Britain, the United States, and the Western nations at about the same time. By the twentieth century it had attracted the attention of not only Andrew Carnegie and other benefactors, but of people throughout the world. [ELH 519-521]    7. The movement that coalesced in the middle 1800s was grounded in institutions that immediately preceded it-such as, social libraries, circulating libraries, athenaeums, lyceums, Sunday school libraries, YMCA libraries, ladies' libraries, etc. With the establishment of enabling legislation in New England in the years spanning 1850, the modern public library began-available to all readers, supported by public funds, and a social institution integral to local government. The founders of these libraries-the most notable being the Boston Public Library that opened in 1854-wished ""to promote equality of education opportunity, to advance scientific investigation, to save youth from the evils of an ill-spent leisure, and to promote the vocational advancement of the workers [Shera, 247]."" The goal was the enlightenment and improvement of individuals, and through this to elevate society. The first point in the American Library Association's ""Library Bill of Rights"" reflects the continuing significance of this idea when it declares boldly ""Books and other library resources should be provided for the interest, information, and enlightenment of all people of the community the library serves."" [IFM 3]    8. This notion of the educational and civilizing purpose of the public library was the persuasive argument for the widespread support and spread of public libraries throughout New England, the middle Atlantic states, and the Middle West-and ultimately the West and the South. This broadly based appeal was significant as a foundation for the public library movement. The initial emphasis on the educational values promoted by the public library has continued as exemplified in the frequently employed the moniker of ""the people's university."" [Ditzion 77-96]    9. Other complementary purposes joined education over time. The civic aim incorporated the notion that individuals would become more responsible citizens if they were informed about issues; they would vote more intelligently if they had information on matters before the electorate. The utilitarian purpose suggested that one of the functions of the public library was to enable citizens to succeed in their occupations and professions and generally to develop their potential in whatever field in which they were engaged. Yet another purpose has come to be the recreational function; citizens find at the public library a variety of resources available to engage their leisure time. [Ditzion 190-193] Engaging in this latter purpose, libraries abut, but do not intend to compete with, commercial enterprises that provide the spectrum of services and technologies catering to popular taste and media.    10. Each of these purposes has energized and been promoted by libraries, sometimes simultaneously, throughout the past century and a half. Communities and their libraries have had to decide what emphases and priorities would prevail. As late as the mid 1960s the provision of reference and information service was seen as the critical contribution of public libraries. [Lee 118-119] But whether explicitly educational or not, all public libraries have embraced goals that they deemed to be of benefit to society and their communities; none have adopted goals that would result in degrading, injuring, or harming users, or potential users, of their institutions. In fact, they would likely refrain from encouraging the use of such in a publicly supported agency. Materials prohibited by the CIPA-visual representations of obscene materials, child pornography, and other images harmful to minors-have not been among the resources selected for the enrichment of society. Public librarians from the earliest years have considered the welfare of their patrons in the selection process. In short, public libraries are in reality one of the ""helping professions""-one that helps and benefits people through the tools of information resources at all levels. [WELIS 674]    11. Ongoing and recent promotions of the innate and social value of reading, and its accompanying benefits for society have emphasized goals that were positive and helpful for their communities. The prominence given to reading and library visits has again reminded citizens that the educational purpose of the public library, notwithstanding incorporation of the complementary purposes, is paramount. [Lee 112-127] When entire cities, for example, concentrate on reading a single work and when reading and book clubs flourish in communities, the educational and civilizing aim is being realized. Strengthening community values, broadly conceived, is again gaining support from both the library community and the community at large. [McCabe 95-102]    12. Second, in my opinion, since Melvil Dewey's first school at Columbia more than eleven decades ago, library and information science programs that provide graduate-level professional education to produce qualified librarians have sought and required broad educational preparation for their applicants. Moreover they have sought to encourage intellectual curiosity and lifelong learning in their graduates.    13. For most of the past century schools that educated future librarians were proud of the fact that accepted applicants possessed a broad, liberal arts education. In current professional library programs, students undertake a rather broad series of courses that will prepare them for library employment in a variety of settings. Most library schools allow for some specialization, so that students intending to work as a selector of materials may take several specific courses that deal with the literature, reference works, and information sources in broad subject areas. Many students who aim toward work in public libraries are already beginning to demonstrate the kind of knowledge that that kind of context requires, because they read widely, are developing taste, and are becoming sensitive to the needs of patrons in given communities. [WELIS 486-491]    14. In addition to formal classroom instruction, students frequently engage in projects in libraries, including public libraries. This often promotes a kind of mentoring role with respect to the supervising librarian. Many students who aspire to becoming public librarians will find part or full-time employment in public libraries and gain valuable experience in evaluating patron requests and available materials. When collection evaluation projects are undertaken in a local public library, the students receive first-hand experience of judging the relative value of items in a collection and the adequacy of the collection as a whole. These kinds of apprenticeships are building blocks in gaining professional competence.    15. Through education and experience, then, librarians are equipped to make the kinds of judgments that one would expect of a professional who is trained in this area. Professional education programs are acutely aware of what their graduates will need to perform on the job and they seek through a variety of means to provide them with the preparation they need. Graduates from professional library and information programs are most effective, especially in public libraries, when they have had wide exposure with the world of ideas, communication patterns, and community needs. [Evans (2000) 25-26]    16. Third, in my opinion, the role of selection in the acquisition of library materials has been one of the primary, if not the primary, tasks of the professional librarian. It remains so today.    17. From the earliest noted predecessors of the public library to the present, the custodians of collections-the librarians-have been obliged to choose what they will select and ultimately acquire for their store of materials from an increasingly vast universe of information resources. They have done this most effectively when they have understood the purposes of their libraries, the needs of their served communities, and the nature and scope of available resources. Limited funds, in almost every situation, further dictated that judicious choices were necessary. This process took the form of consensus among the libraries' members or decisions delegated to members of the library staff who were considered knowledgeable in specific areas. The collection creating and building activities of the early major public libraries frequently involved scholar-librarians and bibliographers who were thoroughly expert in the world of books, such as William Frederick Poole, a leading authority in the latter half of the nineteenth century, especially as director of the Chicago Public Library. [WELIS 214-215; Wortman 1-2]    18. When the American Library Association (ALA) was founded in 1876, an effort was made to analyze, systematize, and regularize basic functions of the developing profession. Along with the publication of Melvil Dewey's Dewey Decimal Classification, in that year the U.S. Bureau of Education published its special report entitled Public Libraries in the United States of America: Their History, Condition, and Management-an encyclopedic manual of more than 1200 pages. One of the 39 chapters in this handbook was written by Poole on ""The Organization and Management of Public Libraries"" [476-504] in which he devoted three pages to ""Selection of Books,"" laying out some principles that could guide public librarians in the selection of materials. A later chapter by A.R. Spofford, Librarian of Congress, offered a ""List of the Principal Books of Reference Important to be Used in Libraries"" that consists of the essential information sources of the time. [688-710] Early on, publications, such as lists and bibliographies, began that brought together the collective mind of the profession to identify the significant, the best, the important items that are desirable for public libraries and their patrons.    19. While the debate soon began, and has continued, on what kinds of popular materials to include in public library collections, what proportion of the materials' budget should be expended on varieties of fiction, what groups of readers or users deserved more or less attention-the profession through its Association continued to insist that one of the librarian's primary professional functions was to select quality materials that supported the reasonable information needs of the community groups and individual members. Librarians have needed to balance the perceived demands of their patrons with the public trust of spending funds prudently. Responsible for some knowledge of a work's content, reputation (author and publisher), presentation, special features, and physical format-professional staff members needed informed judgment to make good decisions. Since no one librarian can know enough, despite his or her broad education and professional training, groups within the profession began to compile bibliographies of recommended works, create lists of desirable titles, and produce reviewing media with professionally-oriented assessments of current books and other materials. [Evans (2000) 91-95ff.]    20. Fourth, in my opinion, the publications that the profession has developed to assist librarians provide evidence that the selection function is a critical part of the professional librarian's task. The fact that these publications, produced and distributed widely by the ALA and other publishers to the profession, have been used for so long, by so many speaks for itself about the needs of the profession.    21. Early in the twentieth century the profession, through its principal association and other publishers, began to establish regular works that consolidated the quality evaluations that librarians valued in selecting the potential purchases and assessing their collections. A few examples illustrate this commitment. The ALA initiated Booklist in 1905 to assist the staff of public libraries to make knowledgeable decisions in the selection of materials. Currently, it is a semimonthly reviewing journal that states as its purpose in mid 2001 ""to provide a guide to current print and audiovisual materials worthy of consideration for purchase by small and medium-sized public libraries and school library media centers. A review in Booklist constitutes a recommendation for library purchase [July 2001]."" The entries do not include the kind of explicit visual depictions that are subject of the current litigation. The Association produced its Guide to Reference Books for the first time in 1907. Its success is symbolized by the massive eleventh edition that appeared in 1996. This standard work of scholarly description and evaluation is a working tool for thousands of librarians in the United States and elsewhere and has served this function for nearly a century. Reference Books Bulletin, another organ of the ALA that began under an earlier title in 1930, serves to supplement the Guide for current material and appears in conjunction with Booklist, the reviewing medium discussed above. Public librarians who are doing their job conscientiously rely on these helpful professional tools.    22. Several works produced by other distinguished publishers also augment the selection and evaluation aids developed by the ALA. The H.W. Wilson Company publishes several catalogs of books for various audiences, each at several year intervals. Two of these serve public librarians especially. The first is the Fiction Catalog that began in 1908; the 14th edition appeared in 2001. The second is the Public Library Catalog that began in 1934; the 11th edition appeared in 1994. Each includes several thousand annotated titles and has annual supplements between editions. The first of these is described as a ""standard work that lists and annotates a selection of the best fiction in English, along with a generous representation of foreign fiction that has been translated into English. . . . Together with its companion, . . . which includes works of fiction criticism, it forms a comprehensive bibliography of recommended fiction and nonfiction for adults [Guide, 500]."" Introductions to these works indicate that they can be used as aids in selection of and in evaluating material. A third work that illustrates the selection emphasis of the profession is The Reader's Adviser, published by the R. R. Bowker Company since 1921; the 14th edition in six volumes appeared in 1994. It is designed to be a guide to the recommended ""best"" books in English in the various fields of human knowledge. The publisher released a CD-ROM version of this work in 1996 that includes 58,000 titles. The implicit, if not explicit, criteria used in the professional works mentioned above do not support inclusion of pornographic and sexually explicit, graphic materials.    23. That recommendations for quality selection remain a priority of professional activity is evident from the several pages of the Summer/Fall 2001 catalog of ALA publications. Among the many titles devoted to the subject, one finds Best Books for Young Adults, 2d ed. (2000) which is accompanied by the following description: ""For serving the needs and interests of young adult readers-from avid to reluctant, these trusted bibliographies are sorted into more than 25 themes covering the gamut from adventure to youth in trouble [23]."" Selecting materials for children and young adults is a serious matter. School librarians and children's librarians in public libraries, as well as teachers, understand this. They typically take courses in the subject during the credentialing process, learning ""to analyze books as carefully and objectively"" as possible and to develop judgments that are ""both informed and objective."" [Sutherland 25-26] Among the literary elements often considered are: setting, point of view, characters, plot, theme, and style-in addition to author, illustrator, publisher, and age of audience. In short, children's librarians, while educated to develop their own judgment and taste, value the recommendations of even more experienced colleagues because they have been entrusted with nurturing the future generation.    24. Textbooks also are another means that the profession has used to codify current best practice and to communicate this knowledge to the next generation. Many of these textbooks have concentrated on the crucial role of the selection process. From the 1920s onward, a succession of standard texts has suggested criteria for selection of fiction and non-fiction works for libraries of all kinds, but particularly public libraries [Evans (2000), 92-93]. Among these authorities are Arthur E. Bostwick (1929), Francis Drury (1930), Helen Haines (1950), William Katz (1980), Robert Broadus (1981), Arthur Curley and Dorothy Broderick (1985), and G. Edward Evans (1995 and 2001). Each author's work, attempting to balance the library's responsibility with the needs of the community, wielded considerable influence in its time and together are worth studying for what they reveal about the continuing necessity for informed professional judgment based on experience and knowledge in the process of selection.    25. Fifth, in my opinion, professional judgment regarding content, as well as format, readership, etc., has been a distinguishing and characteristic trait that librarians have developed and exercised.    26. Though there is considerable debate within the profession, especially from the 1960s to the present regarding the skill involved in, and even the legitimacy of, evaluating the quality of materials with a view to selection, when the dust settles the publications cited above-reviewing media, bibliographical works and textbooks-continue to be published because they fill a need in evaluating content, a need that the profession has embraced. Critics and analysts may not agree with every criterion applied in past and current generations, but they cannot deny that the profession has considered the selection function to be a significant one-partly assumed and partly thrust upon it. As one authority begins his text, ""The library's primary service is a good collection."" [Wortman 1]    27. The fact that professional judgment, taking into consideration the purpose of the library and the unique needs and requirements of the community, has been rendered by librarians for the past 150 years and before and is still a cornerstone of professional practice raises an interesting issue. Though selection is seen generally as a positive process, every time a librarian chooses one item and not another, a professional judgment is made. When material is not selected or deselected, for a variety of reasons, the decision is best made not in a whimsical or even personal perspective, but in the light of specific guidelines that have been agreed upon through as much consensual discussion as possible.    28. Most librarians in most public libraries, therefore, have given careful thought to the kinds of materials and the depths of coverage-formats, treatments, and topics-that need to be evaluated carefully before determining whether or not they should be included in their collections. Each new communication medium and format thus undergoes scrutiny to understand how it fits the purpose of the library and contributes to the particular mission of the library. Although the educational preparation and broad experience prepare librarians for their selection responsibilities, they frequently seek assistance from reliable sources that can assist them in judging content, as well as format and the intended audience. [Evans (2000) xix]    29. Component elements to be considered in the selection of individual items commonly include content (niche, currency, veracity, perspective or bias), reputation of author and publisher, appropriateness and adequacy of presentation, added value of special features (illustrations, documentation, index[es], and bibliography), and physical format (paper, binding, design, typography). If a general and overriding consideration is the benefit or the good that this selected item will bring to the community served, then the issue of content is of prime consideration and not easily ignored. [Broadus 85-99] In addition to applying to individual considerations, the various categories of criteria may be used to make decisions between alternative selections and competing items. These elements will naturally carry more or less weight depending on the purpose of the collection. With a vast universe of materials available for selection, librarians naturally want to select that which will provide the most value for the cost. [Evans (2000) 15-16]    30. While embracing First Amendment principles, public libraries have had to interpret what particular role or niche in the cultural world they would play. While declaring that they were committed to provision of materials for ""the interest, information, and enlightenment"" of all, library staff members know that the library cannot (and likely should not) supply all the material that is available. In fact, many considerations enter in to what materials a library will include in its collection. In addition to decisions about media and formats, other questions about potential problem materials arise. These categories include costly materials, ephemera and fragile materials, high-risk and unprotected materials, as well as other materials that do not contribute to the purpose of the library. Not only do the collecting contours of genre or fiction and non-fiction, reference, and foreign language works need to be determined. Subject fields like law, medicine, religion and genealogy many times require guidelines for appropriate selection. Materials dealing with drug and substance abuse, obscenity and pornography, materials unsuitable or harmful to minors, semi-and pseudo-scientific works, unbridled and offensive social propaganda, not to speak of guns, firearms and explosives-all require and receive consideration utilizing the professional judgment of librarians.    31. While some of these fields are governed by statutory law, most are not. Librarians apply their informed judgment when they assume responsibility for selecting materials. Legal considerations are only the minimal and ""worst case scenario"" among considerations. Professionals hold to higher standards that reflect their user groups. Children and minors pose a special case, as they do in virtually every civilized society, and are protected from behavior that will affect them adversely. In any event, most librarians strive in the most delicate manner to balance individual needs with the public good. The critical point is that selection of materials in libraries occurs regularly in a variety ways. How that public good is understood and determined is and should be a matter for discussion.    32. The notion that the kind of professional judgment applied to individual print and non-print items should also be applied to the Internet is consistent with historic professional practice. Rather than considering the initiation of Internet access as simply one selection decision to acquire one item-such as, for example, a very large and exhaustive encyclopedia-those responsible for selection might well view Internet access as a kind of approval plan whereby many items come to the library for review and those that do not meet the library's collection profile are returned to the vendor. In the case of the Internet, the use of filters accomplishes a similar function. Likewise, Internet materials arrive unsolicited at the library and might well be subject to the same collection profile review, albeit using technological devices. Categories-such as ""extreme/obscene/violent"" and ""adult/sexually explicit,"" for example-are not included in public libraries' subjects for active selection. Why then, some would ask, should they be included in the Internet fare offered to public library users? As filtering devices become ever more effective, and are accompanied by adequate safeguards that allow for overriding limitations for reasonable use, they can ensure that selection standards will remain intact.    33. Sixth, in my opinion, libraries, and particularly public libraries, because of their community-based support and their accountability to their constituents have been and remain inextricably linked. They must serve one another to be effective. They need, and are instructed in how, to carefully assess the needs of their communities and apply their professional judgment to selection decisions. Thus they have developed strategies to assist them-community analyses and collection development policies.    34. There would seem to be little question that selection of materials is a primary function of professional librarians and that they, and their constituent communities, wish for it to remain so. Among the principles, or maxims, of materials selection is one that urges librarians to understand their communities and their needs for information and ideas as they pursue the life of the mind. This can be an arduous assignment, even if aided by data generated by public and commercial sources. Without such an understanding, librarians can too easily ignore the information needs and expectations of their natural clientele. Ultimately, from the vast universe of information materials-books, journals, audiovisual media, and electronic resources-librarians are obliged to select knowledgably for their communities and patron groups those items and categories of materials that will most effectively satisfy the needs identified.    35. While librarians wish to serve as intellectual provocateurs, they know that public libraries have never been able, nor seen fit, to provide all available material to their communities. However, by weighing the relative value of their acquisitions, librarians exercise their judgment as to what materials will meet the needs of their users and potential users. Public libraries are, after all, ""public"" libraries-and as such, reflect largely the range of common values shared by community groups, rather than the isolated, unique needs of solitary individuals that might be better served through other entities. [Evans (2000) 31-63]    36. Public librarians, in particular, are trusted by the public to be accountable to their communities for the decisions that they make that support the purpose of their institutions that are, in turn, made possible by public funds-local, state, and federal-funds that the people through their elected representatives provide. Thus, conscientious librarians make every effort to understand the nature of their communities-the socio-economic demographics, the cultural and intellectual infrastructures, and the historical-geographical contexts-in order to select materials that will be optimally useful. As communities change in character, the selection of materials also changes. This can result in adding new materials and in deselecting other materials, so that the collection provides optimum support for members of their communities. Deselection, or ""weeding"" of collections, is commonplace for public libraries and should be done regularly according to standard guidelines. However, public libraries will be unlikely to deselect materials that concern this litigation, because they were never selected for the collection in the first place.    37. A frequent way in which ideas, principles, and processes of selection may be forthright and useful to both staff and the public is accomplished through the development of documents that lay down some of the understandings of groups to be served and of the criteria that will be applied in decision-making-in other words, a selection policy. As important as indicating what materials will be collected are guidelines that indicate what material will not be selected-for a variety of reasons that have been carefully considered beforehand. When these policies are developed in concert with local communities and are used as guidelines for selection, then both the professional library leadership and the community represented by the public can be well served. Donations and gifts of materials are subject to the same selection considerations as materials that the library purchases. While it is true that no criteria or standards are, nor should they be, applied rigidly in every public and school library in every community, thoughtfully constructed selection policies can serve as a catalyst for developing mutual support. Furthermore, the profession has long held the conviction that the more time and effort expended in the establishment of these policies in advance, the fewer the problems will develop at a later date. Those difficulties that persist can be minimized. [Futas 331-233; Evans (2000) 69-86]    38. Seventh, and finally, in my opinion, if public libraries honor their heritage and are consistent in their maintaining quality standards in the selection of library materials, they will apply the same standards to Internet resources that they apply to other materials. The medium is decidedly different, but if the mission remains intact, means that match the medium can assist librarians and their communities to fulfill their mission.    39. A library historian, looking at the history of the public library movement in America from the mid nineteenth century to the present, must acknowledge that the selection process is deeply imbedded in what constitutes professionalism in the library profession. It is also what the general public has come to expect of their librarians. The manner in which principles of selection apply to the pervasive and ubiquitous electronic media is a hotly debated issue within the profession, if not in American society at large. The professional staff members in public libraries intuitively understand that their qualifications have equipped them to help their users locate and utilize reliable websites-as the current helpful column, ""Web Watch,"" in one of the most influential journals of the profession, Library Journal, underscores. There is, of course, no similar column for pornographic sites displaying visual images unsuitable for children-nor is there likely to be.    40. A complementary strategy that can work for the same end, to bring Internet materials in line with existing selection practices that reflect is the employment of filters that, judiciously monitored, can maintain to some extent the kind of criteria that make the library an attractive place for all, including children. They can use technology to solve problems that technology introduces. A unique medium may well require new approaches to ensure the desired end. One can only wonder why many in a profession that is enthusiastic, with good reason, about the immense promise and power of Internet access to information and ideas seem most reluctant to utilize developing tools to accomplish their time-honored goals of providing material of ""interest, information, and enlightenment"" to its tax-supporting users. As many public libraries have demonstrated, there is no intrinsic reason why filtering devices cannot be used in a beneficial way.    41. In any case, large segments, quite likely the majority, of the general public expect librarians to use their professional judgment wisely and exercise their options when dealing with newer technologies. [Evans (2000) 562-563] Supporters of public libraries will rightfully want to be assured that the selection of materials and provision of access to electronic information-visual, as well as text-is consistent with the mission and purpose of the library. Librarians either select, or they do not. They either practice their professional competence or they risk becoming mere technicians and managers. Visual depictions that are considered obscene, child pornography, and harmful to minors (CIPA) are clearly not found in general public library collections. Many citizens and librarians will envision no loss in their absence from the Internet for children in their community libraries. The Internet is hardly a medium that nullifies the role that public libraries have played from their inception-a point underscored by a recent article in American Libraries. [Herring, April 2001] Librarians will need to deal with this issue in a forthright and accountable manner.    42. The fact that some members of the library profession are reluctant to undertake the obligations of selection and deselection in relation to the world wide web that they have historically carried out as a public trust with conventional media reveals an inconsistency with the purpose of the public library. For librarians to abandon this function is tantamount to abandoning the core of the professional vocation. What other profession refers clients to the unregulated Internet for information? The American nation and local communities-as reflected by taxpayers, the voting electorate, and their elected representatives at all levels-entrust to their public libraries the professional responsibility to discharge their historical, legitimate, and necessary role of providing materials of human culture for the benefit of all. [WELIS 218]    43. For my services in the present litigation, I am being reimbursed by the Department of Justice at the rate of $110.00 per hour.    44. I have not served as an expert witness in a legal case in the past four years.    * * * * *    Dated October 12, 2001    signed /s/ DONALD G. DAVIS, JR.  DONALD G. DAVIS, JR.           [D. Ex. 187]  [Rebuttal Expert Report of Donald G. Davis, Jr.]      RESPONSES TO ALA v. USA EXPERT WITNESS REPORTS OF JOSEPH JANES, ANNE LIPOW, AND MICHAEL RYAN  by  Donald G. Davis, Jr.  8 November 2001    1. My responses to the Expert Witness Reports of Joseph Janes, Anne Lipow, and Michael Ryan center on two primary points-(1) the general and professional qualifications and the relevant experience of the witnesses to deal with collection development issues and (2) the weaknesses displayed in their statements and arguments relevant to collection development in public libraries.    2. An issue that recurs throughout the report of Janes and the others is the lack of differentiation between various types of libraries. The mission of research libraries, for example, differs substantially from that of public libraries, since the former strives to build comprehensive collections of specialized materials-many of them unique in character- designed for research at the highest levels. They are not intended to serve the general public. The Association of Research Libraries consists of about 120 such institutions in the United States. The mission and role of institutions, such as the Library of Congress and the great university libraries of America, differ dramatically from those of general, community-based public libraries.    3. Joseph Janes. Though Dr. James has taught at the undergraduate and graduate/professional level, among the courses he lists in his report (p.1), one does not find courses related to general collection development and management or content-related issues in public libraries. His interests appear directed primarily toward promoting applications of Internet resources. His record of professional activity does not suggest extensive experience in selecting a variety of materials for public libraries. Though Janes has published on digital, electronic information services, he does not appear to have had employment or a sustained association with a real (as opposed to virtual) public library, nor to have taught collection development and management or supervised projects in that subject in the broad context of public libraries.    4. The main conclusion of the Janes expert report is that ""the blocking programs tested block a significant amount of content that would be appropriate in a library setting"" (p.7). Janes conducted his study by using analyses of websites, selected from a database of alleged overblocked sites supplied to him by the plaintiffs' expert. The very term ""overblocking""-a term that means blocking a site that has some usefulness-is inextricably linked to the conception of what is essential information for those requiring it, in this case, patrons in a public library. The assignment of the label ""overblocking,"" is conditioned by one's understanding of the institutional context for which the site is being considered. As will be shown below, Janes and the other witnesses do not clearly define the specific context of the public libraries, or specifically the uses made by minors.    5. The study that Janes made of the sampling of a file containing alleged overblocked sites, received from the plaintiffs' expert, made use of 16 students and former students at the Washington school-eleven of which had ""less direct experience"" and five with ""much more experience in school or public library collection development and reference work."" (p.4). In the absence of information about the qualifications of either group-how many of the respondents were students and how many had been doing selection work and how then they were able to interpret the instructions for evaluating the sites assigned to them-the study's conclusions are not useable. Judging by my thirty years of teaching experience, most students, though eager and sometimes knowledgeable, have had little experience in actual selection situations. The smaller group of five is described as those with ""substantially more experience in library reference and collection development work.""(p.7). Considering the absence of specific information about the extent of broad experience in public libraries of these five, the conclusions of this group, too, raise a question of credibility. In short, there is no evidence from which once may ascertain whether these selected respondents can possibly be considered reliable judges in this study.    6. The instructions that the current and former students recruited as judges in the Janes study received (pp.4-6) appear to have been designed to elicit the desired responses. They do not conform to standard kinds of quality content criteria that selectors of materials for public libraries utilize. They include simply whether or not similar information is in libraries, whether or not given infinite resources a librarian might select this information source, and whether or not any patron of any age might ever be referred to such a source. The fact that public libraries are the context of evaluation is not explicitly acknowledged in the above instructions given to the respondents. In fact they include some ""criteria"" that are false. They insist, for example, on the faulty premises that (1) whatever is in any library anywhere is a reasonable standard, that (2) a state of infinite resources is the goal of public libraries, and that (3) whatever information whatsoever that a patron of any age asks for is a reasonable request for a public library to supply. The instructions, or ""criteria,"" are in reality only directions or instructions to respondents in this study that refer to perception of real or imagined usage. They are, in effect, not criteria for content selection at all. However, these instructions merit closer examination in the following three paragraphs.    7. Janes's first instruction (a) is to identify ""information similar to that already found in libraries"" (pp.4,6). What type of libraries were the students/ respondents asked to consider-public libraries that serve the general public, or research and special libraries, as well? Without any qualifications whatsoever, this instruction seems almost irrelevant, in that some libraries somewhere will contain just about any kind of material. What about the types of libraries- public libraries and school libraries-addressed in the CIPA? This is a critical point for clarification, otherwise the respondents might well have responded in a manner not consistent with the supposed intent of the study. It vitiates the integrity of the results. This appears to be a non-criterion.    8. Janes's second instruction (b) is to identify ""information a librarian would want in the library if s/he had unlimited funds to purchase information and unlimited shelf space"" (pp.4,6). However, in real life public librarians do not select only on the basis of space and funds being unlimited. They select materials that fit and conform to the standards established by their collection development policies that have, in turn, been developed with community involvement. The meaning of ""selection"" is selection-not collection. A hypothetical collection of everything that has been produced is not only of dubious value, but actually detrimental to users trying to find what they want to find and really need. Even research and national libraries, such as the Library of Congress, select from the vast array of materials those items that they will add to their collections. The Library of Congress has long since ceased adding to its collections all the materials it receives through the copyright deposit program. This instruction, too, is a non-criterion.    9. Janes's third instruction (c) is to identify information that the respondent ""would be willing to refer a patron (of any age) to the site if the patron appeared at a reference desk seeking information about the subject of the site"" (pp.5,6). Janes continues with further directions: ""Sites that have a commercial purpose should be included here if they might be of use or interest to someone wishing to buy a product or service or doing research on the Internet, much as most libraries include the Yellow Pages in their collections. A site that is purely erotica should not be noted."" Again, this is no real criterion that deals with content, but simply an appeal to supply what a patron wishes to see. What defines the limits of ""willing"" as far as the eleven less experienced respondents are concerned? This direction is a far more subjective and personal one than criteria that librarians professionally trained in collection development use in selecting other materials, such as accurate and reliable sources. Janes's instruction is wholly dependent on what the judges in the study (in this case, respondents with varied levels of experience) consider reasonable. It does not take into account content, except in a single matter of erotica. If ""purely erotic"" is being used as a euphemism for pornography or materials unsuitable for children, this is a subtle misinterpretation of the word. But, if some libraries collect this, why is this, and this alone, excluded? Why not material related to bomb making, child pornography, gratuitous violence, terrorist tactics, child abuse, etc? One does not find these materials recommended for the Internet Public Library-a digital resource with which Janes has been associated and that is discussed in the next paragraph. Is the implication that public libraries do not collect this kind of material? If so, there are many other categories of materials that libraries do not select for a wide variety of reasons. The emphatic instruction to include sites with a ""commercial purpose"" in the amended criterion (c) on p.6, on the basis that the Yellow Pages are automatically included in public library collections is absurd. Even though the Yellow Pages is a well known source, the entries themselves are not fully evaluated for authenticity. No public library directly supplies detailed information on every service advertised as available in the Yellow Pages. If the issue is that of providing any information whatsoever that a patron of any age wants, why is nothing is excluded except pure erotica. In short this, too, is a non-criterion.    10. The Internet Public Library (IPL), which Janes helped to found in the late 1990's, defines itself as ""a public service organization and learning/teaching environment at the University of Michigan School of Information"" (http://www.ipl.org/). It further describes itself as a project that ""seeks to challenge and redefine the roles and significance of libraries in an increasingly distributed and digital world."" Even though the principles listed strive to portray content-neutrality, the mission statement, adopted 21 April 2001, gives six activities that are common to public libraries, including ""service."" Among the tasks describing service are the following: ""finding, evaluating, selecting, organizing, describing, and creating information resources."" The mission statement concludes with the statement: ""We approach the above activities via the values and principles of librarianship."" What is being evaluated or selected? When one scans the portions of the web site devoted to teens and youth, one finds headings in the former category for such topics as ""Arts & Entertainment,"" ""Dating & Stuff,"" ""Health,"" and ""Style."" A quick scan of the resources included under these categories does not reveal references to some of the problematic websites that are at issue in the current case-visual images inappropriate for minors. Why not? If Janes does not subscribe to the standard of appropriateness for Internet resources, why does the IPL insist that it acts guided by professional values and principles? The Internet Public Library claims to, and actually does, select materials that are suitable for minors in a public library-even an internet public library. Selection according to content does still retain a place in the accumulation of materials that public libraries gather for their patrons-including minors.    11. Anne G. Lipow. According to the biographical information that Ms. Lipow submitted with her report, she makes no claim to have direct public library experience nor has she taught or supervised projects related to collection development for public libraries. Ms. Lipow was a practicing librarian after the receipt of her M.L.S degree from the University of California, Berkeley-most of the time at her alma mater, a major research library. Academic and research libraries have very little in common with community-oriented public libraries. Lipow is an independent entrepreneur and publisher who promotes more extensive use of the Internet among libraries of all types. Like Janes, her primary interests, and her livelihood, are centered on the digital environment, according to her biographical statement.    12. The main conclusion of the Lipow expert report is that because of the advent of the Internet and the alleged elimination of concerns of libraries related to financial support and physical space, there is really no difference any more between public libraries, academic and research libraries, and very specialized libraries (p.4). A further conclusion is that an ideal situation would be for any and every searcher to seek any information without a mediator of any kind (p.4). In other words, with regard to Internet resources, no differentiation may, or should be made, between types of libraries, and it is incorrect to argue that librarians should not be involved in selection activities in that medium. The need for even the Internet Public Library, promoted by Janes, is an anomaly, according to Lipow's presupposition. Though her conclusion has little to do with her examination of websites, she, too, used a database contained on a CD furnished by the plaintiffs' expert, in this case an apparently pre-selected group of 204 sites. There is no indication of the random nature of this selection.    13. Of the group of sites examined, all met the ""criterion"" of ""useful information for someone"" and ""should be accessible to children."" 200 sites fell into three categories-A, B, and C-that correspond generally to what amounts to core sites, marginal sites, and debatable sites. The third category, C, consisted of sites that a library ""might not choose"" for a variety of reasons, but that patrons doing comprehensive research analysis, etc. might be referred to by librarians. That is, these were sites that ""fall outside libraries' collection policies or standards for inclusion"" but would be helpful for persons with special needs. An example or two of each type accompany the report, however the examples for type C seem of remote value to patrons, by Lipow's own evaluation. If these examples are indicative, one can only wonder why 74 sites in this category (one third of the total) were deemed acceptable. Here Lipow reveals her presupposition that hypothetically any information of any kind is useful for someone, sometime, somewhere-so it should be collected. (Incidentally, she found only one site ""inappropriate for kids""-category D-and that site itself warned those under 18 to not continue further.)    14. Lipow asserts in her concluding paragraph both the presuppositions and the conclusions supported by her and her colleagues-who are promoting the Internet as the new information environment that challenges all the selection standards of the past. The Internet, according to Lipow, apparently defies, and should continue to defy, all efforts to manage it for desirable ends. The argument is that the Internet has blurred, if not obliterated, the differences between research, school, special and public libraries-as far as the user is concerned. The first erroneous implication of this is that space is no longer an issue, assuming that that was a primary hindrance to the well-selected library. The second erroneous implication is that no mediator of any kind should be needed or even desirable in helping users find information, assuming that all users (including minors) require unlimited access to any type of information that is available anywhere on the planet. This assumption is particularly ironic, given the fact that Lipow has been employed in, and lectured on, reference services. Together, these ideas, carried to their ultimate ends, run counter to the historic mainstream of American librarianship. In short, the conclusions of this report could have been written without any study, because they are not based on meaningful selection principles employed by most public libraries-but rather on the presuppositions of the witness.    15. In reality, it is inconceivable that even unlimited space and funds would eliminate the need for public librarians to select materials that are congruous with the collection development policies that they and their communities have constructed. To assume otherwise is a false assumption that portrays the weakness in the argument. Such a notion is clearly antithetical to the principles of library information and reader's advisory service that maintain that one of the chief professional responsibilities of librarians is to save the time of users and ensure that they do not waste their time in unproductive material. Patrons have come to trust the informed judgment of librarians to have culled for them from the vast universe of information those materials that will be most useful and productive for them to use.    16. The benefit to patrons, especially children and youth, in community libraries in this environment is not at all clear. According to Lipow, public library patrons must avail themselves of the full impact of the Web without assistance, whether they want to do so or not. Library professionals who do not fully embrace the historic role of public libraries, and the collection development responsibilities they bear, unfortunately can succumb to behaving like uncritical enthusiasts for unbridled access to material of any kind-even to that which the overwhelming majority of communities think should reasonably be limited. Although they see themselves in a heroic role, these information libertarians are running against community interests. They seem to be advocating for public libraries something that would be comparable to forced removal of protective fences around swimming pools that prevent those unable yet to swim from being hurt or worse-and accept liability for their welfare. Will Manley, ""Good Fences Make Good Libraries"" has written on this point recently in a respected ALA selection journal (Booklist, November 1, 2001, p. 446.) (attached as Ex. 1).    17. Michael Ryan. Dr. Ryan is a historian, bibliographer, archivist, and special collections specialist who has spent his career in research libraries and makes no claim to have had public library experience; nor has he taught or supervised projects related to collection development for public libraries. His professional and scholarly involvements include serving on the editorial boards of journals, such as College & Research Libraries and Rare Books & Manuscripts Librarianship, and he currently serves as director of the Rare Book & Manuscript Library, University of Pennsylvania. In short, Ryan is an academic librarian who administers unique and specialized materials available for research purposes.    18. However, although Ryan possesses credentials for the field in scholarly, research librarianship, his expertise and experience do not extend to the issues that are relevant to collection development in public libraries. Thus, he has little expertise to evaluate sites relating to these format and content related materials. What are legitimate resources for highly specialized collections designed for research are surely not the kinds of materials that one currently finds in public libraries.    19. The main conclusion of the Ryan very brief expert report is that all the blocked sites that he examined ""are legitimate reference and information sources providing a variety of information and content for constituents"" (p.1). Ryan lists the categories into which he classified the sites-""group or topic relevance, general usefulness, focus, and transparency."" He concludes by saying essentially that all of these sites contain information of some sort and could be accessed from an unfiltered public library, thus he sees no reason for filtering them. In other words, since these sites are all findable from equipment without blocking mechanisms, they are all legitimate. This non-conclusion, that all sites have information that someone might find, is a meaningless statement in the discussion of collection development in public libraries.    20. Based on Ryan's review of the 200 plus allegedly blocked web sites assigned to him by the plaintiffs' expert, he concludes that ""all of the blocked sites are legitimate reference and information sources providing a variety of information and content for constituents."" From the criteria Ryan uses in his evaluation-""group or topic relevance, general usefulness, focus, and transparency""-and the context in which he evaluated the sites-his own experience-all one knows is that these sites contain information. One can assume under this definition that there are no sites-and by extension, that no sites even exist-that do not contain information of some sort. This logic does not help clarify anything.    21. The final sentence of his concluding paragraph states that ""The nature and spectrum of information represented on these sites is consistent with the nature and spectrum of information contained in and accessible from a public library."" Ryan appears to agree with Lipow that there is no distinction between public and research library; public libraries become simple connecting points to the Internet. Surely there are vast differences in the clientele and the collections of community public libraries serving a general population and the very specialized users of comprehensive and exhaustive research libraries that Ryan has served. Yet, despite his single mention of the public library, there is nothing in this paper to indicate that Ryan seriously considered the unique role of public libraries in serving the needs of the members of the community in which they are located, including children and youth. In Ryan's report, all libraries are treated as the same; there are no distinctions to be made.    22. Summary Comments. Each of the expert witnesses focuses on blocked sites as delivered to them in a database provided by the plaintiffs' expert. None of the expert witnesses acknowledge that currently filtered sites can be freely unblocked or that filtering devices can be disabled by professional library staff members. This is a procedure for dealing with the electronic universe that compares with the kind of decisions that librarians make with regularity with regard to other information media. Materials, such as books, records, etc., need to be individually selected and require professional judgment to ensure maximum value. Likewise, information on web sites that are not selected requires evaluation and decision as to its suitability to the community's users. (Approval plans from library wholesalers work something like this. The library receives items based on its collecting profile, with the provision that it may return to the publisher items that it does not want to acquire.) For the profession to do otherwise would be a departure from common practice of librarians for a century and a half. If selection of materials served the public library's community well in the past, then in the Internet environment the use of blocking and unblocking sites may serve the same purpose and counter the effects of overblocking. The historical record is clear: The ability of librarians with the expertise to select quality materials has been viewed as a critical professional responsibility that has been expected by communities supporting their public libraries.    23. An analogy is useful here. From time to time librarians re-evaluate materials (e.g. books and journals) that they had not selected initially, when a case is made that a work will be appropriate for a public library collection and meet the information needs of community members. Likewise, a librarian who is conscientiously responsible to the needs of the community will unblock a site that was previously overblocked, if need and appropriateness are indicated. Both of these examples are a normal part of the ongoing evaluating and management of collection resources. Both involve sensitivity to available resources and expressions of community need. Content considerations are important to librarians and the community alike. For a century and half this relationship has been built on developing trust and respect for common values in the community.    24. In summary, all three expert witnesses agree that there are selection criteria of some sort for library collection development, either explicitly or implicitly- Janes looks for ""experienced"" judges (p.4), Lipow mentions ""quality and authority"" (p.2), and Ryan refers to ""legitimate reference and information sources"" (p.1). These admissions support the principle of the selection role of librarians-particularly those serving public libraries. However, while the expert witnesses affirm the professional librarian's classic selection functions, on the one hand, they seem to be saying that the Internet as a collection of web sites should not be subject to the same standards used to the present for other types of materials-even though generally comparable methods for doing so exist. In their view, the Internet is untouchable. This is a contradictory position that flies directly in the face of what public librarians concerned about the enrichment and enlightenment of their communities have undertaken for generations.    25. The propositions of the expert witnesses-that one library cannot be differentiated from another; that the least possible, and preferably no selection and mediation is best; and that any information of any sort will be of some use to some one, in some place, and at some time-are inconsistent with the selection roles that public librarians play in civilized society    The foregoing is a complete and accurate report of my expert opinions in this matter.    30 November 2001 DONALD G. DAVIS, JR.         [D. Ex. 189]  [Expert Report of Blaise Cronin]      The Children's Internet Protection Act: Expert Testimony of Professor Blaise Cronin, PhD, DSSc, DLitt (h.c.), FRSA, FIM, FIInfSc, FLA    1. Preamble    1.1. I write as the Rudy Professor of Information Science at Indiana University, where I have been dean of the School of Library and Information Science for the past ten years. Prior to that I was head of the Department of Information Science at the University of Strathclyde in the U.K., where I held the Chair of Information Science. I have authored or edited some 300 monographs, research articles, technical reports, conference papers, book chapters, and other publications dealing with many aspects of library and information science theory, practice, and policy. I also have extensive international experience, having worked as a consultant for organizations such as the World Bank, Commission of the European Communities, UNESCO, and British Council. By way of illustration, I was a member of the team commissioned by the Department of National Heritage that carried out the Review of the Public Library Service in England and Wales, one of the largest ever surveys of public library use and attitudes [1]. Recently, I have studied the market for digital pornography in the U.S. [2]. My curriculum vitae is attached.    1.2. For the last 16 years I have been responsible for directing graduate programs designed to educate librarians, information scientists, and sundry other information professionals. As a result, I have a broadly developed sense of the trends, contemporary and historical, relating to the education and training of professional librarians, particularly in the U.S. and U.K. I also have considerable first-hand familiarity with the various professional bodies associated with the library and information professions in both countries (e.g., The American Library Association, American Society for Information Science and Technology, Association for Library and Information Science Education, Library Association, Institute of Information Scientists).    1.3. Indiana University's School of Library and Information Science (http://www.slis.indiana.edu/), which offers, inter alia, master's degrees in both Information Science and Library Science and a Ph.D. in Information Science, is one of the top-ranking programs of its kind in North America, with almost 6,000 graduates employed in virtually every state and in many foreign countries. In April 2000, the school's faculty was rated #1 overall in the nation for its multi-year scholarly productivity and impact [3]. For the last 50 years the school's MLS (Master of Library Science) program has been continuously accredited by the American Library Association (ALA), the body principally concerned with the formal education of professional librarians in this country.    2. The Children's Internet Protection Act and the Practice of Librarianship    2.1. In this expert witness report I wish to address a number of issues relating to the substance of the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) and, more specifically, to show that the use of a ""technology protection measure,"" as proposed in the Act, is consistent with the traditional principles and prevailing practice of public librarianship in the U.S. More specifically, I shall show that the idea of filtering materials which are harmful to minors_""any picture, image, graphic image file, or other depiction that (A) taken as a whole and with respect to minors, appeals to a prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion; (B) depicts, describes, or represents, in a patently offensive way with respect to what is suitable for minors, an actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact, actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual acts, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals; and (C) taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value as to minors,"" to use the language of the CIPA_is in keeping with the historical purpose of the public library and the enduring professional ethos of the American library profession. For convenience I'll use the term ""pornography"" throughout this report to connote the full spectrum of sexually explicit materials.    2.2. First, I'll outline the marketplace for digital pornography in order to demonstrate the nature and scale of the problem facing public libraries. Second, I'll address the related practices of selecting, filtering, and labeling library materials, and show how the adoption of the CIPA is consistent with long-established conventions in professional librarianship as they relate to the handling of pornography. Third, I'll illustrate some basic similarities between the functions performed by filtering software, as proposed in the CIPA, and the traditional bibliographic access systems (e.g., indexes, catalogs) used by librarians. Fourth, I'll show how the CIPA is consistent with existing procedures and practices for handling print-based pornographic materials in public libraries.    3. The Market for Online Pornography    3.1. The amount of pornographic materials freely available via the Internet and World Wide Web is enormous. The dramatic growth in online pornography and the increasing accessibility of such materials via networked computers in public libraries are creating a very real problem for librarians, and diverting professional time, attention, and resources from mainstream tasks. The CIPA is an attempt to provide the library profession with a pragmatic solution to the problem of minors' exposure to sexually explicit materials. Common sense tells us that allowing children to have unfettered exposure to pornography is neither professionally nor socially responsible. The CIPA provides librarians with a means of dealing with this complex challenge in a way that is consistent with professional practice.    3.2. The Children's Internet Protection Act is a direct response to the dramatic growth in publicly accessible pornography facilitated by the widespread diffusion of internetworking technologies, notably the World Wide Web. For detailed background information on these and related trends, the reader is referred to the sources cited in [2] and the references contained therein. The remarks that follow are based in large measure on these two texts and their supporting references.    3.3. Estimates of the ""legal"" sex industry worldwide, which includes magazines, striptease clubs, phone sex, videos, and web sites, is about $60 billion annually, or more than twice Disney's global earnings from all of its diversified businesses. The U.S. probably accounts for $15 billion of the total, of which, in turn, video sales and rentals (roughly 700 million per year) alone account for $5 billion. To put things in perspective, revenues for sex goods and services are considerably larger than all movie box office receipts in this country. The adult entertainment sector, to use the favored euphemism, is also more economically significant than all of the performing arts, or, for that matter, professional sports such as football and basketball. In the U.S., commercial web-based pornography is estimated to be generating annual revenues in the $1 billion range; additionally, it is believed that there are more than 250,000 free web sites devoted to pornography. Pornography is the one form of Internet content that seems (almost) recession-proof.    3.4. Daily, millions of Americans surf sex sites (free and pay-for-view) from home, work, and other locations. Evidence of this activity comes from commercial market research firms like Nielsen and Jupiter Media Metrix which measure in-home use of adult entertainment sites on the web, and from other companies, like the portal Sextracker (http://www.sextracker.com), which provide publicly accessible (longitudinal) data on the hit rates of the sites they track.    3.5. The Internet and World Wide Web are facilitating new means of distributing and consuming pornographic goods, and also creating new computer-mediated environments (chat rooms, web rings) and novel experiences (public voyeurism, interactive sex) for the global market. The social ramifications of these trends are likely to be complex: for instance, there is evidence that online sex addiction is on the rise, with an estimated 200,000 cases in the United States. As the percentage of U.S. households with access to the Internet continues to rise (51% in August 2000, according to the Department of Commerce), so, too, does the number of public libraries and schools offering online connectivity. Today, virtually every public library in the U.S. is wired, and every day, millions of U.S. children routinely access the Internet and World Wide Web, from public and private terminals located in homes, schools, libraries, and elsewhere.    3.6. Even as the number of children online rises, the amount of freely available accessible, web-based pornography continues to grow. It is estimated that 100,000 web sites contain child pornography [4]. Quite apart from the numerous recorded incidents of children accessing digital pornography in public libraries across the nation, there is the well-documented risk of minors being preyed upon in online chat rooms [5, 6]. The significance of this phenomenon has been powerfully described by Andrew Vachss, an attorney, novelist, and life-long library advocate, in his 1999 testimony to the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS) [7, pp.10-11]:    You know what the greatest threat to vulnerable children is? It is the very real potential for enticement. Child pornography has always existed. Predatory pedophiles have always lurked outside playgrounds and inside organizations. But the Internet permits, in its interactive form, access to children that would not be available to them otherwise . . . As a research tool, I think the Internet has much to offer. But ""chat"" is not research. And while it is most certainly a form of ""speech,"" the enticement of children for the sexual gratification of an adult is not a protected form of speech.    3.7. The intersection of these trend lines has manifest public policy consequences for institutions where unfettered access to pornographic materials and potential exposure to pedophiles pose credible concerns. Given the vast amount of digital pornography freely available in the public domain, it would seem, at the very least, commonsensical to consider how children's risk of exposure to such materials in libraries might be minimized.    3.8. The specific goals of the Children's Internet Protection Act are congruent with the historical assumptions underpinning the practice of librarianship and also the education and training of professional librarians in the U.S. [8] Education and self-improvement have always been cornerstones of the public library movement in the US and other nations, and the CIPA will enable librarians to fulfill their social mission with greater assurance and effectiveness in the evolving digital environment.    4. Selecting, Filtering, and Labeling Library Materials    4.1. The selection of materials and building of collections are the defining tasks of professional librarianship. Selection and filtering have a reciprocal relationship. To argue otherwise is disingenuous. From the patron's perspective, the net effect of an item not being added to a library collection is no different from its being consciously excluded by a librarian. The same holds with regard to de-selection (the systematic removal of items from a collection), otherwise known as de-accessioning, de-acquisition, or weeding. De-accessioning is also a form of filtering. This, of course, is not quite the same as saying that items which are not selected (or are de-selected) are always purposefully, excluded on the grounds of content, since most libraries can afford to purchase (and/or store) only a fraction of what is published, a point made by the late Lester Asheim in his paper, Not censorship but selection [9]. But filtering is an inescapable fact of library life.    4.2. Librarians select materials; librarians filter materials. They are trained and remunerated to do so. Over the years, librarians have often been referred to as ""gatekeepers,"" in recognition of their role as filters between readers and the mass of published material in the public sphere. Increasingly, librarians have been turning their attention to the selection (and filtering) of digital materials. The principles of selection and collection development are today being applied to a wide variety of web-based resources. Because many web sites contain sexually explicit materials, the library profession is confronted with a fresh challenge for which new tools, such as the technology protection measures proposed by CIPA, will be required. Faced with an explosion of pornographic materials in cyberspace, librarians will surely benefit from the use of filtering software in the exercise of their core professional functions.    4.3. Labeling, in its various guises, is an absolutely essential and pervasive activity within professional librarianship. The practice of librarianship is (and always has been) predicated on labeling: from the classification numbers on the spines of books to the broad subject headings (history, biography, fiction, etc.) used to group public library materials for patron convenience. While rating systems for movies or television programs, like library classification schemes and cataloguing systems, may be less than perfect instruments, they have evident social utility and a seriousness of intent.    4.4. Categorizing and labeling are fundamental cognitive processes: they enable us to make sense of the world. We instinctively categorize objects, behaviors, events; and we (in the form of the federal government) label foodstuffs, prescription medicines, and, of course, ourselves (in the context of the decennial census). No one denies that labeling systems, whether it's the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) scheme used in libraries or the categories (e.g., race) employed by the U.S. Census Bureau, are, to resort to the prevailing jargon, anything other than socially constructed. But that is a far cry indeed from saying that they are, as some would have it, inherently, or invariably, ""prejudicial"" [10].    4.5. Librarians routinely apply labels and rating systems in the exercise of their craft. Children's books are rated in terms of their readability, for example. School Library Journal, a leading selection tool for professional librarians, might label a book as * PreS-Gr 3, which means that it is ""excellent in relation to other titles on the same subject or in the same genre"" and suitable for children in preschool through Grade 3. Logically, there is no reason why one should object to similar labeling of pornographic materials, be they web-based or printed, or to the use of filtering software to identify and screen out certain categories of sexually explicit materials. With CIPA, librarians will still be in a position to evaluate and categorize digital resources: the technology supports rather than displaces the librarian. And, of course, many librarians are already voluntarily using commercial filtering software to assist them in their work.    4.6. Librarians reflexively label materials (e.g., as juvenile nonfiction, or biography) before adding them (or not) to their collections. Once added to the collection they are again labeled (e.g., catalogued and/or classified). In some cases, the labeling is implicit rather than explicit, as when materials are put on restricted access, or otherwise segregated from the mainstream collection-a common tactic for handling pornography in public libraries. Librarians use magazines such as Library Journal or the Horn Book Guide to read reviews of new books (reviews often written by other librarians) and then make a decision whether or not to purchase a copy. There are also various specialized selection tools and bibliographies to draw upon, such as Sensitive Issues: An Annotated Guide to Children's Literature K-6 and Multicultural Picture Books: Art for Understanding Others. Librarians' selection and de-selection decisions are filtered though reviews, their own subject knowledge, exposure to collection development guidelines, and their adherence to community standards.    5. Filtering Software and Bibliographic Access Systems    5.1. It is misleading to single out filtering software for criticism, or to refer to the Children's Internet Protection Act as imposing ""dramatic, federally mandated speech restrictions on public libraries and schools across the country"" [11, p.7]. Such a standard would require that we acknowledge the analogous limitations of traditional subject cataloging and indexing tools and hold them to account in like fashion. Although the bibliographic tools employed by librarians have become progressively more sophisticated over the years, their inherent limitations are widely acknowledged.    5.2. Library users are occasionally frustrated in their attempts to identify, access, and retrieve materials, but these frustrations are not the result of the library profession consciously trying to abridge patrons' First Amendment rights. They are a natural consequence of the limitations of the access tools (catalogs, indexes, etc.) that are used day in day out by librarians and library patrons everywhere. Library indexing and access systems, as much as commercial search engines or filtering software, are inherently imprecise instruments. The net effect of such imprecision is that sometimes documents are unintentionally 'lost' to the user, or the documents which are found have little to do with the subject for which information is being sought. This is not materially different from the claimed effects of filtering software (viz., under-or over-blocking). It is unreasonable to hold filtering software to a higher standard than the other bibliographic access tools used by professional librarians in the daily exercise of their craft.    5.3. In an important sense, much of the technical discussion surrounding filtering software is beside the point. Library patrons access information using a rage of indexes, catalogs, online databases, and web search engines, all of which, as with filtering software, have well-documented shortcomings. Various studies of search engine performance have shown that even the best engines find only a relatively small amount of the information available on a given topic. In their highly cited study [12], published in Nature, Steve Lawrence and C. Lee Giles found that the relative coverage of eleven commercial search engines ranged from a high of 35% to a low of 5% of the web, based on a sample of more than 1,000 queries. In sum, much of the web remains uncovered even by the best search engines, and patrons won't always get what they need or"

The Internet                            is a global electronic information infrastructure, a                            network of computer networks created and used by governments,                            businesses, organizations, educators, and individuals.                            As such it is an essential medium for obtaining and                            transmitting information of all types. Therefore, public                            access to the Internet is germane to the Library's mission.                           However,                            the Internet is not subject to regulations that assure                            the content or accuracy of information. Users should                            critically evaluate sources for accuracy, completeness,                            and currency.

Unlike other library resources,         it is not organized, cataloged, or indexed. The information available         on the Internet includes much that is personally, professionally, and         culturally enriching. It also provides access to material that may be         offensive or disturbing to some individuals, as well as access to information       that may be factually incorrect and/or illegal.           The Maine State Library has no control over the information available         through the Internet, and specifically disclaims any warranty as to the         information's     accuracy, authoritativeness, timeliness, usefulness or fitness for a particular     purpose. The Maine State Library endorses the Library Bill of Rights, including     the new interpretation on electronic access, as adopted by the American     Library Association, and supports       the democratic principle of every citizen's right to free access to information.                   Library             Bill of Rights, American Library Association , http://www.ala.org/work/freedom/lbr.html#rights                   As with other library resources, restriction of a minor’s access to the       Internet is the responsibility of the parent or legal guardian.           The Maine State Library reserves the right to limit the use of public         access workstations.          You must read and accept policy in order to continue……………………………….         User Responsibilities         1. Sign in at the reference desk before using the sit down workstations         or Computer Lab. At the stand-up workstation, patrons do not have to         sign-in.         2. Time limit of 1 Hour for sit down workstations if someone is waiting.   The stand-up workstations are for quick access to e-mail, electronic catalogs     and reference databases and may be limited to 20 minutes.         3. Printing copies will cost $.15 per page.         4. Refrain from damaging or altering the computer software and hardware.         Computer and Internet settings may not be changed and the downloading         of files to workstation hard drives is prohibited. No peripheral devices         may be installed on any Public workstation. Examples: handhelds, Palms,         CE, digital cameras, printers, notebooks, or external devices.         5. In the Computer Lab and some Library computers, patrons may save         their work to diskettes and zip cartridges. The patrons may use their         own pre-formatted diskettes or zip cartridges for saving files (the Library         is  not  responsible for any loss or damage to zip cartridges or personal         disks).         6. Patrons must abide by all U.S. copyright laws.          7. E-mail is allowed for users who have their own account. The Library         does  not  provide e-mail accounts or allow use of its accounts.          8. The user is responsible for charges incurred by accessing fee-based         services and should  not  enter the library’s name at these sites.         Security of credit card purchases made on the Internet cannot be guaranteed.         9. Users may not use the Library workstations for illegal or criminal         purposes.           10. In general, only one person may use a workstation at a time, except for     an adult working with a child. Families and groups are encouraged to share     when possible.          11. Simultaneous use of two or more workstations is prohibited by 1         patron. Users may not abandon machines for any length of time without         the chance of them being claimed by the next user.         12. Loss of time, work or property due to equipment malfunctions shall         not be the responsibility of the Library.         13. Users of the Library’s workstations may not send, receive,         (by e-mail or chat rooms) print or display any child pornography whether         text or graphics, that are legally defined by State of Maine Law as “obscene” or “child         pornography”.

All workstations at the Maine State Library are in a public area.         We ask you to respect other library patrons around you and consider this         before accessing potentially controversial material or material that         may be deemed “harmful to minors” as defined by law. Therefore,         it is inappropriate to view sexually graphic and/or explicit materials         at public workstations.          15. It is the responsibility of parents or legal guardians to decide         which library resources are appropriate for their child (minors are defined         as persons 17 years of age and under). The Maine State Library strongly         urges parents to become involved in and supervise their children’s       Internet activities.                 The Maine State Library‘s electronic resources may be used only for purposes   that are legal and consistent with the Library’s mission.          Unacceptable uses include, but are not limited to:                    Harassment of other library patrons, computer users or staff; unauthorized         access to files, data, passwords or accounts of others.            Libeling, harassing, or slandering other users.           Fraud.           Solicitation of minors           Hacking and spamming.           Connection of personal equipment to the Library’s           network.           Attempting to violate computer system security or software             license agreements           Child pornography as defined by the Maine law.                 Failure to abide by the provisions of this policy will result in the         loss of library privileges. Illegal acts involving the public access         workstations will be subject to prosecution by local, state or federal         authorities.         Responsibilities of Maine State Library         1. The Maine State Library does not provide one-on-one in-depth training         on computers, but staff may be able to answer computer related questions.

In addition to my  corporate duties, I currently serve as President of the Internet Safety  Association, founded in September 2000 and headquartered in Washington  D.C. The ISA (Internet Safety  Association) was created by leaders in the Internet Content Management Industry  to promote safe use of the Internet for all users.      I would like to thank  the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce,  Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet for inviting me to submit  testimony.      I will focus my  comments specifically on filtering & Internet content management  technology, offering background, current approaches and tools, and future  developments.             Technology Protection Measures- Why  are they necessary?      The Internet is  truly the most comprehensive and unique mass medium in the history of  communication. The Internet is rapidly  becoming the convergence of all other forms of communication. Television, radio, print, postal service and  telephone service, are all available via the Internet. But even more amazing, is that the Internet  has become the new backbone of these other communication mediums, ensuring that  the Internet industry is here to stay.  Our dependency upon this new medium has flourished, especially in the  past decade. The Internet is an  emerging technology that has its own set of problems.      The Internet is  essentially an open network with a common language that allows anyone worldwide  to access and transmit information. It  is essentially a public forum, which fosters the free transmission of information  and ideas.      One of the sacred  cornerstones of the founding fathers was to preserve the free transmission of  ideas and information. That is why the  very first amendment covered this issue.  However, there are obvious exceptions to the first amendment. Information that is obscene, illegal and  harmful to minors is not protected under the first amendment. Outside of the Internet, this type of  information in any other medium is prosecutable under existing laws and regulations. To understand why illegal content via the  Internet has become so controversial is puzzling. One might ask: What makes  the Internet immune to existing laws and statutes that are already in place to  protect individuals from material that is deemed detrimental in nature?      Although the  Internet is a viable tool for business, education and commerce, there is a  significant amount of obscenity and illegal information. The goal is to limit access to this type of  material without affecting the overall Internet experience for the user. Filtering technology is the best alternative  to solving these issues.       Historically,  there has been controversy concerning the effectiveness of filters. The rapid growth and dynamic nature of the  Internet make Internet filtering a constant moving target.      In the mid-nineties,  a few companies emerged in an effort to offer technological solutions to the  ever-expanding problem of detrimental and illegal activity on the  Internet.       The first approach  relied on artificial intelligence to block access to pornographic or objectionable  material. These systems were based on  keyword filters that would filter incoming data and look for words such as  sex, XXX or breast. This type of  approach was, in fact, good at identifying pornographic & illegal websites,  but inadvertently blocked legitimate site searches such as Middlesex, Super  bowl XXX or chicken breast recipes, etc.  To solve this problem, new ways of filtering would have to be developed.      Many opponents of  filtering use the argument that filters still make these kinds of  mistakes. Todays technology has risen  far above these early products by using computers that scour the Internet  coupled with human review to ensure a high level of accuracy.       In fact, todays  Technology protection measures are more advanced than ever before. Not every filtering product is the  same. In the same way that there are  different types of automobiles, some have more features than others, some are  more expensive and then there are some that were created with specific purposes  in mind. If your desire were to race in  the Daytona 500, then you would not drive a Yugo. If your goal were fuel economy, you would not drive a Hummer. Similarly, there are different types of  filters for different objectives. Some  are less expensive and offer less protection and less control. At the same time, there are filtering  products that have been specifically designed to operate in a more commercial  application such as large corporations, schools and libraries.       To ensure  successful lasting implementation of a technology protection measure, you must  fit the product with the application.  Opponents of filtering have misled the public into believing that  filtering does not work, or more accurately, does not work well. The justification for this claim has been a  few isolated studies where the testing criterion is questionable and the  results generalized.       In March 2001,  Consumer Reports published an article about filtering technology where 6  off-the-shelf filtering products were tested.  The results indicated that the tested products did poorly when the  testing criterion was applied. The  article proceeded to question the governments imposition of filtering on  schools and libraries through the Childrens Internet Protection Act, citing  that the test results were clearly negative.        In response to the  article, I wrote the editor of Consumer Reports on February 23, 2001 and  questioned the products tested and the criterion used to test the  effectiveness. Here is an excerpt of  that letter:      First, the objectionable contentsite  sample used, 86, was obviously but a small fractionin comparison to the vast number of adult and illegal websites on  the web. To effectively test any filter, a more appropriate sample might have  been 10,000 or even higher.              Second, a thoughtful set of criteria should be established in the  selection of sites to be tested to ensure that the sites chosen are a  statistically accurate representative sample of the range and type of  objectionable sites found on the web.  Your article did not indicate what criterion, if any, was used to  determine which 86 sites were to be used.  For example, we do not know if the author searched for 86 obscure sites  or chose a random sample from a popular search engine. The answer to that question would dramatically  affect the outcome of your informal survey.             Third, only six of the 141 filter-related products listed on the popular  information website www.getnetwise.org were tested. The products tested, with the exception of AOL's parental  controls, are client-side products. No  server-side filter systems were tested.  Also, some of the most popular filter programs were not included in the  test.              Fourth,none of the filters  tested are those typically used in the educational space. Filters such as N2H2, X-stop, I-gear, S4F  and Web Sense were not even mentioned, and these products represent the vast  majority of the access-control market share.  Would it not be reasonable to test those products that are most commonly  used and perhaps those who have made the greatest advancement in creating  solutions that work for everyone?             Fifth, the  test conducted did not include one of the most important aspects of filtering,  the ability of the software to be overridden or bypassed by web-savvy  kids. A filter can be a false sense of  security to a parent or educator if it can be easily bypassed. Features such as this contribute greatly to  the overall value and effectiveness of a filter.             I hope you can see how these seemingly innocent oversights lead to  erroneous, generalizedconclusions.   The  fact is, there have been significant advancements by many companies even in the  past year that validate the claim that filtering works and is effective in  protecting children from illegal and dangerous information.             In response to my letter, I received a return  letter dated March 7 th , 2001 where the editor admitted that the  products tested were from the consumer level and not those used in the  educational space.      We are,  however guilty of testing only so-called client-side software. Since our founding in 1936, weve focused on  testing products available to consumers at the retail level. It is not part of our brief to test software  sold exclusively to schools or libraries.  By analogy, we would test garden hoses, sponges and auto polish, but not  commercial car-wash equipment.             I encouraged the editor to consider a more comprehensive test where some  of the more popular and broadly used filters could be included. I am sure the results would be entirely  different.             David Burt, in his written testimony before the COPA commission in July of  2000, cited several larger studies of Internet filtering products where the  outcome of filtering effectiveness was quite different.             In the Dangerous Access, 2000 edition by David Burt, the filter product,  Bess, used at the public library in Cincinnati and Hamilton County wrongly  blocked sites only .019% of the time.             A study by Michael Sims Censored Access in Utah Public Schools, 1999  found error blocking rates at .036%.  These numbers are a far cry from so-called tests being highlighted by  filtering opponents.              Christopher Hunter, a COPA panelist said:      The majority of reports about  Internet content filters being both under inclusive and over inclusive have  come from journalists and anti-censorship groups who have used largely  unscientific methods to arrive at the conclusion that filters are deeply  flawed.                    Current Approaches to Content  Filtering             There are two  typical approaches to filtering  inclusion filtering, and exclusion filtering.      Inclusion  Filtering- White Lists      With inclusion  filtering, Internet users are permitted access to particular  ""allowed"" sites. This type of filtering can be 100% effective   assuming the person or organization that has compiled the white list that  shares the same set of values as the Internet user. Because of the global  nature of the Internet, it is difficult to create with a globally accepted set  of criteria. The main drawback of  inclusion filtering is that the acceptable list would have to be enormous to  be accurate. The creation of a blocked  list tends to be more manageable.      Exclusion  Filtering      Exclusion  filtering is based on  black lists  (or   block lists ) of objectionable sites.  This is a more common form of filtering than inclusion filtering, and has the  advantage that black lists will invariably be smaller than white lists. A  second advantage is that unrated sites are presumed to be innocent till proven  guilty, and so do not need to be automatically excluded.      Both types of content filtering  require a constant effort to maintain a valid and updated list for use by the  user. The most effective approach is to  use the benefit of computer technology, coupled with unique capabilities in  human review.              What  Content Can Be Blocked?      In the early days, companies  offered 1 or more categories of blocked sites, offering little or no control to  the end-user. Today, most companies  offer multiple categories and varying levels within these categories, giving  complete control and flexibility of application to the end-user.      Some filtering providers offer  as many as 35 categories allowing the administrator complete local control over  what is being blocked. Here is an  example of a typical category listing from N2H2:      Adults  Only, Auction, Chat, Drugs, Education, Electronic Commerce, Employment Search,  For Kids, Free Mail, Free Pages, Gambling, Games, Hate/Discrimination, History,  Illegal, Jokes, Lingerie, Medical, Message/Bulletin Boards, Moderated,  Murder/Suicide, News, Nudity, Personal Information, Personals, Pornography,  Recreation/Entertainment, School Cheating Info, Search, Search Terms, Sex,  Sports, Stocks, Swimsuits,   Tasteless/Gross, Tobacco, Violence, Weapons      Most of the above categories are  not classified as illegal or detrimental in nature, but give the user a wide  range of control when determining what information is appropriate for the  viewer or more commonly, for what application the filter is being used.       An employer may want to block  access to job sites or other non-work related sites to reduce employee Internet  abuse in the workplace. Several studies  have indicated that loss of productivity from Internet use has cost employers  billions of dollars each year.      The point is filtering products  today offer the user a wide range of options and combinations that allow the  user to determine what is and is not blocked.  In the educational space, the local school board can determine what  information is appropriate to block based upon community standards, federal  laws and the individual states harmful to minors statutes.      How  Filtering Is Accomplished      There are several approaches to  filtering content. As technology has  progressed, the most effective methods have been improved, new ways to filter  have been developed and many products have taken the best features from each  approach and created a hybrid of several methods.      There are four primary methods  that are used in varying degrees.       URL Filtering      This is the most common, and  most effective form of filtering, and involves the filtering of a site based on  its URL (i.e. its address). It provides more fine-grained control than packet  filtering, since a URL can specify a particular page within a large site,  rather than specifying the IP address of the computer that hosts the Content.      S4F Technologies adds an average  of 5,000  7,000 new URLs to its database each week. Computer spiders scour the Internet using a sophisticated search  mechanism that collects potential sites for human review. Spidering computers run programs that  systematically read through the World Wide Web and collect URLs (Uniform  Resource Locators) that match a particular set of criteria established a  filtering department. These computer  can run 24 hours a day and collect potential candidates to be added to the  database. However, spiders are not  perfect, and using spiders alone as the mechanism for fortifying a blocked site  database would result in overblocking.  That is why human review must be used when accurately building a blocked  database.      During the human review process,  using custom browsers, sites can be positively identified and properly added to  the database. As soon as a site is  added, it is active in the blocked list for all to use. If a site is inadvertently blocked, it is  reviewed and a decision is made within 24 at the most. If the site contains Child Pornography it is  automatically forwarded to the National Center for Missing and Exploited  Children.      One of the challenges facing  filtering departments is managing the constant change of the Internet. When a website is reviewed, it may not  contain obscene material, but at some later point, the author of the website  may change the content that now would be considered inappropriate. Conversely, a site with content that may  have at one time been considered pornographic or illegal could change and be  perfectly acceptable. So, in addition  to keeping up new sites that come online daily, filtering departments must  constantly review those sites that are already categorized.      Considering the ongoing task of  Internet content data management, coupled with the constant change in the  Internet snapshot, filtering companies do an amazing job of keeping up.      Keyword Filtering      Keyword filtering was the first  generation of filtering. With keyword  filtering, content is scanned as it is being loaded into a users computer for  keywords, which are included in a black list. A site is blocked if it contains  any of the words in the block list.      The advantage of keyword  filtering is that it adds very little computational overhead. The main disadvantage is that it checks  text  only, and cannot block  objectionable pictures, plus, some products filters are indiscriminate, as the  context is not taken into account.      However, one of the advances of  S4F Technologies, is the development of IKSSB (Intelligent Keyword Search  String Block out) where the keyword component operates as a secondary line of  defense to the primary specific URL block out database, and has the ability to  decipher the difference between a website containing pornography, and one that  has text which contains the word pornography.        For example the IKSSB can  differentiate between searches for breast and chicken breast recipes or  another example, the difference between sex and Middlesex, England. Both of these examples have been tirelessly  used by opponents of filtering to claim that keyword filters can block useful  sites.       IKSSB Keyword Search String Examples       Blocked Not  Blocked      Sex Middlesex,  England      Sexually  Transmitted Diseases      Sex Education      Sextant             Breast Chicken  Breast      Breast Cancer                Although S4F uses this filter  component as a secondary line of defense, it exhibits the technological  adaptation of filtering companies to remedy earlier filter problems. Technical issues regarding filters have been  overcome by most leading companies in the filtering space.              Packet Sniffing      Content is delivered over the  Internet in  packets  of information.  Each packet has the IP address of where it is going to, as well as the IP  address of where it has come from. Packet sniffing involves examining the  IP address  of where the Content has  originated. This approach moves the  point of filtering to the level of the router offering increased speed and  efficiency. There are several companies  that are developing packet-sniffer products at this time.      Image recognition filtering      A handful of companies have  produced filtering products that examine images as they are delivered to a  user. This is a relatively recent approach, and relies on techniques such as  the detection of skin tones, or indeed on the analysis of images themselves. It  is computationally quite intensive, and computers will invariably experience  difficulty in distinguishing between art and pornography. A photograph that is artistic in nature  cannot be distinguished from that of obscenity. These types of value judgments can only be made by human  review. Video and other streaming  media further complicate the filtering task by supplying a constant flow of  images to be examined for undesirable content.      Where  Does Content Filtering Occur?        There  are four technical components of filtering systems: browser-based, client-side  software, proxy servers, and server-side filtering servers.      No filter is foolproof. There are 146 filtering tools listed on the  popular website  www.getnetwise.org .  Each of these products essentially falls into one of the categories  below. It is important to note that no  filtering system is designed to work well in every application.             Some of the lower-end products would not  be recommended for use in schools and libraries because they lack the specific  features that educators need to create the best filtering scenario for their  school, library and for their community. Conversely, those products that are  used in the corporate space may need more flexibility of categories, and  schools & libraries might be only interested in blocking sites that fall  into the obscene, illegal and harmful to minors categories where parents might  have other desires.      Client-Side  Software      This  type of method is typically marketed at the consumer level. Filtering can be implemented by placing a  software program on the end-users computer. The software then runs while the  user is online, performing the particular filtering functions. Client-side  software may require the end-user to configure the software and download  updated website lists.              The security  loopholes with client-side software are a concern. Many smart children can  disable filtering software faster than a parent or teacher can install it. In addition, there are quick and easy  programs written to disable the major companies software with the click of a  mouse. These programs are circulated among children who simply download it from  the Internet, place it on a floppy disk, and pass it around.             Proxy Servers      Filtering functionality  can be removed from the end-users computer and placed on a server somewhere  else on the Internet, called a proxy. With a proxy server, all website traffic  must go from the end-users computer  through   the proxy server, then to the rest of the Internet.       Proxy servers offer more security  than client-side software. All users  must go through this proxy server to be able to access the Internet proper.  To do so, the client is required to configure their software to point to this  proxy server to be able to access Web pages and ftp files. a range of  Internet-based Failure to do so will result in blocked access to the Internet.  A proxy filter can be selective about what it blocks, and can be configured to  block or permit access to services.                            Browser Settings      Filters  using built-in browser settings typically uses a ratings system. These systems are less intrusive but  typically less accurate.              Microsoft Internet Explorer  provides content security settings for the Internet Content Ratings Associations  RSACi ratings, the most popular ratings system on the market. However, if a  site is not rated, it is not accessible. Popular sites that are not rated  include ESPN, CNN, eBay, Amazon, and AOL. In fact, most sites are not rated,  making them inaccessible to the user.             Some filtering software ""decides"" what to  block based on how a site is  rated  --  not entirely unlike the way parents use movie ratings. This method offers fewer  features and less precision compared to some of the higher-end server-side products.      Hybrid Filters      There is a new filtering method  that utilizes the best features from each of the other methods. This hybrid system has varying forms. S4F Technologies patent-pending system uses  a server-side component that works in tandem with a thin client-side software  interface. By using more than one  method, the user is able to take advantage of the benefits of server-side  filtering, including real-time access to the most up-to-date database, the  speed benefit and user-control features of client-side technology.              Future  Advancements In Filtering Technology      Filtering technology providers have  dedicated thousands of man-hours and millions of dollars in research and  development to create real solutions for schools, libraries, homes and  businesses. At best, the filtering  industry is only 7 years old. The  advancements in technology over the past 2-3 years alone have brought about  products that combine artificial intelligence, advanced algorithms, intelligent  keyword databases, computer spidering technology, millions of websites  accurately categorized. All of this,  while increasing speed, efficiency and manageability through cutting edge  system design and engineering.             Internet filtering is not  foolproof. The dynamic of the Internet  as it relates to filtering can be likened to virus detection software. Products in the virus detection industry use  similar algorithms, they monitor packets being transmitted over networks, and  they have extensive databases of known viruses and their signatures, yet these  virus detection tools are not fool-proof, still network administrators  world-wide use these programs to protect their networks because that can offer  a high level of protection, even if it is not 100%.              It seems that the opponents of  filtering technology wish to cast down the use of any filtering software  because it might only be 95-99% effective.  Opponents are trying to hold filtering software to a higher standard  than other types of similar and related products. Windows and Macintosh operating systems, Internet dial-up  connections, computer manufacturers and virtually any software application  manufacturer all create and sell products that are not fool-proof and error  free. That is why software companies continue  to release updates and create new versions, to keep up with the ever-changing  marketplace. It is an acceptable part  of the computer industry.             Future filtering technology  advancements will see the convergence of several of the approaches  reviewed.       Are There  Other Alternatives To Filtering?      Some of the opponents of the Childrens Internet  Protection Act have suggested that filtering is not necessary; rather, a strong  education program that trains children how to have a positive Internet  experience is all that is needed.      Although I feel that education is a great way to  teach children about the dangers of the Internet, it is surely no replacement  for technology protection measures. The  biggest problem is that much of the pornographic and illegal exposure to minors  is accidental. The National Center For Missing and Exploited Children released  a study where 1 in 4 minors reported viewing of unwanted material. It is a well-known fact that in an effort to  increase viewer ship, operators of obscenity websites will use unrelated  keywords and misleading URLs to attract unsuspecting users to their site. Once the image is viewed, the damage is done  and the law has been broken. All the  education in the world cannot stop that from happening.       To illustrate this erroneous argument, consider  drivers education. Millions of  teenagers and adults each year take some form of drivers education or  training. Yet the government has put  seatbelt laws in place to protect people from harm. All the drivers education in the world cannot stop accidents  from happening. Seat belt laws do not  guarantee to protect the passenger 100% of the time, in the same way that  Internet filters cannot ever guarantee 100% perfect performance, yet they are a  great tool to divert the vast majority of Internet abuse in schools and  libraries.      Monitoring has been considered as an alternative to  filtering. This approach places the  burden of policing the Internet on educators and librarians who cannot possibly  mange the activities of every Internet user.  Once again, if sites are accidentally seen, the damage has been done.      Can Existing  Technology Protection Measures Meet The Requirements Of The Childrens Internet  Protection Act?      The answer is a resounding  yes. The Childrens Internet Protection  Act requires that a school or library select a technology protection measure,  which they choose, not the government through a public hearing and the creation  of an Internet safety policy. The local board determines what to block based  upon Federal and state laws as well as local community standards.             This law encourages public  education and empowers consumers and local authorities to work together to  create a solution that is right for everyone.  Schools and libraries have the affirmative duty to protect minors while  in their custody. Using technology  protection measures shows that educators are taking reasonable steps to protect  their kids.      Effective filtering technology  exists and is effective.              The leading filtering products in  the educational space already have the necessary functionality to meet the  requirements of the law. Here is a  profile of those products:      CIPA related features  comparison of the most popular filters in public schools and public libraries.

A new study [1] by the U.S.  National Commission on Libraries and Information Science shows a dramatic  increase in the number of Public Libraries using Internet filters. In 1998, just 1,679 public libraries  offering public Internet access filtered some or all Internet access. [2] In 2000, that number more than doubled to  3,711, [3] representing an increase of 121%.              One in four Public Libraries  offering public Internet access now use filters.     Overall, 24.6% of Public Libraries offering public Internet access use  filtering on some or all terminals. [4]  This percentage represents an increase from 14.6% in 1998. [5] The fact that the number of Libraries  filtering has more than doubled, while the overall percentage of Libraries  filtering has not doubled is explained by the fact that the total population of  Libraries offering public Internet access has increased from 11,519 in 1998  [6] to 15,128 in 2000 [7].              The most dramatic gains came in  Libraries filtering some Internet access, which increased from 801 or 7.0% in  1998 [8], to 2,265 or 15.0% in 2000 [9].  Data from this study indicate that there has been a 65% increase in  Public Libraries filtering all public Internet access since 1998. The number of Libraries that filter all  access has climbed from 878 or 7.6% in 1998 [10], to 1,446 or 9.6%. [11]  Nearly  1,500 public libraries (one out of every ten) filter all access today.               A Survey shows that librarians  and teachers are highly satisfied with filters.    In April-May of 2000, respected library researcher Dr. Ken Haycock  conducted a survey of school librarians and public librarians on the use of  filtering software, for the magazine School Library Journal, a publication of  Cahners Research. [12]             An astonishing 90% of public librarians who used filters responded that  ""the software serves its purpose"" either ""very well"" or  ""somewhat well"" .

""We got it on a trial basis, and it seemed to  work,"" Sumler said. Called I-Gear, the application is produced by Symantec  Corp., maker of Norton AntiVirus software. I-Gear resides on the computer  server, rather than on individual PCs, and Sumler said it allows librarians to  set a variety of levels for blocking Web sites.              She said that if a patron complains that the technology is blocking a  legitimate site, librarians easily can override the controls. ""If there  are complaints, librarians are to deal with them right away,"" Sumler said.  ""We don't want to deny access."" ""We think this works for  us,"" she said. [16]             David C. Ruff, executive director of the Rolling Meadows (IL) Library:      Expanding the filtering technology to block obscenity and pornography  on the library's 20 public computers was based on the library's satisfaction  with the Cyber Patrol software and the desire to simplify some administrative  procedures, said David C. Ruff, the library's executive directorIn the week  since the filtering policy was expanded, patrons have not noticed the  difference, Ruff said. [17]                           Joan Adams, director of the Jefferson Parish (LA) Public Libraries:      After several months of wrangling with software companies, parish  officials on Thursday finally finished installing filtering software on about  100 computers, cementing the Parish Council's promise to do what it legally can  to keep perverts and smut out of public libraries. But for most computer users who sat quietly pecking away at their  keyboards, the added restrictions were hardly detectable""I've gotten a  lot of 'what if?' questions from the librarians,"" [Library Director Joan]  Adams said. ""But the average computer user doesn't even notice it is  there.""              So far, the WebSense software does not seem to be slowing down the  speed of library computers, a common side effect to installing filtering  software, library network administrator Dwight Bluford said. The software  program also seems to be fairly on target with the sites it blocks. That's  because WebSense searches the content of Internet Web sites to determine if  there is offensive content, not the keywords, he said. ""It seems to be working well,""  Bluford said. And because it can be locally manipulated, ""we also have the  ability to immediately block a site if we get a complaint from a patron, or to  unblock a legitimate site if it is blocked."" [18]             Library patrons and staff at the Plano (TX) Public Library:    James Engelbrecht wasn't too happy when Plano  libraries were compelled to install Internet filtering software on their  computers late last year. Because he doesn't have Internet access at home, Mr.  Engelbrecht uses the computers at the L.E.R. Schimelpfenig and Maribelle M.  Davis libraries about twice a week.  ""When it was first implemented, I wasn't crazy about it,"" Mr.  Engelbrecht said of the filtering policy. ""I thought it was another  bureaucratic layer."" To his surprise, the BESS filtering software hasn't  impeded his ability to navigate his way around cyberspace. ""It's not  burdensome,"" he said. ""If I do find a site blocked, I can ask to use  an unfiltered computer."" While the  controversial policy was debated for a year before it was launched in December,  its implementation appears to have been fairly undramatic. [19]             Erin Noll Halovanic, Information Systems Librarian at Kenton County  (KY) Library:      Halovanic says if a customer complains about not being able to access a  site that's supposedly suitable, she reviews it on an unfiltered staff PC and  unblocks the site if she finds it appropriate for the library. And that seems  to be a good compromise for Halovanic who admits, ""As a librarian,  filtering absolutely curdles my blood. It goes against my training as a  librarian and my belief in librarianship. However, when it comes to the choice  between pandering sexual materials and between protecting people's personal rights,  I choose filtering over the alternative."" [20]             Margaret Barnes, Director, Dallas (OR) Public Library:      After much conversation and serious reflection, it was determined that  a workable approach, enabling the Dallas Library to furnish access to the  public, would be the installation of a filter system on all public Internet  stations...During the almost 1 1/2 years that we have been providing this  service we have had no one formally or really informally register an objection  about a filter system being in place on the workstations. We have received  countless positive comments about this service from all ages in our community.  [21]                    Judith Drescher, Director Memphis-Shelby County (TN)Library:      The library system's switch to pornography-blocking software has gone so  smoothly that it could be considered a nonevent. The Memphis area's chief  librarian, Judith Drescher, told a Shelby County Commission committee Wednesday  that more than half the      26 public queries about blocking software had nothing to do with the  new softwareIn a report given to the commission's education and libraries  committee, Drescher stated, ""Since installation, the library has received  no requests from the public to review and block a site. Library staff has  submitted five sites for review, all of which were blocked."" [22]              FOOTNOTES FOR PRODUCT SURVEY      1.

GX235-72-12549090	"Posted: June 12, 1998  Updated: October 12, 1998  Updated: February 10, 1999     Click for Latest Proposed Ephedrine Rules     Click for TDH News Release on Latest Proposed Ephedrine Rules            Texas Department of Health   Ephedrine   Questions and Answers      UPDATE  The question and answer document below pertains to a set of  proposed  ephedrine  rules approved by the Texas Board of Health at its May 15, 1998  meeting.   Those proposed rules lapsed in November 1998. (Texas law requires  that proposed rules be finalized within six months of their proposal  dates.)   A new set of  proposed  ephedrine rules was approved  by the Board of Health on Jan. 12, 1999. See above links for more  information about these  proposed  rules.                On May 15, 1998, the Texas Board of Health proposed rules that would restrict the sale of  some products that contain ephedrine.          1)   What are  the Texas Board of Health rules intended to do?   The proposed rules would classify ephedrine as a dangerous drug and require a prescription for  most ephedrine- containing products sold in Texas.  A dangerous drug is one that is unsafe for  self-medication.  The Board of Health has the authority to require a prescription for a  dangerous drug if that drug has been shown to be abused or misused.  Prescription status  implies that a drug is used under the supervision of a licensed physician.         2)   Why were these  rules proposed?   More than 1,400 reports of a wide range of adverse effects, including eight deaths, associated  with the use of ephedrine have been recorded in Texas since 1993. The Board of Health is  concerned with the safety of these products, especially when self-administered, and believes  requiring a prescription under the supervision of a physician will greatly reduce the threats  to individual health associated with these products.        3)   How do the 1,400 incidents  break down by product type and age group?   Half the reports were associated with ephedrine-containing dietary supplements; half with  energy-boosting drugs that contain ephedrine.  About 90 percent of the dietary supplement  users were adults, and 60 percent of those using the energy-boosting drugs were kids.   Though other factors may have been involved in some of the deaths, the eight people who died  were adults who had used dietary supplements containing ephedrine.         4)     What is ephedrine?   Ephedrine is an amphetamine-like drug, a stimulant, found naturally in ma huang, a group of  Chinese herbs in the ephedra genus of plants.  Ephedrine can be extracted from its natural  plant sources and used in concentrated amounts with other substances.  Ephedrine also can be  produced synthetically.  All ephedrine in the U.S. is imported.        5)     How is ephedrine used?  Ephedrine is an ingredient in many dietary supplements and so-called energy-boosting drugs.   However, the only over-the-counter uses of ephedrine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration are in products sold for the treatment of hemorrhoids, hay fever, mild asthma  and nasal decongestion.  Prescription injectable ephedrine is used in hospitals and emergencies  to raise or maintain blood pressure in shock patients.         6)     How can ephedrine be dangerous?   Ephedrine is a powerful stimulant that affects the cardiovascular and central nervous  systems.  Sensitivity to the drug may vary greatly from person to person.  Even small amounts  of ephedrine can cause strong adverse reactions in some people.  In Texas ephedrine has been  associated with headaches, irregular heartbeats, elevated blood pressure, seizures,  hallucinations, psychoses, strokes, heart attacks and deaths.  The long term effects of the  regular use of ephedrine, even among people who suffer no immediate side-effects, are  unknown.         7)     How can ephedrine products be misused and abused?   Misuse occurs when a substance is used for a purpose not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration.  Reports of adverse events associated with over-the-counter ephedrine-containing  products indicate that these products had been used to get high, stay awake, lose weight,  enhance athletic performance or boost energy levels.  None of these uses is approved by the  U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  Records of calls to Texas Poison Control Centers document  that school-age children consider over-the-counter drug products containing ephedrine as  ""legal"" cheap alternatives to amphetamines (speed) and other illicit stimulants and  hallucinogens.  Teens are taking more than the package-recommended dosages of these products  to lose weight, enhance athletic performance, boost energy or get high.  Other teenagers have  used the products to attempt suicide.         8)     What is ma huang?   Ma huang is a Chinese term for a group of herbs in the ephedra plant genus that contain  naturally occurring ephedrine.  Though some types of ephedra grow in North America, none  contains ephedrine.         9)     How is ma huang used?   In traditional Chinese herbal medicine, the above-ground portion of ma huang plants is used  by herbal practitioners, usually for short time periods, to treat respiratory problems and  edema (swelling).  A common practice is to use the plants to brew a tea.  In the brewing  process, ephedrine is extracted from the plants into the tea.  Ma huang also is an ingredient  in many dietary supplements and energy-boosting drug products.         10)     Is ma huang dangerous?  Though there is no established guaranteed safe ephedrine-use level, health authorities  believe the low level of ephedrine in raw ma huang and its bitter taste discourage its  misuse and abuse -- especially as prescribed in traditional Chinese herbal medicine under  the direction of trained practitioners.  None of the 1,400-plus adverse effects associated  with ephedrine involved the use of raw, unprocessed, unenhanced ma huang.         11)     If ephedrine is relatively safe as found in the ma huang plant,  why isn't it safe as found in these dietary supplements and energy boosters?   The dried unprocessed plant typically has an ephedrine level of less than one percent.   Concentrated ephedrine has been added to the ma huang in many dietary supplements and  so-called energy-boosting drug products resulting in an ephedrine level four to 12 times  higher than found in raw ma huang.  These elevated concentrated levels of ephedrine present  a far greater risk to users and increase the potential for misuse and abuse.  It is these  products that are affected by the proposed rules.         12)     Will people who use ma huang still be able to use it?   Yes.  The new rules would not require a prescription for ma huang in its raw state or  for products that contain minimally processed (cut, dried and ground) ma huang.    However, if anything is done to concentrate or increase the ephedrine content of such a product,  that product would require a prescription.         13)     Will people who use dietary supplements and energy boosters affected  by these rules still be able to get them?   Yes, with a prescription given under the supervision of a physician.         14)     Will people who live in Texas still be able to obtain and possess  restricted ephedrine products through mail order or by purchasing them in states where there  are no restrictions?   Not legally.  The restricted products could not be sold, distributed, introduced into commerce,  manufactured, produced, packaged, exposed, offered, possessed or held for sale, dispensed or  given away in Texas.  Texas law prohibits the possession of a prescription drug without a valid  prescription.         15)     Will it take long for affected products to be available under the  prescription process?   Manufacturers who choose not to reformulate their products will need to relabel these products.   The label would indicate that the product is prescription-only.  How long this takes will vary  from manufacturer to manufacturer.         16)     Will the affected products only be available in pharmacies, or  drug stores?   Yes.  By Texas law, prescription drugs can only be sold in licensed pharmacies.         17)     Will products affected by these rules cost more as prescription  items?   Possibly.  Neither the Board of Health nor the Texas Department of Health establishes product  prices.  Any cost increase to the individual consumer -- including charges for physician  visits (to obtain a prescription) -- could be offset by health insurance coverage of  physician visits and prescriptions, subject to individual insurance company decisions.   Any increase in out-of-pocket costs for the consumer could be viewed as a small price to  pay to reduce the health risks associated with the self-administration of these  products.         18)     Isn't the federal government considering nationwide restrictions  of ephedrine?  If so, why does Texas need to take action on its own?   Yes, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration are  considering regulations restricting products that contain ephedrine.  However, the federal  process will not happen quickly.  The Board of Health believes it must proceed with rules to  reduce the incidence of adverse events associated with ephedrine in Texas.         19)     Is Texas the only state to take action against ephedrine?   No.  At least 27 other states have placed restrictions on various ephedrine-containing products.   Some 23 of these states require a prescription for certain ephedrine products.   Fifteen of these also have classified certain ephedrine products as  controlled substances ,  a stronger categorization than Texas' proposed  dangerous drug  classification.       Controlled Substance+Prescription:  Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Montana,     Nebraska, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,  South Dakota, Wisconsin       Prescription:  Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Tennessee,  Washington      Other Restrictions:  California, Hawaii, New York, Pennsylvania         20)     What are some brand names of products that would be restricted  under the new rules?   Unless they are reformulated to remove elevated levels of ephedrine, some of the dietary  supplements affected include: BioLean, Cloud 9, Formula One, Herbal Ecstacy, Metabolife,  Ripped Fuel, Thermajetics and Thermo Chrome 5000.  So-called energy-boosting drug products  affected include: 357 Magnum, GoFast, MaxBrand (formerly called MaxAlert) and Mini Two-Way  Action (formerly sold as Mini Thins).  Products not affected by the rules include Bronkaid and  Primatene tablets and Pazo, an external preparation to reduce hemorrhoid swelling.         21)     How are these products distributed or sold?   Many of the dietary supplements are sold by mail order and via multi-level marketing plans.   Some are available in health food stores.  The energy-boosting drug products are readily  available in truck stops, head shops and convenience stores.  There is no minimum age  requirement to purchase these products.         22)     Does the Board of Health expect much opposition to the new rules?  If so, from whom?   Yes.  The manufacture, distribution and sale of ephedrine-containing products affected by  the rules is a multi-billion dollar industry in the U.S.  Continued opposition to the rules  is expected, especially from companies and individuals who derive income from the unrestricted  sale of these products.         23)     Isn't it unfair to deprive people who sell these  products of income?   Health issues are often also financial issues.  The Board of Health has been continuously  told of the financial losses possible under these rules.  However, the Board's responsibility  is the health and safety of Texas residents.  There is nothing in the proposed rules to  prohibit manufacturers from providing their distributors and retailers with reformulated  products that are exempt from the prescription requirements.         24)     Why not just require these products to have a warning  label?   A warning label would not address concerns with the ready access of these products to anyone  regardless of age or health status.  A warning label also would not address the Board of  Health's safety concern that ephedrine, as a dangerous drug, be administered only under the  supervision of a licensed practitioner.         25)     Why not just restrict the sale of ephedrine products to  adults?   The Board of Health does not have the authority under Texas law to restrict the sale of  products to specified consumer age groups.  Were such a restriction possible, it still would  not address the safety concern that ephedrine, as a dangerous drug, should be administered  only under the supervision of a licensed practitioner.         26)     How do doctors feel about ephedrine and its restrictions?   The Texas Department of Health and the Texas Medical Association convened two separate  medical/scientific panels on ephedrine.  These panels were made up of physicians, toxicologists  and other health professionals.  Both panels recommended prescription status for products  containing ephedrine.  Support of restrictions of ephedrine also has been received from  individual physicians, nurses, emergency room personnel, educators, dieticians and others,  including family members of those reporting adverse events.         27)     How do I report a bad experience with ephedrine?   Adverse reactions associated with ephedrine may be reported by calling the Texas Department of  Health toll-free at 1-888-839-6676.         28)     How do I offer comments on the rules?   Written comments may be mailed to: Texas Department of Health, Drugs and Medical Devices  Division, 1100 W. 49th St., Austin, TX 78756.  Mailed comments should be postmarked on or  before June 29, 1998.         29)     What gives the Board of Health the authority to pass such  a rule?   Texas law.  The Texas Health and Safety Code (483.003) gives the board the authority to  limit the availability of an abused drug by permitting its dispensing only with a prescription  from a licensed practitioner.  Another section (431.021) prohibits the introduction or  delivery into commerce of any food or drug that is adulterated and prohibits the dissemination  of any false advertisement.  And 431.241 and 12.001 give the board the authority to adopt  rules for the performance of every duty imposed by law on the board, the Texas Department of  Health and the Commissioner of Health.         30)     What is the process for the rules to become final?  (See update at top.)   The  proposed rules  were published in the May 29, 1998 issue of the Texas Register.  A 30-day  public comment period will follow.  A public hearing to receive verbal comments from the public  was held June 3, 1998.  The board is expected to reconsider the rules in September.  The rules  would become effective 20 days following Texas Register publication of the final rules.      Send Comments   Go to TDH Home Page"
GX063-40-11703237	"Investigators' Reports   Illegal Use of Vet Drug Results in Fines, Probation   by Dixie Farley     Investigation by FDA agents in Missouri and New York led last fall to fines and probation for one man and deferred prosecution for another on charges of prescription drug misbranding and product tampering.   On Sept. 8, 1995, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, St. Louis, fined Joseph Schilling, 31, of St. Louis, $1,000 with $25 special assessment, and sentenced him to three years' probation with mandatory drug testing. Schilling had pleaded guilty to drug misbranding caused by dispensing a prescription drug without a license.   On Oct. 17, 1995, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, New York City, accepted Dean Gabriel, 25, of New York City, into a six-months deferred prosecution program. Gabriel was charged with product tampering.   Following a tip from an informant, St. Louis police began surveillance of Schilling on Feb. 11, 1994, arresting him sometime after midnight on suspicion of possessing a narcotic and marijuana. In Schilling's apartment, the police seized drug paraphernalia and vials of suspected Ketaset (ketamine), a veterinary anesthethic. Schilling cooperated with the police and named Gabriel as his source.   Because FDA regulates Ketaset as a veterinary drug and the drug is not a controlled substance regulated by the Drug Enforcement Administration, the police notified the agency's Kansas City Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI), which in turn notified OCI agents in the New York field office, Jersey City, N.J. In deference to probable federal charges, the local charges were held in abeyance.   Kansas City agents began investigating Schilling, and New York agents investigated Gabriel with surveillance, examination of subpoenaed bank and telephone records, and electronic monitoring.   The agents learned Schilling had met Gabriel in 1993 during a Thanksgiving vacation in Miami. Schilling had some ""Special K,"" the street name for Ketaset, which they both used to get high.   Schilling told agents that after he and Gabriel returned home from Miami, he asked Gabriel to supply him with more Special K, and that Gabriel had done so twice. On March 28, at OCI's request, Schilling ordered more Special K from Gabriel, receiving 30 vials, worth about $1,350, on April 28.   Testing by FDA's Forensic Chemistry Center, in Cincinnati, determined the substance in the vials was indeed ketamine.   In October, OCI agents asked the New York U.S. attorney to file a complaint. Gabriel was arrested Nov. 16, 1994, on charges of tampering with Ketaset by altering it so that it could be used illegally, thus risking injury to another person.   On June 8, 1995, Schilling pleaded guilty to an information charging him with misbranding a prescription veterinary drug in interstate commerce.   Gabriel's deferred prosecution program requires him to report to a pretrial services officer, obey laws, associate only with law-abiding individuals, and remain within the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York or the District of New Jersey unless his supervising officer grants him permission to leave. If Gabriel meets these conditions throughout the six months, the government will not prosecute him.    Dixie Farley is a staff writer for FDA Consumer.        Cheese Maker Says He Wants Out    An Ohio cheese manufacturer and distributor told the government he would go out of business rather than comply with a court order to rid his operations of dangerous bacteria and filth.   On July 12, 1995, Dominic Gangale, owner of Union Cheese Co., Sugarcreek, Ohio, told U.S. Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Hemann in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio that the firm had ceased all cheese production, and he wanted only to sell the cheese in stock.   The judge had ordered the firm on June 16 to stop making and distributing cheese until it could ensure that the cheese was not contaminated with pathogenic bacteria or filth.   In 1994, samples of cheese had tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes, an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in small children, frail and elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms, such as high fever, severe headaches, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths in pregnant women.    Union Cheese produced about 20,000 pounds (9,072 kg) of Swiss cheese daily and usually kept an inventory of about 1 million pounds (454,000 kilograms) of cheese, both its own Swiss, as well as different kinds from other manufacturers.   On Sept. 29 and 30, 1994, Phillip Pontikos, an investigator with FDA's Brunswick, Ohio, office, inspected Union Cheese as part of the agency's scheduled surveillance of food manufacturers.   Pontikos found numerous violations of good manufacturing practices. In one container of brine and cheese, he counted more than 30 floating dead flies. He also saw dead insects on blocks of cheese and hundreds of dead insects, cobwebs and dirt on windowsills.   He also noted that there was no hot running water in the restrooms, brine room, or laboratory.   Pontikos discussed these problems with Annette Gangale, daughter of the owner. She agreed to discuss the problems with her father.   Pontikos sent samples of cheese to FDA's lab in Cincinnati. One sample tested positive for Listeria.   The agency advised the firm of the sample analysis, and as a result, Union Cheese recalled cheese from the contaminated lot. But the recall could not be completed because the company had not properly coded cheese lots. Gangale admitted that he did not know exactly what firms had bought the cheese.   On Oct. 27 and 28 and Nov. 7, Pontikos returned to Union Cheese and collected more samples of cheese and environmental samples, including brine and various materials from the floor. Several of the environmental samples tested positive for Listeria.   On Nov. 29, Pontikos, along with FDA investigators Steve Kilker and Frederick Lochner, returned to Union Cheese. In a two-week-long investigation, they found many of the same problems Pontikos had seen previously, as well as:   raw and finishing operations not being kept sufficiently separate  Swiss cheese being shipped before the end of the required 60-day aging period  ceiling condensation dripping onto uncovered cheese  peeling ceiling paint directly above the cutting table  cutting tools that could not be sanitized because of wooden handles and rusty screws.   On Feb. 22, 1995, the agency asked the Justice Department to initiate injunction proceedings against Union Cheese. But, to confirm that the problems still existed, the court ordered another inspection. When FDA investigators returned to inspect the firm from May 16 to 18, many of the same insanitary conditions still existed. One instance in which some effort was made to improve things only made matters worse. A fan, placed in the cutting room to prevent condensation from dripping on cheese, drew air into the facility from the direction of the firm's sewage treatment plant.   At a three-day hearing begun June 5, Gangale did not dispute the investigators' findings. He said, however, that, in his opinion, these problems did not violate good manufacturing practices.   At the end of the hearing, Judge Hemann ordered Union Cheese to close until violations were corrected.   On July 12, the court entered a supplemental order clarifying the conditions the defendants must comply with before they would be allowed to sell cheese in stock. Those conditions called for FDA to supervise the testing of each lot of cheese for Listeria and to ensure that the cheese would be handled under sanitary conditions.   All the in-stock cheese--3,981 blocks, each weighing 200 pounds (90.7 kg)--tested free of Listeria, but one lot was insect-infested. All were sold except for the insect-infested lot (72 blocks). At press time in February, Gangale still had not destroyed the insect-infected lot.   --Dori Stehlin       Animal Drug Maker Overhauls System    A major manufacturer of generic animal drugs chose to overhaul its injectable drug processing system following a government seizure of thousands of dollars worth of drugs, a partial factory shutdown, and a consent decree in which the company agreed to correct violations.   At press time in February, Anthony Products Co., of Arcadia, Calif., was planning to have its new injectables' operation at its El Monte, Calif., plant up and running this spring, pending FDA's concurrence, according to Mary LoVetere, a compliance officer with FDA's Los Angeles district office. The company already replaced its injectables' system at its Irwindale, Calif., plant.   The company reportedly bought new equipment, hired new people, and revised manufacturing procedures and controls so that its injectable drug product line would comply with good manufacturing practices (GMPs), she said.   Anthony Products makes various veterinary medicines, including injectable forms of antibiotics, anesthetics and other drugs for large and small animals. It manufactures drugs under its own brand name and other companies' labels.   The company agreed to correct GMP violations in a consent decree it signed Aug. 3, 1995, in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.   In March 1995, U.S. marshals had seized, at FDA's request, about 200 drums of drug ingredients and 8,000 vials of injectable drugs. The company's injectable drug system at its El Monte plant has been idle since. Its penicillin production line at its Irwindale plant resumed manufacturing in June 1995.   Previously, FDA sent Anthony Products several warning letters for failing to follow GMPs for its injectable drugs. The most recent warning was issued in May 1994, and company officials responded that they would correct the violations.   However, during a reinspection in August and September 1994, FDA investigators found continuing problems, as well as some new ones. The problems revolved around the company's failure to ensure the sterility and quality of its injectable products.   FDA decided to seek a seizure to spur the company to correct repeated violations and to make sure that adulterated drugs did not reach consumers.   On March 3, 1995, U.S. marshals seized all injectable drugs and injectable drug ingredients in Anthony's possession.   In the consent decree, FDA agreed to return the raw ingredients to Anthony Products for testing under GMPs. The seized drugs will be disposed of by U.S. marshals.   --Paula Kurtzweil     Filth in Fish Fillets Closes Business    A food business closed after an FDA inspection found flies, condensate dripping on smoked salmon fillets, racks of product placed against fish-residue-encrusted walls, and fillets being trimmed with rusty pliers.   FDA investigators found those and other unsanitary conditions at Sotra Smoked Fish, U.S.A. Inc., Kingston, N.Y., after routine agency sampling showed products contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, bacteria that can cause potentially fatal illness.   About 25 percent of such infections result in death, said FDA microbiology expert Joseph Madden, Ph.D., in testimony concerning Sotra. ""Symptoms are most severe in the elderly, infants, pregnant women, and those people whose immune systems are impaired,"" he said.   Sotra principal officers Olav Isaksen and Joel Kudlowitz signed a consent decree of permanent injunction last June 23 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York. Isaksen is president and treasurer, and Kudlowitz is vice president and secretary. Sotra is closed until it can meet the decree's terms, which include a cleanup and an extensive testing program supervised by FDA's Buffalo district office.   On June 1, 1994, investigator Thomas Morgan, of FDA's Boston district office, sampled Sotra's fillets at a smokehouse in Bennington, Vt., as part of the agency's seafood sampling program. Testing at FDA's Winchester Engineering and Analytical Center, in Winchester, Mass., detected Listeria, and Boston informed the agency's Buffalo office.   Buffalo FDA investigator Margaret Slimbach visited Sotra July 7 to present the test results.   Meanwhile, according to Buffalo compliance officer Raymond Kent, FDA discussed Sotra with the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets, which inspects manufacturers for FDA under contract. In August 1993, the agency learned, the state had sent Sotra a warning letter and levied a $300 fine because of continuing unsanitary conditions seen during several state inspections in 1992 and 1993.   On July 12, Slimbach and Samuel Eskenazi, a microbiologist with FDA's Northeast Regional Laboratory, began an extensive inspection of the food plant. On the third day, Sotra agreed to recall the lot sampled in Vermont.   The FDA team discovered gross unsanitary conditions and practices. The freezer and cooler handles, for example, were slick with dirty residues. And the cooler door had been left standing open about an hour and a half, the inside temperature unmonitored. Using an FDA thermometer, Slimbach found the temperature to be 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15 Celsius), when it should have been below 40 F (4 C). (Listeria bacteria can grow at 40 F, but not as fast as at higher temperatures.)   Other problems included:   inadequate use of hair coverings  no use of hand sanitizing solution  handling of fish with unwashed hands after returning from the restroom or other areas or after touching unsanitized equipment  routine placement of racks of fish against a cement wall encrusted with residues from previous operations  fish lying directly below the cooler's bottom panel, which was heavily coated with condensate droplets  use of rusty pliers for trimming products  uncleanable floors and walls due to pitting, cracks and peeling  residue-encrusted fillet rinsing hose touching the dirty floor  flies (known to transmit Listeria bacteria) in the production room  no tray to catch dead flies under the electric fly zapper.   Slimbach and Eskenazi collected swabs from numerous sites in the plant for contaminant testing. At the end of the inspection, they informed Sotra of the problems. Isaksen and Kudlowitz promised immediate corrections.   FDA's Northeast Regional Laboratory's testing of the swabs showed Listeria on such sites as the slicing and skinning machine blades, condensate dripping onto salmon, stagnant water in the cooler, on cooler and freezer door handles, on the wall, and under the fly zapper. The bacterium was also identified in samples of finished salmon.   On Aug. 18, 1994, Slimbach returned to Sotra with a state investigator to present these test results and see whether the firm had cleaned up. It hadn't. The state seized all fish at the plant. Kudlowitz agreed to recall the sampled lots and to destroy them and the seized product.   On Nov. 13, 1994, FDA asked the Department of Justice to file an injunction against Sotra. In a letter two days later, FDA informed Isaksen that the agency considered the recalled salmon to have posed a life-threatening health hazard, and that Sotra must take appropriate measures to prevent further contamination.   In signing the consent decree, Sotra agreed not to process, prepare, pack, label, hold, or sell food in interstate commerce until it:   establishes methods, facilities and controls that ensure foods do not become contaminated with pathogenic bacteria or filth  provides certification to FDA by a qualified outside person that the sanitation control program is adequate  provides a written report to FDA detailing actions taken to ensure that foods are not contaminated or held under unsanitary conditions  has food tested by a qualified outside laboratory for Listeria, with results and analytical worksheets submitted to FDA  establishes a label review program, supervised by a qualified person, that ensures legal labeling  receives written notice from FDA that the requirements appear to be met.   FDA will closely monitor Sotra when it resumes operating. For example, for three months, Sotra is to have an outside laboratory conduct bacterial testing of finished and in-process products, food contact surfaces, and other sites and report results to FDA. If bacteria are found, testing is to continue as long as FDA specifies.   FDA is unaware of any complaints or illnesses related to Sotra products.   ""We're still monitoring the second recall,"" FDA's Kent says.   --Dixie Farley          FDA Consumer magazine (April 1996)"
GX002-97-7007141	"The     Gifting Club ""Gotcha""       W hen is a gift not a gift? When     it’s a ""gotcha.""       In a scam spreading throughout the mid-Atlantic states and the Pacific     Northwest, people pay to join a ""gifting club,"" billed in promotional materials     as a private club with members eager to help new friends -- often from within their own     neighborhood or church group.        In reality, the clubs are illegal pyramid schemes. New club members give     cash ""gifts"" to the highest-ranking club members, with titles such as     ""captains."" And they’re promised that if they get additional members to     join the club, they, too, will rise to become captains and receive money – far more     than they initially paid to join the club -- from newer club ""friends.""       The problem is that, like most pyramid schemes, illegal gifting clubs must     continually recruit ever-increasing numbers of members to survive. When the clubs     don’t attract enough new members, they collapse. Most members who paid to join the     clubs never receive the financial ""gifts"" they expected, and lose everything     they paid to join the club.        Don’t Get on the Receiving End of a Gifting Club     ""Gotcha""       Promises of quick, easy money can be a powerful lure – especially     when it comes with the additional benefit of new friendships.        If you’re approached about joining a club but you aren’t sure if     it’s an illegal gifting club, the Federal Trade Commission reminds you to:               Consider that a legitimate gift has no strings attached and is not an         ""investment.""                  Avoid being misled into thinking a gifting club is legitimate because         the ads say that members consider their payments a gift and expect nothing in return. This         is an attempt to make an illegal transaction look legal.                 Be wary of success stories or testimonials of tremendous payoffs. Very         few members of illegal gifting clubs or pyramid schemes ever receive any money.                 Take your time. Don’t buckle under to a high-pressure sales pitch         that requires you to join immediately or risk losing out on the opportunity. Remember,         solid opportunities – and solid friendships – aren’t formed through         nerve-wracking tactics.

Baltimore Orioles pitching prospect Steve Bechler died on Monday after collapsing during spring training. Bechler, 23, was slightly overweight and ephedra supplements were found in his locker.   Broward County, Florida, Medical Examiner Dr. Joshua Perper said he believed the supplement had something to do with Bechler's death from heatstroke. He said he had learned that Bechler took three daily tablets of Xenadrine RFA-1, one brand of supplement containing ephedra.   The NFL, the International Olympic Committee and the National Collegiate Athletics Association have banned ephedra use among players, but baseball leagues have not. ""I would like to hope that this very unfortunate and tragic death would prompt, perhaps, the baseball association and other groups to ban them from their practice,"" Perper told a news conference on Tuesday.   But manufacturers of the supplement insist their product is safe when taken as directed. Consumer groups hope to get ephedra banned completely and US government health officials are looking into it.   The Health and Human Services department has commissioned the RAND research corporation to do a report on the safety of ephedra. It is due next month.   Earlier this month, a team of researchers in San Francisco said they had found that ephedra is responsible for 64% of all adverse reactions reported from herb use, although ephedra products account for less than 1% of such supplements sold.   Writing in the Annals of Internal Medicine, they said that people who take ephedra products are 200 times more likely to suffer a complication from it than from other supplements.   The New England Journal of Medicine published an analysis two years ago that found 54 deaths linked to use of ephedra since 1995. Public Citizen, a consumers' advocacy group, says 100 deaths have now been reported.   In January, the Mayo Clinic Proceedings published a study that reviewed reports of so-called adverse reactions linked to ephedra. Even at recommended doses, it found 11 sudden deaths, 16 strokes and 10 heart attacks in patients who took products containing ephedrine.   Cytodyne Technologies of Manasquan, New Jersey, which makes Xenadrine RFA-1, said its product had been tested and found safe. It said the recommended dose was two tablets.   ""Due to the lack of medical evidence available at this time, Cytodyne is unable to specifically comment on the circumstances surrounding the tragic death of Steve Bechler,"" the company said in a statement.   ""Until the toxicology report becomes available the cause of death remains unknown and may never be known. What is clear is that Xenadrine has been the subject of numerous clinical trials on people, which have conclusively demonstrated that the product is safe and effective when used as directed.""

Page 6         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Mr.  BURTON.  The committee will come to order.      I want to apologize for a lot of Members not being here. We had a rule on the floor that went down just a short time ago, and there is a conference going on with a large number of our members expressing their discontent with some of the things that have happened; and I don't know if you have ever been in a food fight, but those things happen from time to time, and I decided to extract myself from that and come up here to be at the meeting. I don't know what the Democrats are doing, but we have two fine Democrat Representatives here so——      Mr.  KUCINICH.  We are in a supplement fight.      Mr.  BURTON.  We are getting ready to go on a break back in our districts.      The Chair sees a quorum and a quorum being present, the Committee on Government Reform will come to order. I ask unanimous consent that all Members' and witnesses' opening statements be included in the record, and without objection, so ordered.      We are here today to continue our dialog with the Food & Drug Administration on their regulation of dietary supplements. Today's hearing will focus on the need for a better system to monitor adverse events with dietary supplements.      The Food & Drug Administration is responsible for tracking adverse events for different products, prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, infant formula, dietary supplements, and even veterinary medicines.      So what is an adverse event? Clearly, if someone takes a drug or dietary supplement and dies from it, that is a very serious adverse event. If you take a product and suffer a stroke as a result of a heart attack, that is a serious adverse event. If you take a product and develop a skin rash, that is an adverse event, but not necessarily a serious event.      An adverse event can be one or more of a range of things. Why does the Food & Drug Administration have monitoring systems? These are early warning systems to protect the public if food or a drug unexpectedly starts hurting people. The Food & Drug Administration has the authority to seize products which pose a public health risk, or the FDA can propose regulations to limit the way in which a product is used.     Page 7         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Obviously, it is very important that the FDA has an accurate and effective system. People's lives may depend on it. Companies' reputations are at stake. Sometimes millions or billions of dollars of investments can be affected. So it is very important that the FDA does a good job in this area.      Today, we are going to talk about the adverse events monitoring systems for dietary supplements. We have been looking at this system for a while now, and there appears to be some very serious problems.      I think that the FDA will concede that this system has some shortcomings. The point of today's hearing is not to say that we should not have an early warning system. The point of the hearing is that we need to have an accurate system and that the facts need to be checked and good information needs to be provided to the American people. The FDA uses this monitoring system to develop regulations. If you want to have good regulations, you have to have good information.      Through our review, we have identified six problem areas: causality not established. There is no analysis of possible causal relationships between products and adverse reactions for dietary supplements. The FDA does not followup to make sure that an adverse event is actually caused by a dietary supplement.      Ironically, this is done for veterinary drugs. For instance, if a dog takes a medicine and a dog has a heart attack and dies, the FDA evaluates this report to see if the death was related to the drug or not. Because they followed up on the veterinary reports, the FDA was able to determine that in 1997, of 3,000 adverse event reports to the center for veterinary medicine, only 1 percent were definitely associated with a product, 31 percent were probably associated, 45 percent possibly were associated, 12 percent were definitely not related to the product, and 11 percent lacked adequate information to determine association.      With people and dietary supplements events, the FDA has not done this analysis. They cannot provide this type of information. If the FDA does this for animals, why not for people? On the FDA website, two deaths are attributed to ephedra, 15 to ephedrine, and 12 to ma huang.     Page 8         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     I have further information on two such cases. This case states that one death attributed to ephedra was actually attributable to hypothermia, the other is the death of a woman who had been using an ephedra supplement. She died after driving her automobile the wrong way on a one-way street and struck a pole going 90 miles an hour. Her blood alcohol limit was .212, more than twice the legally intoxicated limit in most States. Are these two cases really ephedra deaths?      No. 2, no classification of seriousness of event. The website lists over 2,000 adverse events, but there is no evaluation of whether these are mild events, moderate events, or serious events. The impression the FDA gives, especially in the press, is that all of these events are serious events.      According to information provided to the committee by the FDA, of 600 events received, 60 percent were not serious events. Additionally, it is unclear on the website what actually should be reported as an event.      On the prescription drug reporting site, a detailed explanation is given of what an adverse event is. However, the dietary supplement site is vague and lists an adverse event as an illness or injury associated with the use of dietary supplements.      Are there dual definitions for adverse events? This is a very important issue because the FDA frequently quotes the numbers of adverse events in dietary supplements and uses these numbers as a means of developing policy.      I understand my colleagues on the Science Committee have requested a General Accounting Office evaluation of the FDA's use of this monitoring system in the development of policy regarding ephedra. The report is expected to be released in the coming months, and we look forward to utilizing this report in our investigation.      Three, time lag for Freedom of Information Act requests. If someone outside the FDA wants more information on an adverse event, they have to file a Freedom of Information Act request. This process is so slow that sometimes it takes over a year.     Page 9         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Can you imagine being a manufacturer of a supplement and the FDA's website states that someone died after taking your product, and the FDA will not provide you information about the report for over a year? Think about that. You could go out of business because they erroneously put something on a website about an adverse reaction to a product that you produce and they are wrong, and you can't get that corrected for over a year while your product is on the market. You can bankrupt a business when the FDA is wrong. That can't be correct.      One case recently reported in the press was a manufacturer who had 14 events and one death reported on the FDA website for their product, and the FDA told the manufacturer they were too busy to respond to his concerns. They are still waiting after 11 months for the FDA to provide information on these events.      Another requester has still not received information after 1 year. The industry wants to work with the FDA, but how is the industry supposed to be responsive when the FDA will not give them any information?      Is the FDA's response to the pharmaceutical industry the same on prescription drugs or to manufacturers of infant formula and other food products?      Fourth, timely updates to the FDA website. The current website has not been updated since October 1998. This is over 6 months. If the public is looking to this website for information on adverse events and dietary supplements, they are not well served by a system that is not current, that is out of date.      No. 5, brand and corporate name identification without confirmation. The FDA identifies products and companies on the website. Is it appropriate to do so, especially since they did not determine if the product actually caused the event or whether the product was actually consumed by the patient?      So you list something on the website that has not yet been documented or proven, and you put that company in jeopardy without proper information and proper confirmation.     Page 10         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     No. 6, incorrect information not purged. Sometimes the FDA makes mistakes. Companies may find their name or product listed as having caused an adverse event when they do not make a product which contains the ingredients listed.      If the FDA went back and fixed mistakes, there would be no problem, but they don't. The FDA commissioner alluded to this problem in response to questions at our March 25 hearing. They told us that it is a monumental task to have the FDA make any changes to a report, so if they make a mistake, it is a monumental task for them to correct the mistake.      Is it a responsible act to leave misinformation about a company on a government website with a small footnote stating the corrected information? With the increased use of dietary supplements by Americans and with concerns about adulterated products, drug interactions and the need to identify public health concerns, an accurate and effective reporting system for dietary supplements should be a high priority for the Food & Drug Administration.      Now, let's talk about ephedra, as an example. In January, the FDA published its priority list for 1999 activities. Resolving the proposed rule on ephedra was listed at the top of the Center for Food and Applied Nutritionals' list for dietary supplements.      Ephedra has been a very controversial supplement. It has been used for thousands of years in traditional Chinese medicine for asthma. Approximately 15 billion servings of ephedra supplements were used last year in hundreds of products.      The plant version of ephedra is used as a dietary supplement. The synthetic version is used in over-the-counter medicines like Sudafed and Primatine Mist. Sometimes it has been abused.      In the past, there have been a few unscrupulous companies that marketed illicit street drugs containing high doses of ephedrine. We applaud the FDA for stopping these companies. We also applaud the respectable supplement manufacturers who worked with the government to stop this criminal activity.     Page 11         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     We will hear today from two mothers whose sons died after taking products containing large amounts of ephedrine. Our sympathies are with them and their families.      Let me make it very clear that no one in Congress has fought harder against drug trafficking than I and many of my colleagues. We have sponsored legislation to give the death penalty to drug pushers. It is my understanding that these products are now off the market, the ones that we are talking about.      If they are not, the FDA clearly has the authority to seize them. This hearing is about whether the FDA is doing a good job in tracking adverse events; are they giving the public and the medical community reliable information.      On the one hand, if a supplement is causing harm, it should be removed from the marketplace. On the other hand, if the FDA is giving the public erroneous information, then potentially good products that help people could be removed from the market and many companies could be in jeopardy. What we need is good information so the American people can make good decisions, and the Congress as well.      This hearing is not about deciding whether the current proposed rule on ephedra is the correct stand or not. It is about finding effective solutions for the obvious problem of an ineffective system so the FDA can fulfill its mandate of protecting the public. With the passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, the onus is on the FDA to determine safety of a product, and if it is not safe to remove it from the marketplace.      Some have said that the FDA would like to use a tragedy caused by a few unscrupulous manufacturers to change how we regulate an entire industry, retract the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act and regulate dietary supplements as drugs, not foods. I hope that is not the case. That is not the right way to make policy.      We are pleased that Dr. Joseph Levitt, Director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the Food & Drug Administration will be addressing us on the development of the special nutritional adverse events monitoring system. He will detail how this system functions and how it compares to other monitoring systems within the FDA and other HHS organizations.     Page 12         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     I have been told by my staff that Mr. Levitt and staff from the FDA plan on leaving after the first panel is finished. I would request, Doctor, that you stay to hear the other witnesses and be available to answer questions that may arise as a result of the other testimony.      Mr. Levitt, I appreciate that you are here today, but these people represent the public that both you and I serve. I really think if it is at all possible that it is valuable for you to stay and hear what they have to say, especially considering that we have two mothers who have lost their sons to adverse events.      We will hold the record open until June 10 to allow written submissions to the record. I will wait until the second panel comes to the table to introduce them. But before I introduce our first panel, I would like to recognize our ranking minority member, Mr. Waxman, for his opening statement.      [ NOTE. —The submissions referred to may be found at the end of the hearing.]      Mr.  WAXMAN.  Mr. Chairman, today's hearing raises important questions about the regulation of dietary supplements. The Food & Drug Administration [FDA] is supposed to ensure the safety and effectiveness of an enormous range of health products, including supplements. To do so, it is essential that manufacturers report deaths and other adverse events to the FDA. This is the rule that applies in the case of drugs and medical devices.      But the public will be surprised to learn that manufacturing of dietary supplements are exempt from the most basic public health protection. When Congress enacted the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, we severely limited FDA's authority over supplements. FDA may not approve supplements before they are marketed and FDA is held to the very high threshold of demonstrating a ''significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury before it can remove an unsafe supplement from the market.''     Page 13         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     This is a higher threshold than FDA has for dealing with foods, drugs, or medical devices. This means it is up to the supplement industry to ensure that the products that they are making are safe. But here, too, we have restricted the FDA.      We require all drug and medical device companies to report any adverse events they learn of which are associated with their products, but not dietary supplement companies. Instead, we rely on them on a wholly voluntary system of reporting.      This system is not adequate to protect public health. There are many unavoidable problems with a voluntary reporting system, not least of which is the possibility that manufacturers become aware of problems with products and choose not to share that information with the FDA.      I am interested in learning from today's witnesses how reliable the current system has been and how the system can be strengthened.      I want to commend the chairman for his balanced approach in putting this hearing together. He has graciously and appropriately agreed to allow three witnesses that we have requested to testify. As a result, we are going to have witnesses here today who can tell both sides of the story, including witnesses who have lost family members because of ephedra products.      I look forward to hearing their stories and to learning from their firsthand experience about the need for a strong monitoring system, especially for dietary supplements that do not have to undergo any premarketing testing for safety.      Let me make a final comment about FDA's regulation of ephedra. Ephedra is practically a molecular twin to methamphetamine, or speed. The DEA already has restricted its availability. And, in response to hundreds of adverse events related to ephedra supplements, including several deaths, the FDA proposed to limit the amount of ephedra permitted in supplement doses and to require labeling to fully inform consumers about their risks.      This seems to me sensible. Despite the industry's claims, there is no ephedra ban. No one is going to burst into your home to take away your ephedra. Instead, the regulation appears to contain minimal, common sense health safeguards.     Page 14         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     There is a lot of misinformation about ephedra. That is why I found Dr. Tim Johnson's comments this morning on Good Morning America to be so helpful, and I would like to play his comments for the committee. I think he cuts through a lot of false claims and provides a balanced analysis.      [Video tape played.]      Mr.  WAXMAN.  I hope that we can approach this issue with the same kind of objectivity that Dr. Johnson displayed in his presentation. I welcome our witnesses, and I look forward to their testimony. I hope that out of this hearing we will get information that will help us do our jobs better.      Thank you, very much, Mr. Chairman.      Mr.  BURTON.  Did you have an opening comment?      Mr.  KUCINICH.  Just for a minute.      Mr.  BURTON.  Let me yield to Congresswoman Morella.      Mrs.  MORELLA.  I want to thank you for calling for this hearing because I look forward to hearing about the adverse event reporting system. But I was just reminded of the fact that recently I had a group of school students who came in and I took them on the floor of House.      I showed them where the Speaker stands; and during the Q and A one of them said, You have a speaker, but do you have a listener? So I am going to be a listener today, and I hope to learn a great deal. Thank you.      Mr.  BURTON.  That is refreshing.      Mr. Kucinich.      Mr.  KUCINICH.  Thank you very much, Mr. Burton. I want to thank you, Mr. Burton, for your continuing efforts to provide a balanced public presentation of the possibilities of alternatives of health care in this country.     Page 15         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     I think that all of us appreciate the opportunity to look at not only the challenges which face health care but also the possibilities of new approaches that people might use in order to expand their own health and to improve the quality of their lives.      I support your endeavors in looking at alternative medicine, and I know that the concerns that are expressed today about the use of supplements are concerns that ought to be taken with a great deal of seriousness.      It is my view that while food supplements can provide many useful opportunities for people to have better health, I think we are starting to gather a lot of information that would suggest that some degree of professional supervision may be helpful in order to protect the health of the consumer.      Not every consumer has the kind of background that would enable them to be safe in the consumption of some of these products. On the other hand, I don't think that products ought to be withheld from the market simply because they are not approved by the FDA.      Now, this is a very difficult matter that we face, and I know that the testimony will help to resolve some of it, at least for the moment. So I thank you again, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Waxman, for your leadership on this issue.      Mr.  BURTON.  Do other Members wish to be heard?      Mr. Cummings.      Mr.  CUMMINGS.  Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I join with my colleagues in expressing appreciation to you for this hearing.      Whenever I go to the health food stores, the place is packed with people trying to improve their health, trying to deal with health problems, and so this hearing is quite appropriate.      The Food & Drug Administration is the governing body charged with the responsibility of regulating the production, distribution, and consumption of prescription and over-the-counter drugs. In keeping with its general purpose, it seems only natural that the FDA has an adequate system of monitoring the adverse effects of dietary supplement products that are not FDA regulated, specifically those like ephedra.     Page 16         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     The need for a careful examination and assessment of the Food & Drug Administration's AER reporting system, particularly in the way of stimulus-like drugs, like ephedra, is evidenced by not only the 38 deaths and the several hundred voluntarily reported cases of adverse events caused by ephedra or synthesized versions, but also in the history of the Federal action involving ephedra, which dates back as early as 1983.      In addition, after giving consideration to the fact that in 1998 the DEA noted an increased relationship between synthesized ephedra and the street drug methamphetamine, it becomes obvious that the nature of this stimulant is one that necessitates mandatory monitoring and reporting of its adverse effects.      I am interested to hear Mr. Levitt's testimony concerning the AER system and how the FDA seeks to modify the process toward making it a more efficient and effective means of monitoring ephedra and other dietary supplements which might have adverse effects to the public. Thank you very much.      Mr.  BURTON.  I thank the gentleman.      Are there further Members that want to be heard? If not, Mr. Levitt would you come forward.      [Witness sworn.]      Mr.  BURTON.  We welcome your opening statement, Mr. Levitt.    STATEMENT OF JOSEPH A. LEVITT, DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR FOOD SAFETY AND APPLIED NUTRITION, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION      Mr.  LEVITT.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Joseph A. Levitt. I am Director of the FAA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, often referred to as CFSAN.     Page 17         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Joining me today at the table is Janice F. Oliver, my Deputy Director in the center, and on my right, Dr. Elizabeth A. Yetley, who is Director of the Office of Special Nutritions within our center and it is their office that we regulate dietary supplements.      I am pleased to be here today to discuss FDA's adverse event reporting systems generally, and specifically CFSAN's adverse event monitoring system, referred to by the initials SN/AEMS, which stands for special nutritionals adverse event monitoring system, and this includes dietary supplements.      Mr. Chairman, if I may respond to your request that you made in your statement about my staying at the hearing, while I had not planned to, at your request I will be glad to with the one request that I be allowed a 2-minute break between panels in order to rearrange my schedule.      Mr.  BURTON.  That is fine.      Mr.  LEVITT.  Let me begin by saying that we are here today to focus on FDA's adverse event reporting system for dietary supplements. As Dr. Henney stated when she testified before this committee on March 25, 1999, the intent of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act [DSHEA], was to provide consumers with broad access to dietary supplements while at the same time to assure the safety and proper labeling of those products.      The adverse event monitoring system for dietary supplements is a critical part of FDA's ability to meet the consumer protection provisions of the law. We believe the current system serves as a valuable source of information to signal—and we will be hearing that word a lot today—to signal potential hazards associated with the use of dietary supplements.      However, we agree with what you said, Mr. Chairman, in your opening. We believe there are both enhancements and refinements to the current system that need to occur.      As we move ahead, we want to learn from our experience to date, including our experience with ephedra-containing products, which I know that the committee is particularly interested in. We welcome this opportunity to continue a dialog with the committee on this important issue and how we approach this task.     Page 18         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Mr. Chairman, if I may just divert for one moment with your indulgence, since this is my first time for appearing before your committee as a principal witness, let me just share for a moment some of the overall themes that I have tried to bring to the center in the leadership position that I have been at for a little over a year now.      One thing that people are very curious about when somebody takes a new job, is what does that person really stand for? What values does that person bring to the job? And I have over here a poster on my right which stands in our lobby. It is a little faded because it has been there for a year, but it lays out five major values that I have tried to stress in the year that I have been at CFSAN and which I think are very applicable here today.      No. 1 is public health and safety. We are a public health and safety agency and that needs to be our highest priority. Clearly you are recognizing that, and that is the subject of today's hearing.      No. 2 is respect. I think it is very important that we at FDA and in government as public servants show respect for all of those on the outside that we deal with, be they from industry, health professionals, or consumers; and I think Dr. Henney tried to signal that also in her testimony here earlier this spring.      I also think that it is important that we show respect for the law. I am a lawyer. I think in our case the law provides both tools for us to get our job done as well as boundaries that we must live within. As a lawyer I have particular sensitivity to that.      No. 3 is integrity. In all that we do, what FDA needs to stand for more than anything else is we are a group that is independent and able to provide objective assessments for the public. That is the groundwork on which our credibility is based, and that is paramount.      Four is dedication. I have worked at FDA for over 20 years, and I think if there is probably one word that characterizes our work force more than anything else, it is dedication. We have a hard-working, dedicated staff that does its best on behalf of the public.     Page 19         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Finally, it is not just dedication to anything; it is a dedication to excellence—excellence in science, excellence in regulatory policy, excellence in communication. You spell those out as you can see and it spells out pride.      I have tried to bring a sense and culture of CFSAN pride to all of the work that we do; and I have found that in the first year that I have been there, it has been a very valuable galvanizing force to say this is what we stand for. Thank you.      Moving back to dietary supplements, I would like to summarize my written testimony by highlighting three main points.      First, there are inherent strengths, but also inherent limitations in all spontaneous reporting systems, be they for drugs, biologics devices, or dietary supplements.      The major utility of a surveillance system based on spontaneous reports is to generate signals of potential health problems. These signals warrant and demand further investigation and must be evaluated in the context of other information which may include one or all of the following: controlled clinical trials, scientific literature, market and consumer surveys and product analysis.      There are also significant limitations. The major limitations to consider when assessing spontaneously reported information is underreporting of adverse events, report quality, adverse event recognition or attribution, reporting biases that are inherent and estimation of population exposure.      Notwithstanding these very relevant limitations, postmarketing surveillance based upon spontaneous report data has been a very powerful tool for detecting adverse event signals.      Second, within the FDA the most developed system for adverse event reporting is a system used for prescription drugs. This system, however, has had over three decades to mature and benefits from a number of tools not available to dietary supplements, for example, premarket testing a data base, mandatory reporting by manufacturers, and access to market exposure data, sometimes referred to as denominator data.     Page 20         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Moreover, even in its current state, the agency continues to incorporate enhancements into the prescription drug reporting system and to fine-tune it as necessary. By contrast, the agency's reporting system for dietary supplements was developed only recently in 1993. And so comparatively speaking, it is still in its infancy.      This means we are still in the process of developing the infrastructure, the resource base, and the overall framework of this adverse event monitoring system. We recognize that there are many challenges that we face with the current system and we intend to address each area that will make the system stronger.      The fiscal year 2000 budget request which is now before the Congress includes $2.5 million to enhance the adverse event monitoring system within the foods program. Most of these funds would buttress reporting system for dietary supplements as these products provide the largest share of the center's adverse event reports.      If these funds are provided, we would hire several additional clinical staff to review the adverse event reports, and we would develop a system to integrate adverse event reporting and to modernize it for our entire center programs.      This system would also be compatible with other adverse event systems within the agency. We are also now in the process of assessing our longer-term needs as we develop the budget for 2001.      Third and most importantly, notwithstanding its degree of development, the dietary supplement adverse event monitoring system is capable of and has surfaced important safety issues for the benefit of the American public. This includes identifying a serious manufacturing product in samples of raw material labeled ''plantain'' that contained digitalis, and more recently identifying the basis for removing from the market products contain gamma butyrolactone or GBL.      It is critical that FDA be able to move rapidly to protect consumers when significant safety problems arise, and I believe there is general acceptance of that principle.     Page 21         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     In closing, Mr. Chairman, I would like to place in context today's subject of adverse event reporting for dietary supplements as it relates to our commitment to develop this calendar year an overall strategy for achieving effective regulation of dietary supplements under the law.      As part of our ongoing consultation with stakeholders, the agency has scheduled two public meetings to solicit comments that will assist CFSAN in developing a strategy and this will include, certainly, input on adverse event reporting for dietary supplements.      The first meeting is coming up soon, July 8 in Washington, DC. The second is on July 20 in Oakland, CA. I will personally chair each of these two meetings. I would encourage interested persons to attend one of these sessions.      It is not necessary to attend both, as we are essentially repeating the same meeting on the West Coast so as to save stakeholders the time and expense of traveling East. For those who cannot attend, comments may be submitted in writing to the public document.      We look forward to input on development of an overall strategy for dietary supplements. Developing the solid blueprint for implementing the DSHEA is essential. This will ensure that the implementation is guided by a framework that will both protect consumers and enable them to make informed choices by using dietary supplements to improve their health.      Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would be happy to respond to questions you may have. I also note I am getting a note passed to me that I have misspoken. The two public meetings, one is in June. It is on June 8. The second is on July 20. I am sorry if my eyes skipped down.      Thank you very much for your attention. I will be happy, with my colleagues, to try to answer questions.      Mr.  BURTON.  Thank you, Mr. Levitt, and thank you for that correction.      [The prepared statement of Mr. Levitt follows:]     Page 22         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     INSERT OFFSET FOLIOS 1 TO 36 HERE      [The official committee record contains additional material here.]        Mr.  BURTON.  Why is it that the FDA evaluation reports determine the causality in veterinary medicine for animals but not the dietary supplement for humans?      Mr.  LEVITT.  I think the question is addressing how we evaluate the strength of the reports. That is really what you are talking about. In your statement you listed two main things. One is seriousness and one is what you referred to as causality. I would like to think of that as attribution or how strong is the association.      Inherently, with any passive reporting system, whether it is veterinary drugs or human drugs, there are going to be limitations in terms of how much information is available to us, both in terms of how much is available and what other activities are present, whether it is other therapies, other medical conditions, special populations. All of those have to be evaluated together.      I think it is, however, a misconception that that is not part of the system as we have it because inherently when our medical staff—we view reports, that is a very important part of what they look at.      One thing that I have, I think, gleaned from, as I have looked more into this recently, is an important lesson from what has happened is that we need to have greater transparency and understanding of the process that we have. And one thing that we will be undertaking will be to describe better what processes that we do use and also how can we refine those processes.      Now, if I can add—to help us do that, we have set up a working group under the auspices of our food advisory committee to address, specifically, adverse event reporting; and this has broad membership of health professionals as well as industry. And this group is just getting going so the timing is very good.     Page 23         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     They have two charges which have already been written out. I think after this hearing we will go back and decide if we need to broaden or refine the charge because the timing is too good not to take advantage of that. But the charges are twofold.      No. 1, to identify medical toxicological and communication principles or guidance that could assist industry in establishing and implementing a system to solicit, collect, evaluate, and report potential safety concerns associated with product purity and consumer complaints and reports of illness or injury. So the first charge is what are things that the industry should be looking at to do better.      The second is directed to FDA. Based on your knowledge or experience in other food safety or food science arenas, could you please suggest mechanisms for FDA to share post market surveillance information with consumers, the dietary supplements industry, the medical community, and other surveillance system.      So as I said, this group is being assembled right now and I think that we should take advantage of what is learned today and feed that back in so we can have recommendations.      Mr.  BURTON.  I glean from your answer that you are going to be doing that in the future, and in the past you haven't.      Mr.  LEVITT.  What I am trying to say is that in the past, that has been more a part of the process of internal evaluation, and it has been obvious to outsiders because it hasn't been designated to 1, 2, 3, 4.      But when I talk to the reviewers and ask them how do you evaluate the reports, one of the most important elements that they look at is how strong or how weak is the association with it. And I think we need to clarify that.      For example, when we later talk about ephedra, there are large numbers of reports that are often reported, saying FDA has so many reports, and that is so. However, FDA within the internal analysis breaks those down much more and tries to look at that.     Page 24         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     So we need to spell out where and how we do it so it is better understood. And if we are not doing it as well as we should, we should improve that, too.      Mr.  BURTON.  Thank you. One of the things that concerns me—and I mentioned it in my opening statement—is that things are posted on your website and they may or may not be accurate. The information that you have on there may be a conclusion that is reached, but it takes a year or more for that to be clarified or removed. During that time the company that may be the ''victim'' or the person who suffers from this, may not be able to get that clarified, and it may hurt the sale of their product at the marketplace. During that time many companies have had difficulty getting the FDA to respond to them to clear up these misunderstandings.      I know that my time has expired, and I will talk more about this in a second round. One of the things that concern me—I take Slim Fast. I know I look thin, strong, healthy and everything—why is it that nobody is smiling at that?      In any event, if you look at the website that you have, you show approximately 22 problems that are created by Slim Fast that may or may not be accurate and probably hasn't hurt because people still continue to use it, but could hurt a product like that in the marketplace.      And during the time that a company is trying to explain to the people that buy it, who might be scared to death after reading something like this on the website, they have no recourse because you are not having a dialog with them and getting it cleared up.      So what's the answer to that?      Mr.  LEVITT.  I think the answer to that is that we at the FDA need to have a greater sensitivity to the manufacturers in this whole process. We have focused primarily on our internal work. The reports come in. We try to look at them, and making time and resources available for getting the reports FOI purged and ready to submit has taken a back seat.     Page 25         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Earlier this year, when that was brought to my attention, we have allocated funds this year but we are terribly behind and it will take us some time to catch up.      But if I were to paint a picture of the way that I would like to see it, we need to have a system so that as with other product centers, if you look around within FDA, reports come in; they go through the normal purging for names and identifiers of health professionals and patients if they are there, and they are sent to manufacturers because the manufacturers have an important role to play, not just in knowing what is there but in helping and investigating what is going on with this product. And that's something we have to try and fix.      Mr.  BURTON.  I want to go ahead and yield to Mr. Waxman, but let me just say that I think that's something I would like to work with you on, and I think the committee would like to work with you to make sure that businesses who may have been hurt by misinformation that has been put on the website or public, into the public domain, have quicker access to the FDA so they can clarify those things so they don't suffer.      If a product is bad, it should be off the market. We don't want it to hurt the people. But at the same time in the free enterprise system, we want to make sure that businesses don't suffer either because of erroneous information put on the website that they can't get off, and work with you to clarify those things.      Mr. Waxman.      Mr.  LEVITT.  Yes, thank you. And we need to be working more closely with companies on their followup.      Mr.  BURTON.  OK.      Mr.  LEVITT.  So that we can have a stronger system.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. One of the most fundamental safeguards of public health is adverse event reporting. An adverse event is a death or serious disease or injury that's linked to the use of a drug, a medical device, or a dietary supplement. Adverse event reporting is required of some product manufacturers but not of manufacturers of dietary supplements.     Page 26         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Can you explain why adverse event reporting is so important to protecting the public health?      Mr.  LEVITT.  Well, with any product, even those that have premarket testing and review, once the product gets onto the market, it is exposed to many more people, many different kinds of people, people that are taking different kinds of medications, have different medical conditions, and any premarket system is not going to be able to pick up rare events, interactions or other things that control trials cannot do.      When you have a system such as here, where there is no premarket, that is even more important because that is the way that we can pick up signals that there may be a problem with the product. And so we need it as a critical feature to signal us, hey, there may be a problem with this product; FDA, you need to look into it; you need to work with the company and say maybe we need to do something to improve things.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  If a drug is on the market, and it has already gone through an approval process where FDA assures the safety and efficacy of that drug, is the manufacturer of the drug required to report adverse impacts from the use of the drug?      Mr.  LEVITT.  In the context of prescription drugs, yes, manufacturers are required to report to FDA all adverse events that they receive associated with their product. They have to report on a more urgent basis those that are serious and unexpected, meaning not on the product label; and later on, more routine reports. But, yes, they are required to submit those.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  How about medical devices such as x-ray machines or artificial joints; does the law require the manufacturer of medical devices to report adverse events?      Mr.  LEVITT.  Yes. Medical device manufacturers are required to report. The definitions are a little different, but by and large, it is an attempt to require the submission of important serious adverse events to the FDA.     Page 27         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Mr.  WAXMAN.  Now dietary supplements, however, are governed under different rules. Can you tell us whether manufacturers are required to inform FDA if they learn about an adverse event report?      Mr.  LEVITT.  There is no requirement that manufacturers make those submissions to us.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  This, as you pointed out, is like a double whammy. With other products, you have to assure the safety and in many cases the efficacy before the product can be sold. Dietary supplements can go right on the market without any scrutiny by FDA in advance. But even manufacturers of those products that had to be preapproved before they could be marketed are required to report when there is an adverse event. But dietary supplement manufacturers are not required to report an adverse event to you. They are, however, encouraged to do it voluntarily; isn't that true?      Mr.  LEVITT.  That is correct, as are health professionals. We probably need to strengthen our outreach there to get as many high-quality significant reports as health professionals are coming across, as well as to the industry.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  Well, it seems to me this puts a good manufacturer at a disadvantage because it makes it impossible for a consumer to know which products have been manufactured responsibly and which products have not. Would you agree?      Mr.  LEVITT.  That is correct.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  Now, under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, we have a voluntary system of reporting adverse events. This means that if a dietary supplement manufacturer learns of a problem associated with its product, there is no obligation to report the problem to the FDA. Are you aware of any situations of manufacturers not reporting problems about its product to the FDA?      Mr.  LEVITT.  We don't have direct evidence, information, on that one way or the other. Also, unlike the other systems, manufacturers are not required to register with the FDA.     Page 28         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Mr.  WAXMAN.  If they don't tell you, you don't know?      Mr.  LEVITT.  That's correct.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  Well, let me tell you and everybody else here that my staff is doing some research on this issue, and they talked to the people in the State of Texas where they found that there were manufacturers and distributors who had received a large number of complaints about their products.      In fact, I have for the record a list of some of these adverse impacts from the use of the products. One company received over 150 complaints of side effects, including complaints of high blood pressure, kidney problems, difficulty in breathing. Another company received complaints that their product had been linked to at least one heart attack and one case of seizures. Many of these complaints even came directly from doctors' offices, where the doctor learned about what was happening to the patient and called the manufacturer and said, ''You better know that your product is causing these distressing events.''      While many of these complaints went to the manufacturer, we found out from the Texas Department of Health that the companies didn't share these complaints with the public or the Texas Department of Health until they were compelled to do so by a court.      And I would like to ask unanimous consent to put in the record at least a summary of some of these complaints I doubt you ever heard about these complaints unless you found out about them after the court case. But the manufacturers weren't rushing to report voluntarily what they, in my view, should have been required to report under the law, if the law had been drafted the way it should have been.      Mr.  BURTON.  Would the gentleman allow us to put a sampling of those along with the number that you have?      Mr.  WAXMAN.  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that they be put in the record at the discretion of the chairman. You can go through them and determine whatever is appropriate to get the point across.     Page 29         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Mr.  BURTON.  Very well.      [The information referred to follows:]      INSERT OFFSET FOLIOS 38 TO 55 HERE      [The official committee record contains additional material here.]        Mr.  WAXMAN.  One of the arguments we sometimes hear is adverse event reporting is not needed because dietary supplements are always safe. I want to ask you about that. FDA has received about 1,000 adverse event reports relating to ephedra. About how many of those reports are classified as serious?      Mr.  LEVITT.  Of the—we have received overall about, I believe the number is about 1,000 reports altogether. The number, total number that is serious, I am going—I am going to give an estimate and then provide for the record something that is more detailed. But my impression, it is in the vicinity of 30 to 40 percent. I could be wrong on that but that is the impression I have from talking—it is a large enough number that it is—that it is of concern to us. It is not by any means all of the reports.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  My last question to you is: Is it not correct that of those reports, 45 were of deaths?      Mr.  LEVITT.  There are a number of reports of deaths in there. I don't know if that is the exact number but we could certainly check on that, too.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  Thank you very much.      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.      Mr.  BURTON.  I think that we might ask Dr. Henney at some point to sit down with us and discuss some of the issues that have been raised by Mr. Waxman after this meeting to see if something can't be done to clarify some of these issues.      We would certainly like to look into that and talk to her about that.     Page 30         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Mr.  LEVITT.  I think—I don't know what the right process is but I would hope there is also a process for FDA to obtain access to the adverse event reports if there are safety issues there that we need to know about.      Mr.  BURTON.  There is a definition of serious side effects for prescription drugs, is there not?      Mr.  LEVITT.  Yes.      Mr.  BURTON.  Did you have questions? I am sorry. Ms. Schakowsky.      Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  Yes.      Mr.  BURTON.  Let me yield to Ms. Schakowsky and I will get back to my questions in just a moment. I am sorry.      Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't mind waiting for you.      I wanted to continue the line of questioning that Mr. Waxman was beginning.      You had said that there were 30 to 40 percent that were serious. Actually, we heard—and we also heard that there were about 45 deaths. But what is considered serious? Could you tell us what kind of events are considered serious?      Mr.  LEVITT.  Yes. The general issues that we would consider serious are as follows, and I think I will just read them to be sure that I get this exactly right.      No. 1 is when the outcome is death, is life-threatening, it requires hospitalization or prolongs hospitalization, causes disability, congenital abnormality or requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. Those are the general criteria under the MedWatch program.      In addition, within our program, we would add on the following, which says that other medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening but which require intervention to prevent one of the serious medical conditions, meaning one of the MedWatch outcomes I just said, would also be considered medically serious.     Page 31         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     So it would—both something where we have reached the outcome as well as something that could lead to it. And we consider all of those to be serious under, if you will, the general categorization of dangerous, critical or alarming.      Coming back just to a point earlier, this is not something that we have been as transparent to the outside world as we should be, and that is something that we will be addressing so that it is clear to everybody. It also is worth noting that in the recently revised regulations for prescription drugs, the definitions are very consistent.      Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  Just to clarify, then, in my own mind, you are saying that while these serious event—these reports are not required—that of the thousand reports, you think probably about 30 to 40 percent are serious. You have read what serious is. I think anyone listening to that would agree that's very serious; and it seems to me that your expression of concern is certainly warranted and that is shared by members of this committee as well and may require some further action. I think it almost certainly would.      FDA has issued warnings to consumers about a number of other supplements besides ephedra, and I want to mention a couple of those. The FDA recently issued a warning about products containing GBL and asked companies to recall the product. According to the FDA press release, GBL is related to 55 adverse events. Can you talk a little bit about what those adverse events were and how serious they were?      Mr.  LEVITT.  Yes. Well, the GBL is a product that converts itself in the body to a drug referred to as GHB, which is a well-known sedative and not an approved product on the marketplace.      We had, of those 55 events, they all were consistent with each other as being quick after taking the product. About 20 of those were associated with somebody who actually was unconscious, sometimes into a coma. There was also one event that was reported in the context of a death.     Page 32         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     In that setting, it was clear, I think, that—to everybody looking at it, we had a clear pattern.      Going back, Mr. Chairman, to your question about causality or attribution, we had a very strong association; we had a known product; we had exactly the same kind of result that would be anticipated from what we know of that product, and we said that product needs to come off the market.      Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  In this instance, it was one death?      Mr.  LEVITT.  One death reported. One report was based on a death, yes.      Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  In 1998, the FDA issued a warning about 5 HTP, which is found in supplements promoted to treat insomnia, depression, obesity, and for children with attention deficit disorder. According to the FDA press release, 5 HTP contained impurities that are similar to the impurities that were found in L-tryptophan, which was banned because it was so dangerous.      Do you remember how many adverse events were associated with L-tryptophan?      Mr.  LEVITT.  I am going to ask Dr. Yetley to see how her memory is since that's prior to my involvement.      Dr.  YETLEY.  That particular issue was one that was related to a report that came out of the Mayo Clinic in which they had analyzed those products on the marketplace and had found the presence of an impurity. As soon as they had raised that issue to our attention, we had our chemist work with the Mayo chemist. They developed a method, they developed a standard method, for it. We met with the industry, shared our information on how to test their products for this particular contaminant.      It is my understanding that the industry has worked hard to look at their products and to assess them. So that was not particularly an issue that came up from the adverse event system but was one in which we were trying to prevent adverse events because we had information about a contaminant.     Page 33         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Mr.  LEVITT.  If I could just add, I am not sure Dr. Yetley heard the question properly. She reacted to something that happened within the last year or so. If you are reacting—questioning about L-tryptophan which was in the late eighties, there were a number of reports associated with that.      Do you recall the number?      Dr.  YETLEY.  L-tryptophan is a related but somewhat different product than the 5-hydroxy L-tryptophan.      This was a concern that was raised through the reports of adverse events. We had a number of serious injuries and illnesses. We worked with the manufacturers. They did voluntarily recall those products from the marketplace. We did issue warnings, and there was some research done and we have never clearly resolved whether or not those injuries were due to a contaminant, were due to the product itself or to some interaction within the product, but there was a fairly quick action on the part of the agency and a response by the industry in response to those adverse events.      Mr.  LEVITT.  Right. There was a sizable number, were there not?      Dr.  YETLEY.  It was a sizable number. I don't remember the exact number.      Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  If I could just make one more comment. It seems to me then, given these examples, that adverse event reporting can help to resolve these dangers and that we have some good examples of that being the case?      Mr.  LEVITT.  Yes, absolutely. And that was one of the points I tried to highlight earlier, but thank you for reinforcing that.      Mr.  BURTON.  Before I yield to Mr. Horn, let me just say that it is my understanding that L-tryptophan, it was because of an adulteration of the product that you had a problem; it was not the L-tryptophan itself?     Page 34         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Dr.  YETLEY.  It is not clear. The research that was done did not clarify that completely.      Mr.  BURTON.  But once you worked with the industry and they cleaned up the L-tryptophan to take out the other adulterated products, was it no longer a problem?      Dr.  YETLEY.  I believe the marketing of that particular product was pretty much limited or restricted to a great degree.      Mr.  BURTON.  Well, it is still being marketed and used, though, is it not?      Dr.  YETLEY.  I don't know the current use, but it was not used for quite a long time after that particular period.      Mr.  BURTON.  It was my understanding that it was because of the adulteration, but we will look into that.      Mr. Horn.      Mr.  HORN.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am sorry I have missed some of the previous presentation.      Let me give you an example apparently that occurred on the website. The FDA reported that a 27-year-old female had nausea, passed out, suffered liver damage as a result of taking Slim NRG Plus, a product containing ephedra. However, the woman had also taken Nyquil and two glasses of wine. A drug screening showed she had also consumed acetaminophen, nicotine and three other drugs.      I guess the question is: What does the FDA do to make sure that the adverse events that it is reporting on its website are actually related to the dietary supplement being listed on the website?      Mr.  LEVITT.  OK. Thank you for raising that. I got to address only part of that point earlier in response to the chairman's question.     Page 35         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Let us take a moment on the website itself, because I think the website is misunderstood for what it is intended to be. Maybe based on what it is, we need to make changes also, but the website is nothing more than a table of contents of reports submitted to FDA.      We got all of these reports. We need to kind of keep track of them, and a system was worked out with just a minimal amount of information which basically is the product, the company, the nature of the reaction reported, and I guess the ingredient. It is just a line listing, and when you see it it is just one line across the page. That is taken verbatim from the report that comes in, even before there is an evaluation done.      That originally, as I have come to understand it, was the center's way, if you will, of cataloging what came in and then following through and doing a more detailed review.      What has happened over time is there were so many requests for that information, and actually under the revised FOI statute for electronic availability we are actually charged with putting up on the web frequently requested documents, and people are asking for this all the time so it was put up on the web.      From FDA's point of view, it was always understood to simply be a table of contents of what was submitted. The problem, I believe, that we have come up to is not so much that, although maybe there are some issues there, too, but the juxtaposition of what the chairman raised about putting that up now and not being able to make the underlying report available to the manufacturer for very long periods of time. So that is the only thing that is up there.      What is done in other centers is that the initial line listing is up there; but the report is up there, too. And so the manufacturer has access to everything and you have, if you will, a full record.      As I testified earlier, and maybe before you were able to be here, we are seriously behind in our purging, what is called purging, or making those documents publicly available because we have to go through each one and take out any identifying information.     Page 36         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     I have authorized funds for a contract to bring us up to speed; but the way it ought to be running, which is the way we will try, resources permitting, to do, is we have got to get all the information available to the manufacturers and up there so that there is a complete and full record and people are not misunderstanding, misusing or hurt by what was originally a table of contents of something that comes in.      Mr.  HORN.  Well, shouldn't FDA have a disclaimer as to the possible inaccuracies? For example, when they put it up here and say the Slim NRG Plus bit and the fact is they didn't know the woman had taken Nyquil and the two glasses of wine and the five additional drugs—and it seems to me somewhere either the authors are at fault in some medical journal and they should have noted that and have a drug screen and so forth, or at least a patient history.      And it seems to me when somebody tunes in to a government-sponsored website they think this is certainly truth, except for the IRS. But actually I would think the FDA, with its scientific reputation, would want to put a disclaimer on any case it puts up there, that you don't know what else this person had that led to the particular conclusion of that little point in time of a case.      Mr.  LEVITT.  You are right. In fact, that is at least one thing that we have been doing. It appears at the beginning of the website. I have heard a recent suggestion that maybe somehow it ought to appear——      Mr.  HORN.  On every case.      Mr.  LEVITT  [continuing]. On every page, but here there is half a dozen disclaimers. But the one that you are referring to says ''There is no certainty that a reported adverse event can be attributed to a particular product or ingredient.'' The available information may not be complete enough to make this determination. So we have tried to make that disclaimer, and maybe we need to tie it closer to the other information so there is no confusion.     Page 37         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Mr.  HORN.  If a person is taking numerous drugs and supplements and possibly even alcohol, isn't it reasonable to assume that the medical condition could have been caused by any of those things?      Mr.  LEVITT.  Yes.      Mr.  HORN.  One last question here. If a person takes two different dietary supplements and has a serious problem and the FDA only reports that the problem was related to one of those supplements, couldn't the FDA wind up banning or regulating the wrong substance?      Mr.  LEVITT.  Again, that report you are referring to is simply the ingredient listed by the person sending in the report. It does not reflect FDA's judgment in any manner about whether it is serious, whether it is actually attributed to that ingredient or not.      As I said, it is a line listing of everything that has come in. That's why I said it needs to be joined with the fuller document so that all that information is clearly available and people are not misled that just because somebody reported it, it is necessarily associated and or serious.      At the same time, a lot of them are and it would be of benefit to have the information out there.      Mr.  HORN.  If there are two different supplements, as we postulated there, it seems as though FDA doesn't try to narrow down the cause of the illness; and the end result of that not being done is that the FDA could wind up banning one substance and it is the wrong substance.      Which would really be the most dangerous, to leave that on or to test it or what, as to which substance might really have been the problem?      Mr.  LEVITT.  Again, it would be—let me take a moment on this. It would be very unusual for us to make a conclusion about whether a product, say, ought to be on the market or not based on a single report. What we are trying to do is actually quite the opposite. Each report needs to be looked at and followed up on, but then we need to be looking at the reports in the aggregate to say, No. 1, is there a pattern here? Is there a consistency?     Page 38         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     So I think the system does have that correction already within it, subject, as I said, we need better transparency if that's not well understood.      Mr.  HORN.  Thank you.      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.      Mr.  BURTON.  Thank you, Mr. Horn.      Ms. Norton, did you have any questions?      Ms.  NORTON.  No questions.      Mr.  BURTON.  Let me ask just a couple of questions.      Go ahead, Henry, and I will finish up. I will yield to you now.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  Mr. Levitt, if I could—just so I understand this problem of what is on the website, what do you put on the website, a complaint from a consumer that you haven't checked out? Is that it?      Mr.  LEVITT.  Every report that comes in, the first step is to simply make a line entry into, if you will, the inbox that says, all right, this is a report. We will assign it a number. We will put on that listing whatever the report says.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  I think it is a valid complaint if a consumer reports a problem with a product, and it turns out that it may not have been that product at all that caused the problem, but the FDA has posted the complaint on the website.      On the other hand, I think people who have a problem with a product and they are sophisticated enough to go to the website and pull down the information that is there should have some information, even though you may not have reached a complete conclusion.      Now, I gather you have a problem in cleaning up your website because you don't have the resources to do it. How about putting a disclaimer that these are reports that FDA has received but cannot verify? After all, you know, the manufacturers for dietary supplements have a disclaimer on their products saying they make the following claim, but FDA has not approved this claim and so there is a disclaimer that the claim may not be true.     Page 39         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     That could be a subject for further discussion, but there is a disclaimer. Why can't you make a disclaimer and continue to post reports so people can get that information?      Mr.  LEVITT.  We do have that disclaimer.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  You do have that disclaimer?      Mr.  LEVITT.  That's up there. The question that has been raised is whether or not that—that disclaimer automatically comes up when consumers, you know, go into the data base or it is somehow at the beginning somehow, so we can look at that. But the disclaimer is there.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  Does the disclaimer say something like there is no certainty that a reported adverse event can be attributed to a particular product or ingredient? The available information may not be complete enough to make this determination?      Mr.  LEVITT.  Yes, that's correct.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  That's your disclaimer?      Mr.  LEVITT.  Right. And that's up there and that's available, and there are a half dozen other disclaimers along with it.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  Look, in the ideal world we want you to get to the bottom of the information, put on the website information that's useful for consumers to know but that's accurate. I think that's asking a lot of you because you don't have the staff resources—I know from my experience when I was chairman of the Health and Environment Subcommittee that oversaw legislatively and otherwise FDA. But maybe we should talk further about this issue because it seems to me again that we want the information, even if it is not complete and accurate and full information, to be available to people. We want full disclaimers of that information.      We want you to clean up that website as quickly as possible, and if we are going to ask you to do that then we ought to provide you the funds to do it, among all the other things we want you to do.     Page 40         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Mr.  LEVITT.  Thank you for recognizing that.      Mr.  BURTON.  You will find this interesting, but Henry and I agree on this.      Let me just say that it seems to me that it would not be a great deal of additional work, for instance on the Slim Fast issue, which I used earlier. You have got four pages of allegations related to Slim Fast that scared me to death when I read it. I thought, my gosh, I must be missing something because I haven't had any migraines or kidney infections or gall stones or dizziness. So if you could just put out at the side of each one of these allegations, or whatever you want to call them, please see disclaimer, please see explanation at the beginning of the website or something so that people can realize that this might be an isolated case that might be related to something else that they were taking at the same time, I think that would really be helpful.      It shouldn't take a lot of additional work just to put that asterisk out there or some kind of a notation to see the disclaimer.      Mr.  LEVITT.  We will look into that straightaway.      Mr.  BURTON.  OK. I want to get back to the issue of companies that are listed on your website as having an adverse event. A lot of times those reports come from doctors, as I understand it.      Mr.  LEVITT.  Uh-huh.      Mr.  BURTON.  The companies that may be the subject of the criticism, or adverse event, don't even know about them. They file a Freedom of Information Act request after they find out about them, and they have to wait for a year many times before they really know what the problem is; and that can cause, as I said before, a lot of economic problems as well as other problems.      They have complained to us about that because they have to wait because of the Freedom of Information Act requirements.     Page 41         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Now, did I understand you to say that you have an avenue, other than the Freedom of Information Act, to get that information to these companies so that they can work with you to clear up a problem if it does exist?      Mr.  LEVITT.  No. I was—you did not understand exactly what I meant to say anyway. What I meant to say was what we need to do—and I said I have allocated some funds to get this done but we are still behind, so that those reports, when they come in are promptly made so they can be made publicly available to the public at large but also certainly to the manufacturer. It is the same preparation process we have to go through, because somebody has to go through every page of the records and be sure that any individual names are not on there.      Mr.  BURTON.  No, I understand that. But a number of the companies that have contacted us have said, yes, we would like to work with the FDA if these kinds of complaints are made.      Mr.  LEVITT.  Right.      Mr.  BURTON.  We would like to get on with it as quickly as possible and clear it up if there is a problem, but because of the Freedom of Information Act and because it takes so long we can't and it does cause problems.      So if there is some way to streamline that, I think it would be helpful to the companies and make people look with a different attitude toward you and the FDA.      Mr.  LEVITT.  OK. Well, thank you. What we tried to do was to have people on staff do it ''when they had time.'' And what happened was they never had time. So we did take that suggestion and said, all right, we will hire an outside contractor.      We are in the process of training that contractor and being sure that there is somebody dedicated to that task. As I said, it will take us some time to catch up; but, you know, we need to find and have the resources so that is available, because, I mean, the industry complaints, as Mr. Waxman said on this, are correct. They need to have the information, too, and they need to be part of the solution here.     Page 42         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Mr.  BURTON.  If you could give us some kind of a report after you get this contractor trained and up to speed on how long a company can anticipate having to wait, it would be helpful to just give a general idea, we would sure appreciate that.      Mr.  LEVITT.  OK. We would be happy to do that.      Mr.  BURTON.  We discussed the fact that there were some fly-by-night companies making some dangerous products containing ephedra. The number of milligrams that were in the product were excessive, and I think we are going to probably hear from one of the parents who lost their son or daughter because of that.      What did the FDA do when they found out about that?      Mr.  LEVITT.  Well, I mean, FDA had a really massive effort trying to deal with all of the reports and questions that came in about ephedra.      Mr.  BURTON.  OK. But when you found out that there was a company that was loading up products with ephedra so that kids could get an artificial high or whatever, it happened to be way above the norm, did you move and were you successful in getting those products off the market?      Mr.  LEVITT.  That was a little before my time so I am going to let Dr. Yetley try to answer that question.      Mr.  BURTON.  Did you get them off the market?      Dr.  YETLEY.  I assume you are referring to the so-called street drug alternatives.      We did indicate—we put out warning, first of all, so there was public warning, and then we transferred authority—or responsibility for those to our drug center, and they have dealt with those as unauthorized drugs and taken appropriate compliance action.      Mr.  BURTON.  And they have been removed?      Dr.  YETLEY.  Yes.     Page 43         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Mr.  BURTON.  OK. Let me ask you two more quick questions here; and then I would like to, unless another Member has additional questions, hear from the second panel and get back to you.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  Mr. Chairman.      Mr.  BURTON.  I am just about finished.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  Go ahead and finish. I was just going to ask for a unanimous consent.      Mr.  BURTON.  Sure. Did the legitimate companies that make products, including ephedra, work with you to solve that problem?      Mr.  LEVITT.  My understanding is there were a number of meetings with representatives from the supplement industry in an effort to try and figure out what can we do to fix this problem. Again, since Dr. Yetley was there, I will let her elaborate if we can.      Mr.  BURTON.  Can you tell us about the cooperation you received from these companies? Were they cooperative? Were they trying to help to make sure that illegitimate users of ephedra were getting those products off the market?      Dr.  YETLEY.  We did get good support from the major trade associations, and they did publicly support the agency for dealing with these as drugs.      Mr.  BURTON.  Did you get that kind of support from the supplement industry as well?      Dr.  YETLEY.  That's the industry I am referring to, yes.      Mr.  BURTON.  Thank you very much. I don't have any other questions.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  Mr. Chairman, is it true that some of these products are still being sold over the Internet? I have one product called X tablets, an herbal Ecstasy alternative. Do you know, in fact, whether some of these products are still available for sale over the Internet?     Page 44         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Mr.  LEVITT.  Given that, under law, companies make market products without telling the FDA, that is entirely possible. I don't personally have information on it one way or the other. I will ask if anybody else does.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  I gather there's another place where you are shortchanged in resources and that's the enforcement area.      Mr.  LEVITT.  Yes.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  So I shouldn't be surprised if there are products that are being sold?      Mr.  LEVITT.  It would be entirely possible.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  I would hope that you would be able to respond to further questions we might have in writing for the record.      Mr.  LEVITT.  We would be more than happy to.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  I will ask the chairman for a unanimous consent at the appropriate time so that we can include those in the record.      Mr.  HORN  [presiding]. Well, without objection.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  You are the chairman?      Mr.  HORN.  I am the chairman.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.      Mr.  HORN.  Without objection, they will be put at this point in the record. Go ahead if you would like to continue questioning.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  No, no. I want the ability to ask them questions to respond for the record after the hearing.      Mr.  HORN.  Right. If you want some more time, why, take it.      Mr.  WAXMAN.  No.      Mr.  HORN.  Let me ask just a few closing questions here. In reviewing the adverse events website for dietary supplement, it appears that there hasn't been an update since October 1998. Now, that's 7 to 8 months ago. I am just curious, how frequently is the website updated?     Page 45         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Mr.  LEVITT.  OK. Again, this really is a resource-dependent issue, and what we have tried to do is to focus our attention first on, if you will, the substantive review of the reports and to do the public availability afterwards. In retrospect, we may have gone too far in one direction on that.      We update it, I think, as available. Is there a specific——      Mr.  HORN.  Why don't you speak in the microphone.      Mr.  LEVITT.  OK. The goal had been to update it every quarter, quarterly, but we have not been able to keep up with that.      Mr.  HORN.  Suppose there is a change in that particular item you picked 2 or 3 months before and there is a correction somewhere in a journal or whatever it is, do you try to include those updates?      Mr.  LEVITT.  OK. Again, the website, as I tried to explain before, I think, is, greatly misunderstood. It is a line listing of reports submitted to the agency, nothing more.      Mr.  HORN.  Now those reports come from various doctors?      Mr.  LEVITT.  They come from doctors. They could come from consumers. They come from companies. They come from poison control centers, from States, from whatever source we receive from anyone.      Mr.  HORN.  So there is no peer review on this?      Mr.  LEVITT.  No. These are with any spontaneous reporting system. The idea is that if you, whoever you are, a doctor or consumer, feel that you have seen a problem with something, there should be a place that you can send that to; and then it is the responsibility of the recipients, in this case FDA, to go through and do a more detailed analysis of what that entails.      That goes to a lot of the issues we have talked about earlier; but I guess I just want to repeat it again, the website has a whole series of disclaimers. It is not intended to provide an FDA analysis or validation of the information that was reported. It is simply a line listing. It is like a table of contents, of reports, that have been submitted. So somebody looking at it could get an idea of what kinds of products people are writing in about, the kinds of things they are raising, but by no means would it be proper to reach any conclusions from that website on, ah, there is a problem with this product. That would be grossly incorrect.     Page 46         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Mr.  HORN.  One last question. How many adverse effects would you estimate have been filed on dietary supplements in the last 7 months? Do you have any feel for those data?      Mr.  LEVITT.  It has been running about 500 per year.      Mr.  HORN.  I see. OK. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.      Mr.  LEVITT.  Thank you.      Mr.  BURTON  [presiding]. I want to thank you, Mr. Levitt.      Let me say this about that. 500 complaints per year? Do you know how many millions of people take these dietary supplements? I think I take a million myself.      Let me thank you. I really appreciate your testimony. Please stick around for a little bit because we might have another question or two for you. I really appreciate your cooperation. Thank you.      We would like to now hear from a public panel. Dr. William Soller of Consumer Health Care Products Association will discuss elements and effective adverse events monitoring system. Dr. Soller has extensive experience with nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements and will offer viable solutions for the problems that have been identified today.      Dr. Theodore Farber is a pharmacologist and a board-certified toxicologist with FDA and EPA experience. He will review the FDA's handling of ephedra adverse events. He conducted an extensive evaluation of the published adverse events on ephedra.      And Dr. Daniel Mowrey is the president of the American Phytotherapy Research Laboratory. He will present testimony on the use of ephedra throughout its history. He will also discuss the level of scientific research in ephedra and what we know through scientific evaluation on usage, serving size, side effects, and adverse events.      Also Dr. Annette Dickinson of the Council of Responsible Nutrition is joining us again to offer advice on how to develop a good monitoring system.     Page 47         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Mrs. Karen Schlendorf is the mother of a young man who, while on spring break in 1996, took Ultimate Xphoria and died.      Ms. Barbara Michal is the founder of H.E.A.T., Halt Ephedrine Abuse Today, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to increase public awareness about the dangers of ephedrine and its related drugs, and to promote the prevention of abuse of ephedrine and its related drugs.      And Dr. Raymond Woosley, a professor of pharmacology and medicine at Georgetown University, will testify about the importance of good adverse events monitoring.      So let me just ask Dr. Soller, Dr. Farber, Dr. Mowrey, Dr. Dickinson, Mrs. Schlendorf, Mrs. Michal, and Dr. Woosley to please stand because this is important. Please raise your right hands.      [Witnesses sworn.]      Mr.  BURTON.  Let me start with Dr. Soller, and if you could give us an opening statement we would like to, if it is possible, restrict your opening statements to 5 minutes, and then we will get into questions.      I want to apologize for not having more of our members here, but as I expressed before we started, we had some problems here at the beginning of the day and some of the Members are still in that conference and others probably have departed.

Thank you. Good afternoon. I am Dr. Bill Soller, senior vice president and director of science and technology for the Consumer Health Care Products Association [CHPA].      Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, for the opportunity to address you on a matter of fundamental importance to the dietary supplement industry, adverse experience reporting.      Founded in 1881, CHPA represents producers of quality nonprescription medicines and dietary supplements, including over 200 member companies across the manufacturing, distribution, supply and service sectors of the self-care industry.      I have had 20 years' experience in the self-care industry, having held scientific regulatory and product development executive positions in consumer health care product companies manufacturing both OTC medicines and dietary supplements and have been with the association since 1985, holding similar responsibilities.      On many occasions in my career, I have personally compiled, analyzed, and reported AERs to FDA on self-care products.      By way of background, let's keep in mind that the vast majority of dietary supplements have a very wide margin of safety. Let's also not forget that there is general agreement that the current sourcing mechanisms for AERs, FDA's MedWatch, SN/AEMS, the consumer hotlines, as well as mechanisms that are maintained by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, U.S. Pharmacopeia, the American Association of Poison Control Centers, the National Institute of Drug Abuse and Centers for Disease Control are adequate signal generators of potential problems with consumer products, though systems integration is needed.      And let's not also forget the bigger picture. Ephedra may be the example today, but we must all take a direct interest in ensuring that in the future the right infrastructure and policies are in place at CFSAN to enable it to handle efficiently, expeditiously, and fairly any and all AERs on dietary supplements.     Page 49         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Therefore, we recommend the following.      As part of Dr. Jane Henney's initial directives as FDA Commissioner, FDA studied prescription drug approvals pre- and post-PDUFA, issuing a report just this month, which calls for an overhaul of the prescription drug AER program, including adoption of a systems approach to FDA's management of AERs. We support this total quality management approach for CFSAN as well.      Second, we support renewed emphasis within CFSAN on FDA's long-standing overarching safety policy. The policy states for warnings that they must be scientifically documented, clinically significant, and important to the safe and effective use of the product by the consumer. And the significant importance of this policy is that it focuses us on scientific documentation.      Without rigorous critical evaluation of how AER data are collected, analyzed and reported, it is literally impossible to determine their significance.      Third, the controversy surrounding ephedra is clouded by the nature of the data collection and analysis by the agency. This is not unexpected, especially where AERs may be difficult to interpret due to their nature, severity, source, and affected organ systems.      In controversial situations, a refined, integrated system with documented policies and procedures is vital to help ensure that the details of such situations are as accurately documented and professionally handled as possible.      Therefore, we could then concentrate on the science, not the administration, of the process.      In summary then, we recommend that CFSAN prepare a written plan for and adopt a systems approach to managing AERs on dietary supplements, grounded in its current safety policy.      CFSAN should keep current written protocols for CFSAN personnel handling AERs to expedite accurate data collection, including a detailed decision tree for use by those whose responsibility it is to filter serious and nonserious reports and route those reports for expeditious followup.     Page 50         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Third, CFSAN needs a policy and procedures for timely sharing of serious AERs with affected companies in order to help facilitate adequate followup and so address incompleteness and inaccuracies in AER reports. Affected companies are inherently motivated to ensure complete, accurate information on AERs.      Four, specific CFSAN training manuals and procedures should be established to ensure quality collection, analysis, and reporting of AERs.      Five, CFSAN should undertake a review of the core competency of the personnel who would operate different facets of an adequate AER system on dietary supplements.      Six, a reengineering of the public process to AER reports for dietary supplements is needed. AERs should be available to the public in a timely fashion when, A, FDA has communicated with the affected company identified in the AER and; B, is prepared to provide publicly a complete file of the report omitting confidential information, not just a table of contents.      Seven, public input is needed in the development of policies and procedures to be used in CFSAN's systems approach to AER management.      And the time is right for these steps. We want consumers to use safe and beneficial dietary supplements for health promotion and health maintenance. Consumer confidence in these products is essential to their usage, and recognizing that the vast majority of dietary supplements are safe and beneficial, a strong systems approach to AER management for dietary supplements is nevertheless needed to ensure that those few dietary supplements that may have safety questions are fairly and expeditiously addressed in order to help maintain consumer confidence.      Hence, we urge this committee to take an interest in the recommendations we have set forth concerning CFSAN's management of AERs for dietary supplements.      We are pleased to hear that Mr. Levitt would use the $2.5 million budget request to upgrade CFSAN's AER system. However, we recommend that the committee consider a specific inquiry to FDA asking for a detailed resource allocation plan for adopting a documented systems approach to AER management.     Page 51         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.      Mr.  BURTON.  We would like to have your requests and recommendations in writing, if you have those, and we will look at them ourselves and also submit them to Mr. Levitt and to FDA.      Mr.  SOLLER.  Yes, sir. We provided them prior to the meeting to counsel.      Mr.  BURTON.  OK. Fine. Thank you. I haven't had a chance to read them yet, but I will.      [The prepared statement of Mr. Soller follows:]      INSERT OFFSET FOLIOS 56 TO 65 HERE      [The official committee record contains additional material here.]        Mr.  BURTON.  Dr. Farber.      Mr.  FARBER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.      I am Dr. Theodore Farber. I am——      Mr.  BURTON.  Can we get you to pull the mic a little closer?      Mr.  FARBER.  Sure.      Mr.  BURTON.  Thank you.      Mr.  FARBER.  I am Dr. Theodore Farber. I am president of ToxaChemica, International, which is a consulting toxicology firm located in Rockville, MD.      Before founding this company, I was in government service at the Food and Drug Administration for over 19 years, serving in many senior science positions.      I then served 4 additional years at the Environmental Protection Agency, as a member of the Senior Executive Service. I was director of the health effects division in the pesticide program at EPA and supervised and developed the science policy for the largest group of regulatory toxicologists in the world.     Page 52         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     I am board certified in toxicology for the last 20 years, and I believe I enjoy an international reputation in my discipline.      Mr. Chairman, if there is only one thing that I could say to the committee, it would be that I have looked at every report in the Food and Drug's AER reporting system in the docket, and I can confirm my belief that dietary supplements containing ephedra, when used according to the label, are safe and effective and have been used for millions of people here in America.      Food and Drug's current system does not provide valid information to the FDA, the public, and the industry about safety of dietary supplements. Instead, because of the way in which AERs are currently handled at Food and Drug, the AER lacks standardized methodology, and this leads to inconsistent applied science from one case to the other.      It causes public confusion over whether an adverse effect was professionally assessed and actually connected with the product mentioned and whether it is simply mentioned as one of the many potential causes, including preexisting conditions and natural causes in other products that may have caused or produced a negative reaction; and it is wasteful of the agency's resources to pursue whole categories of products, branding them as unsafe when the agency might better focus its attention on specific products that are irresponsibly manufactured and marketed.      This is a summary of how Food and Drug's AER system works. Reports from any source concerning the dietary supplement product are received by Food and Drug. They are collected and filed within this AER system. The vast majority of reports, particularly for any product that is the subject of an FDA press release, comes to Food and Drug through a hotline, a number that Food and Drug publicizes. These reports are, almost without exception, anecdotal reports from lay persons who heard about or allege to have had an experience, an adverse effect.      These reports are useless from a scientific perspective, as they typically lack one or more pieces of information critical to scientific analysis, including product identity and ingredients, product dose, frequency and duration, and medical records describing the adverse effects in accurate medical terms.     Page 53         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     FDA's system does not take into account whether or how publicity affects the reporting rate and I have with me—and it is in my written testimony—charts showing that most of the reports FDA has received were as a result of FDA press releases and followup TV programs stating that ephedrine products are dangerous and have killed people. These press releases and TV shows encourage the public to call an FDA hotline to report any problems.      I would like to make one final point. The AER files supporting this proposed rule were in such a disarray when the rule was first published that Food and Drug was required to take unprecedented steps of closing the rulemaking to fix the AER files. Even after this process was completed, I found that the vast majority of AERs for these products, almost 85 percent of these events FDA had publicized as associated with ephedra products, were informationally worthless.      Further, FDA has placed in the docket for that proposed rule a clear statement of its policy on AERs, which acknowledges the scientific fact that unevaluated AERs are inherently unreliable and, therefore, should not be used to establish product risk.      Nonetheless, as Food and Drug has implicitly stated in black and white in the proposed rule, FDA relied on just 13 AERs to establish proposed serving limits for these products, which conservative estimates show that there have been billions of these servings sold that have been consumed by millions of consumers.      FDA even admitted in writing in the proposed rule that the agency had not scientifically evaluated these 13 AERs to determine whether there was any connection to product consumption in the 13 reported events. In fact, the treating physician in 1 of the 13 cases stated that there was no such connection.      Therefore, Food and Drug was almost forced to admit in writing in the proposed rule that the agency's proposed serving limits may have no public health benefit.      Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I thank you for the opportunity to address you today, and I would be more than happy to answer any questions.     Page 54         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Mr.  BURTON.  Thank you, Dr. Farber.      [The prepared statement of Mr. Farber follows:]      INSERT OFFSET FOLIOS 66 TO 76 HERE      [The official committee record contains additional material here.]        Mr.  BURTON.  Dr. Mowrey.      Dr.  MOWREY.  Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, thank you for inviting me here today.      My name is Dr. Daniel Mowrey. I own a company called American Phytotherapy Research Laboratory near Salt Lake City, UT, where our main activity is to investigate the medicinal properties of plant materials, their safety and efficacy.      For the past several years, I have been involved in the investigation of ma huang, its perhaps medicinal properties, its health benefits, its historical uses and so forth.      I have authored a book on the subject called Thermogenesis: Fat Management Related. I think you have a copy there. It deals with the historical background relating the advent, if you will, of ma huang and ephedrine into the weight loss category and what scientific support there is for that. I think I list about 1,400 references in there to detail how that has all come about.      I was asked to testify today about the historical use of ephedrine on ma huang. In doing that, I thought it was fairly impossible to know how long people have benefited from ma huang. However, some time ago I read where ephedra plants were found in a grave alongside the remains of a Neanderthal man dating back about 20,000 years.      This seemed like a good starting point to begin a historical discussion of ma huang, but I must admit to some degree of hesitation in citing this ancient case. It might just wind up in some AER. I can see the headlines now, Killer Herb Has Been Killing People for 20,000 Years.     Page 55         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Anyway, back to my point. This case of, this Neanderthal case, I think demonstrates mankind's long association with ma huang. Chinese and other Asian texts show that ma huang has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for at least 5,000 years.      Now, in traditional Chinese medicine, the twigs of this rather scraggly looking ma huang plant were broken up or pulverized and brewed up as a tea. They didn't have capsules in those days, in the ancient days, but they did have a lot of teas.      Several ounces could be used in one serving, and a serving could be taken several times a day. It was served as a tonic; or it was concentrated to be used in the treatment of colds, fevers, and other debilitating conditions.      All in all, I think it was a highly prized herb, used throughout Asia; and it still is to this day, for these traditional systems have not changed much in the way that they use medicinal plants.      By the way, seldom was ma huang used by itself. It was most often combined with a variety of other plants that moderated its effectiveness and its action in the body; and I think that that particular property of ma huang is evident in the way that it is used in modern therapy in weight loss.      Now, although ephedra is normally associated with traditional Chinese medicine, it does grow in the United States, at least related species can be found here. As a matter of fact, early American settlers in Utah, where I reside, brewed up a beverage known as Mormon tea or Brigham tea. It was a favorite beverage and it was used by pioneers to combat exhaustion and fatigue, and often as a primary source of energy or food, since the conditions in the early pioneer days in Utah were not very good.      Brigham Young was said to enjoy an occasional cup of this namesake tea, although I don't think we have any evidence that any of his 20-some-odd wives did that.      The point to all of this is to show that throughout recorded history, in cultures around the world, ephedra has been considered just another herb to be routinely used by human beings. It was never singled out as an exception to standard herbal lore, but fit quite naturally in the traditional medical and nutritional systems.     Page 56         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     While great reservations are found in traditional medicine about the use of plants, such as magic mushrooms, mandrake, jimpson weed, foxglove, rawolfia and other pyschoactive and cardiovascular plants, no record exists anywhere to suggest that similar concerns were ever directed toward ephedra.      So in recent years, ephedra has become a favorite herb of millions of Americans as a tool for safe and effective weight management. We have identified the active constituents, synthesized them, and these products, or the ephedra-related products, have been widely used throughout modern countries, civilized countries, if you will, not just Third World countries, but actually throughout Europe.      In fact, ephedrine-based weight loss products are the most popular weight management product in Europe and is rapidly becoming so in America.      Given the fact that obesity itself is more prevalent than ever before and that more people are dying of obesity-related disorders than ever before, the notorious syndrome X, the use of ephedra as a dietary supplement may be just the thing that we have been looking for.      Given its centuries-long reputation as a perfectly safe and useful herb, we have to ask the question, why all of a sudden is there this concern over ephedra's safety?      I can see two reasons for that. One is just flat out abuse. The second, I think, is an AER system that has failed us by creating misinformation rather than giving us the truth. The two reasons are intertwined.      The AER thing has been addressed. I just would like to say something about the area of abuse. While I sympathize with people who have lost members of their family to taking substances containing ma huang, whether that was the active constituent or not, I think that we are in a situation where we need better labeling for these things.      I don't think we are in a position where we should get rid of the—throw the baby out with the bath water, as it were.     Page 57         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     We need to use the tool the way that it can be used safely, to help the millions who need it, at the same time devising labeling requirements and other regulations that reduce the risk of abuse. I thank you very much for allowing me to speak today.      Mr.  BURTON.  Thank you very much, Dr. Mowrey.      [The prepared statement of Dr. Mowrey follows:]      INSERT OFFSET FOLIOS 77 TO 102 HERE      [The official committee record contains additional material here.]        Mr.  BURTON.  Dr. Dickinson, it is nice seeing you again.      Dr.  DICKINSON.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.      The Council for Responsible Nutrition is a trade association of dietary supplement manufacturers representing some hundred member companies who are deeply committed to producing safe and quality products.      We are proud of the safety record of dietary supplement products overall, but we recognize that there is a need for an adverse reaction reporting system because any product, including preapproved products, can result in unexpected effects when taken by millions of people in the general population.      Therefore, the adverse reaction reporting system is a very important signal to us where there may be some errors in product manufacture or some other issues that are causing consumers to be harmed, and it is a valuable indication of that need for action.      We share the concerns expressed by the chairman in your opening remarks regarding the need for FDA resources to handle these systems appropriately, the need for prompt reporting of adverse reactions on the public system.      We question the appropriateness of listing the company name and the product name as part of the table of contents. Mr. Levitt was referring to the publicly available website. The AER system is a table of contents of the system, and I would like to suggest an alternative to the kind of listing that we see on the current system.     Page 58         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     We also share the chairman's concern about the need to correct errors that may creep into initial listings; and, actually, our new proposal may address some of that concern.      There is an overwhelming need to evaluate the strength of the association, both in terms of the seriousness of the reactions and the nature of the causality of the product taken and the effects seen.      I would like to spend just a couple of minutes describing what may be a very useful new way of approaching the development of this system.      In our statement that we submitted prior to this hearing, we suggested that there might be a three-step system that could be adopted for making these reports publicly available.      First of all, as soon as FDA receives the report, we believe it should immediately become available on the public system, that is, on the website. We would suggest, however, that that initial posting perhaps should only include a description of the generic nature of the product involved and a description of the ingredients of that product, if that is available, and the nature of the symptoms that are observed in the adverse reaction.      We see no reason, no compelling reason, why the name of the company and the name of the product should be part of this very first initial product listing which is only an indication that a report has been received and has not been at this point evaluated in any way.      Therefore, we would suggest that FDA consider having a separate part of its reporting system that is reserved for the initial reports where there would only be generic information about the reaction.      We agree with Mr. Levitt that the priority is that as soon as FDA receives these reports, they should immediately purge them of personal information that is not releasable, so they may be released in a very prompt fashion.      We also believe that the FDA should immediately share those reports with the manufacturer or, in the case where the manufacturer has not been identified, with trade associations representing the industry so they may work with FDA to provide more complete information about the nature of the product, about the nature of its expected effects, and also assist in investigating the particular adverse reaction report.     Page 59         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Therefore, we would suggest that as soon as FDA has conducted the second phase of the investigation, that is, has shared the report with the manufacturer and has done some analysis of the likely causality involved in the report, that it be moved from this initial report section, which is a summary form into one of two more permanent report sections.      One of those two sections would be reserved for adverse reactions that the FDA has, in fact, determined are likely to be related to the product itself. And in that case it may be appropriate to include in that listing the name of the product and the name of the company after the company has been notified of that.      We think that there should be a third section of these reports which will be reserved for reports which are determined definitely not to be related to the product taken or about which there is insufficient information available to make a determination.      Therefore, we would end up with a three-part reporting system, an initial part which is a summary, a second part which is essentially the ones that are either not related to the product or about which there is not sufficient information, and then a third part which would really be the core of the permanent record and would be the basis for FDA's future analysis of any action to be taken which would be limited to those reports that have been evaluated and where there is sufficient evidence to believe that the report, the adverse event is, in fact, related to the product.      We think that this would improve the ability of FDA and the industry and other health professionals to use these adverse event reports in a productive way to address questions that need addressing as promptly as possible.      Thank you very much.      Mr.  BURTON.  Thank you, Dr. Dickinson.      [The prepared statement of Dr. Dickinson follows:]      INSERT OFFSET FOLIOS 103 TO 108 HERE     Page 60         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     [The official committee record contains additional material here.]        Mr.  BURTON.  Ms. Schlendorf, we appreciate you being here, both you and Ms. Michal; and we are very sorry about the experiences you have had.      Ms.  SCHLENDORF.  Thank you.      Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my name is Karen Schlendorf. To me Peter Schlendorf is not an adverse event but my youngest child who, like too many others, suffered from the fatal effect of a herbal supplement which contained ephedrine.      I believe that I am speaking for so many people who can no longer speak for themselves, Kristopher Michal, Rosanna Porras, to mention a few; but let me tell you about Pete Schlendorf.      As a mother, it is very difficult to put into words the depth of my feelings for my youngest son. Pete was the joy of my life. From the day he was born, Pete was someone very special. He made me smile every day, and I thanked God that I had been blessed with such a wonderful gift.      My three children meant the world to me; and as a full-time mother, I enjoyed every minute that I spent with them. On the day that I began my job as a high school guidance counselor, Pete, who was then 10, picked a bouquet of flowers from our garden for me.      I had always given the children a small gift on the first day of school and told them how proud of them I was, and now he was doing the same thing for me. He was always a kind and thoughtful person who made people glad that they knew him. He brightened a room every time he entered it.      He was always the center of attention, not because he asked for it, but because it seemed to come to him naturally. Pete was bright and funny, athletic and talented and a leader among his peers. I was proud of his accomplishments and prouder still of the man he was becoming.     Page 61         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Then one day the unthinkable happened. He died. Pete had gone to Florida on spring break with some of his friends. On a cold and overcast day, they decided to explore some of the shops along the beach. All week they had seen ads and banners promoting herbal supplements of all kinds. They went into one of the shops and decided to try one.      It is all natural, safe, harmless. The store clerk said that she and her friends took 10, 12 of them all the time, made them feel great and gave them lots of energy. So the boys tried them.      Pete took somewhere between four and eight pills and almost immediately began to feel strange. His heart rate was faster, he felt tingly, hot all over and had a pounding headache. He took a shower, but it didn't help.      He told the other boys to go out, and he would lie down for a while; and when he felt better, he would join them later. The last time his friends saw him alive, he was sitting on the edge of a bed reading the label on the box. What had he taken? What was wrong? What should he do? There was no help on that box.      It took weeks, months for us to understand what happened to our beautiful, wonderful, healthy son. At least now we know the facts. But I don't know that we will ever really understand. Pete died because a company cared much more about profits than about lives. Pete died because he had an unfortunate chance encounter with Ultimate Xphoria.      The manufacturers of this product have admitted to us their irresponsibility and their callousness. They have admitted that they are not sure how many or which additional herbs were in each batch.      They claim not to know where the ma huang came from, which part of the plant was used, the time of year it was harvested, or how strong the concentration was. They didn't know, or perhaps they didn't care; but my son died because Ultimate Xphoria was improperly manufactured and irresponsibly marketed toward young people.     Page 62         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     A number of ingredients in this product posed a risk to Pete or any other healthy individual. Combined, they caused an insurmountable risk of harm. I know that there is a great deal of information in publications and on the Internet that disputes these truths. I have read them myself. But this is the truth.      I have a copy of Pete's autopsy, something no mother should ever have to see; and it shows beyond a shadow of the doubt that the only thing in Pete's system was the ingredient in this product. He had been on spring break with his friends, but there was no evidence of any drug or alcohol or anything else except the lethal herbal supplement that he bought over the counter in a little shop on the beach.      Ephedrine is a drug. It has been known as a drug for over 5,000 years. No amount of legislation will make it a food. Proponents of ephedrine-containing supplements like to say that the Chinese have used it for centuries. They have, through practitioners who prescribe it as part of their traditional medicine, not for weight loss, not for energy boosts.      Scientists have agreed on what ephedrine does. It dilates bronchial muscles, contracts nasal mucosa, raises blood pressure, acts as a cardiac stimulator. Although there may be some disagreement as to a safe limit of ephedrine, I do not dispute that in proper hands, ephedra can be appropriate and safe.      However, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 has allowed irresponsible persons to contaminate the marketplace with false claims and dangerous marketing. I doubt that it was the intention of this governmental body to allow people like those who caused my son's death to get rich at the expense of America's youth.      I fully understand that there are many people and certainly many manufacturers making millions of dollars from these products who don't want to hear any of this, but I would hope that my government would want to hear this.      Filing an adverse event report was our vehicle to the truth, and I did this in honor of my son, Peter Charles Schlendorf.     Page 63         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Mr.  BURTON.  Thank you very much. That was a very touching statement.      [The prepared statement of Ms. Schlendorf follows:]      INSERT OFFSET FOLIOS 109 TO 110 HERE      [The official committee record contains additional material here.]        Mr.  BURTON.  Ms. Michal.      Ms.  MICHAL.  Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, my name is Barbara Michal of Novi, MI, founder of the nonprofit National Coalition Halt Ephedrine Abuse Today. I am here today at my own personal expense, and I am deeply grateful for you allowing me to testify today.      My keen interest in the ephedrine regulation issue came about through a parent's deepest terror, the death of a child. On March 14, 1997, ephedrine killed my 24-year-old son Kristopher.      Since that time, I have been researching ephedrine; and I am appalled at how much information is available as to the serious dangers of this powerful cardiovascular and central nervous system stimulant and equally appalled at the lack of strict regulation of this drug.      Some members of the dietary supplement industry with their huge profits and their powerful lobbyists have mounted a concerted campaign to discredit the work of the FDA in gathering adverse event reports and in promulgating proposed ephedrine controls rules. Their motivation is to protect their profits, not the safety of the citizens of the United States.      Mainstream drug companies not only welcome adverse event reports, they have physicians and pharmacologists on staff to review and evaluate each adverse event report. With prescription and mainstream over-the-counter drugs, physicians and other health-care practitioners know to report adverse events to the FDA.     Page 64         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     However, the unregulated dietary supplement industry is another story all together. There is no industry-wide adverse event reporting procedure. Product labels generally do not carry 800 numbers for consumer use in reporting adverse events.      In general, the public is unaware that the FDA wants to receive adverse event reports on dietary supplements, and I strongly doubt that the dietary supplement manufacturers have physicians and pharmacologists on staff to evaluate what adverse event reports they do receive.      The industry disputes the validity of the data base of the FDA, yet they are not required to submit reports to it. Now they come to you complaining that the FDA adverse event reporting system is seriously deficient, the data base is suspect and the FDA has not used sound scientific studies upon which to base their proposed ephedrine control rules.      I respectfully ask whether the dietary supplement industry has submitted even one peer-reviewed, sound scientific study to prove the safety of their ephedrine-laced products in humans. They are bashing the science and data of the FDA because they have nothing of substance to support their position.      They also use the Chicken Little argument, the sky is falling. They claim that strict regulation of ephedrine will destroy the dietary supplement industry. This argument is preposterous on its face. Some dietary supplement manufacturers have recognized the serious dangers and potential liability of this amphetamine analog and have already removed it from their products; and those products are selling quite well, thank you.      My organization, Halt Ephedrine Abuse Today, is conducting a survey of ephedrine use on the Internet. As of April 30, 1999, with 227 people reporting, 48 percent report addiction.      Of those reporting using dietary supplement products as opposed to synthetic ephedrine products, 28 percent, over one-fourth report addiction. Among other adverse reactions, we have had reports of psychosis, stroke, cardiac arrythmia, kidney damage, nerve damage, heart attack, and death.     Page 65         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Contrary to the staffing problems with the FDA not being able to followup on these reports, I have spoken personally with many of these people after they have contacted me through the Internet. We have received an additional 85 responses since the end of April. They have not yet been collated.      This report is not scientific. It has not been reviewed by a licensed medical professional. It is purely the voices of American citizens detailing the adverse event reactions and injuries they have experienced. And this is just the tip of the iceberg.      My organization is hearing only from people with Internet access and who are actively seeking information on ephedrine; and of those, very few have reported their experiences to the FDA, and some even say, I didn't know I should.      Comparatively, the FDA already has in place a centralized reporting system where both private citizens and health-care professionals can report adverse reactions. If the industry has a problem with the reporting system and data collected, they should be working directly with the FDA to suggest improvements, which I have heard today they are doing, which I am very pleased with.      They should not be bringing their crusade to Congress in an effort to tar and feather the FDA without being sure that they provide constructive input as to how to fix the alleged deficiencies.      Regarding the industry's argument that the FDA has no legitimate science upon which to base their proposed ephedrine control rules, I respectfully refer the committee to the bibliography at the end of the June 2, 1997, proposed rules as published in the Federal Register.      Along with my written statement that I submitted, I included a bibliography of medical journal articles that I have collected. The proof is out there. The fire storm the industry is trying to ignite against the FDA serves only as smoke and mirrors to divert the focus from the real issue: Is ephedrine a threat to the health of the citizens of the United States? Yes.     Page 66         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Is the industry taking responsibility for seeking out and collecting adverse event reports to learn the truth? No. Does ephedrine need to be strictly regulated? Yes.      I sincerely thank you for this opportunity to be heard. The playing field in this controversy is far from level. We ephedrine victims and our families don't have millions of dollars in corporate profits to spend. We don't have powerful lobbyists with political connections. We don't have paid professionals whose job it is to be aware of and attend every hearing and committee meeting.      We are members of the general public; and we have a voice, too.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, for hearing that voice.      Mr.  BURTON.  Well, thank you, Ms. Michal. We appreciate your comments.      [The prepared statement of Ms. Michal follows:]      INSERT OFFSET FOLIOS 111 TO 139 HERE      [The official committee record contains additional material here.]        Mr.  BURTON.  Mr. Woosley.      Dr.  WOOSLEY.  Good afternoon, Chairman Burton and members of the committee. I am actually a physician; I am a pharmacologist and physician.      Mr.  BURTON.  Excuse me, Dr. Woosley.      Dr.  WOOSLEY.  No problem. It gave me a chance to emphasize the fact that I am a physician.      I have to say I am moved and even shaken to follow the previous two witnesses. I reviewed the FDA reports of their children's deaths, and I have to tell you it was difficult then, and it is more difficult now. I read those cases of—as they described, young children unknowingly taking poisons.     Page 67         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     I have helped the FDA analyze these cases, and that is one of the reasons that I am here today. I have helped them analyze these and many other cases, and I would like to tell you that there is nothing wrong with that process. It can be made better, but it doesn't make mistakes.      Since 1977, I have conducted clinical research and basic research on the mechanisms of the adverse effects of drugs in humans. In over 250 scientific publications, I have examined the toxic effects of prescription and nonprescription drugs, mainly on the heart.      My research has identified the mechanisms responsible for the potentially lethal cardiotoxic effects of several drugs, including Seldane, a widely prescribed antihistamine recently removed from the market.      I mention my background because it is this experience upon which I base my conclusions and the recommendations to you today. You have asked this panel to address a very serious question, and I don't appreciate the levity that some have introduced; it really seems inappropriate.      This question has major consequences for the health and welfare of many citizens in our Nation. You have heard testimony from others that there are major weaknesses in the FDA's voluntary reporting system; and I also have criticized it in the past, but usually for what it has not done, not for what it has done. Some have tried to cast doubt on the data that comes from the FDA's surveillance system. Please don't allow them to confuse you on this issue.      In 1994, I was asked by the attorney general of the State of Texas and the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the FDA to review 88, and later another 147, cases. These were cases of suspected toxic reactions of ephedrine-containing products. I have enclosed a copy of my initial report to the FDA for the record.      As you will see, in 1994 I concluded that there were reports of chest pain, heart attack, stroke, seizures, cardiac arrest, sudden death, two that we have heard today, some of these people in the prime of their lives. I concluded that these reactions are perfectly consistent with what one would expect to see from excessive dosage or extreme sensitivity to ephedrine.     Page 68         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     In August 1996, I served as a member of the FDA Food Advisory Committee to review all of the scientific evidence that had been accumulated by the FDA. The FDA has done due diligence. They have had a process—perhaps it hasn't been made known to everyone, but they have seriously investigated this issue. There was full agreement by this committee that the 800 cases submitted to the FDA were absolute proof of the harm associated with dietary supplements containing ephedra.      I and others have constructively proposed improvements to the FDA's current voluntary reporting system because it has inadequate staff. It often requires months to years before identifying an adverse event associated with a drug or a devise. The system is plagued by underreporting, incomplete reports, and inadequate staff for analysis of those reports. However, no credible argument has ever been made that the system makes errors in detection. It is a blunt instrument, but an essential one, that is capable of identifying frequent, serious problems, especially when they are closely associated with exposure to a product, as in this case.      In 4 years, over 800 reports of adverse events associated with over 100 different ephedrine-containing products were received at the FDA, 100 different, not just a few rebel products, 100 different products. The FDA has estimated that less than 1 percent of serious adverse drug reactions ever get reported. Therefore, the actual number of reactions to ephedra is far greater than the number that they have on record.      I have absolutely no doubt of the validity of the harm detected by the FDA scientists. In the past, the adverse drug reactions detected by the systems have been routinely confirmed by regulatory scientists in other countries that have used a wide range of different methodologies. An important part of the FDA system is the confirmatory process applied in the analysis of these, often less than adequate, reports. For example, because we know that ephedrine increases the blood pressure and heart rate in animals and in people, the profile of adverse events that you would predict to occur would be arrhythmias, stroke, cardiac arrest, and sudden death. These are exactly the kind of reactions I reviewed in those reports.     Page 69         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Additional confirmation is obtained by comparing the patterns of reactions to those seen with drugs that have similar pharmacologic action, such as amphetamine and methamphetamine. These have been the exact same kind of events reported with ephedrine.      Additional evidence for the reliability of the association is seen in the fact that 26 percent of the 800 reports included documentation that the adverse events subsided when the product was withdrawn. Further, in 4 percent of the cases, the exact same symptoms recurred when they reinstituted the therapy or the drug was again administered.      In summary, the FDA's spontaneous reporting system accurately detected and confirmed the harm that results from compounds containing ephedra. The public must be protected from the proven harm of these products.      Because of the biologic variability in the way people respond to these products and the fact that many people don't know that they have conditions which predispose them to the products harmful effects, such as coronary artery disease, it is impossible to identify a safe dose of these products.      I sincerely request that you give your strong support to the FDA's efforts and affirm their authority to take even stronger action and remove every one of these products from the marketplace.  When my 7-year-old son grows up and goes to Florida on spring break, don't let these products kill him.      Mr.  BURTON.  Thank you, Dr. Woosley.      [The prepared statement of Dr. Woosley follows:]      INSERT OFFSET FOLIOS 140 TO 143 HERE      [The official committee record contains additional material here.]        Mr.  BURTON.  I have a granddaughter and a grandson, and I share your concern about their exposure to things that could harm them.     Page 70         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Let me ask you a question. You reviewed the reports on the two young people who died. By any chance in those reports did you notice how much ephedra they had taken?      Dr.  WOOSLEY.  We tried to estimate that based on their labelled content, but in the FDA hearings it became very clear that you can't. FDA scientists collected those products that were being marketed then and measured their ephedra content. The content of ephedra and ephedrine-like alkaloids varied from 1 milligram to 100 milligrams, even though they were labeled to contain on average about 12 milligrams. We have no way of knowing how much these two young people took. The other aspect of it is it really doesn't matter how much it was, any amount could have been lethal.      Mr.  BURTON.  It is of concern. I take Sudafed and my wife takes a product that she uses for her asthma.      Dr.  WOOSLEY.  But that is not ephedrine. That is Sudafed. That is a much weaker compound. It is a totally different drug.      Mr.  BURTON.  All right. We will get back to that. That may be a layman's understanding.      Dr.  WOOSLEY.  This is a potent, toxic drug.      Mr.  BURTON.  What I would like to understand, when your son was in Florida and he took this, as I understand it, that particular product was advertised as giving people some kind of a feeling of euphoria?      Ms.  SCHLENDORF.  Yes, a feeling of euphoria or an energy boost or 100 other things.      Mr.  BURTON.  Right.      Ms.  SCHLENDORF.  It was also stressed that it was perfectly safe and harmless. Pete took at least four pills, could have taken as many as eight. His friends said they thought he took four. We were trying to account for all of them, so there could have been a couple more than four, but they didn't think that they were taking anything dangerous.     Page 71         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     And what came out in our investigation of the pills and of the company, the company didn't know how much ephedra was in the product; and one box could have varied greatly to the next. We don't know how much he took.      Mr.  BURTON.  And I don't like to get into too much of the detail because it is not comfortable for everybody, but the autopsy that was performed, I presume, did it indicate in any way how much of this product or this substance was in his system?      Dr.  WOOSLEY.  I don't remember in this specific case, but I recall in several of the cases there was analytical data indicating the quantity in the body.      The problem with all of that is, it doesn't really matter how much is in the body or even in the pills. There are people who are exquisitely sensitive. He may have been such a person.      In the hearings, I argued long and hard but failed to win the argument that there is no safe dose of ephedrine as a dietary supplement because there is no way you can give it to a large number of people without hurting an exquisitely sensitive person, for example someone who didn't know that they have high blood pressure.      Mr.  BURTON.  There are some products that I might buy over the counter which are perfectly legal and very safe for healthy people to take that might cause hives or severe problems for other people in my family, so that may not be unique to ephedrine.      Let me ask Dr. Farber about this. Doctor, Dr. Woosley has indicated that there is no safe amount of ephedra that can be taken, and you seem to have some expertise in this area. Can I have your opinion on that.      Mr.  FARBER.  Yes. I can't agree with Dr. Woosley. It is almost contrary to what every pharmacologist or toxicologist knows. Over 400 years ago, the father of modern toxicology said that the poisoning is in the dose and so forth.      And for a pharmacologist to say that there is no level of a material that is safe is mind boggling to me. There is a safe level of ephedra alkaloids; and the products of the responsible companies in this industry which do have proper labeling presents a product to millions of individuals that can be taken safely every day, and, in fact, billions of servings have been taken by people over the years.     Page 72         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     This would, indeed, make this product safer than peanuts and shellfish and chocolate and strawberries and aspirin and wine; and I could go on and on and on in regards to products that we all use with the concept that we are using it safely, that, in fact, has produced a higher incidence of reactions in the public than these products.      Mr.  BURTON.  Do you have a comment, Dr. Mowrey?      Dr.  MOWREY.  In the ephedrine hearings that took place in 1995 and 1996, I believe those were the years that Dr. Woosley was a part of, questions came up about what is the history of toxicology with ephedrine hydrochloride prescribed at a dose of 150 milligrams per day, which is over twice as much as what we are saying is—is established in the research on ephedrine or ma huang currently in use.      Somebody said there isn't any. I can't remember who that individual was, but the point was that with all of the millions and millions of doses of that ephedrine hydrochloride that have been administered, such as in Primatine, which does contain ephedrine, there is virtually a total lack of this kind of toxicology that we are discussing here today.      And so the idea of a disconnect was suggested. There is some kind of a difference between the alkaloids present in ma huang and those in ephedrine; and it was an open question at that time.      Since then there has been research published to demonstrate the pharmacokinetics of ephedrine in ma huang is virtually identical to the pharmacokinetics of ephedrine hydrochloride. I think we have settled that issue at least temporarily in view of maybe we need more research along those lines, but I think that question has been addressed and the initial response is that they are fairly identical in their reactions in the body.      Mr.  FARBER.  Mr. Burton, could I make another comment?      Mr.  BURTON.  Sure. Go ahead.      Mr.  FARBER.  Dr. Mowrey brings up an important point in regards to Primatine and some of the products that are offered to millions of Americans in over-the-counter preparations. Primatine contains ephedrine, and the labeling allows for a dose level as high as 150 milligrams a day.     Page 73         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     With the dietary supplements that we are talking about right now put out by responsible companies, the labeling suggests that there be no more than an exposure of 100 milligrams of ephedrine alkaloids, not necessarily ephedrine, but ephedra alkaloids; and some of those alkaloids are weaker, in fact, than ephedrine.      But it is interesting to note that people out there are taking Primatine at 150 milligrams a day—and at one time several years ago it was as high as 300—taking 150 milligrams a day and having ubiquitous contact with caffeine in coffee, in tea, in chocolate, in cola beverages; and there are no significant number of AERs being reported or in the files of the Food & Drug Administration. Doesn't that raise some questions? Thank you.      Mr.  BURTON.  Dr. Soller, has there ever been any analysis as to what is a safe amount of ephedrine and what is an excessive amount of ephedrine? Obviously Ms. Schlendorf's and Ms. Michal's sons took amounts that were excessive and did end up in their demise.      How do we know what is a safe amount, and what do we tell the American people?      Mr.  SOLLER.  Thank you. It is always difficult to try and be objective when you are—and deal with the science when you are dealing with tragic stories; and of course, we very much reach out to the parents, knowing that we have children as well.      And so with that and attempting now to step back and think objectively and what we know about the science, there has been a review of ephedrine through the OTC review that began in 1972 and subsequent reviews as well; and as a bronchodilator, ephedrine is used both as an inhalation form and an oral tablet.      Inhalation it will be about 5.5 milligrams per inhalation and then wait about 5 minutes and take another dose. And for the tablet, a total of a 25 milligram dose taken on a 4-hourly basis.     Page 74         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Now, information that has been sent in to FDA in reviewing this particular issue looked at the drug abuse warning network and found that ephedrine is fairly low on the list in terms of potential for abuse, that is, reports of an abuse situation to an emergency room setting.      And that is not particularly unusual in the OTC field because it is at the issue of a low potential for abuse, not absence of abuse. But what was backed up in that particular data-set for ephedrine was a 15-year cohort of AERs reported to companies finding that in a period where about a billion OTC tablets were sold, there were 171 adverse experiences and 3 of those were serious reports. There were no deaths.      So there appears to be a different situation on that OTC side than on this other side, and I would just like to make one or two more comments that kind of rounds out a view in terms of what I have heard here.      That is that the main issue here is for CFSAN to focus in on the safety of dietary supplements, and I would agree with Dr. Woosley that we have basically a system in effect at FDA which can be refined.      And even on the drug side, Jane Henney knows that there needs to be refinement by CDER, and we would suggest that same systems approach be put through all centers, including CFSAN, and that we do not get into the kinds of situations where we are arguing the administration of AERs but we are looking at the science and carefully documenting. That is very important to do.      The other aspect is that GMPs are very important to the industry, and we have commented to FDA and urged that GMPs be adopted into regulation that would be somewhat different than food GMPs, not quite as high as drug GMPs for appropriate technical reasons we need not get into.      But that is very important because it would raise the issue of identity and concentration within the particular dietary supplement and would very much help, as you would get reports from the field that would talk about unknown amounts.     Page 75         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     And if a company doesn't know what is in their particular product from an identity standpoint, it is our belief that raising the level of awareness on GMPs, allowing FDA to have that standard of inspection, would help the field and some of the occurrences that we have heard about today.      Mr.  BURTON.  Thank you. Ms. Schakowsky.      Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Since we are talking today about accurate reporting, I just wanted to elaborate a bit. We are talking about 500 voluntarily made adverse event reports on dietary supplements. That was Mr. Levitt's comment.      But I asked him later privately, and he said that is a tiny number of adverse events, that is how many were reported under this voluntary system, that is all there were. When I said 1 percent, he seemed to indicate that was more like it.      So I think it would be a mistake for us to conclude that there are not any adverse events larger than 500. But I wanted to also ask Dr. Farber in the interest of accurate reporting, Dr. Farber, do you have or have you had any kind of a financial relationship with a dietary supplement manufacturer of an ephedra product?      Mr.  FARBER.  I have been retained by the law firm of Hyman, Phelps & McNamara that represents several diverse companies in the dietary supplement industry.      Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  And you said that AERs are useless. That was your testimony.      Mr.  FARBER.  No, I really didn't.      Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  No, I wrote that down. You said AERs are useless.      Mr.  FARBER.  In this particular instance, they are close to worthless. I could show you some further information in regards my analysis on these AERs. I have personally spent, and my associate, over 700 hours examining every one of the AERs in the public docket. If you are interested, I can show you the analysis.     Page 76         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  What I am interested in is the AERs that were filed by Ms. Schlendorf regarding her son Peter. Is that worthless?      Mr.  FARBER.  No. No. I didn't say that. I said that when you look at the whole situation, there is very little that is—that you are able to interpret. Now, I have looked at the Schlendorf file, and I have looked at the autopsy report. I feel very sad for Mrs. Schlendorf in regards to this situation, but regrettably this young man took an illicit street drug, masquerading, perhaps, as a dietary supplement, and regrettably lost his life.      I don't condone the marketing of this product. Neither do the people that I have been working with or the industry that I have been trying to help. They are appalled that these products have been allowed to remain in the marketplace.      The Food & Drug Administration, indeed, had the powers under DSHEA to remove these products before Peter bought the product. They did not take the action that they were permitted by DSHEA to take against these things.      Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  I thought that you testified that it is safer than peanuts.      Mr.  FARBER.  I said when the products of the responsible industry companies are taken according to the labeled instruction on the product that they are safe and they are effective. That is not to say—I am not saying that abuse potential doesn't exist with ephedra. It does.      But I know—and it has been recently established—I think you are familiar with the Physicians' Desk Reference. I think almost every American has looked at this book to check on side effects of drugs. There is a new PDR on herbal remedies. That PDR says that ephedra is safe at levels up to 300 milligrams a day.      Now, the responsible members of this industry are recommending that their labeling state not to take any more than 100 milligrams a day.     Page 77         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  Thank you, Doctor. I would like to let Dr. Woosley respond to a number of things that were said here today. Go ahead, Dr. Woosley.      Dr.  WOOSLEY.  Thank you for that opportunity. I think it is very important to point out that the PDR and the PDR for herbals is simply a compilation of materials submitted by manufacturers. It has absolutely no other special credibility.      I would also defend myself as a pharmacologist in my statement that ephedrine has no safe effective dose as a dietary supplement. You can give 25 milligrams, 50 milligrams, 75 milligrams of ephedrine to everybody in this room and no one will ever feel anything more than a rapid heart rate and a headache and maybe trivial side effects.      But if you give it to millions the way that it is happening today, you get hundreds, or tens at least, of people dying like the ones that we heard about today, even at the low dose that is currently being recommended with no, absolutely no, proven benefit other than a high.      Do we want to recommend products be out there that can kill when there is no proven benefit?      Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  Could I go on for a minute. Just to underscore that, I am looking at some of the marketing of this product on the Internet.      Psychedelic Shrooms. Take a psychedelic magic carpet ride with the greatest pill on earth. Contains ephedra, sinac, whatever that is.      Then we have got each capsule contains 800 milligrams of ma huang extract; dosage orally, one to two capsules on an empty stomach 30 to 40 minutes before activity. Do not exceed recommended dosage.      We have got Midnight Ecstacy, Herbal Coke, Turbo Charge, all being advertised right now on the Internet.      Dr. Tim Johnson said on the tape this morning that he felt that ephedra should be acknowledged as a drug and therefore should be regulated as a drug, and I would like to hear the doctors' comments on whether or not they agree with that.     Page 78         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Mr.  FARBER.  Clearly the products that you have discussed—and I can go on and name many, many more like Brain Wash, Cloud 9, Ultimate Xphoria, Love Potion 69 and so on and so forth—they have all been taken out of the market at least by action of the Food & Drug Administration.      These products are winding up on the Internet, and the Food & Drug Administration has to work out some game plan to take action against these products. They are illicit street drugs; they are not dietary supplements.      Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  Should ephedra be regulated, as Dr. Tim Johnson said, as a drug?      Mr.  FARBER.  No, I don't believe so. If these dietary supplements are used according to the label—and the labeling on these products are almost identical to the labeling on Primatine—they can be used safely and effectively by the public without having to turn them into prescription items.      Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  And what is a safe dose?      Mr.  FARBER.  A safe dose would be 25 milligrams a day four times a day, not exceeding more than a 100 milligrams per day of ephedra alkaloids. The literature indicates that 25 milligrams per kilo four times a day is a safe dose even in the presence of caffeine. And you can go back into the literature.      Ephedrine had been derived from ephedra 75 years ago by K.K. Chen who became the scientific director of the Eli Lilly Laboratories. It has been extensively studied. We do know its pharmacology and what its side effects and toxicity is.      It is not a substitute for methamphetamine. For somebody to say it has the potency of methamphetamine and it has the capability of producing highs like amphetamine is wrong.      The DEA has acknowledged that it is not a substitute methamphetamine, and the United Nations has indicated that this material is not a drug or a substance that has any particular high level of drug abuse potential, and that has been as late as March of this year.     Page 79         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     In fact, there is a letter to Congressman Farr from the State Department declaring that ephedra is considered by the United Nations to be not a significant drug of abuse.      Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  Mr. Chairman, I wanted to ask that the accompanying materials to Ms. Michal's statement also be put into the record; and she seems really anxious, so say something.      Mr.  BURTON.  Without objection. Ms. Michal.      Ms.  MICHAL.  Thank you very much.      As far as the addiction and abuse and the effect of ephedrine mimicking amphetamine, it is an amphetamine analog. It is molecularly similar to amphetamine. It has been proven in studies by Dr. Paul Wellman at the head of the department of psychology at Texas A&M University that it affects dopamine in the brain exactly the same way cocaine and amphetamine do.      I mentioned that I was getting these reports from people over the Internet. I have just two comments that I would like to share with you as far as ephedra not mimicking amphetamine or giving them the same feeling.      I have a 40-year-old female from California reported that she was addicted to speed. She is a recovering drug addict. She took a product called Power Trim, two pills as per the label, took it once and she said, I knew right away it is the same stuff that I took when I was addicted to methamphetamine.      I have another one that basically said the same kind of thing. She was a former drug addict addicted to meth—a female, 24 from Oklahoma, and she took two pills, took it once of Advantage A.M. 300, and it was the same reaction: this is the same stuff that I was addicted to before, and I can't take it again.      Ephedrine is an amphetamine analog. I have a 48 percent addiction report rate, dosage run-ups to incredible levels.      Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  Mr. Levitt, is it true that those are illegal on the Internet? Are those drugs that I was referring to that are being marketed on the Internet, are they, in fact, illegal according to the FDA, which is what Dr. Farber said that those are illegal?     Page 80         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Mr.  BURTON.  We might ask him to return to the table after we conclude with this panel.      Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  I'm sorry.      Mr.  BURTON.  That is fine.      Let me just end up by asking one or two more questions. I want to make a comment. Dr. Woosley, you said that the food supplement industry did that PDR, but as I understand it from my staff, that PDR is based on the German government's commission and monograph. Is that correct?      Dr.  WOOSLEY.  There is something called the German Commission Monographs that is a translation of the monographs on herbal preparations.      Mr.  BURTON.  Is that the one to which you were referring?      Dr.  WOOSLEY.  No, that is a different document. The PDR for dietary supplements is a separate book and it is—Medical Economics markets these products.      Mr.  BURTON.  As I understand it, the industry took their PDR from the German government's?      Dr.  WOOSLEY.  They may have taken parts of it, but it is a form of advertising. It is not a scientifically rigorous document.      Mr.  FARBER.  Mr. Chairman, if I could make a comment.      Mr.  BURTON.  Dr. Farber.      Mr.  FARBER.  I have extensively used the German Commission E monograph, not AufDeutsch, but the English translation, and clearly ephedrine is recognized as a useful herb and recognized to be safe at dose levels considerably higher than 100 milligrams per day. The West German government has set up this commission, and it is heavily dependent upon the opinions found in these monographs.      Mr.  BURTON.  Let me ask Dr. Mowrey one more question. Dr. Dickinson, because we have not asked you a whole bunch of questions does not mean that we don't value your contribution.     Page 81         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Dr. Mowrey, can you give us any information about ephedra and how it works on fat metabolism?      Dr.  MOWREY.  This is a fairly new application for ma huang. It has its historical roots in the science of thermogenesis, and in particular in the discovery that brown adipose tissue in human beings is truly capable of significant thermogenesis in terms of its ability to help the body in its efforts to control weight.      Ephedrine turns out to be the only safe and effective molecule that we know of today to really activate this process in the body via sympathetic mediation. The process is under the control of the sympathetic nervous system, and we stimulate that with ephedrine.      There is plenty of research to support the contention that it is a safe and effective treatment for obesity in human beings. Like I say, it is the most popular treatment throughout Europe. Ephedrine/caffeine combinations there account for 80 percent of the weight loss market, and considerable research has been generated by Arn Astrup and a group in Denmark to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of this particular combination.      Granted, there are mild adverse events that occur, as we have been mentioning here, but serious adverse events are not seen in that research. That research, the subjects of course are screened so they don't have cardiovascular complications coming into the research. Labels are designed to help screen out people from taking the product that might be susceptible to that kind of an accident.      In the United States the Harvard group led by Patty Dailey with Lawrence Lanceburg on the team established the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment of human beings with an ephedrine, caffeine, and aspirin combination. That was published in the International Journal of Obesity in 1993.      Since the publication of that document, there has been a dramatic increase in interest in this particular mechanism for weight control. I think that it represents right now perhaps the boldest and the best program that we have for controlling weight because it seems to address the underlying physiology of the problem.     Page 82         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     In fact, most of the genetic research going on right now with leptin and other genetic mutations all seem to have as a common pathway metabolism in adipose tissue, in particular brown adipose tissue.      So it's a very strong thrust for the medical profession right now to be involved in doing this, and it is, I suppose, what has led the dietary supplement industry into producing products that contain those substances.      Mr.  BURTON.  OK. Well, let me just say to all of you how much I appreciate your time and your patience.      Once again, our condolences to both of you. We will certainly take into consideration everything that you two have said, as well as Dr. Woosley. We sure have heard a diverse group of opinions here. So thank you very much.      We would like to have Mr. Levitt return to the table just for a couple of seconds. Mr. Levitt, thank you for being patient and sticking with us for a little bit here.      I think what I would do is I will initially yield to Ms. Schakowsky, and then I just have a couple of questions for you, Mr. Levitt, esquire.      Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. I really appreciate this opportunity.      Let me ask you directly then what I had mentioned before. The 500 voluntarily made adverse events reports represent, in your view, what percent or how much of the total adverse events that occur with dietary supplements?      Mr.  LEVITT.  Well, we believe with all regulated products that the reports that get submitted is a tiny percentage of what is really out there, because people don't necessarily either make the connection themselves or even if they make the connection think that either—either don't know where to report it to or don't know how to or aren't sure what is going to become of it.     Page 83         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     So we estimate, even in the pharmaceutical area, that reporting is in the neighborhood of 1 percent of what really is out there.      Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  So would it be accurate then to conclude, because there are so few reported cases then, that there are, therefore, so few problems out there?      Mr.  LEVITT.  Well, I think it is hard to say that. What I think it is important to say is that the point of the adverse event reporting system, and I appreciate the chance to emphasize this, is to signal a potential problem. And even with under reporting, which is accepted in all of these systems, the chances are high that somebody is going to report it and then FDA has a chance to see it and check other data bases, other existing information, check the literature and, see, yes, do we think this signal is right.      So there is definitely under reporting, as there are with all of those. What we hope is reported is, if you will, an illustrative example and we can pick from even under reported important signals that can identify safety problems.      Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  Thank you so much for that.      I also wanted to clarify whether or not these drugs that contain ephedra, that are advertised over the Internet, are they—is that illegal to purchase them and to offer them for sale?      Mr.  LEVITT.  OK. The rule on that is that if these products are—contain what we would consider a drug claim, that makes them subject to the drug rules. Now what you have there is we have had to go back and say are there—by the kind of title that they give the product, by the kind of statements, if they are really essentially marketing it as an alternative to street drugs, that we will consider that a drug and in this case, since we know they don't have pre-market approval as an approved drug, then they would be illegal.      But the fact that they are illegal doesn't mean that it is easy to chase down. Things market over the Internet. FDA can try to do something. It is very simple for somebody to change their website, alter their name a little bit, and it is very much a difficult process to chase these people down.     Page 84         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  So it is a subjective conclusion on what they are claiming to be? I mean, energetic sensations, waves of sensual pleasure, gentle tingling sensations, states of nirvana, is this illegal?      Mr.  LEVITT.  The actual analysis of those is done by a different part of the FDA so I am not expert in the specifics, but that is the general point. The general point is how—if in the jargon that is used, if what they are really saying is that this is an alternative street drug, it is used for recreational purposes, it is not identified for weight loss or for something that is a normal mainstream use, then that would make it a drug claim and not lawfully marketable.      Ms.  SCHAKOWSKY.  Thank you.      Mr.  BURTON.  Thank you, Ms. Schakowsky.      Mrs. Schlendorf's and Ms. Michal's children lost their lives because of the over use or over—excessive consumption of these pills.      They have been taken off the market by the FDA, have they not?      Mr.  LEVITT.  You mean those particular ones?      Mr.  BURTON.  Yes.      Mr.  LEVITT.  My staff are telling me yes.      Mr.  BURTON.  What I would like to know, and followup to what Ms. Schakowsky just asked, is were the advertisements fairly consistent with what she just read for these other things that are on the Internet?      Mr.  LEVITT.  I—you don't know? Are they fairly consistent with what——      Mrs.  SCHLENDORF.  Yes, they are, and I also know that the exact product Ultimate Xphoria that my son took, it was recommended to take four and he only took four to maybe eight. That particular product is no longer manufactured. The company is still in business and they are manufacturing other similar things.     Page 85         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Mr.  BURTON.  OK.      Mrs.  SCHLENDORF.  There are lots of other things on the Internet very similar that any 10-year-old can buy. Those have not been taken off the market.      Mr.  BURTON.  OK. Thank you.      I would like to ask, Mr. Levitt, can't the Federal Trade Commission work with you to get these products that are being advertised on the Internet, that are using similar advertising techniques, can't they followup and try to run these people down?      I know that there are some ''Internet police'' now that are out there trying to get unscrupulous people off the Internet. It seems to me that the same thing could be done for these products that are endangering young people with excessive amounts of ephedrine.      Mr.  LEVITT.  Well, there are mechanisms that we are using.      Mr.  BURTON.  OK.      Mr.  LEVITT.  And shall continue to use for those.      But may I just say I think it is a mistake, and at least a number of the testimony in the previous panel suggested that the evidence and the adverse events that we have found are not limited to those that are viewed as ''high abuse levels.'' The questions that were basically asked were five.      No. 1, are there consistent patterns of signs and symptoms associated with the use of these different ephedra alkaloid containing products? And the answer to that was yes.      Two was, are the patterns consistent with the available scientific evidence and known physiologic and pharmacologic effects of ephedrine alkaloids? The answer was yes. The answer I am giving here was the answer from our Foods Advisory Committee.      Three, does exposure occur temporarily before the onset of the observed scientific symptoms, meaning did they take the product first? The answer was yes.      Is there other evidence of causality, meaning dechallenge, rechallenge? Dr. Woosley referred to that also, and the answer was yes.     Page 86         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     And then the question was, considering the totality of the available information, is there a biologically plausible explanation for the adverse events? And the committee concluded, I believe unanimously, that the answer was so.      Mr.  BURTON.  Was there any indication from that about the amount?      Mr.  LEVITT.  There was a number of views expressed about the amount. Some expressed Dr. Woosley's view that it would not be possible to establish a safe amount. Others on the committee suggested that FDA try and establish a safe level. That's what FDA tried to do in the proposed rule and so forth.      If I may, just one other point that is related to this. Appended to my written testimony is a chart that I would just like to put up briefly because it was—so much of this was addressed by the previous panel, because I think, again, a point that is often misunderstood. There are a lot of adverse events, some of them more serious than others, some less serious, obviously, than others, and we have talked about that. But what FDA did, and what is important to understand about the system in general, is that the point of those reports is not to give you a definitive answer. The point of those reports is to signal, is there a potential problem here? If they do, what else can we look at?      And the chart here shows, you start really at the bottom. What is in the literature that we know about it? Are there any controlled clinical trials? In this case, there were some trials dealing with weight loss. What do we know about the OTC drug experience? What do the experts say?      We take all of that together and say, is this supporting a global finding that there is a public health problem with these products? And they unanimously said, yes.      And so I was appreciative of some of the prior testimony about the FDA process. Before, we talked mostly about the process in general, but this is a case where the system did identify a real public health issue.     Page 87         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     People are struggling on exactly what is the right remedy. You referenced that. Is there a safe dose or not a safe dose? How many different products are out there? Is it some products and not other products?      There is a lot of complexities to the issue, but I think that should not take away from the underlying finding. And the Timothy Johnson segments, I think, underscored that, that there is something going on here that we need to try and remedy and do the right thing about that.      We are trying to do that, but I think, as you have also seen, it is a challenging labyrinth to get all the way through.      Mr.  BURTON.  Obviously there are some strong differences of opinion.      Mr.  LEVITT.  Right.      Mr.  BURTON.  The thing on the Internet, though, and we are going to review all of this information that has been submitted by everybody, the thing on the Internet is really important and you are going to put these disclaimers on there, you say, to try to make sure that people don't——      Mr.  LEVITT.  Yes. You mean the webpage, yes.      Mr.  BURTON.  On the webpage, right.      I would like to ask Dr. Yetley one last question. Is she still here?      This is on a different subject, but since we have you here I would like to ask you about it. We have received hundreds of letters from the public regarding the Codex Committee on Nutrition and Food for Special Dietary Use. There are a lot of consumers that are concerned that through an international governing body, upper limits will be set on the dosage of their vitamins.      Can you give me an outline of what the controversy is on that real quickly?     Page 88         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Mr.  LEVITT.  Could I just say, thank you for asking that question because again there is a lot of misinformation out there about that. I am sure Dr. Yetley can explain.      Mr.  BURTON.  Thank you for prefacing her comment with that. I appreciate that.      Ms.  YETLEY.  Thank you. The Codex Committee is an international standard setting committee. It is part of the WTO agreements, or at least it feeds into those.      There is a proposal on the table that was forwarded by the German government, which is proposing to set standards for vitamin and mineral supplements that would include both minimum and maximum levels.      First of all, let me make it very clear that even if the Codex Committee were to adopt these standards, it would not affect the products in the United States. The products under DSHEA would still have jurisdiction here. So it would not affect availability of these products in the United States.      This issue has come up before the Codex Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Use for the last two meetings. The U.S. position has been to oppose this particular standard because it is not consistent with our laws. However, the rest of the delegates have, as a majority, wanted to move forward.      We are now in the process of offering to work with other governments to write a background paper that would lay out the pros and cons of the various perspectives of different governments and different delegations. So it will give us a chance to lay forth our philosophies and concerns as well as other governments'.      Mr.  BURTON.  We would like to, if it would be possible, Doctor, to have you meet with our staff for a full briefing.      Ms.  YETLEY.  I would be glad to.     Page 89         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Mr.  BURTON.  We would really appreciate it.      Mr.  LEVITT.  I think that it is just indicative of the fact that these products are regulated differently in different countries, and when you get into different international fora, everybody tries to move it.      Mr.  BURTON.  Sure. We would like to have a briefing just so we can understand that better.      Mr.  LEVITT.  Sure.      Mr.  BURTON.  Mr. Levitt, thank you very much. Doctor, thank you very much.      We I want to thank all of our witnesses. It has been a long day. We really appreciate it, and we hope this has shed some light on this whole problem. The meeting stands adjourned.      [Whereupon, at 4:45 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]      [Additional information submitted for the hearing record follows:]      INSERT OFFSET FOLIOS 144 TO 158 HERE      [The official committee record contains additional material here.]
GX004-28-15721031	"Multilevel         Marketing Plans                     Produced in cooperation with the North     American Securities Administrators Association        M ultilevel marketing plans, also known as ""network"" or     ""matrix"" marketing, are a way of selling goods or services through distributors.     These plans typically promise that if you sign up as a distributor, you will receive     commissions -- for both your sales of the plan's goods or services  and  those of     other people you recruit to join the distributors. Multilevel marketing plans usually     promise to pay commissions through two or more levels of recruits, known as the     distributor's ""downline.""        If a plan offers to pay commissions for recruiting new distributors,  watch out!      Most states outlaw this practice, which is known as ""pyramiding."" State laws     against pyramiding say that a multilevel marketing plan should only pay commissions for     retail sales of goods or services, not for recruiting new distributors.        Why is pyramiding prohibited? Because plans that pay commissions for recruiting new     distributors inevitably collapse when no new distributors can be recruited. And when a     plan collapses, most people -- except perhaps those at the very top of the pyramid -- lose     their money.        The Federal Trade Commission cannot tell you whether a particular multilevel marketing     plan is legal. Nor can it give you advice about whether to join such a plan. You must make     that decision yourself. However, the FTC suggests that you use common sense, and consider     these seven tips when you make your decision:          Avoid any plan that includes commissions for recruiting additional distributors. It may         be an illegal pyramid.                  Beware of plans that ask new distributors to purchase expensive inventory. These plans         can collapse quickly -- and also may be thinly-disguised pyramids.                  Be cautious of plans that claim you will make money through continued growth of your         ""downline"" -- the commissions on sales made by new distributors you recruit --         rather than through sales of products you make yourself.                  Beware of plans that claim to sell miracle products or promise enormous earnings. Just         because a promoter of a plan makes a claim doesn't mean it's true! Ask the promoter of the         plan to substantiate claims with hard evidence.                  Beware of shills -- ""decoy"" references paid by a plan's promoter to describe         their fictional success in earning money through the plan.                  Don't pay or sign any contracts in an ""opportunity meeting"" or any other         high-pressure situation. Insist on taking your time to think over a decision to join. Talk         it over with your spouse, a knowledgeable friend, an accountant or lawyer.                  Do your homework! Check with your local Better Business Bureau and state Attorney         General about any plan you're considering -- especially when the claims about the product         or your potential earnings seem too good to be true.                     For More Information                               The FTC works for the consumer to        prevent fraudulent, deceptive and unfair business practices in the        marketplace and to provide information to help consumers spot, stop and        avoid them.

Production and Trade  In 1990-92, approximately 4,550 tonnes of tobacco were grown per year. In 1990, import costs of tobacco leaf amounted to US$ 65,000, compared to US$ 290,000 in 1985. Exports of tobacco leaf declined between 1985 and 1990, from US$ 2.5 million to US$ 1.4 million (0.4% of all export earnings). Nicaraguan tobacco is highly regarded abroad. In 1992, Nicaragua produced 3,029 million cigarettes, with all of them consumed domestically.    Industry   Only one cigarette manufacturing company operates in Nicaragua, which also produces cigars.       Tobacco consumption    Per capita consumption of cigarettes among persons age 15 and older has remained fairly constant since 1985, at approximately 1455. Per capita consumption is relatively high compared with other countries in Central America.

Prevalence    The only survey of smoking, performed in 1989, reported overall current smoking prevalence among young workers as part of an occupational health research project (mean age 33 years). Among men, 51% were current smokers, 5% were ex-smokers, and 44% were non-smokers. Among women, 16% were current smokers and 3% were ex-smokers.    Age Patterns  According to the 1989 worker survey, prevalence of smoking was higher for those age 25 years and older, with the difference more pronounced among women (4% prevalence for women younger than 25 years, 20% for women 25 years and above. Among high school students in the capital, 39.8% of boys were smokers (regular and occasional). Prevalence increased to a high of 64% for those more than 18 years old, however most (90%) smokers reported smoking less than 10 cigarettes per day. According to a 1988 Managua survey, 78% of smokers began smoking at age 17 or below.       Tobacco Control Measures    Control on Tobacco Products  Smoking product advertising has been prohibited since 1979, and the Chronic Disease Department of the Ministry of Health has responsibility for prevention of tobacco-related illness.

GX242-06-1762901	"Family Peer  School unity m m Co  So cie ty  M  r HS og A M od el P r  The Olweus Bullying Prevention Program The Olweus Bullying Prevention Program is a multilevel, multicomponent school-based program designed to prevent or reduce bullying in elementary, middle, and junior high schools (students 6 to 15 years old). The program attempts to restructure the existing school environment to reduce opportunities and rewards for bullying. School staff is largely responsible for introducing and implementing the program. Their efforts are directed toward improving peer relations and making the school a safe and positive place for students to learn and develop. While intervention against bullying is particularly important to reduce the suffering of the victims, it is also highly desirable to counteract these tendencies for the sake of the aggressive student, as bullies are much more likely than other students to expand their antisocial behaviors. Research shows that reducing aggressive, antisocial behavior may also reduce substance use and abuse.  Effective Substance Abuse and Mental Health Programs for Every Community  Proven Results  A 30% to 70% reduction in student reports of being bullied and bullying others; results are largely parallel with peer ratings and teacher ratings  Significant reductions in student reports of general antisocial behavior (e.g., vandalism, fighting, theft, and truancy)  Significant improvements in classroom order and discipline  More positive attitude toward schoolwork and school  TARGET POPULATION The Olweus Bullying Prevention Program targets students in elementary, middle, and junior high schools. All students participate in most aspects of the program, while students identified as bullying others or as targets of bullying receive additional individual interventions.  BENEFITS  Reduces existing bullying/victim problems  Prevents development of new cases of bullying  Improves peer relations at the school U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Center for Substance Abuse Prevention www.samhsa.gov  INTERVENTION Universal Selective Indicated  am  SA   OUTCOMES HOW IT WORKS Some key results are reported under the heading Proven Results. Two graphs from the last evaluation of 10 schools in Oslo, Norway, are presented below. The reductions in bully/victim problems varied between 33 and 64 percent for the various subgroups (girls and boys 11 to 13 years old in grades five to seven). The Olweus Bullying Prevention Program works with interventions at three levels: Schoolwide Interventions  Administration of the Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire about bullying (filled out anonymously by the students)  Formation of a Bullying Prevention Coordinating Committee  Staff training  Development of schoolwide rules against bullying  Development of a coordinated system of supervision during break periods Classroom-level Interventions  Regular classroom meetings about bullying and peer relations  Class parent meetings Individual-level Interventions  Individual meetings with children who bully  Individual meetings with children who are targets of bullying  Meetings with parents of children involved  IMPLEMENTATION ESSENTIALS Implementation of the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program requires significant and ongoing commitment from school administrators, teachers, and other staff. A first step is to establish a Bullying Prevention Coordinating Committee composed of administrators, teachers, students, parents, and the program's onsite coordinator. Training All school staff participate in a half- to 1-day training session. In addition, teachers are expected to--  Thoroughly read the Teacher Handbook: Olweus' Core Program Against Bullying and Antisocial Behavior and the book Bullying at School: What We Know and What We Can Do.  Hold weekly 20- to 40-minute classroom meetings.  Participate in regular Teacher Discussion Groups during the first year of the program. Additionally, school personnel on the Bullying Prevention Coordinating Committee--  Participate in a 1.5-day training with a certified trainer.  Attend 1- to 2-hour monthly meetings.  SAMHSA Model Pr ograms  http://model   Target Areas Program Management and Timing Depending on the school's size, a program will require a part- or full-time onsite coordinator. The optimal approach to program implementation involves selecting the onsite coordinator and administering the questionnaire survey in the spring; training staff in August, before school opens; and holding a schoolwide kickoff at the beginning of the fall semester. Technical Assistance Technical assistance is available for interested schools, including followup telephone consultation provided to the onsite coordinator every 3 to 4 weeks during the first year of implementation. Program Resources It is required that each teacher have a copy of the Teacher Handbook and Bullying at School. Other required materials include the Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire and accompanying PC software for processing and evaluating student responses. One videotape and accompanying guidebook, appropriate for grades three through eight, should be purchased for every six classrooms. Supplemental lesson plans may also be purchased. Risk Factors To Decrease Individual  Impulsive, hot-headed, dominant personality  Lack of empathy  Difficulty conforming to rules  Low frustration for tolerance  Positive attitudes toward violence  Physical strength (boys)  Gradually decreasing interest in school  Peer  Friends/peers with positive attitudes toward violence  Family  Lack of parental warmth and involvement  Overly permissive parenting  Harsh discipline/physical punishment  Lack of parental supervision  PROGRAM BACKGROUND In 1983, after three adolescent boys in northern Norway committed suicide, most likely as a consequence of severe bullying by peers, the country's Ministry of Education commissioned Professor Dan Olweus to conduct a large-scale research and intervention project on bully/victim problems. The resulting Olweus Bullying Prevention Program, developed at the University of Bergen in Norway, has been refined, expanded, and evaluated with positive results in two new large-scale projects in Norway. As part of the Norwegian Government's plans for the prevention of delinquency and violence among children and youth, the Olweus Program is now being implemented on a large-scale basis all over Norway. The program has also been successfully implemented in other countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. During the 1990s, Professor Olweus worked closely with a number of colleagues in the United States, notably Dr. Sue Limber and Dr. Gary Melton at Clemson University in South Carolina, to implement and evaluate the program in the United States.  School  Indifferent or accepting teacher attitudes toward bullying  Indifferent or accepting student attitudes toward bullying  EVALUATION DESIGN Two different types of evaluation designs have been used to assess the program. In several evaluations, what is often called an ""age-cohort design"" with time-lagged contrasts between adjacent but age-equivalent cohorts was used. One of the strengths of this quasi-experimental design is that several of the cohorts serve both as intervention and control/baseline groups (in different comparisons). Also, in one evaluation project, a traditional control group design was used.  pr ograms.samhsa.gov  1 877 773 8546   HERE'S PROOF PREVENTION WORKS PROGRAM DEVELOPER Dan Olweus, Ph.D. For almost 30 years, Professor Dan Olweus has been involved in research and intervention in the area of bullying among school children and youth. In 1970, he started a large-scale research project, now generally regarded as the world's first scientific study of bully/victim problems. In the 1980s, he began the first systematic study of bullying intervention and documented the positive effects of this program. During the late 1990s, Professor Olweus and his research and intervention group at the University of Bergen conducted several new large-scale intervention projects using a somewhat different study design, again gaining good results. Professor Olweus has been named ""the world's leading authority"" on bully/victim problems by The Times newspaper of London. His book, Bullying at School: What We Know and What We Can Do, has been published in 15 languages.

Here are some pitches that often herald illegal pyramid schemes:                                                                                                                                                               ""Make good money quickly and easily!""                                                                                                     ""Get                        in on the ground floor of an opportunity that's sure to                        snowball and make you rich.""                                                                                                      ""I'm                        sure you can recruit others to get involved!""                                                                                                                   Those                    pitches should ring warning bells. The attraction of quick and                    easy money -- and lots of it -- is hard to resist, but people                    who get pulled into pyramids typically find themselves lighter                    in the pocketbook than when they started. And sometimes they                    are in trouble with the law.                                                                                                                  Scores                      of illegal pyramid schemes ripple across Iowa every year.                      Pyramid schemes promise that if you pay in some money and                      then recruit others to join, you will receive an attractive                      pay-out in short order. As long as new people keep entering,                      others will make money (especially those at the top!), but,                      by definition, the pyramid can't go on forever and newcomers                      who toss in their money ultimately will lose out.                      Promoters                      of illegal pyramids often try to get around consumer protection                      laws by claiming they are really selling a product.                                                                     Here                          are questions to help you decide if a multi-level selling                          plan is really an illegal pyramid:                                                                                                                                                                                      Do                        presentations emphasize money-making and recruiting new                        participants, rather than selling a product?                                                                                                      Is                        the product simply treated as a ticket to participate in                        the money-making scheme, with little interest in the product                        for its own sake?                                                                                                      Is                        the product substantially overpriced, so others higher up                        the recruitment chain will get more money?                                                                                                      Is                        anyone buying the product outside the pyramid network?                                                                                                                  Pyramids                    may be disguised as games, motivational courses, buying clubs,                    mail order operations, chain letters, or multilevel marketing                    businesses. There are countless variations, but disappointment                    and loss is the rule for most participants.                                        Pyramids typically violate federal, state and local laws, both                    criminal and civil. Steer clear of pyramids. If you join the                    rush for cash, your money isn't the only thing you put at risk.                    You also risk your reputation and your relationships with the                    unhappy recruits who look to you when the scheme collapses --                    as all pyramids eventually do.

Production and trade  About 2,200 tonnes of unmanufactured tobacco were produced in the early 1990s ( a substantial decrease from 11,600 tonnes in 1985), supplemented by an annual import of 10,000 tonnes (compared to 7,000 tonnes in 1985). Cigarette production has steadily increased since the 1960s, and by the early 1990s, around 14,000 million cigarettes were manufactured annually. Iraq also manufactures tobacco for other purposes, such as for use in the shisha (a type of water pipe). Import cost of tobacco decreased from US$ 93.4 million in 1985 to $12.3 million in 1990, and then increased again to US$ 44.0 million in 1993.       Tobacco consumption    Annual adult per capita consumption decreased from about 1,250 cigarettes in the early 1970s to about 1,100 in the early 1980s, and then rose to almost 1,300 in the early 1990s. The consumption of manufactured tobacco in forms other than as cigarettes (hookah, pipes and some chewing) increased from 5,060 tonnes in 1971 to 7,800 tonnes in 1980 but had fallen to 5,000 tonnes by 1986. Per adult capita consumption of other forms of manufactured tobacco was 1,600 grams in 1975 but had fallen to 600 grams by 1985.                               Consumption of Manufactured Cigarettes                                           Annual         average per adult (15+)                                 1970-72                     1,250                                 1980-82                     1,090                                 1990-92                     1,280                        Tar/ Nicotine/ Filters  In 1994, 87% of manufactured cigarettes were filter-tipped.       Prevalence    In 1990, among adults aged 16 years and older, 40% of males and 5% of females smoked, a slight decrease from 1987, when prevalence was 45% and 7% for males and females, respectively. In the 1990 survey, 5% of males and 1% of females under the age of 16 years reported smoking.    Tobacco control measures    Control on tobacco products  Tobacco advertising is banned in Iraq.    Protection of non-smokers  Smoking is prohibited in hospitals and health care institutions and in schools, cinemas and closed meetings. Administrative measures exist for the limitation of smoking in public transport. In order to conform with a 1980 resolution of Health Ministers of the Gulf States, the government of Iraq requested Iraq Airlines to refrain from selling tobacco or cigarettes on board their aircraft.
