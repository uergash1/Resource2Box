GX261-71-6283039	"Vol. 149  WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, November 5, 2003  No. 159  Senate State me nt of S ena tor D iann e Fe instein ""On the Feinstein Amendment to H.R. 2673, the FY04 Agriculture Appropriations"" M rs. FE INS TE IN. M r. Pre siden t, this ame ndm ent has to do w ith providing some regulatory oversight ove r ener gy tradin g. It has to do w ith closing the En ron lo oph ole. It ha s to do w ith pro viding transp arenc y. Energy trades today are not subject to the 2 000 -passe d C omm odity M odern ization Act. Rathe r, these energy trades take place electro nically, take place in secre t, without transparency, with no reco rds ke pt, with no audit tra il available, and with no regulatory oversight to prevent fraud and manipulation in energy trading. I would like, first of all, from the De rivatives Stud y Cen ter, to ind icate and read a couple of paragraphs from the letter they have sent, which I think d efines the issue ve ry well. I quote: ""This regulatory assistance comes at a critical time. According to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Director of the Office of Market Oversight, `energy markets are in severe financial distress.' A long w ith the de cline in credit quality in these markets, the loss of confidence and trust has led to a ruin in the liquidity and depth of these m arkets. T his legislatio n will go a lo ng wa y to ad dress this pro blem ."" Then he defines what derivatives are. This is important for Memb ers to know. It is complicated. We went throu gh this on ce be fore. I w ould like to give you this definition because it is a good one: ""Derivatives are highly leveraged financial transactions, allowing investors to potentially take a large position in the market without committing an equivalent amount of capital. Moreover, derivatives trade d in ov er-the-co unter m arkets are devoid of the transparency that characterizes exchange-traded deriv atives, suc h as future s, and th is lack of transpare ncy introduce s a greater potential for abuse through fraud and m anipu lation."" That is exactly what happened. He goe s on to say: ""Derivatives are often combined into highly complex, structured transactions that are difficult, even for the seasoned securities trader and finance pro fessiona ls, to unde rstand and p rice in the mark et. Enron used such over-the-counter deriv atives ex tensively in o rder to hide the nature of their activities from investors. The failure of Enron and the demise of other energy derivatives dealers has had a devastating impact on the level of trust in ene rgy ma rkets."" That is a good definition of what we are trying to do, why we are trying to do it, and what we are trying to involve. Now I would like to read into the Record a portion of a letter from Eliot Spitzer. Mr. Spitzer is the Attorney General of the State of New Y ork. That is the place where many of these cases are now coming to trial. He says: ""I firmly sup por t your effo rts to make energy markets competitive and protect those markets from fraud and m anipu lation. T he bill sponsored by Senators Feinstein, Levin, and Lugar, and under con sidera tion as a n ame ndm ent to the proposed 2004 agricultural appropriations bill, is a major step towa rd b oth go als."" He goes on to s ay: ""The amendment makes a major contribution to compe titive energy mark ets by initiating an elec tronic information system to be operated through the Federal Energy Reg ulatory C omm ission. T his system w ill prov ide o pen acce ss to com preh ensive , timely, and reliable wholesale electricity and transmission, price and supply data, greatly expanding the choices of both buyers and sellers. In addition, the reliability of market information would be markedly improved by the amendment's general prohibition on manipulation of the purchase or sale of electricity or the transm ission se rvices n eed ed to delive r electric ity, and b y spec ific prohibition of the round-trip trading man ipulatio n used so effec tively to inflate electricity prices to the pub lic's injury.""  1   This is a letter from the Attorney General of the State of New York. As such, it places an imprimatur of correctness, of need, and of value on the amendment that we introduce toda y. No w, wha t is in that ame ndm ent? Spe cifically, the am end men t would impr ove price transp arenc y in wholesale electricity markets. The amendment directs the Federal Ene rgy Re gulato ry Co mm ission to do j ust wha t M r. Spitz er said it wou ld do : to estab lish an ele ctron ic system to provide information about the price and availability of who lesale e lectricity to b uyers, to sellers, an d to the pub lic. Th is provision is actually similar to the transparency provision offered by my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Dom enici, in the Energy bill. Sec ond ly, this legislation would prohib it round-trip electricity trades. W hat is a round-trip trade? It is the simultaneous buying and selling of the same quantity of electricity at the same price, in the same location, with no financial gain or loss. In other words, no commodity ever changes hands. Again, this is similar to a provision that Senator Domenici offered during consideration of the Energy b ill. Round-trip or wash trades are bogus trades. No electricity changes hands but the profits from the trades enrich the bottom line of a company's financial repo rt. In fact, I think we ha d on e com pan y-I believe it was CMS--say that 80 percent of their balance sheet in a given year was from bogus trad es. And there is nothing we can do abo ut it? D oes a nyone believ e that is right? I think not. I don't think the American peop le do, and that is one of the reasons these m arkets are so decimated. Next we would increase penalties for violations of the Federal Power Act  and the Natural Gas Act. Maximum fines for violations of the Federal Power Act would be increased from $5,0 00--tha t is nothing to a big company--to $1 million. And maximum sentences are increased from 2 to 5 years. Reme mber, these rip-offs were tremendous. Just look at the people plea-bargaining from Enron, look at what they did, look at the amounts of money they fraudulently compromised. This language is identical to section 209 of the Senate-passed Energy bill. Current fines are extraordinarily low and, therefore, provide no deterrence to illegal activity. W e also amend the Natural Gas Act to do essentially the same thing. Sena tor D ome nici, in his sub stitute electric ity title to the E nergy b ill, increased the fines in the Gas Act but he did not do so in the Federal Po wer A ct. W e wo uld d o bo th in this ame ndm ent. Ne xt the am end men t would pro hibit manipulation in elec tricity markets. Manipulation is prohibited in the wholesale electricity markets, and FERC is given discretionary authority to revoke market-based rates for violators. Strangely enough, manipulation of energ y mark ets is not p rohib ited in curre nt law. C an you believ e that? M anipu lation o f energ y mark ets is not p rohib ited in cu rrent law . Th is would add language to Part 2 of the Fed eral P owe r Act to do ju st that. M ost imp ortan tly, this bill wou ld repeal the Enron exemption and allow the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, which has oversight over virtually all other trading, to monitor the over-thecou nter en ergy m arket. This would repeal what happened in 2000 when Enro n pushed the Commodities Futures Modernization Act exemption for  large traders in energy com mod ities. And it would app ly antimanipulation and antifraud provisions of the Commodities Exchange Act to all over-thecounter trades in energy comm odities and d erivatives. In my view, when C ongress exempted energy from the Commodities Futures M ode rnizatio n Ac t of 20 00, it created the playing field for the western energy crisis of 2000 and 2001. The western energy crisis cost millions of people millions of dollars in my home State of California. So this is a charge I am making. W hen this Cong ress permitted the E nron loop hole to exist in the Commodities Mo dernization Act, they created the loophole for the playing field that Enr on an d oth ers use d to manipulate the western energy markets. Next, our bill would provide the Comm odity Futures Trading Commission the tools to monitor over-the-coun ter energy mark ets. Ov er-the-co unter e nergy tra de in energy commodities and derivatives performs a significant price discovery function, including trade on electronic trading facilities. Our amendment requires large, sophisticated traders to keep reco rds an d rep ort larg e trad es to the Commo dity Futures Trading Comm ission. This doesn't change the law. It only applies the law that exists for futures contracts to overthe-counter trades in energy markets. W e would limit the use of data. This requires the CFTC to seek the information that is necessary for the limited purpose of detecting and preventing manipulations in the futures and over-the-counter markets for energy, to keep pro prieta ry busin ess da ta confidential, except when used for  2   law enforcement purposes. This does not require the real-time publication of pro prieta ry data . It doe s not. This would have no effect on nonenergy commodities or deriv atives. T he am end men t would not alter or affect the regulation of futures markets, financial derivatives, or metals. We have specifically stated on page 20 the following: ""The amend ments by this title have no effect on the regulation of excluded comm odities under the Co mm odity E xcha nge A ct."" In addition, we state: ""Th e am end men ts mad e by this title have no effect on the regulation of meta ls unde r the C omm odity Exc hang e Ac t."" Mr. President, my colleagues may be asking themse lves wh y I con tinue to press this cause. Here I note that Senator Levin has come to the floor. I want the Senate to know how helpful the Senator from Michigan has b een in w orkin g on this complicated issue. He has spent hour s and hour s of his time . His staff has worked with my staff in evolving this mea sure. W e have carefu lly vetted it. I believe we really know what we are doing here. The energy crisis in the W est demonstrated that, without Federal ove rsight, a b usiness b eco mes so lely concerned with its bottom line and not with any sense of ethical behavior; and arrests and convictions to da te have clearly d ocu men ted this to be the case. Californians are still paying the price of this unethical behavior. I make the point that we are not talking about one bad player in the C alifornia market. This goes way beyond Enr on. It ex tends to othe rs as we ll-to Reliant, Dynegy, Williams, AEP, CM S, El P aso M ercha nt Ene rgy, Duke, M irant, Coral, Sempra Energy  Trading--unfortunately, in my own State--Aquila, the City of Redding, Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Pacificorps, and to the Puget Sound Ene rgy. W e believe California was duped out of $9 billion. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has illustrated its inability to refund California the money it is owed by recen tly recom men ding se ttlemen ts that in no way, shape, or form reflect the damage that was caused to both consumers and the economy of the largest State in the Union. In fact, FERC settled with Reliant on Aug ust 29 , allowe d them not to admit wrongdoing, and fined them $836,000. That was $836,000 for rules o f cond uct that co st the State $13 million--hardly fair. This disproportionately low fine gives credibility to the fact that the price one w ould have to pay in penalties, if caught manipulating the market, is worth the risk since the benefits of not getting caught far outweigh any penalty that may be lev ied up on a c omp any. I think it is pre tty clear tha t this disproportionately low fine gives credibility to the fact that the price one wo uld have to p ay in penalties, if caught manipulating in the market today, is worth the risk. There is no deterrence, since the benefits of not getting caught far outweigh any penalties that may be levied on a company. That is what we are trying to change. If I left any doubt in my colleague s' minds about the widespread manipulation that took place during the western energy crisis, let me poin t out som e rece nt exam ples o f a case that was brought by the Securities and Exchange Co mm ission ag ainst D avid Delaney, a former chief executive with two of the most prominent divisions of Enron. On October 30, 2002, Delaney pled  guilty to insider trading. The SEC brought charges against him for selling millions of dollars in Enron stock at a time he knew it was being manipulated. While these charges appear to be financial in nature, the underlying facts of the case were that En ron w as eng aged in manipulative b usiness practices, especially in California. In M arch o f 200 3, the F ER C staff repo rt on p rice m anipu lation in wester n mar kets: Inve stigators said they suspected Enron was using price inform ation o btaine d in regulated deals to manipulate trades in unregulated energy derivative markets. In one instance, Enron manipulated the price of physical gas, upward, then downward. Although the price change in the physical markets was only 10 ce nts per million B tus, Enron profited due to the effect that this small change in the physical price had on its large financial position. Enron earned more than $3 million in the unregulated overthe-counter markets, while losing only $ 86,0 00 o n the p hysical sa le of natural gas. I think it is important to note that the FER C repo rt also states: ""Enron's corporate culture fostered a disregard for the American energy customer. The success of the comp any's trading strategies, while temporary, demonstrates the need for explicit prohibitions on harmful and fraudulent market behavior and for aggressive market mon itoring a nd en force men t."" Th at is what w e are tryin g to pro vide in this ame ndm ent. T hat is what FERC says is missing. Our amendment would provide greater ove rsight over these markets so that fraudulent and manipulative behavior could be prevented. It would increase the penalties if, in fact, a company  3   engaged in fraudulent or man ipulative beha vior, an d it wou ld outlaw all types of manipulation including round -trip trading, wash trades, false reporting, churning, and deliberately withholding generation. All of the Enro n trading strategies, such as Ricochet, Death Star, Get Sho rty, Fat B oy, N on-F irm E xpo rt, Load Shift, Wheel Out, Black W idow , Red Co ngo, a nd C udd ly Bear: these are euphemisms for fraud and manipulation and our ame ndm ent wo uld co ver the m all. It is not clear to me why energy deriv atives ar e not re gulated while the Federal Government oversees some p hysical energy transactions. In other wo rds, if I buy natural gas, and it is delivered to me, then that transaction is overseen by FERC, which has the authority to ensure that this trans action is both transparent and reasonably priced. But a giant loophole is opened where there is no Go vernm ent ov ersight, when transac tions are carried out in electro nic exc hang es. As a result, if I sell natura l gas to yo u, and you sell it to som eon e else w ho se lls it to ano ther pe rson w ho the n sells it again, none of these transactions are covered by FERC or the CFTC. Because of that, what we saw in the wester n ener gy crisis is that this particular loophole allowed energy companies to manipulate prices and to escape any investigation or prosecution by any regulatory agen cy. Our amend ment will close the loophole, as Senator Levin said, created in 20 00 whe n Con gress passed the Commodities Futures M ode rnizatio n Ac t. The loop hole exempted energy trading from r egulato ry ove rsight, and it excluded it completely if the trade was done electronically. At the time, Enron was the main force beh ind ge tting this exe mptio n in this act. By closing this loophole, the amendment will prohibit fraud and  price manipulation in all over-thecou nter en ergy co mm odity transactions and provide the CFTC the auth ority it need s to inve stigate and prosecute allegations of fraud and manipulation. Opp onents of this amendment have que stioned why we need to exp licitly give the C FT C this autho rity. The answe r is we ne ed to give the Commodities Futures Tr ading Co mm ission this a uthor ity because we learned during the western energy crisis that there was, in fact, pervasive manipulation and fraud in energy markets, and that FERC and the CFTC were either unable or unwilling to use the autho rity they had to interv ene. I think M r. De laney's plea barg ain is eloq uent testim ony to that. W e nee d to giv e the C FT C this authority because we need regulators to protect consumers and make sure they are not taken advantage of. We need to give the CFTC this authority because, when there are inade quate regulation s, consumers are ripped off. Let me be cle ar. O ur am end men t will pro vide th e sam e pro tection s to consumers in energy markets as these sa me c onsu mers have in all other commodity markets such as the N ew Y ork M ercha ntile Exchange or the Chicago Merchantile Exchange. Our amendment do es not provide more regulation or greater oversight than what currently exists for other commo dity markets, merely the same protections: Protections which are currently lacking. In fact, in an effort to avoid onerous or com plicated req uirements, Senator Levin, Senator Lugar, and I have worked together to make sure the recordkeeping and reporting requirements are very clear. Our ame ndm ent on ly requir es trad ers to keep records of over-the-counter trades in energy commo dities and derivatives that perform a significant price discovery function.  In other words, these are the trades that affect the pricing for everyone. The se are the big trade s, and these are the trade s where there ne eds to be transparency because they affect the ma rket. If I am a large c omp any and I sell you 1,000 decatherms of natural gas in a typical transaction on the spot market, this is a price discovery transaction because the prices of these transactions are usually covered and repo rted by the press and will affect prices of subsequent transactions. Trades on electro nic ma rkets ser ve, by the ir very nature, as price discovery function s. Th ey sho uld b e ava ilable for everyone to see because they will very likely influence what price the nex t trader will buy o r sell at in an open and transparent fashion. Our amend ment would require trade rs to ke ep re cord s of their trade s and to ma intain an a udit trail. Th is requ ireme nt wou ld simp ly regulate energy trading in the same way other finite commodities are handled. Why should pork bellies or frozen concentrated orange juice have more protection for consumers than ele ctricity? There is nothing in this amendment that should be burdensome for traders in any way. I would think responsible traders would already be keeping records and maintaining an audit trail for their own protection in this world. In fact, the amendment only allows the CFTC to seek inform ation to investiga te allegations of wrongdoing. W e have worked for almost 3 years to craft this provision. It has had hearings in the committee. It has bee n discu ssed o n the floo r. W e have met with dozens of people. W e understand there are those who do not want to support it. But in not supp orting it, wh at they are doin g is condoning a marketplace that has practiced deep fraud and deep manipulation and for the most part  4   gotten away w ith it. I don't think we do our job as Senators if we can't protect an unsuspecting public. As the Derivative C enter pointed out, these markets are in disarray now. Why are these markets in disarray? They are in disarray because people do not have confid ence in them. T hey are in disarray because there is no transparency because there are hidden markets, and when they explode, they explode big time. W hy should Mrs. Smith from Texas or Mr. Jones from Pennsylvania or M r. Co rnyn fro m T exas inv est in these markets? Why should he? He wouldn't have confidence in them. He would have no transparency. He would have no ability to know what is going on. W hat we are trying to do is put that confidence back in the marketplace by pr ovid ing som e pru den t, commonsense, antifraud, antimanipulation oversight by saying: If you trade this way, you must keep a record of the trade. You must keep an audit trail. And these trades must be transparent so that the Smiths, the Jone s, and the Co rnyns, if they so d esire, ca n find o ut what in fact is going on. Let me stress that this does not impact financial derivatives in any way whatsoever. We have clarified that. Our opponents persist in using the argument that financial derivatives are affected. They are not. Look at page 20, lines 17 to 20, if you want to see it in black and white. Nothing in this provision affects the authority of the Federal Ene rgy Re gulato ry Co mm ission. W e don 't change it in a ny way. To respo nd to concerns about trading platforms that only match buyers and sellers, there is no capital requirement. Let me repeat that because people are going around saying the re is. T o resp ond to concerns about trading platforms  that only match buye rs and sellers, there is no capita l requir eme nt. Bottom line: Our amendment merely gives back to the CFTC most of the authority it had before Co ngress passe d the C omm odity Future s Exc hang e Ac t. M r. Pre siden t, at this poin t I would like to read into the Reco rd a colloquy b etween the two lea ders, Senators Frist and Daschle, which mak es clea r the pa rame ters of this and why we are o n the floo r on this bill. If I may: ""Sen ator D aschle : M r. Pre siden t, Senator Feinstein has a market manipulation amendment that she was seeking a vote on. It is my understanding that the agricultural appropriations bill would be the appropriate bill for that amendment. I would inquire of the majority leader, should she offer her am end men t to that bill, wo uld she b e assur ed o f a vote o n or in relation to her amendment with no second-degree amendments, prior to such vote? ""The majority leader responds: The Demo cratic leader is correct. If Senator Feinstein offers her amendment to that bill, she will get a vote on o r in relatio n to it."" I just offer that to clarify the prese nt legal situa tion. I have stated in the Se nate nume rous tim es it is the du ty of this Congress to make sure our regula tors ha ve all the a uthor ity they need to prevent fraud and manipulation in the en ergy markets. Simply put, this is what our amend ment do es. Enr on re mains the pe rfect exa mple of ho w the syste ms we re so e asily gam ed. A fter En ron su ccess fully lobbied for an exemption to the Commodity Futures Modernization Act in 2000, they and others in the energy sector quickly took  advantage of this new freedom by trading energy derivatives absent any transparency and regulatory ove rsight. In o ther wo rds, in se cret. Thus, after the 2000 legislation was enacted, Enron began to trade energy derivatives literally without being subject to proper regulatory oversight. Th at is how all these schem es cam e abo ut. Som e hotshot trad er, sitting in fro nt of his computer, found a way to evolve a strategy for the fraudulent and manipulative action of the marketplace. They let these various strategie s play o ut. Unlike the NASDA Q, from which timely electronic trade reports are available to the public, even prior to its transparency-enhanced reforms in 1997--in 1997, the NAS DAQ reformed itself to make their trad ers mo re trans pare nt-Enr onO nline d id no t offer time ly reporting of executions. This means Enr onO nline p rovid ed no data regarding recently executed transactions. Consequently, even after the trades, basic market inform ation w as no t prov ided to market pa rticipants. It should not surprise anyone that without basic transparency, without the ability to see what is happening, price s wou ld soa r. W hat intere sts me is the y did a nd yet the re is still resistance to this legislation. In 2 years, Enron's derivatives business had been a stand-alone company. It would have been the 256th largest company in America. That year, according to author Ro bert B ryce, E nron claime d it mad e mo re mo ney from its derivatives business, $7.23 billion, than Tyson made from selling chickens. That is huge, if you think abou t it. Think what that means. This segment of the market in one year made $7 billion and nobody knew how. No o ne knew what the trade s were . Th ey were all in secre t. Nothing was registered. There was no audit trail. There was no  5   antifraud, antimanipulation oversight. Boom. It happened. EnronO nline rapidly became the bigge st platfor m for e lectro nic energy trading. But unlike the regulated exchanges, such as the New Y ork Me rcantile Exchange, the Chicago M ercantile Exchange, and the Chicago Board of Trade, Enr onO nline wa s not re gistered with the CFTC. So Enron set its own standards. In other words, it had a very secure, quiet, protected niche on the mark et. Othe rs have tried to replica te that. The banks, for example, Senator Levin said, devised something called the Intercontinental Ex change so they could do the same thing Enron has done. It is wrong. Traders and others in the energy sector came to rely on EnronOnline for pricing information. Yet the com pan y's contro l over th is inform ation a nd its ab ility to manipulate it was tremendous. As autho r Ro bert B ryce we nt on to describe--and this is very colorful and true--Enron did not just own the casino. On any given deal, Enron could be the house, the dealer, the oddsmaker, and the guy across the table you are trying to beat in diesel fuel futures, gas futures, or the California electricity market. You tell me that is a good situation? Yo u tell me th is Sena te and this Co ngress should let that hap pen . W e should not. That is just plain wrong. Th ose w ho wa nt to pr otect this secre t niche a re just d ead wron g. It is not in the Ame rican peo ple's interest to have a secret trading niche that can be an empire for fraud and manipulation. We need to protect consumers from future Enron-like scam s bec ause the y are go ing to happen. Now, was Enron and its energy derivative trading arm, Enron On line, the so le reaso n Ca lifornia and the W est had an ene rgy crisis?  Absolutely not. W as it a continuing factor to the crisis? I certain ly believ e that ev idenc e has sh own it was. Unfortunately, because of the energy exemptions in the 2000 Commodity Futures Modernization A ct , w hi ch to ok aw ay th e C FT C 's authority to investigate, we may never know for sure. In other word s, quite p urpo sely, this Congress, in 2000, let this secret world be created and said: ""We are go ing to take energy and metals out of the entire trading regulatory structure and we are going to let them go on op erating on their own, without the proper oversight. That is exactly what hap pen ed. It is jus t plain wr ong."" I repeat, once again, the amendment we o ffer will subj ect elec tronic exch ange s such a s Enr onO nline to the same oversight as other commo dity exchanges, such as the Chicago M ercantile Exchange, the New York M ercantile Exchange, and the Ch icago Bo ard o f Tra de-no more, no less. Without this type of legislation, there is insufficient authority to investigate and prevent fraud and price manipulations since parties making the trade are not required to keep a record. This amendment is not going to do anything to change what happened in Califo rnia an d the W est. T hat is done. But it does provide the nece ssary au thority for the CF TC to protect other parts of this country against this kind of thing happening again. And it well could happen. Nobody thought we would ever see the kind of event that blacked out most of the East Coast and the Midwest, but we did. Nobody thought we would ever see what happened in the West, but we did. Nobody ever thought anybody would come up with schemes like ""Ricochet,"" ""Death Star,"" ""Get Shorty,"" ""Fat Boy,"" but they did.  No bod y thought they could use them to commit a manipulation of the market, but they did. I will leave you with one fact: The total co st of elec tricity in Califo rnia in 2000 was $7 b illion. The cost the next year was $28 billion. Does anyo ne be lieve tha t mark et force s-nam ely, supp ly and d ema nd--co uld accoun t for a 400-p ercent increase in the cost of electricity in a year? The answer has to be no. The answer has to be that bad things were done. So w e have work ed o n this amendment. I sit on the Energy Co mm ittee. I hav e tried to pay a great deal of attention to these matters, to follow this, and I am absolutely convinced that America and the business climate of America is much better off when things are transparent, when there are record s kept, when there is a regula tory auth ority that ca n say: W hoa. Something may be going haywire. Let's take a look at it. That is all we do--no mo re and no less than for any co mm odity. I wish to sa y one o ther thing . A financial derivative is not like an energ y deriva tive. Fo r peo ple to con fuse this an d say it affec ts financia l deriva tives is no t right. Ene rgy is a finite co mm odity. There is a beginning and there is an end, and it is different from a financial derivative. I believe the CFTC has antifraud and antimanipulation oversight on futures exchanges but not on overthe-co unter e nergy tra des. T hat is the differe nce he re. W e wo uld cover over-the-counter energy trades and particularly those trades that are electronic. I also want to show where existing law is inadequa te. There is a ca se that has just been brought to my attention which I think shows that the existing law is inadequate, and this is what we are trying to fix.  6   Two ene rgy traders from the energy firms Dynegy and El Paso were charged by the U.S. Government with reporting false information on a numbe r of trades--at least 48 trades. They falsely reported the number and the prices used in trades they con duc ted inv olving natura l gas in an attempt to influence the natural gas spot price indices. The Federal indictment charged them, a mon g othe r matter s, with wire fraud and violation of the Co mm odity E xcha nge A ct, which is what w e are ta lking ab out, provisions prohibiting price manipulation and dissemination of false information about energy comm odity rates. The Fed eral court allowed the wire fraud charges, but it dismissed the Commodity Exchange Act charges on the ground that the wording of the act failed to prohibit persons from knowingly pro viding false information. While the CEA used the word ``knowingly'' in an earlier part of the provision, the court ruled that the w ord had to be re pea ted in the section pro hibiting false information. Th e Fein stein-Lug ar-Lev in amendment would clarify the word ing of the CE A pr ovisio n to resolve the problem identified by this Federal district court in the case of the United States of America v. Michelle Valencia, Criminal Action No. 8-03-024. That is a pretty clear indication of where present law is not adequate. The se were bo gus trades. T hese trades never took place. There were totally bo gus, and yet the wo rding in the Co mm odity E xcha nge A ct, which we are trying to fix, was judg ed b y the co urt as too vague to take any action. Sec ond , I want to make this poin t: W hat we are trying to do is prevent fraud and manipulation. We are  trying to prevent it and deter it from happening. The soft penalties we have now don't prevent it. That should be very clear. We toughen the penalties in the Electricity Act and in the N ationa l Gas Act. Clearly, a number of these schemes that Enron practiced, whether it was ""Death Star,"" ""Ricochet,"" or ""Black W idow,"" or any of these other terrible schemes, took place. Our bill would specifically prevent them. W e are trying to prevent and deter, and the way we do that is by strengthening the law. I am really puzzled by the administration's position. I am really pu zzled beca use it seem s to me they should be on the side of the American people, not on the side of the trad ers and those w ho wa nt to get rich quick from this open marketplace. Additionally, it is interesting to me that the President's working group, when it came out in 1999, specifically said: ""Due to the characteristics of markets for nonfinancial com mod ities with finite sup plies""-that is energy""however, the work ing gro up is un animo usly reco mm end ing that the exclusio n""-the exclusion from the bill""not be extended to agreements involving such c omm odities ."" So beginning in the year 2000, they have done a total switch and I do not un dersta nd wh y, particu larly after the events of 2000 and 2001, where we know fraud and manipulation was explicit. Now when the Government tries to go after two comp anies for bogus trades, a court finds the Co mm odities Exc hang e Ac t is inadequate; it is vague. W hy would people oppose what we are trying to do? I think we are on the side of the angels.  Let me quickly go over some poin ts. W hy do we ne ed this legislation? W e need it bec ause com pan ies are n ow p ermitted to trade large a mou nts of en ergy in virtually unregulated marke ts, which makes it easier for unscrupulous companies such as Enron to manipulate the price of energy. The bill would close the Enr on lo oph ole tha t allows this unregulated trading. Secondly, do we have any exam ples o f how the se ma rkets have been manipulated? FERC recently released a 1-inch thick report on how the markets for electricity and natural gas in the western United States were manipulated in 2000 and 2001. So we know it happened. The FERC found Enron and other companies lied abou t the prices of their trades, reported fictitious trades to drive up prices, did wash trades with each other, and engaged in rapid trading to drive prices up and then back down, reaping millions of dollars of profits in the process and costing custo mers billions o f dollar s in unjustified energ y costs. T hat is accord ing to FER C. Th at is a finding in their stud y. Yet p eop le still oppose this legislation. Unbelievable. W ould this legislation have prevented these manipu lations? Un der c urren t law, the C FT C is totally in the dark about what goes on in the over-the-co unter marke ts. Under this legislation, manipulation in these markets would be a felony and the CF TC would get rep orts about large trades in the over-thecounter markets, so it would be able to mo nitor these marke ts, som ething it ca nnot d o no w. Sho uld anybody be able to escape from ongoing monitoring of what they do in these markets, big traders? I do not think so. Y et they are in this little loophole that was created. That was the purpose of the loophole, to prevent anybody from looking; keep no reco rds.  7   Therefore, they are not going to be able to catch us, and there will be a weak law so it will not be sustained in court when they try to bring a case. Ano ther qu estion: E nron is bank rupt. A number of traders have been fined and energy trading is back on the rise. The marketplace seems to be corr ecting itse lf. W hy is this legislation needed? It is needed to avoid more problems like we have just had. Although everything mentioned in the question I just asked may be true, there is one other significant fact. The consumers and businesses that paid higher price s have only rec ove red a small fraction of their lo sses. It is be tter to prevent the manipulation and the losses fro m hap pen ing than try to make up for them after they take place. That is the point. What our agencies have shown is there is, up to this point at least, no way for an aggrie ved mark etplac e to rec ove r its losses from fraud and any manipulation. Therefore, it should be our jo b to se e the law s are ac curate and in place to prevent this kind of activity from taking place in the beginning. That is where increasing the penalties comes in. Imagine, a $2,000 penalty for doing this. That is nothing. That is not even a slap on the wrist for multibillion-dollar com panies. How d oes one respond to the con cerns that this legislatio n will increase costs and uncertainty and scare off investment in the energy markets? It will not. The regulated U.S. co mmo dities markets are the most successful and reliable in the world. Ever since the agricultural exchanges were first regulated, we have heard dire predictions from commodities traders that regulation will drive busine ss ove rseas. In fact, the opposite has happened. W e have seen a flight to quality as investors seek safe and reliable markets. That is a fact. T his help s the ma rket.  Many traders and energy comp anies have said the a ctual cost of compliance with this legislation will be m inimal. Th e final qu estion: W hy shou ld energy derivatives be regulated differently or more stringently than financial derivatives? Because we do no t touch financial derivatives. M r. Gre ensp an, ple ase kn ow tha t. The price of energy derivatives can be manipulated by manipulating the supply of the underlying energy commodity. The price of financial deriv atives is ve ry difficult to man ipulate beca use it is difficult to manipulate the price of financial measures underlying the instruments, which generally are not commodities but abstract financial measures such as interest rates and curre ncy exchang e rates. T he n a ga in , in 19 99 , th e P re sid en t's working group saw this. They recommend ed they not put energy into the looph ole. The Cong ress saw d ifferently and put en ergy into this loophole, and the never-never land of secrec y went on. T hese bogus trad es were ena bled. T hese bogus trades took place. There are cases being brought, and we are even find ing that the law is inade qua te bec ause a cour t has said it is too va gue. W e cor rect tha t. I think this is really an important ame ndm ent. I do not think I cou ld live with m yself if I did no t try to do it. If we lose to day, b elieve m e, I will come back again and again, because we saw what happened. W e know there was massive fraud and manipulation. We know the loophole was there. We know there is no transparency, no record, no audit trail, and no antifraud and antimanipulation oversight for any over-the-counter energy trade. That is what we are trying to do. M y collea gues h ave re ferred to futures exchanges rather than over-  the-counter energy trades, and that is what we are refe rring to in this bill. Please, I know back here people look at the West and they say, aha, it is not us, but what I say to them is some day it could be them. Do they not want the law right? Do they not want to be pro tected ? D o they n ot wan t a record kept so the regulatory agency can look at it? I really hope the answ er is yes, an d I ho pe this Sena te will vote for this ame ndm ent. This is a report entitled ``The O verthe-Co unter D erivative s M arket in th e C om mo di ty E xc ha ng e A ct '' which was written by the President's working group on financial markets in 1999. On page 16 of that report, it goes on to say--and I want to read it in its conte xt: ""Due to the characteristics of markets for nonfinancial commodities with finite supplies""  which energy would be one  ""the work ing gro up is un animo usly reco mm end ing that the exclusio n""-In other words, the loophole-- ""not be ex tende d to a greem ents involving such commodities. For example, in the case of agricultural com mod ities, pro duc tion is seasonal and volatile and the unde rlying co mm odity is perishable, factors that make the mark ets for the se pro duc ts susceptible to supply and pricing distortions and to manipulation. Th ere ha ve also been severa l well known efforts to manipulate the prices of certain metals by attempting to corner the cash or futures markets. M oreov er, the cash market for many nonfinancial commo dities is dependent on the futures m arket fo r price disco very. Th e CF TC , howe ver, sho uld reta in its authority to grant exemptions for derivatives involving nonfinancial commodities as it did in 1993 for energy products, where exemptions are in the public interest and  8   otherwise consistent with the Co mm odities Exc hang e Ac t."" Then the loophole was promulgated. The section of the Commodities Exchange Act which contains that loophole is section 2(g) and is titled, ""Excluded Swap T ransactions."" The section read s: ""No provision of this Act (other than section 5a (to the exte nt pro vided in sections 5a(g)), 5b, 5d, or 12(e)(2) shall apply to or govern any agree men t, contra ct or tra nsactio n in a commodity other than an agricu ltural co mm odity if ag reem ent, contract or transaction is......""And then it goes on. This section in the Commodities Exchange Act is what creates the loophole, and that is the problem that we a re trying to corre ct in this legislation. I believe we do correct it. Again, it is very hard for me--and this migh t have so methin g to do with the fact we went thorough it in the W est--to und erstand why we would not want to deter this activity and strengthen the rules to prohibit such manipulation from happening in the future. W e wan t to be v ery cer tain that with all of this kind of trading, including over the counter trades and electronic trades, that the records are kep t and the re is an a udit trail cle arly exists and there is an opportunity for the Commo dity Futures Trading Commission to note something may be wrong and hold the proper investigation. This is no more and no less than what exists on the exchange toda y. Why should this secret world of trading be allowed to exist? I know peo ple ge t rich thro ugh it. T his secre t trading world allows p eop le to get rich by engaging in fraudulent trades, as was seen during the Western energy crisis. It is this type of manipulative behavior that we are  trying to stop. I can't understand why the adm inistration would not wa nt to support this. When M r. Greenspan came in and talked to me a few years ago when we first proposed this legislation, his main concern was finan cial de rivatives . Th is is why we mad e certa in, as I hav e said in my co mm ents, that this legislation does not concern financia l deriva tives. H e ma y well have expanded his view to all kinds of over-the-counter trades since then, but at the time I sat down and met with him, that w as no t his position. Regardless, we are talking about public policy. We are talking about protecting the people of America. W e are talking about strengthening the law so that what happened on the wes t coast c an nev er hap pen in the Midwest or on the east coast or any part of the nation. I mentioned what the Attorney Ge neral o f the State of N ew Y ork-the Atto rney G enera l, not a d epu ty-Mr. Spitzer, has written. Once again, let me read what he said. He is the one who prosecutes many of these c ases an d I rea lly think his views in this area should make a difference. He says: ""I urge your amendment's adoption. In ad dition to pro viding whole sale electricity markets, the transparency vital to effective competition, the amendment closes loopholes used to manipulate energy markets. It improves the ability to detect fraud and other m anipu lation, an d it deters manipulation by establishing substa ntive p enalties."" This is the Attorney General of the State o f New Yo rk who is going to be pro secuting many o f these cases. He says it is a wise thin g to do , it is a prudent thing to do, and you shou ld do it. He also says that this amendment  mak es a m ajor contrib ution to competitive energy markets by initiating an electronic information system to be operated through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. I have already talked abo ut this. Ea rlier, I said how th is legislation will provide op en access to comprehensive, timely, and reliable wholesale electricity and transmission prices. The attorney general rep eats that. He says: ""The reliability of market inform ation w ould be m arked ly impr ove d by the ame ndm ent's""-Do n't we wan t that? I thin k so-""general prohibition on manipulation of the purchase or sale of electricity, or the transm ission se rvices n eed ed to deliver electricity and by the specific prohibition of the round trip trading manip ulation used so effectively to inflate elec tricity price s to the p ublic's injur y. This is the prosecutor in one of the main S tates that w ould have th is kind of litigation. Then he goes on to say: ""Enforcement of the law and regulation safeguarding our energy markets would be greatly aided by other reforms the amendment pro vides . Th e am end men t would repeal the so-called Enron exemption which shields large energ y trade rs from over sight."" Once again, I want to iterate that this is the Attorney General of New York speaking. ""In ad dition, the ame ndm ent wo uld app ly to anti-ma nipula tion an d antifraud pro visions o f the Co mm odity Exc hang e Ac t""-- I just rea d this pro vision to you  ""Clea rly this section of the Act is inadequate by anyb ody's rea ding to effectively regula te all ene rgy transa ctions."" Our legislation would improve the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's ability to addre ss  9   complaints, and it would lift the restriction on the Federal Energy Reg ulatory C omm ission's autho rity to ord er refun ds. T hese re form s will make accountable parties, which are currently beyond the law's reach acco untab le for the ir action s and will increase reco very of overc harges. On ce ag ain, I ask, d on't we wa nt to do this? Do we really want to protect these people who are willing to do such harmful things to the American people? I a m s ho ck ed at th e a dm in ist ra tio n's letter. I tho ught the y were th ere to protect the public. M adam Presiden t, there really is a differen ce of o pinio n here . I would like to have the time to read part of the transcript in a hearing on the Co mm ittee on A gricultur e on J uly 10. A question that Senator Crapo asks to Mr. Newsome of the CFTC. ""Senator Crapo: I know we have bee n ove r this befo re bu t I want to be sure that I have it right. As I listened to the testimony of both of you it see ms to m e that ther e is actually a lot more agreement than disagreement with respect to what we ought to be doing and where we ought to be . The d isagreemen t, as I understand it, is over whether 2G excludes from the fraud and manipulation provision swap transactions. ""Now, swap transactions are  the dominant majority of what goes ove r the ov er-the-co unter m arket. ""I am correct about that. W ould the two of you agree that is the core of the disagreement between your testimo ny? ""Mr. Newsome: 2G certainly does exclud e swap transac tions."" Th at is my p oint. An d he is testifying to it in this committee that this is not  covered by the CFT C. It goes on. ""Senator Crapo: It excludes them from fraud and manipulation protections. ""Mr. Newsome: 2G excludes them from jurisdic tions o f the CF TC ."" The P RESID ING OFFIC ER. T he Senator's time has expired. Mrs. FEIN STE IN. I thank the chair.  10"

SUMMARY Ninety three frogs were submitted for evaluation. Frog malformations were classified into 6 major categories and 12 subcategories based on necropsy observations of 72 frogs (Appendix J) and the findings of radiographs performed on 69 of thes e 72 frog s (App endix D ). All of the pr imar y ma lform ations in fro gs from Verm ont w ere relativ ely uniform, involved missing or incomplete limbs, which is quite different from frog malformations found in other states wh ere ou r lab has co nduc ted studies . Unlike malfo rma tions in 3 oth er states (19 97 and 1998 Nation al W ildlife Health Center data), Vermont frogs collected in 1997 were unique in having no multiple limbs, no phocomelia or complete but extremely abnormal limbs, no pure rotational/skin web malformations, and only one frog with a possible craniofacial malformation. It was interesting that, on the average, all malformed frogs from all Vermont sites were in poor to emaciated body condition without discrimination by site or malformation type (Appendix F, Tab les #1 and #2). Ag ain, this wa s not our finding in o ther states. R adiogr aphs w ere extr eme ly helpful in determining the degree of malformation in the limbs as well as the type of abnormal termination in both long bones and digits. Malformations of the hip were also seen in some of the Vermont frogs and these would not have been detected without the use of high detail radiography. Radiographs were also helpful in differentiating trauma from malfo rma tion, althou gh nec ropsy observ ations an d histopa thology were also imp ortant in ru ling out trau ma. Histopathology was performed on 19 frogs (Appendix G). Histopathology on malformed bones showed two general types of bone changes. One of the characteristic types of microscopic change seen at the termination of the malfo rme d limb was v ery diso rganiz ed and hyper plastic cartilag e that wa s not ossifyin g norm ally and inte rfered with the formation of bone cortex. The second type of bone change seen at the point of termination was the formation of sma ll nests of end osteal type cartilage m atrix w ith som e orga nization b ut no ob vious m aturation or ossification . None of the malformed limbs had inflammation and they often had very poor skeletal muscle development at the term inal end. T raum atic am putation s did hav e micr oscop ic eviden ce of skele tal mus cle necr osis and inflamm ation. There were no microscopic changes in internal organs that could be related to malformations. The brain and spinal cord of the frogs submitted often had dilated ventricles and we are in the process of consulting with a neuropathologist to determine the significance of this finding. Virology cultures were conducted on 51 tissues on 2 different cell lines adapted for amphibians and electron microscopy was performed on selected homogenates of frog tissues to determine if viruses were present. No viruses were isolated or identified in any Vermont frogs. Bacterial cultures were performed on 44 tissues and 98 bacteria were isolated and identified. There did not appear to be any direct association between bacterial isolates and the observed malformations. Parasitologic examinations were conducted on 14 frogs. Although the parasitology sample size was small, no association could be found between the presen ce of m etacerc aria and the occu rrenc e of m alform ations.  5   II.  BACKGROUND  During the summer of 1995, a group of school children conducting a wetland nature study observed a high rate of abnormal leopard frogs in Henderson County, Minnesota. Since 1995, occurrence of deformed frogs have been reported in 42 states and 3 Canadian provinces (Gilbertson). The species reported have included northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), spring peeper (Hyla crucifer), American toad (Bufo americanus), gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor), bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana ), wood frog (Rana sylvatica ), green frog (Rana clamitans), pickerel frog (Ran a palustris ), and mink frog (Ran a septen trionalis ). Studies, funded by the USGS Biological Resource Division's Eastern Region in coordination with the Vermont Age ncy of N atural R esour ces, and the U.S . Fish an d W ildlife Serv ice, we re initiated thr ough the Na tional W ildlife Health Center in the summer of 1997. The objectives of the study were to characterize frog abnormalities, document the distribu tion of m alform ed frog s, determ ine the freq uency of ma lform ations, collec t baseline m orph om etric measurement of frogs, and collect water and sediment samples for analysis. The National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC) was requested to assist in defining the developmental problems in Vermont frogs. The role of the NWHC was to perform diagnostic assessments of abnormal and normal frogs from Vermont sites that were known to have malformed frogs. The diagnostic evaluation included gross necropsy examination, histopathology, virology, bacteriology, parasitology. In the spring of 1998 funding became available to perform radiology on a subset of the Ver mo nt frogs. A report of preliminary findings was presented at the NIH/NIEHS Workshop on Strategies for Assessing the Implications of Malformed Frogs for Environmental Health held December 4-5, 1997 at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. The data we presented at the conference made it clear that teratogenesis was occurring in tadpoles of the northern leopard frog. Factors that have been shown in the lab to cause teratogenesis are numerous falling into the general categories of genetic or environmental. Some environmental factors that can influence development are; chemical, thermal, infectious, or trauma-related factors such as UV radiation which can cause cell damage. Tadpoles are free-living postembryonic organisms that achieve all of their intricate developmental milestones without the pro tection of a sh ell or uteru s. The en vironm ent in w hich thes e tadpo les deve lop is com plex an d dyn amic . Sorting out the significant physical and chemical (molecular) factors that are contributing to teratogenesis in the frogs from those facto rs that are c oincide ntally pre sent in the en vironm ent with out direc t effect is impo rtant. M alform ations can indicate a ge neral tim e fram e durin g wh ich factor s are influe ncing th e teratog enic pro cess. Knowledge of the possible developmental stages that have incorporated an error can provide guidance in choosing appropriate times for collecting field samples for chemical analysis and guide researches in developing bioassays that mimic the timing of factors present in the field. Careful characterization and categorization of malformations occurring in the frogs can provide clues to potential causes through comparison with similar malformations that have been produced in lab experiments. Some of these laboratory experiments involving development date back as far as 1929 (Vogt). However, associations based on morphologic evidence are circumstantial and without further field and lab analy ses, con clusions canno t be draw n rega rding th e cause s of ma lform ations. To determine the causes of malformations, agents will need to be identified in the field at appropriate developmental times, and in the appropriate geographic locations in relation to occurrence of malformations. The agents must be capab le of consiste ntly pro ducing com parab le lesions in ap prop riate spec ies of frogs . Lab ex perim ents w ill need to take into consideration the role played by such variables as timing of exposure, dose and duration of exposure, and interactions between other environmental or host factors in the potential for producing the wide range of malfo rma tions seen in the field. La borato ry resu lts will need to be repr oduc ible und er field con ditions.  6   III. DEFINING THE PROBLEM The pathology of many of malformed frogs is obvious, the cause is not. Syndromes like these ha ve not be en clear ly defined in frogs an d even the directio n to look fo r answ ers is unde r deba te. Thes e chan ges are not prod uced b y a sudd en and catastrop hic insult. Malformations represent the end point in a developmental process that incorporated an error long befo re the ex ternal m anifestation of patholo gy. W hat are the errors in development and what questions can we ask to clarify the possible causes of these errors?  A. M orph ogen esis Fro m the time an egg is fertilized , an intricate r elationsh ip exists betw een cells an d cell 14897-011 layers w hich giv es rise to ver y orga nized an d highly specialized tissues. Th is proce ss is called morphogenesis. Morphogenesis occurs through cell division and proliferation, cell migration, cell differentiation, and programm ed cell death. Cells divide and proliferate following well defined maps as they move and fold, becoming more differentiated and specialized. As cell layers interrelate to each other they profoundly influence the growth and character of cells around them. The timing of this intercellular communication is critical and is thought to be carried out primarily by chemical signals that affect gen etic expr ession.  In limb bud formation, the mesoderm carries all of the information needed to induce a limb as it interacts with the overlying ectoderm. If the lateral mesodermal plate, represented in this figure, is su rgically tra nsplan ted onto the back of a tadpole, an entire limb will form in response to that committed mesoderm. During later morphogenesis of the limb the mesoderm is responsible for directing bone formation and the ectoderm is responsible for prov iding the ce llular env ironm ent that allow s the limb to continu e to grow . B. Malformation vs. Deformation If something goes wrong during morphogenesis and an error occurs in the sequence of cell division, cell migration, cell differentiation or programmed cell death, pathology is likely. This pathology is called a malformation or a deformation. Malformations represent primary errors in development; deformations arise later in development and usually result from mechanical factors. Timing of the error or insult influences both the occurrence and the type of malformation produced. And the appearance of the malformation can indicate timing. For example, if the malfo rma tion is an inco mp lete orga n, the factor or insult m ust have occur red du ring a su sceptible p eriod p rior to com plete form ation of that o rgan to halting dev elopm ent. C. Teratog enesis Teratogenesis is simply the name given to the abnormal development that results in malformations. These errors can involve any level of organ formation; cell division and proliferation, cell migration, cell differentiation, and programm ed cell death. Teratogenesis can be caused by either genetic or environmental factors (intra-uterine factors in mammals). Examples of environmental factors include radiation, hyperthermia, low oxygen, high carbon dioxide, poor nutrition and chemicals. Factors or compounds causing malfo rma tions are c alled terato gens.  7   The same teratogen presented at different developmental ages can initiate different malformations. However, different teratogens presented at the same developmental age can res ult in similar errors in develo pm ent caus ing the sam e ma lform ation.  IV. FINDINGS A. PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF FROGS WITH SIMILAR MALFORMATIONS Du ring July and S eptem ber 19 97, 93 r ecently m etam orph osed leo pard fr ogs w ere sub mitted to the Na tional W ildlife Health Center (NW HC) for diagnostic evaluation. Frogs were submitted from Alburg Dune (12 abnormal and 6 norm al), Lap ans B ay (14 ab norm al and 6 n orm al), M issisquoi N W R (15 abnor mal an d 6 nor mal), M ud C reek (6 normals), Poultney River (21 abnormal and 7 normal) and shipped, alive, to the NWHC . Diagnostic methods and proce dures are detailed in the study plan (A ppen dix B). Necropsy evaluations did not reveal developmental abnormalities in the internal organs of the frogs, although there were renal flukes (most likely Echinostomatae) in various stages of development and inflammation of the cloaca was occasionally seen. The most common primary abnormalities in these frogs involved the rear legs and examples of these limbs with radiographic detail of the bone changes provide information that assists in classification of the patholo gy as m alform ations or deform ations.  1. Deformations a. Trauma Ver y few frogs sub mitted w ere con vincing deform ities or traum a. Aga in, defor mities ar e not prim ary err ors in development but structural abnormalities that can be caused by mechanical forces, trauma, infectious agents or inflammation. Gross observations of northern leopard frog 14895-003 from Poultney River indicated a short femur on one side suggesting a malformation. Radiographs, however, show us that the femur actually has a overriding fracture which is a deformity caused by trauma. Although frog 14897-003 from Missisquoi is missing a limb, the changes in this limb are consistent with trauma and not a primary error in development. Characteristic changes associated with trauma include an abrupt end to the leg associated with an irregular depre ssed cen ter and r ed, inflam ed, raised mar gins. M icrosco pic examination of leg of the frog shown at right (14897-003) showed hem orrha ge, inflam matio n and ac ute necr osis of the sk eletal mu scle surro undin g the end of the fem ur. N o radio graph s wer e availab le from this frog as the limb w as section ed for m icrosco pic evalu ation. 14897-003 Two of the frogs (14896-008, 14897-003) were in fair body condition suggesting recent trauma. Frogs 14897-013 and 14895-003 were in poor body condition suggesting a more chronic condition.

Malformations The limb abnormalities seen in the Vermont study that represent primary errors in development follow and include; com plete or p artially m issing lim bs, rotation of long bo nes, and skin we bbing . a. Am elia This fro g is missin g a limb . This is a ver y early p rima ry erro r in deve lopm ent. If we look at the radiograph of one of these frogs with amelia (below 14895-015) we see that not only is the right leg missing, but the right acetabulum (joint for the femur) of the hip also never developed and the two bones (ischium and pubis) are absent. The hip and hip joint on the opposite side with a normal limb are unremarkable. There is no evidence of inflammation, fractures or vestigial bones in the regions where the right leg should be. The limb never developed. 14895-002 Where are the errors in development? The lateral mesodermal plate is responsible for the pelvic development as well as initiating the development of the rear limb. The lateral mesodermal plate must have been present, as evidenced by the presence of at least a portion of the pelvis on the affected side. However, there must have been a very early error because 2 of the 3 pelvic bones nev er developed. A pparent lack of initiation of a limb also suggests an early primary error in the formation of the limb with either an error in the development of the apical ectodermal ridge or in communication between the mesoderm and ectode rm.  Radiographs of three frogs with completely missing limbs showed two types of changes. Two of the frogs radiographed were 14895-015 missing the ischium and the pubis of the pelvis only on the side witho ut the limb , as in the rad iograp h show n abov e. The other ra diogra phed frog w ith ame lia had all of the p elvic elem ents pre sent. Frogs with amelia were emaciated.

Hem imelia Tru ncation of the limb sugge sts an erro r prior to the com pletion of lim b deve lopm ent but an error th at prob ably occur red later in develo pm ent than tho se erro rs occu rring in fr ogs w ith ame lia. Frog 14896-003 from Alburg Dune does not have the characteristic changes expected in a traumatized limb. There is no swelling, redness, inflammation, or irregularity at the termination of these limbs. There is no scarring and the pigm entation o ver the e nd of the lim b is norm al. Radiographs of these limbs show no fractures in the segment of femu r that rem ains and the term ination is blun t. Frogs with hemimelia have truncated limbs but the proximal segment of limb that is present is relatively normal. This is one of 2 types of bone changes seen radiographically in association with truncation of 14896-003 bone s (hem imelia). If we look at these two radiographs, we see 14896-014 had an abrup t termin ation of the fe mu r witho ut bone reaction similar to that seen in 14896-003. In the radiograph of 14895-013, however, the distal femur has very abnormal bone development at the end of the bon e with irr egular widen ing of the b one silho uette and increased lacy bone trabeculae traversing the marrow. There is no attem pt at bone develo pm ent bey ond this ab norm al bone . The bone changes in 14895-013 suggest that there was an error at the pro gress zo ne; w ith mes oderm al signals; or with comm unication between the ectoderm and mesoderm which eventually stopped growth but may not have stopped as abruptly as 14896-013 14896-014 in 14896-003. The bone development apparently lost its control and became very irregular abnormal fashion in 14895-013 but it did continue to produce bone. In 14896-003 and 014, we see no irregular bone growth at the termination, the bone just ends su ggesting a mo re abru pt halt to dev elopm ent. Microscopically, the proliferative bone changes as seen in 14895-013 confirmed thick, partially ossified trabeculae traversing the marrow w ith irregular and thickened cortices whic h we re som etimes bent at the po int of abno rma l develop men t.

Abnor ma l feet or m issing digits (Ectrodactyly or Brachydactyly) Frog 14895-008 from Poultney River has a short limb and, although difficult to recognize, this disorg anized limb en ds with a structur e resem bling a foo t. The radiog raph o f this frog sho ws tha t not only is the grow th abno rma l but differen tiation of the bo nes is abn orm al as we ll. There appears to be abnormal development of the distal tibiafibula and there was 180/ rotation of the tibiafibula that resulted in the tibiale bone in a lateral position and the fibulare bone in medial location. The tibiale and fibulare are short. The digit positions are also reversed 180/ (they are aligned in the appropriate order relative to the tibiale and fibulare bones) and phalanges. These malformations suggests an error in the mesoderm that may ed later in the develo pm ental sequ ence re sulting in ab norm al skeletal elem ents limb only.  14895-008 are missing have o ccurr in the distal  14895-008  Another example of abnormal development of the feet can be seen in the radiograph of frog 1489 5-18.

Rotation of long bones and skin webbing The radiograph of the Vermont frog shown (14895-010), although missing the distal limb on one side has rotation of the lower limb of the more normal leg with a bend in the bone that is traversed by a ""bone bridge"". Rotational abnormalities in the Minnesota frogs were very common. These rotational abnormalities involved the limb proximal to the hock causing the flexed hock to have either a dorsal or ventral orientation rather than pointing in the more normal medial direction. Although there were no Vermont frogs with rotation as its primarily malformation rotations did occur in relation w ith other m alform ations an d did res emb le som e of the M inneso ta rotations . Rotations were most likely to occur in frogs with ectrodactyly or brachydactyly (missing or shortened digits) suggesting that errors in the bone formation was occurring proximal to the affected d igits (4 frogs). L imb r otation also occur red in tw o frogs with fem oral hem imelia of the opp osite limb and in the sa me lim b as tibiafibula r hem imelia in a nother frog.

INTERPRETATION OF DATA Although the number of frogs submitted from each site was low, it seems important to look at the data to see if there was an association between malformation type and body condition. The potential impact a particular abnormalities migh t have on frog suc cess, as re presen ted by ge neral bo dy con dition or n utritional statu s, migh t also be acc essible through data analysis. Data from the field studies will be needed to determine if the malformations submitted from each site for this study were truly representative of the population in both malformation type and frequency of malfo rma tions pre sent. Although data should be corrected for population variation due to site variables as well as for weight bias secondary to absence of body parts in particular abnormalities, I feel looking at the frog morphology data, as in this scatter diagram, could provide insight into the association between the type of abnormality in the frog and body condition of those frogs, represented by the frog's weight in relation to length. The average body condition for all of the types of m alform ations w as poo r to em aciated w ith the exce ption of fro gs with amelia that were all very emaciated. B. MO RP HO LO GIC FIN DIN GS IN F RO GS FRO M EA CH STU DY SITE : Malformations from Vermont were 93% reduction malformations (amelia, hemimelia or ectrodactyly). Only 3 frogs submitted with malformations evaluated had an abnormality that did not involve truncation of a limb. Of the 61 malformations, (4 were bilateral) 10% had no limb on one side, 40% involved abrupt termination of either the femur, tibiafibula or tibiale and fibu lare and 43% had loss o r trunca tion of the dig its.  13   Fro gs from Miss isquoi ha d the m ost com plete limb develo pm ent with truncatio ns involv ing the low er limb distal to the femur. Frogs from Poultney River and Alburg Dune (although fewer number of total frogs were submitted from Alburg Dune) had the most severe truncations with the primary abnormalities involving apparent lack of any initiation of lim b (am elia) or trun cation of the limb at the fe mu r (fem oral hem imelia). A verag e body condition in frogs from all of the study sites was poor to emaciated. Frogs with no apparent malformations (controls) collected at the study sites also we re in poo r to fair bod y cond ition but the sa mp le size wa s too sm all to mak e an extr apolation to the overall population of leopard frogs at these sites. Lapans Bay had rear limb malformations primarily involving the tibiafibula a nd the foo t. This ch art of association of severity of malformation with site of collection might suggest errors occurring either at different developmental stages in frog development, or different dose or duration of exposure to a teratogen. 1.

Frogs from this site represented 50% of all Vermont frogs submitted with no obvious limb development (amelia) on one side, and 45% of all long bone hemimelia (femur or tibiafibula) an d 25% of missin g digits or p halang es. W ith the exception of one from Missisquoi with a uniformly short leg, Poultney River was the only site that had frogs submitted with limb malformations representing abnormal bone growth but with all components of the limb repre sented. T hese fro gs had rotation of th e limb w ith bone bridgin g as the on ly abnormality(as shown in 14895-010); cutaneous fusion between digits 1 and 2 but the bones of these digits were normal; and (14895-017) had a large distorted region of femur with m id-shaft disru ption of the trabecu lae and c ortex w ith the distal limb unrem arkab le.

This site had the mo st apparent errors in initiation (amelia) as well as the most truncations involving the femur. Although no control frogs were submitted from this site for comparison, the avera ge bod y cond ition of m alform ed frog s from this site is poor to em aciated.  14895-010  15   3.

Amelia at Lapans Bay represented 16% of all of the `97 V erm ont frog s subm itted with no obvious limb development on one side; 32% of all long bone hemimelia (femur or tibiafibula) and 17% of missing digits or phalanges. (one of the frogs (14898-010) had a tibiale or fibulare missing as well as missing 4 digits so that frog was represented twice in the above malfo rma tion cou nt)  Fro gs with rear lim b ma lform ation (148 98- 004 , 013 no t included as these w ere fore limb m alform ations): Snout to vent length (n=12): 3.08 cm Weight (n=12): 2.46 gm Body condition (n=9): 1.89 No rma l control fro g: (n= 1) Snout to vent length: 2.6 cm Weight: 1.4 gm Body condition: not reported but the weight/snout to vent ratio suggests an emaciated frog. Frogs submitted from Lapans Bay had malformations that represented truncations of all bones of the limb. One frog had an apparent error in limb initiation. The single control frog from Lapans Bay and the 12 malformed frogs all had an average of poor to emaciated body condition. 14898-004 had a forelimb malformation.  16   4. Missisquoi NWR MISSISQU OI (14897) Total frogs with malformed rear limbs : 21 No Bilateral Am elia : 0 Hem imelia /ectrom elia : 7 =3 3% of all malformations submitted from Missisquoi Ab norm al feet or d igits : 13 = 62% of all malformations submitted from Missisquoi Abnormal limb but all bone components present: 1 (all bones are proportionally short) =5% Trauma : 2 Primary site feature: hem imelia /ectrom elia Rear leg ectrom elia (0 femu r, 6 tibiafibula, 1 tibiale fibulare, 2 foot, 11 dig its or phala nges). It is interesting that all of missing bone components in frogs subm itted from Miss isquoi w ere distal to the femu r. Missisquoi had 3 2% of all long bone hemim elia (most of these involved tibiafibula) and 54 % of missing digits or ph alange s. Average measurements for frogs with limb abnormalities for which measurements were taken: (n=12; accession 002 not included as not a rear limb abnorm ality, 003 was not included because it was classified as traum a): Snout to vent length: 3.27 cm Weight: 2.34 gm Body condition: 1.33 Average measurements for normal control frogs: (n=0) Abn orm al limbs w ere trun cated at a m ore distal site po tentially sugg esting a m alform ation that be gan later in development of the tadpoles at Missisquoi. Even though the frogs from Missisquoi had less severe malformations than some of the other sites, they were still in poor body condition. 14897-002 had a forelimb malformation. C. DETERMINATION OF BODY CONDITION Gen eral bod y cond ition assessm ent (goo d, fair, poo r, em aciated) p erform ed at nec ropsy seem ed to m ost accu rately reflect the nutritional status of malformed frogs. This subjective assessment at necropsy was independent of the affect that the ab norm ality or frog size mig ht have had on weigh t. Wh en m ajor bo dy par ts of the frog were all present, body weight to body length ratios reflect nutrition status of frogs more accurately than body weight alone or snout to v ent length alone as a lar ge frog (length) m ay be em aciated an d have the sam e weig ht as a sm aller frog with good bod y fat stores. For this study, it was assum ed that sex was not a factor in the body cond ition or size of these immature, recently metamorphosed frogs. Frogs necropsied very close to the time of tail bud resorption (metamorphosis just completed) may still have fat reserves stored during the tadpole stage. These frogs would not have experienced the survival pressures placed on a frog that had been required to actively capture food for a longer period of time and the fat stores in these recently metamorphosed frogs could be misleading if used as an indicator of succes s as a frog.  17   D. HISTOPATHOLOGY FINDINGS Histopathology was performed on 19 frogs (Appendix F). Histopathology on malformed bones showed two general types of bone changes. One of the characteristics of bone at the termination of the malformed limb was very disorganized and hyperplastic cartilage that was not ossifying normally and interfered with the formation of bone cortex. The second type of bone change at the point of termination was the formation of small nests of endosteal type cartilage matrix with some organization but no obvious maturation or ossification. None of the malformed limbs had inflammation and they often had very poor skeletal muscle development. Traumatic amputations did have micr oscop ic eviden ce of skele tal mus cle necr osis and inflamm ation. N o cons istent mic rosco pic chan ges w ere seen in internal organs (heart, lung, liver, stomach, intestine, pancreas, kidney, bladder, gonad, spleen, thyroid gland, thymus, lymphoid aggregates) that could be related to malformations. The brain and spinal cord of the frogs submitted often had dilated ventricles and we are in the process of consulting with a neuropathologist to determine the significance of this finding. E. RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS Radiographs were extremely helpful in determining the degree of malformation in the limbs as well as the type of termination in both long bones and digits.(Appendix D) Malformations of the hip were also seen in some of the Vermont frogs and these would not have been detected without the use of high detail radiography. Radiographs were also helpful in differentiating trauma from m alformation, although necropsy observations and histopathology were also im portan t in ruling ou t traum a. F. RESULTS OF MICROBIOLOGICAL TESTING Lab tests were performed on the frogs sent into our lab so that information involving infectious agents could be looked at in relation to malformation types. 1. Parasitology In an attempt and made an compared to hem imelia o r to look for significance of metacercariae in the frogs, parasitology examined the frogs, cleared them estimate of metacercarial load. Metacercarial load in frogs from Vermont were relatively heavy, Minnesota frogs; the primary malformations in all Vermont sites were reduction defects such as trunca tion of a lim b wh ich has no t been disc ussed a s a direct seq uelae of m etacerc arial infection .  Parasitologic examination was performed on 14 frogs; with at least 1 normal frog from each site following procedure s outlined in the Study Plan (App endix C). Skin, subcu taneous tissue, coelom, oral cavity, esophagu s, intestinal serosa, kidney, urinary bladder, fat body, heart/pericardium, and skeletal muscle from the rear leg, back, abdomen, tail bud area were examined for metacercaria. Metacercariae were most consistently seen in the kidney, how ever this m etacerc aria w as mo rpho logically d istinct (mo st likely Ec hinosto mata e) from the me tacerca ria seen in other locations. Skin, tail bud, liver, tissue adjacent to eyes, epaxial muscles were also common sites where meta cercar iae (mo st likely D iplostom atidae) w ere fou nd. Th e me tacerca riae table in Appendix H is organized by malformation and, although statistical analysis was not meaningful due to the small numbers, an association between metacercariae and malformation was not obvious. Metacercariae were present in both normal and malform ed frogs. Appendix H also contains a table for the adult helminths that were found in these frogs but these are listed for interest and are thought to be incidental findings as there was no pathology associated with these parasites.  18   The hip regio n of a clear ed frog pictured above show s three m etacerc ariae. 2. Bacteriology: Cultures of liver and kidney from 30 abnormal frogs and 15 normal frogs (45 frogs) were conducted following the protocol outlined in the study plan (Appen dix C). 29 different bacteria were isolated and identified from these frog s; most of them were in the group Enterobacteriaceae and are not usually considered to be primary pathogens. One important excep tion to this was Aero mon as hyd rophila which was most comm only isolated from frogs collected at Lap ans B ay. Aero mon as hyd rophila is a know n patho gen of am phibian s and re ptiles. No ne of the fro gs with Aero mon as hyd rophila isolated had evidence of trauma. The most common isolates from all sites were Alcaligenes xylosidans and Pseu dom onas c epacia and these bacteria were also isolated from norm al control frogs. No isolates could b e related to malfo rma tions.  3. Virology Attempts to isolate virus from livers, kidneys, hearts and occasionally skin sampled from 32 abnormal frogs and 19 normal frogs (51 frogs) followed the protocol for virus isolation outlined in the study plan. No viruses were isolated or identified in negatively stained preparations for electron microscopic in any of the samples from any of the frogs in this study.

Many of these terms, defined in Appendix B, were originally used to describe defects that are present in the mamm alian fetus at birth. Direct application of these terms to frogs that metamorphose in a free-living postembryonic state may or may not prove to be appropriate. However, common terminology may allow recognition of similar conditions by individuals in related specialties involving developmental anomalies across species and bring new interest and collaboration to the issues involving malformed frogs. The terminology in reference to possible points of error in development (mesodermal versus ectodermal) may be simplistic, but allows an initial attempt at looking at the pathogene sis of some of these malform ations. Case num ber : National Wildlife Health Center (NW HC) reference number given to a group of frogs submitted from the same site and usually collected in a similar time frame. Accession number : NW HC reference number given to individual frogs within a case. Body condition (as defined for this report by M eteyer): Bod y cond ition reflects the nutritiona l state of the frog and is determined by the pathologist by subjective assessment of relative quantity of muscle and body fat present in the frog at the time of necropsy. Assessment of body condition is independent of absolute weight or snout to vent length. Body condition has been scored in the following w ay so that averages can be m ade for com parison betwee n sites and abnorm alities; good = 4, fair= 3, poor = 2, em aciated= 1. Good body condition: Ad equate skeletal muscle and abu ndant fat in the fat bodies. Fair body co ndition: Adequate skeletal mu scle with reduced fat in the fat bodies. Poor bod y condition: Adequ ate skeletal muscle with scant or no body fat in the fat bodies. Em aciated body condition: Ske letal muscle wasting and no b ody fat in the fat bodies. W eight to length ratio (as defined for this report by Meteyer): The weight (gm) of the frog divided by the length (cm) of the snout to vent length of the frog which provides an approxim ation of nutritional status or body con dition as a numerical index value which correlates with body condition as assessed at necropsy. M orph ogen esis : Developmental process which gives rise to highly organized and specialized tissues through cell division and proliferation, cell migration, cell differentiation, and programmed cell death. Path ogen esis : Cellular events, reactions and other pathologic m echanisms oc curring in the developm ent of disease M esoderm : The embryonic layer from which connective tissue, bone, cartilage, muscle, blood, vasculature, notochord, pleura, pericardium, peritoneum, kidney, and gonads are derived. Ectoderm : The embryonic layer from which epidermal tissues (skin, hair, etc.), mucous membranes, nervous tissue, and extern al sense or gans (ey e, ear, etc.) ar e derive d. Malformations: Primary errors in any phase of morphogenesis including cell proliferation, cell migration, differen tiation, pro gram med cell death or regres sion of larv al structur es. Deformations: Deformations arise later in fetal life and represent alterations in form or structure resulting from mec hanica l factors. The re is no intrin sic defect in m orph ogen esis. M alformation sequence : cascade of events leading to malformation (IE urethral obstruction may cause secondary affect of rena l mor phog enesis an d ma y lead to de fects in the low er limb s due to co mp ression of blood vessels).  20   Appendix A: Definitions Continued . Malformation syndrome : single etiologic agent that simultaneously affects several tissues (IE viruses) RCK. Tera togen esis : Abnormal development that gives rise to malformations Teratogen : An agent or factor that causes the production of physical defects in the developing organism (embryo) Hy pop lasia : Incomplete development of an organ Aplasia (agen esis): Lack of development of an organ or tissue often resulting from failure of appearance of the primordium of an organ in embryonic development. For example, amelia is aplasia or agenesis of a limb. Ectro me lia : Hypoplasia or aplasia of one or more long bones of limbs. Types of ectromelia are amelia, hemimelia, and phocomelia. Ectro dacty ly : Absence of a digit (toe or finger) Brachydactyly: Absence o f phalanx (a bone that com prise the digits) Am elia : No obvious limb development Hem imelia : Developmental anomaly characterized by absence of all or part of the distal half of a limb; fibular hemimelia, tibial hem imelia Pho com elia : Absence of the proximal portion of a limb, IE feet attached to the body by a single small irregularly shaped bone Polym elia : A developm ental anomaly cha racterized by the presence of sup ernum erary limbs. Sym pod ia : Fusion of lower extremities Skin W eb (as defined for this report by M eteyer): The skin covering the leg traverses at least one joint restricting motion. Dorsal/ventral pigmentation maintained. Malformation or deformation of bone is often associated with restricted limb d evelop men t and is seen as rotation of the invo lved bo ne or join t, foresho rtening of the bon e, or fusion of joint. Rotation (as defined for this report by M eteyer): Deviation of bone or joint causing distal limb to have abnormal orientatio n.  21   APPENDIX B: INVESTIGATION OF DEFORMITIES IN THE NORTHERN LEOPARD FROG (RANA PIPIENS) AT SELECTED SITES IN VERMONT  Background and Justification In the fall of 1996, abnormalities in northern leopard frogs ( Rana pipiens) were observed by the public at 12 sites adjacent to Lake Champlain in Vermont. Incidences of abnormal leopard frogs were verified at four of these sites by staff of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources (VTANR ) on October 9, 1996. The incidence of deformities averaged 16.5 %, ranging from 5-23 % at the four sites (230 frogs observed). Several of the sites where deformities were observed were near the borders of the Missisquoi National Wildlife Refuge in Swanton, Vermont. Most of the abnormalities observed were missing legs or feet, but also included eye abnormalities. Similar observations have been made in at least seven states and two C anadia n prov inces. T he m ost exten sive w ork to da te has bee n cond ucted in M inneso ta and in the St. Lawrence Valley of Quebec. The mechanism(s) by which these deformities are occurring have not been identified, however, the predominant theories include: UV-B radiation; xenobiotic contaminants; and viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic diseases. The purpose of this investigation is to take the first steps in examining the abnormalities in the Vermont frogs. Specifically, this investigation will examine affected frogs from four sites in Vermont, catalogue the external and internal abnormalities, and compare to frogs of an unaffected site in Vermont, as well as abnormal frogs collected from M inneso ta in 1995 and 19 96. Se lect sam ples w ill be exam ined for virolog y, bacter iology, an d para sitology. T he ove rall information should verify whether the frogs in Vermont have developmental abnormalities, whether the abnormalities observed in Vermont are the same as those observed in Minnesota, and to begin to determine whether viruses, bacteria, and/or parasites could be respo nsible for the abnorm alities. Purpo se The purposes of this investigation are several fold: (1) to determine whether the abnormalities observed in northern leopard frogs in Vermont are developmental in nature; (2) to compare abnormal frogs to normal-appearing frogs collected from an expe cted con trol site to verify that there ar e differen ces; (3) to com pare ab norm alities found in Ver mo nt to abnormalities found in Minnesota to determine if they are the same phenomenon; and (4) to determine if a subsample of frogs h arbor viruses, b acteria, or parasites w hich co uld be re spons ible for the ab norm alities obser ved in V erm ont. Methods For ty north ern leop ard fro g bree ding sites ha ve bee n identified u sing rec ent data fro m re ptile and am phibian atlas wo rk in Ver mo nt. Nor thern leo pard fr og m etam orph s will be co llected from these sites in July , 1997 a s part of a larg er study to determ ine the distrib ution of de form ed leop ard fro gs in Ve rmo nt. The 40 sites includ e M issisquoi N ational W ildlife Refu ge and the four sites w here V TA NR staff observ ed defo rmities in 1996 . Fifteen ab norm al-appe aring fro gs from up to four sites, an d five nor mal-a ppear ing from a site expec ted to be un affected w ill be shipped live to the N ational W ildlife Health Center (NWH C) in Madison, Wisconsin. Frogs will be examined to characterize abnormalities and catalog them using standardized nomenclature and morphologic diagrams. Routine microbiological samples will be run as necessary on a subset of tissues. Catalogued data will be used to compare abnormalities in Vermont frogs to those recorded during 1995 and 19 96 M inneso ta frogs.

The majority of deformities have involved multiple, fused, or missing hind limbs, however, some recently reported developmental deformities have also included vestigial tails, missing, misplaced or sup ernum erary eyes and ossification abnorm alities (R. Brann ian, National W ildlife Health Center, pers. com m., 19 97; J. H elgen, M inneso ta Pollution Con trol Ag ency, p ers. com m., 19 97). The causes of the rise in amphibian deformities remain unclear, however, a number of hypotheses are presently being researched including: xenobiotic chemicals, parasites, and UV-B light. Some researchers have indicated that classifying the types of abnorm alities on a site will be helpful in isolating the causal agent or agents (C. M eteyer, NW HC , pers. com m., 19 97). In 1997, 19 sites in the Lake Champlain Basin in Vermont were surveyed for frog deformities. Rates greater than three percent were observed at 17 of the sites. Rates overall ranged from 0-45% and averaged approximately 8% (R. Levey, State of Vermont, pers. comm., 1997). A BRD Quick Initiative Grant of $8000 awarded to this project allowed the National Wildlife Health Center to conduct a workup of the abnormal frogs collected in Vermont. The workup included classification of abno rma lities, histopatho logy, ne crops y, virolo gy, bac teriology , and par asitology . The re sults of this wor k sugg ested that the re wa s no cor relation b etwee n viruse s, bacteria , or para sites and the frog abn orm alities obser ved in Vermont (C. M eteyer, NWH C, pers. comm., 1997). What the work did not include, due to insufficient funds, was skeletal analysis through radiology. This additional work should clarify whether the abnormalities observed are deform ities, caused by traum a or disea se, or m alform ations, cau sed by a disfunctio n in deve lopm ent. Th e wo rk sho uld also serve to diagnose any skeletal abnormalities not externally observable. Objective : To determine through radiology of frogs collected in Vermont in 1997 whether the abnormalities observed are developmental in nature or trauma induced, as well as to diagnose skeletal abnormalities not externally observable. Exp ected P rodu cts : A written report of the project findings will be prepared. The work will be presented at professional meetings and will be incorporated into peer-reviewed literature.

Following that study, we obtained ultradetail radiographic equipment which provided very detailed and magnified images of bone changes in the frogs. Given this new capability, quick response money was requested and provided in 1998 for a retrosp ective rad iograp hic study of these fro gs to see if ther e wer e specific bo ne cha nges u nique fo r frogs c ollected in Vermont or at specific sites in Vermont. Radiographs of 33 frogs collected in 1997 from 4 Verm ont sites have been perfor med and inter pretation of these rad iograp hic chan ges is com plete.

This tab le combines description of necropsy and radiographic findings. At this time we are determining significance of the radiographic findings based on malformation type and geographic distribution of the frogs. A final report will be sent by December 31, 1998 to the USGS -BRD E astern Regional Office, USFW S Region 5, and the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources after the radiographic findings are incorporated into the overall final report for the Vermont study. We are currently looking for funding to extend this study to include microscopic characterization of bone changes with comparison to gross and radiographic findings in an effort to more completely delineate factors that might be contributing to the prod uction o f malfo rma tions at the cellu lar level.  26   APPENDIX C : U.S. Geological Survey Biological Resources Division NATIONAL WILDLIFE HEALTH CENTER 6006 Schroeder Road Madison, Wisconsin 53711 Phone: 608-271-4640 STUDY PLAN Study Plan: Investigation of deformities in the northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) at selected sites in Vermont. Background and Justification: In the fall of 1996, deformities in northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) were observed by the public at 12 sites adjacent to Lake Champlain in Vermont. Several sites were near the border of the Missisquoi NWR in Swanton, Vermont. The presence of deformed leopard frogs were verified at four of these sites by staff of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources (VTDEC) on October 9, 1996. The prevalence of deformities averaged 16.5 %, ranging from 5-23 % at the four sites (230 frogs observed). Most of the frogs observed had missing legs or feet and some had eye abnormalities. Similar observations have been made in at least seven states and two Canadian provinces. The most extensive surveys and identification of deformities in frogs and environmental sampling to date has been conduced in Minnesota and the St. Lawrence Valley of Quebec. The mechanism(s) by which these deformities are occurring has not been identified; however, the popular theories include: UV-B radiation; xenobiotic contaminants; and viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic diseases. The purpose of this investigation is to take a first step by completing a clinical examination of deformed frogs collected from four sites in Vermont to complete the following objectives: Objectives: 1. 2. 3. 4. Characterize and catalog the external and internal deformities in leopard frogs in Vermont; Compare deformed frogs to normal-appearing frogs from an expected control site; Compare morphometric descriptions of abnormalities in Vermont leopard frogs to abnormalities confirmed in Minnesota frogs to determine whether any similarities exist; and Determine the presence or absence of viruses, bacteria, or parasites in deformed frogs. frogs breed are identified in the recent Vermont reptile and on 12 of these sites; VTDEC staff confirmed the frog deformities be collected from each of the 40 sites. Four sites with at least this study. Fifteen abnormal-appearing frogs will be collected frogs will be collected from a control site where no deformities  Methods and approach: Forty site where northern leopard amphibian atlas (Andrews, 1995). ). In 1996, deformed frogs were observed by the public on four of these sites in 1996. A least 100 frogs will 10% of the frogs appearing abnormal will be selected for from each of these four sites and five normal-appearing were present in a sample of at least 50 frogs.  Recently metamorphosed frogs will be collected and examined for the presence and type of deformities. Frogs with deformities will be placed in 11 x 32 cm plastic boxes with lids containing 1 air-hole/inch in a chilled cooler or shady location. Approximately 3 cm of water from the site will be placed in the boxes along with sphagnum moss. At the completion of frog collection, the plastic boxes will be placed in hard-sided coolers, surrounded on four sides with frozen blue ice containers. The boxes will be held in place by a washable metal frame. Eight frogs will be placed live in each container and shipped via overnight service to the National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC). Upon arrival, frogs will be examined to deter ermine how the frog responds to this abnormality, photographed, the deformities will be characterized and cataloged using nomenclature and morphologic diagrams developed at NWHC based on frogs submitted to NWHC, photographs by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA, Helgen), and a Quebec study (Ouellet, 1997). Routine histopathological and microbiological samples will be collected and processed on a subset of tissues. Catalogued data will be used to compare abnormalities in Vermont frogs to those recorded during 1995 and 1996 Minnesota frogs. Tissue samples or whole frogs will be archived for later use if funding becomes available or a potential agent causing the deformities is identified. Characterization of abnormalities and Necropsy Examination 1. Describe clinical condition/function or movement of any deformed limbs, multiple limbs or other grossly apparent deformities.. 2. 3. Photograph abnormalities before the frog is anesthetized or euthanized if possible. Euthanize one frog at a time using inhalation of Halothane (see NWHC SOP).  4. Necropsy will be performed with the use of a dissecting scope and 2X head loop. Frogs are opened with an ventral midline incision. The heart is collected and a blood smear made. Tissues for virology will be placed in viral transport media, tissues for bacteriology in vials of broth and tissue for histopathology in formalin. Very small tissues will be places in embedding bags in formalin.  27   5. Necropsy set-up and lab distribution of frogs is as follows: Sites 1-4 Case #'s 14895 - 14898 Accessions 001-005, Pathology: 2 blood smears Multiple tissues in formalin and embedding bag Tissues for bacteriology, virology Accessions 006-007, Parasitology: Description of gross pathology Submit whole carcasses in whirl-paks, in saline Accessions 008-010, Virology: Description of gross pathology Blood smear Submit tissues in viral transport media Carcass saved in formalin jar - Hold Accessions 011-013, Bacteriology: Description of gross pathology Blood smear Submit tissues bact broth vial Carcass saved in formalin jar - Hold Accessions 014-015, Hold Frozen: Description of gross pathology Freeze back in whirl-paks Normals, Case # 14899 Accession 001: Pathology (necropsy as above) Accessions 002-003: Virology (necropsy as above) Accessions 004-005: Bacteriology (necropsy as above) Virology 1. Virus isolation will be attempted in amphibian and fish cell culture. Liver, spleen, kidney, gut and heart were pooled by like tissues (liver with livers, spleen with spleens) with a maximum of three frogs per pool. 2. Viral isolates will be identified and characterized.  3. Electron microscopy will be performed on the pooled tissues in an attempt to detect any viruses that cannot be isolated in cell culture. Bacteriology Frog tissues consisting primarily of liver, heart, kidney and others will be placed directly into appropriately labeled tubes of tryptic soy broth (TSB) at necropsy and submitted to diagnostic bacteriology. The following procedure will be followed: 1. The 10 ml tubes of TSB with tissue will be vortexes for 5-10 seconds and subcultured immediately onto blood agar (BAP), eosine-methylene blue agar (EMB), (or MacConkey agar), Lowenstein-Jensen agar (LJ), sabouraud-dextrose agar (SAB), thioglycollate broth (THIO), and cooked-meat broth (CM). 2. Media (except LJ and SAB) will be examined at 18-24 hour intervals for up to 72 hours before being discarded as negative. Positive cultures will be subcultured and identified to at least genus level. TSB will be subcultured after 24 hours if growth appears. LJ and SAB will be held as appropriate until sufficient growth develops or there is no growth. 3. Identification of bacterial isolates will be consistent with current capabilities and will include the use of commercial identification systems; predominately the API system, bioMerieux Vitex, St. Louis, Missouri. Reference laboratories, primarily the National Veterinary Services Laboratory, Ames, Iowa will be used as needed. Parasitology To determine the presence and species of parasites or evidence of parasite infections, live or freshly euthanized frogs will be sent to the parasitology laboratory for examination under a dissection scope. The following procedures will be followed: 1. Frogs will be skinned and the muscles and fascia examined under the dissecting microscope. will be teased apart and examined for metacercaria. Hind limb muscles  2. Metacercaria in the subdermal layers will be dissected free and placed temporarily in  strength Locke's solution and refrigerated. In some cases, this will cause the metacercaria to encyst so that fixation and staining can proceed. Notes will be kept and vial labeled as to collection site for the metacercaria. 3. A ventral incision will be made from vent to lower mandible to expose internal organs.  28   4.  The heart will be removed and a blood smear made according to DPL SOP.  5. All organs will be examined grossly, any parasites removed, prepped for fixation and fixed in AFA or 70% depending on the class of parasite. Most organs are small enough to examine via a squash preparation. Fat bodies will be examined via squash preparation for mesocercariae. 6. The body cavity will be examined for immature helminths. If found they will be removed, relaxed and fixed.  7. Eviscerated carcasses will be placed in 10% buffered formalin and later cleared according to Hanken ans Wassersug (1981). Following clearing frogs will be examined and the presence or absence of metacercaria noted. Critical Data: 1. Specific characterization of external deformities, 2. Documentation of internal deformities, 3. Histopathological findings for Minnesota frogs for comparison with Vermont frogs. Statistical Treatment: The research sites will be selected from areas with at least 15% of the frogs affected in a sample of 100 frogs. No specific statistical methods will be applied the data from this study. Routine statistical methods may be applied to determine the frequencies of certain lesions and establish similarities between sites. Assessment Criteria: Frogs will be examined for external and internal morphological and histological lesions and these lesions characterized and cataloged. The lesions present in Vermont frogs in this study will compared to lesions in Minnesota frogs described by NWHC in 1996.

SUMMARY Ninety three frogs were submitted for evaluation. Frog malformations were classified into 6 major categories and 12 subcategories based on necropsy observations of 72 frogs (Appendix J) and the findings of radiographs performed on 69 of thes e 72 frog s (App endix D ). All of the pr imar y ma lform ations in fro gs from Verm ont w ere relativ ely uniform, involved missing or incomplete limbs, which is quite different from frog malformations found in other states wh ere ou r lab has co nduc ted studies . Unlike malfo rma tions in 3 oth er states (19 97 and 1998 Nation al W ildlife Health Center data), Vermont frogs collected in 1997 were unique in having no multiple limbs, no phocomelia or complete but extremely abnormal limbs, no pure rotational/skin web malformations, and only one frog with a possible craniofacial malformation. It was interesting that, on the average, all malformed frogs from all Vermont sites were in poor to emaciated body condition without discrimination by site or malformation type (Appendix F, Tab les #1 and #2). Ag ain, this wa s not our finding in o ther states. R adiogr aphs w ere extr eme ly helpful in determining the degree of malformation in the limbs as well as the type of abnormal termination in both long bones and digits. Malformations of the hip were also seen in some of the Vermont frogs and these would not have been detected without the use of high detail radiography. Radiographs were also helpful in differentiating trauma from malfo rma tion, althou gh nec ropsy observ ations an d histopa thology were also imp ortant in ru ling out trau ma. Histopathology was performed on 19 frogs (Appendix G). Histopathology on malformed bones showed two general types of bone changes. One of the characteristic types of microscopic change seen at the termination of the malfo rme d limb was v ery diso rganiz ed and hyper plastic cartilag e that wa s not ossifyin g norm ally and inte rfered with the formation of bone cortex. The second type of bone change seen at the point of termination was the formation of sma ll nests of end osteal type cartilage m atrix w ith som e orga nization b ut no ob vious m aturation or ossification . None of the malformed limbs had inflammation and they often had very poor skeletal muscle development at the term inal end. T raum atic am putation s did hav e micr oscop ic eviden ce of skele tal mus cle necr osis and inflamm ation. There were no microscopic changes in internal organs that could be related to malformations. The brain and spinal cord of the frogs submitted often had dilated ventricles and we are in the process of consulting with a neuropathologist to determine the significance of this finding. Virology cultures were conducted on 51 tissues on 2 different cell lines adapted for amphibians and electron microscopy was performed on selected homogenates of frog tissues to determine if viruses were present. No viruses were isolated or identified in any Vermont frogs. Bacterial cultures were performed on 44 tissues and 98 bacteria were isolated and identified. There did not appear to be any direct association between bacterial isolates and the observed malformations. Parasitologic examinations were conducted on 14 frogs. Although the parasitology sample size was small, no association could be found between the presen ce of m etacerc aria and the occu rrenc e of m alform ations.  5   II.  BACKGROUND  During the summer of 1995, a group of school children conducting a wetland nature study observed a high rate of abnormal leopard frogs in Henderson County, Minnesota. Since 1995, occurrence of deformed frogs have been reported in 42 states and 3 Canadian provinces (Gilbertson). The species reported have included northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), spring peeper (Hyla crucifer), American toad (Bufo americanus), gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor), bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana ), wood frog (Rana sylvatica ), green frog (Rana clamitans), pickerel frog (Ran a palustris ), and mink frog (Ran a septen trionalis ). Studies, funded by the USGS Biological Resource Division's Eastern Region in coordination with the Vermont Age ncy of N atural R esour ces, and the U.S . Fish an d W ildlife Serv ice, we re initiated thr ough the Na tional W ildlife Health Center in the summer of 1997. The objectives of the study were to characterize frog abnormalities, document the distribu tion of m alform ed frog s, determ ine the freq uency of ma lform ations, collec t baseline m orph om etric measurement of frogs, and collect water and sediment samples for analysis. The National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC) was requested to assist in defining the developmental problems in Vermont frogs. The role of the NWHC was to perform diagnostic assessments of abnormal and normal frogs from Vermont sites that were known to have malformed frogs. The diagnostic evaluation included gross necropsy examination, histopathology, virology, bacteriology, parasitology. In the spring of 1998 funding became available to perform radiology on a subset of the Ver mo nt frogs. A report of preliminary findings was presented at the NIH/NIEHS Workshop on Strategies for Assessing the Implications of Malformed Frogs for Environmental Health held December 4-5, 1997 at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. The data we presented at the conference made it clear that teratogenesis was occurring in tadpoles of the northern leopard frog. Factors that have been shown in the lab to cause teratogenesis are numerous falling into the general categories of genetic or environmental. Some environmental factors that can influence development are; chemical, thermal, infectious, or trauma-related factors such as UV radiation which can cause cell damage. Tadpoles are free-living postembryonic organisms that achieve all of their intricate developmental milestones without the pro tection of a sh ell or uteru s. The en vironm ent in w hich thes e tadpo les deve lop is com plex an d dyn amic . Sorting out the significant physical and chemical (molecular) factors that are contributing to teratogenesis in the frogs from those facto rs that are c oincide ntally pre sent in the en vironm ent with out direc t effect is impo rtant. M alform ations can indicate a ge neral tim e fram e durin g wh ich factor s are influe ncing th e teratog enic pro cess. Knowledge of the possible developmental stages that have incorporated an error can provide guidance in choosing appropriate times for collecting field samples for chemical analysis and guide researches in developing bioassays that mimic the timing of factors present in the field. Careful characterization and categorization of malformations occurring in the frogs can provide clues to potential causes through comparison with similar malformations that have been produced in lab experiments. Some of these laboratory experiments involving development date back as far as 1929 (Vogt). However, associations based on morphologic evidence are circumstantial and without further field and lab analy ses, con clusions canno t be draw n rega rding th e cause s of ma lform ations. To determine the causes of malformations, agents will need to be identified in the field at appropriate developmental times, and in the appropriate geographic locations in relation to occurrence of malformations. The agents must be capab le of consiste ntly pro ducing com parab le lesions in ap prop riate spec ies of frogs . Lab ex perim ents w ill need to take into consideration the role played by such variables as timing of exposure, dose and duration of exposure, and interactions between other environmental or host factors in the potential for producing the wide range of malfo rma tions seen in the field. La borato ry resu lts will need to be repr oduc ible und er field con ditions.  6   III. DEFINING THE PROBLEM The pathology of many of malformed frogs is obvious, the cause is not. Syndromes like these ha ve not be en clear ly defined in frogs an d even the directio n to look fo r answ ers is unde r deba te. Thes e chan ges are not prod uced b y a sudd en and catastrop hic insult. Malformations represent the end point in a developmental process that incorporated an error long befo re the ex ternal m anifestation of patholo gy. W hat are the errors in development and what questions can we ask to clarify the possible causes of these errors?  A. M orph ogen esis Fro m the time an egg is fertilized , an intricate r elationsh ip exists betw een cells an d cell 14897-011 layers w hich giv es rise to ver y orga nized an d highly specialized tissues. Th is proce ss is called morphogenesis. Morphogenesis occurs through cell division and proliferation, cell migration, cell differentiation, and programm ed cell death. Cells divide and proliferate following well defined maps as they move and fold, becoming more differentiated and specialized. As cell layers interrelate to each other they profoundly influence the growth and character of cells around them. The timing of this intercellular communication is critical and is thought to be carried out primarily by chemical signals that affect gen etic expr ession.  In limb bud formation, the mesoderm carries all of the information needed to induce a limb as it interacts with the overlying ectoderm. If the lateral mesodermal plate, represented in this figure, is su rgically tra nsplan ted onto the back of a tadpole, an entire limb will form in response to that committed mesoderm. During later morphogenesis of the limb the mesoderm is responsible for directing bone formation and the ectoderm is responsible for prov iding the ce llular env ironm ent that allow s the limb to continu e to grow . B. Malformation vs. Deformation If something goes wrong during morphogenesis and an error occurs in the sequence of cell division, cell migration, cell differentiation or programmed cell death, pathology is likely. This pathology is called a malformation or a deformation. Malformations represent primary errors in development; deformations arise later in development and usually result from mechanical factors. Timing of the error or insult influences both the occurrence and the type of malformation produced. And the appearance of the malformation can indicate timing. For example, if the malfo rma tion is an inco mp lete orga n, the factor or insult m ust have occur red du ring a su sceptible p eriod p rior to com plete form ation of that o rgan to halting dev elopm ent. C. Teratog enesis Teratogenesis is simply the name given to the abnormal development that results in malformations. These errors can involve any level of organ formation; cell division and proliferation, cell migration, cell differentiation, and programm ed cell death. Teratogenesis can be caused by either genetic or environmental factors (intra-uterine factors in mammals). Examples of environmental factors include radiation, hyperthermia, low oxygen, high carbon dioxide, poor nutrition and chemicals. Factors or compounds causing malfo rma tions are c alled terato gens.  7   The same teratogen presented at different developmental ages can initiate different malformations. However, different teratogens presented at the same developmental age can res ult in similar errors in develo pm ent caus ing the sam e ma lform ation.  IV. FINDINGS A. PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF FROGS WITH SIMILAR MALFORMATIONS Du ring July and S eptem ber 19 97, 93 r ecently m etam orph osed leo pard fr ogs w ere sub mitted to the Na tional W ildlife Health Center (NW HC) for diagnostic evaluation. Frogs were submitted from Alburg Dune (12 abnormal and 6 norm al), Lap ans B ay (14 ab norm al and 6 n orm al), M issisquoi N W R (15 abnor mal an d 6 nor mal), M ud C reek (6 normals), Poultney River (21 abnormal and 7 normal) and shipped, alive, to the NWHC . Diagnostic methods and proce dures are detailed in the study plan (A ppen dix B). Necropsy evaluations did not reveal developmental abnormalities in the internal organs of the frogs, although there were renal flukes (most likely Echinostomatae) in various stages of development and inflammation of the cloaca was occasionally seen. The most common primary abnormalities in these frogs involved the rear legs and examples of these limbs with radiographic detail of the bone changes provide information that assists in classification of the patholo gy as m alform ations or deform ations.  1. Deformations a. Trauma Ver y few frogs sub mitted w ere con vincing deform ities or traum a. Aga in, defor mities ar e not prim ary err ors in development but structural abnormalities that can be caused by mechanical forces, trauma, infectious agents or inflammation. Gross observations of northern leopard frog 14895-003 from Poultney River indicated a short femur on one side suggesting a malformation. Radiographs, however, show us that the femur actually has a overriding fracture which is a deformity caused by trauma. Although frog 14897-003 from Missisquoi is missing a limb, the changes in this limb are consistent with trauma and not a primary error in development. Characteristic changes associated with trauma include an abrupt end to the leg associated with an irregular depre ssed cen ter and r ed, inflam ed, raised mar gins. M icrosco pic examination of leg of the frog shown at right (14897-003) showed hem orrha ge, inflam matio n and ac ute necr osis of the sk eletal mu scle surro undin g the end of the fem ur. N o radio graph s wer e availab le from this frog as the limb w as section ed for m icrosco pic evalu ation. 14897-003 Two of the frogs (14896-008, 14897-003) were in fair body condition suggesting recent trauma. Frogs 14897-013 and 14895-003 were in poor body condition suggesting a more chronic condition.

Malformations The limb abnormalities seen in the Vermont study that represent primary errors in development follow and include; com plete or p artially m issing lim bs, rotation of long bo nes, and skin we bbing . a. Am elia This fro g is missin g a limb . This is a ver y early p rima ry erro r in deve lopm ent. If we look at the radiograph of one of these frogs with amelia (below 14895-015) we see that not only is the right leg missing, but the right acetabulum (joint for the femur) of the hip also never developed and the two bones (ischium and pubis) are absent. The hip and hip joint on the opposite side with a normal limb are unremarkable. There is no evidence of inflammation, fractures or vestigial bones in the regions where the right leg should be. The limb never developed. 14895-002 Where are the errors in development? The lateral mesodermal plate is responsible for the pelvic development as well as initiating the development of the rear limb. The lateral mesodermal plate must have been present, as evidenced by the presence of at least a portion of the pelvis on the affected side. However, there must have been a very early error because 2 of the 3 pelvic bones nev er developed. A pparent lack of initiation of a limb also suggests an early primary error in the formation of the limb with either an error in the development of the apical ectodermal ridge or in communication between the mesoderm and ectode rm.  Radiographs of three frogs with completely missing limbs showed two types of changes. Two of the frogs radiographed were 14895-015 missing the ischium and the pubis of the pelvis only on the side witho ut the limb , as in the rad iograp h show n abov e. The other ra diogra phed frog w ith ame lia had all of the p elvic elem ents pre sent. Frogs with amelia were emaciated.

Hem imelia Tru ncation of the limb sugge sts an erro r prior to the com pletion of lim b deve lopm ent but an error th at prob ably occur red later in develo pm ent than tho se erro rs occu rring in fr ogs w ith ame lia. Frog 14896-003 from Alburg Dune does not have the characteristic changes expected in a traumatized limb. There is no swelling, redness, inflammation, or irregularity at the termination of these limbs. There is no scarring and the pigm entation o ver the e nd of the lim b is norm al. Radiographs of these limbs show no fractures in the segment of femu r that rem ains and the term ination is blun t. Frogs with hemimelia have truncated limbs but the proximal segment of limb that is present is relatively normal. This is one of 2 types of bone changes seen radiographically in association with truncation of 14896-003 bone s (hem imelia). If we look at these two radiographs, we see 14896-014 had an abrup t termin ation of the fe mu r witho ut bone reaction similar to that seen in 14896-003. In the radiograph of 14895-013, however, the distal femur has very abnormal bone development at the end of the bon e with irr egular widen ing of the b one silho uette and increased lacy bone trabeculae traversing the marrow. There is no attem pt at bone develo pm ent bey ond this ab norm al bone . The bone changes in 14895-013 suggest that there was an error at the pro gress zo ne; w ith mes oderm al signals; or with comm unication between the ectoderm and mesoderm which eventually stopped growth but may not have stopped as abruptly as 14896-013 14896-014 in 14896-003. The bone development apparently lost its control and became very irregular abnormal fashion in 14895-013 but it did continue to produce bone. In 14896-003 and 014, we see no irregular bone growth at the termination, the bone just ends su ggesting a mo re abru pt halt to dev elopm ent. Microscopically, the proliferative bone changes as seen in 14895-013 confirmed thick, partially ossified trabeculae traversing the marrow w ith irregular and thickened cortices whic h we re som etimes bent at the po int of abno rma l develop men t.

Abnor ma l feet or m issing digits (Ectrodactyly or Brachydactyly) Frog 14895-008 from Poultney River has a short limb and, although difficult to recognize, this disorg anized limb en ds with a structur e resem bling a foo t. The radiog raph o f this frog sho ws tha t not only is the grow th abno rma l but differen tiation of the bo nes is abn orm al as we ll. There appears to be abnormal development of the distal tibiafibula and there was 180/ rotation of the tibiafibula that resulted in the tibiale bone in a lateral position and the fibulare bone in medial location. The tibiale and fibulare are short. The digit positions are also reversed 180/ (they are aligned in the appropriate order relative to the tibiale and fibulare bones) and phalanges. These malformations suggests an error in the mesoderm that may ed later in the develo pm ental sequ ence re sulting in ab norm al skeletal elem ents limb only.  14895-008 are missing have o ccurr in the distal  14895-008  Another example of abnormal development of the feet can be seen in the radiograph of frog 1489 5-18.

Rotation of long bones and skin webbing The radiograph of the Vermont frog shown (14895-010), although missing the distal limb on one side has rotation of the lower limb of the more normal leg with a bend in the bone that is traversed by a ""bone bridge"". Rotational abnormalities in the Minnesota frogs were very common. These rotational abnormalities involved the limb proximal to the hock causing the flexed hock to have either a dorsal or ventral orientation rather than pointing in the more normal medial direction. Although there were no Vermont frogs with rotation as its primarily malformation rotations did occur in relation w ith other m alform ations an d did res emb le som e of the M inneso ta rotations . Rotations were most likely to occur in frogs with ectrodactyly or brachydactyly (missing or shortened digits) suggesting that errors in the bone formation was occurring proximal to the affected d igits (4 frogs). L imb r otation also occur red in tw o frogs with fem oral hem imelia of the opp osite limb and in the sa me lim b as tibiafibula r hem imelia in a nother frog.

INTERPRETATION OF DATA Although the number of frogs submitted from each site was low, it seems important to look at the data to see if there was an association between malformation type and body condition. The potential impact a particular abnormalities migh t have on frog suc cess, as re presen ted by ge neral bo dy con dition or n utritional statu s, migh t also be acc essible through data analysis. Data from the field studies will be needed to determine if the malformations submitted from each site for this study were truly representative of the population in both malformation type and frequency of malfo rma tions pre sent. Although data should be corrected for population variation due to site variables as well as for weight bias secondary to absence of body parts in particular abnormalities, I feel looking at the frog morphology data, as in this scatter diagram, could provide insight into the association between the type of abnormality in the frog and body condition of those frogs, represented by the frog's weight in relation to length. The average body condition for all of the types of m alform ations w as poo r to em aciated w ith the exce ption of fro gs with amelia that were all very emaciated. B. MO RP HO LO GIC FIN DIN GS IN F RO GS FRO M EA CH STU DY SITE : Malformations from Vermont were 93% reduction malformations (amelia, hemimelia or ectrodactyly). Only 3 frogs submitted with malformations evaluated had an abnormality that did not involve truncation of a limb. Of the 61 malformations, (4 were bilateral) 10% had no limb on one side, 40% involved abrupt termination of either the femur, tibiafibula or tibiale and fibu lare and 43% had loss o r trunca tion of the dig its.  13   Fro gs from Miss isquoi ha d the m ost com plete limb develo pm ent with truncatio ns involv ing the low er limb distal to the femur. Frogs from Poultney River and Alburg Dune (although fewer number of total frogs were submitted from Alburg Dune) had the most severe truncations with the primary abnormalities involving apparent lack of any initiation of lim b (am elia) or trun cation of the limb at the fe mu r (fem oral hem imelia). A verag e body condition in frogs from all of the study sites was poor to emaciated. Frogs with no apparent malformations (controls) collected at the study sites also we re in poo r to fair bod y cond ition but the sa mp le size wa s too sm all to mak e an extr apolation to the overall population of leopard frogs at these sites. Lapans Bay had rear limb malformations primarily involving the tibiafibula a nd the foo t. This ch art of association of severity of malformation with site of collection might suggest errors occurring either at different developmental stages in frog development, or different dose or duration of exposure to a teratogen. 1.

Even though the frogs from Missisquoi had less severe malformations than some of the other sites, they were still in poor body condition. 14897-002 had a forelimb malformation. C. DETERMINATION OF BODY CONDITION Gen eral bod y cond ition assessm ent (goo d, fair, poo r, em aciated) p erform ed at nec ropsy seem ed to m ost accu rately reflect the nutritional status of malformed frogs. This subjective assessment at necropsy was independent of the affect that the ab norm ality or frog size mig ht have had on weigh t. Wh en m ajor bo dy par ts of the frog were all present, body weight to body length ratios reflect nutrition status of frogs more accurately than body weight alone or snout to v ent length alone as a lar ge frog (length) m ay be em aciated an d have the sam e weig ht as a sm aller frog with good bod y fat stores. For this study, it was assum ed that sex was not a factor in the body cond ition or size of these immature, recently metamorphosed frogs. Frogs necropsied very close to the time of tail bud resorption (metamorphosis just completed) may still have fat reserves stored during the tadpole stage. These frogs would not have experienced the survival pressures placed on a frog that had been required to actively capture food for a longer period of time and the fat stores in these recently metamorphosed frogs could be misleading if used as an indicator of succes s as a frog.  17   D. HISTOPATHOLOGY FINDINGS Histopathology was performed on 19 frogs (Appendix F). Histopathology on malformed bones showed two general types of bone changes. One of the characteristics of bone at the termination of the malformed limb was very disorganized and hyperplastic cartilage that was not ossifying normally and interfered with the formation of bone cortex. The second type of bone change at the point of termination was the formation of small nests of endosteal type cartilage matrix with some organization but no obvious maturation or ossification. None of the malformed limbs had inflammation and they often had very poor skeletal muscle development. Traumatic amputations did have micr oscop ic eviden ce of skele tal mus cle necr osis and inflamm ation. N o cons istent mic rosco pic chan ges w ere seen in internal organs (heart, lung, liver, stomach, intestine, pancreas, kidney, bladder, gonad, spleen, thyroid gland, thymus, lymphoid aggregates) that could be related to malformations. The brain and spinal cord of the frogs submitted often had dilated ventricles and we are in the process of consulting with a neuropathologist to determine the significance of this finding. E. RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS Radiographs were extremely helpful in determining the degree of malformation in the limbs as well as the type of termination in both long bones and digits.(Appendix D) Malformations of the hip were also seen in some of the Vermont frogs and these would not have been detected without the use of high detail radiography. Radiographs were also helpful in differentiating trauma from m alformation, although necropsy observations and histopathology were also im portan t in ruling ou t traum a. F. RESULTS OF MICROBIOLOGICAL TESTING Lab tests were performed on the frogs sent into our lab so that information involving infectious agents could be looked at in relation to malformation types. 1. Parasitology In an attempt and made an compared to hem imelia o r to look for significance of metacercariae in the frogs, parasitology examined the frogs, cleared them estimate of metacercarial load. Metacercarial load in frogs from Vermont were relatively heavy, Minnesota frogs; the primary malformations in all Vermont sites were reduction defects such as trunca tion of a lim b wh ich has no t been disc ussed a s a direct seq uelae of m etacerc arial infection .  Parasitologic examination was performed on 14 frogs; with at least 1 normal frog from each site following procedure s outlined in the Study Plan (App endix C). Skin, subcu taneous tissue, coelom, oral cavity, esophagu s, intestinal serosa, kidney, urinary bladder, fat body, heart/pericardium, and skeletal muscle from the rear leg, back, abdomen, tail bud area were examined for metacercaria. Metacercariae were most consistently seen in the kidney, how ever this m etacerc aria w as mo rpho logically d istinct (mo st likely Ec hinosto mata e) from the me tacerca ria seen in other locations. Skin, tail bud, liver, tissue adjacent to eyes, epaxial muscles were also common sites where meta cercar iae (mo st likely D iplostom atidae) w ere fou nd. Th e me tacerca riae table in Appendix H is organized by malformation and, although statistical analysis was not meaningful due to the small numbers, an association between metacercariae and malformation was not obvious. Metacercariae were present in both normal and malform ed frogs. Appendix H also contains a table for the adult helminths that were found in these frogs but these are listed for interest and are thought to be incidental findings as there was no pathology associated with these parasites.  18   The hip regio n of a clear ed frog pictured above show s three m etacerc ariae. 2. Bacteriology: Cultures of liver and kidney from 30 abnormal frogs and 15 normal frogs (45 frogs) were conducted following the protocol outlined in the study plan (Appen dix C). 29 different bacteria were isolated and identified from these frog s; most of them were in the group Enterobacteriaceae and are not usually considered to be primary pathogens. One important excep tion to this was Aero mon as hyd rophila which was most comm only isolated from frogs collected at Lap ans B ay. Aero mon as hyd rophila is a know n patho gen of am phibian s and re ptiles. No ne of the fro gs with Aero mon as hyd rophila isolated had evidence of trauma. The most common isolates from all sites were Alcaligenes xylosidans and Pseu dom onas c epacia and these bacteria were also isolated from norm al control frogs. No isolates could b e related to malfo rma tions.  3. Virology Attempts to isolate virus from livers, kidneys, hearts and occasionally skin sampled from 32 abnormal frogs and 19 normal frogs (51 frogs) followed the protocol for virus isolation outlined in the study plan. No viruses were isolated or identified in negatively stained preparations for electron microscopic in any of the samples from any of the frogs in this study.

Many of these terms, defined in Appendix B, were originally used to describe defects that are present in the mamm alian fetus at birth. Direct application of these terms to frogs that metamorphose in a free-living postembryonic state may or may not prove to be appropriate. However, common terminology may allow recognition of similar conditions by individuals in related specialties involving developmental anomalies across species and bring new interest and collaboration to the issues involving malformed frogs. The terminology in reference to possible points of error in development (mesodermal versus ectodermal) may be simplistic, but allows an initial attempt at looking at the pathogene sis of some of these malform ations. Case num ber : National Wildlife Health Center (NW HC) reference number given to a group of frogs submitted from the same site and usually collected in a similar time frame. Accession number : NW HC reference number given to individual frogs within a case. Body condition (as defined for this report by M eteyer): Bod y cond ition reflects the nutritiona l state of the frog and is determined by the pathologist by subjective assessment of relative quantity of muscle and body fat present in the frog at the time of necropsy. Assessment of body condition is independent of absolute weight or snout to vent length. Body condition has been scored in the following w ay so that averages can be m ade for com parison betwee n sites and abnorm alities; good = 4, fair= 3, poor = 2, em aciated= 1. Good body condition: Ad equate skeletal muscle and abu ndant fat in the fat bodies. Fair body co ndition: Adequate skeletal mu scle with reduced fat in the fat bodies. Poor bod y condition: Adequ ate skeletal muscle with scant or no body fat in the fat bodies. Em aciated body condition: Ske letal muscle wasting and no b ody fat in the fat bodies. W eight to length ratio (as defined for this report by Meteyer): The weight (gm) of the frog divided by the length (cm) of the snout to vent length of the frog which provides an approxim ation of nutritional status or body con dition as a numerical index value which correlates with body condition as assessed at necropsy. M orph ogen esis : Developmental process which gives rise to highly organized and specialized tissues through cell division and proliferation, cell migration, cell differentiation, and programmed cell death. Path ogen esis : Cellular events, reactions and other pathologic m echanisms oc curring in the developm ent of disease M esoderm : The embryonic layer from which connective tissue, bone, cartilage, muscle, blood, vasculature, notochord, pleura, pericardium, peritoneum, kidney, and gonads are derived. Ectoderm : The embryonic layer from which epidermal tissues (skin, hair, etc.), mucous membranes, nervous tissue, and extern al sense or gans (ey e, ear, etc.) ar e derive d. Malformations: Primary errors in any phase of morphogenesis including cell proliferation, cell migration, differen tiation, pro gram med cell death or regres sion of larv al structur es. Deformations: Deformations arise later in fetal life and represent alterations in form or structure resulting from mec hanica l factors. The re is no intrin sic defect in m orph ogen esis. M alformation sequence : cascade of events leading to malformation (IE urethral obstruction may cause secondary affect of rena l mor phog enesis an d ma y lead to de fects in the low er limb s due to co mp ression of blood vessels).  20   Appendix A: Definitions Continued . Malformation syndrome : single etiologic agent that simultaneously affects several tissues (IE viruses) RCK. Tera togen esis : Abnormal development that gives rise to malformations Teratogen : An agent or factor that causes the production of physical defects in the developing organism (embryo) Hy pop lasia : Incomplete development of an organ Aplasia (agen esis): Lack of development of an organ or tissue often resulting from failure of appearance of the primordium of an organ in embryonic development. For example, amelia is aplasia or agenesis of a limb. Ectro me lia : Hypoplasia or aplasia of one or more long bones of limbs. Types of ectromelia are amelia, hemimelia, and phocomelia. Ectro dacty ly : Absence of a digit (toe or finger) Brachydactyly: Absence o f phalanx (a bone that com prise the digits) Am elia : No obvious limb development Hem imelia : Developmental anomaly characterized by absence of all or part of the distal half of a limb; fibular hemimelia, tibial hem imelia Pho com elia : Absence of the proximal portion of a limb, IE feet attached to the body by a single small irregularly shaped bone Polym elia : A developm ental anomaly cha racterized by the presence of sup ernum erary limbs. Sym pod ia : Fusion of lower extremities Skin W eb (as defined for this report by M eteyer): The skin covering the leg traverses at least one joint restricting motion. Dorsal/ventral pigmentation maintained. Malformation or deformation of bone is often associated with restricted limb d evelop men t and is seen as rotation of the invo lved bo ne or join t, foresho rtening of the bon e, or fusion of joint. Rotation (as defined for this report by M eteyer): Deviation of bone or joint causing distal limb to have abnormal orientatio n.  21   APPENDIX B: INVESTIGATION OF DEFORMITIES IN THE NORTHERN LEOPARD FROG (RANA PIPIENS) AT SELECTED SITES IN VERMONT  Background and Justification In the fall of 1996, abnormalities in northern leopard frogs ( Rana pipiens) were observed by the public at 12 sites adjacent to Lake Champlain in Vermont. Incidences of abnormal leopard frogs were verified at four of these sites by staff of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources (VTANR ) on October 9, 1996. The incidence of deformities averaged 16.5 %, ranging from 5-23 % at the four sites (230 frogs observed). Several of the sites where deformities were observed were near the borders of the Missisquoi National Wildlife Refuge in Swanton, Vermont. Most of the abnormalities observed were missing legs or feet, but also included eye abnormalities. Similar observations have been made in at least seven states and two C anadia n prov inces. T he m ost exten sive w ork to da te has bee n cond ucted in M inneso ta and in the St. Lawrence Valley of Quebec. The mechanism(s) by which these deformities are occurring have not been identified, however, the predominant theories include: UV-B radiation; xenobiotic contaminants; and viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic diseases. The purpose of this investigation is to take the first steps in examining the abnormalities in the Vermont frogs. Specifically, this investigation will examine affected frogs from four sites in Vermont, catalogue the external and internal abnormalities, and compare to frogs of an unaffected site in Vermont, as well as abnormal frogs collected from M inneso ta in 1995 and 19 96. Se lect sam ples w ill be exam ined for virolog y, bacter iology, an d para sitology. T he ove rall information should verify whether the frogs in Vermont have developmental abnormalities, whether the abnormalities observed in Vermont are the same as those observed in Minnesota, and to begin to determine whether viruses, bacteria, and/or parasites could be respo nsible for the abnorm alities. Purpo se The purposes of this investigation are several fold: (1) to determine whether the abnormalities observed in northern leopard frogs in Vermont are developmental in nature; (2) to compare abnormal frogs to normal-appearing frogs collected from an expe cted con trol site to verify that there ar e differen ces; (3) to com pare ab norm alities found in Ver mo nt to abnormalities found in Minnesota to determine if they are the same phenomenon; and (4) to determine if a subsample of frogs h arbor viruses, b acteria, or parasites w hich co uld be re spons ible for the ab norm alities obser ved in V erm ont.

The majority of deformities have involved multiple, fused, or missing hind limbs, however, some recently reported developmental deformities have also included vestigial tails, missing, misplaced or sup ernum erary eyes and ossification abnorm alities (R. Brann ian, National W ildlife Health Center, pers. com m., 19 97; J. H elgen, M inneso ta Pollution Con trol Ag ency, p ers. com m., 19 97). The causes of the rise in amphibian deformities remain unclear, however, a number of hypotheses are presently being researched including: xenobiotic chemicals, parasites, and UV-B light. Some researchers have indicated that classifying the types of abnorm alities on a site will be helpful in isolating the causal agent or agents (C. M eteyer, NW HC , pers. com m., 19 97). In 1997, 19 sites in the Lake Champlain Basin in Vermont were surveyed for frog deformities. Rates greater than three percent were observed at 17 of the sites. Rates overall ranged from 0-45% and averaged approximately 8% (R. Levey, State of Vermont, pers. comm., 1997). A BRD Quick Initiative Grant of $8000 awarded to this project allowed the National Wildlife Health Center to conduct a workup of the abnormal frogs collected in Vermont. The workup included classification of abno rma lities, histopatho logy, ne crops y, virolo gy, bac teriology , and par asitology . The re sults of this wor k sugg ested that the re wa s no cor relation b etwee n viruse s, bacteria , or para sites and the frog abn orm alities obser ved in Vermont (C. M eteyer, NWH C, pers. comm., 1997). What the work did not include, due to insufficient funds, was skeletal analysis through radiology. This additional work should clarify whether the abnormalities observed are deform ities, caused by traum a or disea se, or m alform ations, cau sed by a disfunctio n in deve lopm ent. Th e wo rk sho uld also serve to diagnose any skeletal abnormalities not externally observable. Objective : To determine through radiology of frogs collected in Vermont in 1997 whether the abnormalities observed are developmental in nature or trauma induced, as well as to diagnose skeletal abnormalities not externally observable. Exp ected P rodu cts : A written report of the project findings will be prepared. The work will be presented at professional meetings and will be incorporated into peer-reviewed literature.

Background and Justification: In the fall of 1996, deformities in northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) were observed by the public at 12 sites adjacent to Lake Champlain in Vermont. Several sites were near the border of the Missisquoi NWR in Swanton, Vermont. The presence of deformed leopard frogs were verified at four of these sites by staff of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources (VTDEC) on October 9, 1996. The prevalence of deformities averaged 16.5 %, ranging from 5-23 % at the four sites (230 frogs observed). Most of the frogs observed had missing legs or feet and some had eye abnormalities. Similar observations have been made in at least seven states and two Canadian provinces. The most extensive surveys and identification of deformities in frogs and environmental sampling to date has been conduced in Minnesota and the St. Lawrence Valley of Quebec. The mechanism(s) by which these deformities are occurring has not been identified; however, the popular theories include: UV-B radiation; xenobiotic contaminants; and viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic diseases. The purpose of this investigation is to take a first step by completing a clinical examination of deformed frogs collected from four sites in Vermont to complete the following objectives: Objectives: 1. 2. 3. 4. Characterize and catalog the external and internal deformities in leopard frogs in Vermont; Compare deformed frogs to normal-appearing frogs from an expected control site; Compare morphometric descriptions of abnormalities in Vermont leopard frogs to abnormalities confirmed in Minnesota frogs to determine whether any similarities exist; and Determine the presence or absence of viruses, bacteria, or parasites in deformed frogs. frogs breed are identified in the recent Vermont reptile and on 12 of these sites; VTDEC staff confirmed the frog deformities be collected from each of the 40 sites.

Fifteen abnormal-appearing frogs will be collected frogs will be collected from a control site where no deformities  Methods and approach: Forty site where northern leopard amphibian atlas (Andrews, 1995). ). In 1996, deformed frogs were observed by the public on four of these sites in 1996. A least 100 frogs will 10% of the frogs appearing abnormal will be selected for from each of these four sites and five normal-appearing were present in a sample of at least 50 frogs.  Recently metamorphosed frogs will be collected and examined for the presence and type of deformities. Frogs with deformities will be placed in 11 x 32 cm plastic boxes with lids containing 1 air-hole/inch in a chilled cooler or shady location. Approximately 3 cm of water from the site will be placed in the boxes along with sphagnum moss. At the completion of frog collection, the plastic boxes will be placed in hard-sided coolers, surrounded on four sides with frozen blue ice containers. The boxes will be held in place by a washable metal frame. Eight frogs will be placed live in each container and shipped via overnight service to the National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC). Upon arrival, frogs will be examined to deter ermine how the frog responds to this abnormality, photographed, the deformities will be characterized and cataloged using nomenclature and morphologic diagrams developed at NWHC based on frogs submitted to NWHC, photographs by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA, Helgen), and a Quebec study (Ouellet, 1997). Routine histopathological and microbiological samples will be collected and processed on a subset of tissues. Catalogued data will be used to compare abnormalities in Vermont frogs to those recorded during 1995 and 1996 Minnesota frogs. Tissue samples or whole frogs will be archived for later use if funding becomes available or a potential agent causing the deformities is identified. Characterization of abnormalities and Necropsy Examination 1. Describe clinical condition/function or movement of any deformed limbs, multiple limbs or other grossly apparent deformities.. 2. 3. Photograph abnormalities before the frog is anesthetized or euthanized if possible. Euthanize one frog at a time using inhalation of Halothane (see NWHC SOP).  4. Necropsy will be performed with the use of a dissecting scope and 2X head loop. Frogs are opened with an ventral midline incision. The heart is collected and a blood smear made. Tissues for virology will be placed in viral transport media, tissues for bacteriology in vials of broth and tissue for histopathology in formalin. Very small tissues will be places in embedding bags in formalin.  27   5. Necropsy set-up and lab distribution of frogs is as follows: Sites 1-4 Case #'s 14895 - 14898 Accessions 001-005, Pathology: 2 blood smears Multiple tissues in formalin and embedding bag Tissues for bacteriology, virology Accessions 006-007, Parasitology: Description of gross pathology Submit whole carcasses in whirl-paks, in saline Accessions 008-010, Virology: Description of gross pathology Blood smear Submit tissues in viral transport media Carcass saved in formalin jar - Hold Accessions 011-013, Bacteriology: Description of gross pathology Blood smear Submit tissues bact broth vial Carcass saved in formalin jar - Hold Accessions 014-015, Hold Frozen: Description of gross pathology Freeze back in whirl-paks Normals, Case # 14899 Accession 001: Pathology (necropsy as above) Accessions 002-003: Virology (necropsy as above) Accessions 004-005: Bacteriology (necropsy as above) Virology 1. Virus isolation will be attempted in amphibian and fish cell culture. Liver, spleen, kidney, gut and heart were pooled by like tissues (liver with livers, spleen with spleens) with a maximum of three frogs per pool. 2. Viral isolates will be identified and characterized.  3. Electron microscopy will be performed on the pooled tissues in an attempt to detect any viruses that cannot be isolated in cell culture. Bacteriology Frog tissues consisting primarily of liver, heart, kidney and others will be placed directly into appropriately labeled tubes of tryptic soy broth (TSB) at necropsy and submitted to diagnostic bacteriology. The following procedure will be followed: 1. The 10 ml tubes of TSB with tissue will be vortexes for 5-10 seconds and subcultured immediately onto blood agar (BAP), eosine-methylene blue agar (EMB), (or MacConkey agar), Lowenstein-Jensen agar (LJ), sabouraud-dextrose agar (SAB), thioglycollate broth (THIO), and cooked-meat broth (CM). 2. Media (except LJ and SAB) will be examined at 18-24 hour intervals for up to 72 hours before being discarded as negative. Positive cultures will be subcultured and identified to at least genus level. TSB will be subcultured after 24 hours if growth appears. LJ and SAB will be held as appropriate until sufficient growth develops or there is no growth. 3. Identification of bacterial isolates will be consistent with current capabilities and will include the use of commercial identification systems; predominately the API system, bioMerieux Vitex, St. Louis, Missouri. Reference laboratories, primarily the National Veterinary Services Laboratory, Ames, Iowa will be used as needed. Parasitology To determine the presence and species of parasites or evidence of parasite infections, live or freshly euthanized frogs will be sent to the parasitology laboratory for examination under a dissection scope. The following procedures will be followed: 1. Frogs will be skinned and the muscles and fascia examined under the dissecting microscope. will be teased apart and examined for metacercaria. Hind limb muscles  2. Metacercaria in the subdermal layers will be dissected free and placed temporarily in  strength Locke's solution and refrigerated. In some cases, this will cause the metacercaria to encyst so that fixation and staining can proceed. Notes will be kept and vial labeled as to collection site for the metacercaria. 3. A ventral incision will be made from vent to lower mandible to expose internal organs.  28   4.  The heart will be removed and a blood smear made according to DPL SOP.  5. All organs will be examined grossly, any parasites removed, prepped for fixation and fixed in AFA or 70% depending on the class of parasite. Most organs are small enough to examine via a squash preparation. Fat bodies will be examined via squash preparation for mesocercariae. 6. The body cavity will be examined for immature helminths. If found they will be removed, relaxed and fixed.  7. Eviscerated carcasses will be placed in 10% buffered formalin and later cleared according to Hanken ans Wassersug (1981). Following clearing frogs will be examined and the presence or absence of metacercaria noted. Critical Data: 1. Specific characterization of external deformities, 2. Documentation of internal deformities, 3. Histopathological findings for Minnesota frogs for comparison with Vermont frogs. Statistical Treatment: The research sites will be selected from areas with at least 15% of the frogs affected in a sample of 100 frogs. No specific statistical methods will be applied the data from this study. Routine statistical methods may be applied to determine the frequencies of certain lesions and establish similarities between sites. Assessment Criteria: Frogs will be examined for external and internal morphological and histological lesions and these lesions characterized and cataloged. The lesions present in Vermont frogs in this study will compared to lesions in Minnesota frogs described by NWHC in 1996.

CURDIE, at Little Rock, Pulaski County, Arkansas. The claimant was represented by Gary Davis, Attorney at Law, Little Rock, Arkansas. The respondent was represented by Frank B. Newell, Attorney at Law, Little Rock, Arkansas.  STATEMENT OF THE CASE The hearing w as he ld on Au gust 20 , 2003, in Little Roc k, Arka nsas . It was stipulated as follows: 1. The employee-employer-carrier relationship existed at all relevant times. 2. The temporary total disability rate is $195.00 and the permanent partial disability rate is $154.00. 3. The claimant sustained a compensable left lower extremity (left knee) injury on June 10, 2001. The issues to be litigated at the hearing were as follows: 1. Is claim an t en titled to m ed ical b en efits and cos ts a ss oc iate d w ith his  1   left knee replacement? (Claimant alleges that the compensable injury of June 10, 2001, aggravated, accelerated or combined with his pre-existing left knee condition to produce the nec essity for the su rgery.) 2. Is the claimant entitled to temporary total disability from August 1, 2001, to a date to be determined? (Respondent alleges that the healing period ended on Aug ust 1, 200 1). 3. Is claimant entitled to an attorney's fee? The claimant, 33 years of age, testified that in 1985 he was involved in a non-work related motor cycle wreck at age 14. He testified about the wreck and the injuries he received: ""A. Yes, my femur was broke and several of my phalanges, which are your toes, we re com poun d fracture d, and I ha d a rope m ark on m y knee wh ere when it scraped across the ground, it rubbed a hole in the top of my knee, and they had wound up having to do an amputation of my toes, threequarters of my foot, and from some deal up in there around the tibia and fibula they put a screw in the back side of my knee. I don't exactly know wha t it was for. The knee cap itself wasn't broke or any ligaments wasn't damaged, and they had a p in in my fem ur. Q. Part of the extent of that surgery, you had the broken fem ur up above your knee? A. Uh-h uh (affirm ative). Q. Th ey had to su rgically break your tibia and your fibula in orde r to accomplish a leg lengthening, I believe? A. Tha t's correct. Q. And it was a pretty extensive process that you had to go through up through 1989, res ulting in pretty muc h the am putation of your foot, correc t? A. Tha t's correct.""  2   (T-9, 10) The claimant testified that he did not have any knee surgery as a result of that 198 5 acc ident. In Febru ary, 1992, the c laima nt injured his kn ee wh ile working at A uto Zone, Inc. As a result of that accident, he had a posterior cruciate ligament replacement. He testified that from October 13, 1992, to June 10, 2001, he did not req uire any tre atm en t for his k ne e. H e did tes tify tha t on one occ as ion h e ha d to quit one job h e had d ue to his kn ee hurting, b ecau se of the need f or lifting heavy objects. Additionally, the claimant testified that he had some jobs from October, 1992 until the com pens able Jun e 10, 20 01, injury that required him to do exten sive ben ding and lifting. He worked for the Humane Society as a kennel master and animal abuse officer. He was required to be on his feet, bend and stoop on a regular basis. He worked as a pest control employee. He was a termite inspector, a job which required him to crawl and bend under houses to inspect for pest damage. He worked in a liquor store, stocking the cooler and liquor shelves. He worked for Rock Church International as a business maintenance employee. He was required to paint, re-do and buff floors. The claimant then began w orking for the respondent/em ployer, a job which required extensive physical labor. His job, basically, was to clean hospital rooms. He performed that job without any trouble for one month before his injury on June 10, 2001. He had to clean many rooms a day. This job required him to make beds, dust, mop, sweep and clean comm odes. The claimant testified that the only real problems he had prior to the 2001 injury were arthritic problem s that we re aggra vated w hen the weath er wou ld chang e.  3   Th e c laim an t de sc ribe d h is J un e 1 0, 2 00 1, c om pe ns ab le in jury: ""Q. Now Gene, here we are now, June 10th of 2001. Tell us what happened on that date. A. I was coming from the break room in the basement, I was running real late so I was walking pretty fast, and when I came around the corner in the ba se m en t, the re's like a dec line g oing dow n to the elev ato rs. A nd I still don't know if it was water or oil or whatever it was, but there was something in the floor, and I slipped and fell right down on my knee. Q. And you experienced pain? A. Yes, s ir. Q. Can you be descriptive about what sort of symptoms? A. At first it was a real sharp stabbing pain and throbbing, so I hopped back to my supervisor's office, which was around the corner. I was going to put some ice on it and go home, but she told me to go around to the ER."" (T-15, 16) The claim ant's knee becam e swollen, painful and required extensive medical treatment. He had physical therapy and was prescribed medication, neither of which helped the claimant a great deal. He was told he was going to need a total knee replacem ent. The claimant had the total knee replacement on November 30, 2001. He underwent therapy, and was prescribed medication. He wanted to get a job, but testified tha t be ca us e of the m ove m en ts re qu ired to pe rfo rm any jo bs he w as cap ab le of , he d id not believe he could perform the jobs. The claimant did not believe that he could bend or stand, squat with his knees, nor could he run, skip, or jump. (T-23) Th e cla im an t be ga n st ud ying f or h is A ss oc iate in Ar ts (A A) d eg ree in accounting in March, 2002. In December, 2002, he obtained his AA degree. About that  4   tim e th e cla im an t be ga n re ce iving soc ial se cu rity disa bility. He tes tified tha t he wo uld like to get off of social security disability so that he can work. He has applied for some jobs based on his AA degree in accounting. The claimant complains of current left knee problems. At the hearing, he demonstrated how the left knee was clicking and somewhat off center. According to the claimant, his condition is not ""fixable"". He testified that he was told by Dr. Carl Nelson that he w ould have to ""live with it"". The medical records in this case reflect that the claimant came under the ca re o f Dr . Jo hn Va nd er S ch ilden , an orth op ae dic s urg eo n an d pr ofe ss or o f ort ho pa ed ic surgery at the U niversity of Arkan sas fo r Medica l Science s at Little Rock , Arkans as. Dr. Vander Schilden took extensive x-rays of claimant's left knee. He stated that the claimant had ""previous end stage degenerative arthritis"" and a ""strong possibility of patella fracture."" Dr. Vander Schilden's note of July 17, stated that the claimant's June 10, 200 1, com pens able injury cause d no ""increa sed m orbidity to the knee w hatso ever."" According to Dr. Vander Schilden, the claimant reached maximum m edical improvement on August 1, 2001. He referred the claimant to Dr. Carl Nelson, an orthopaedic surgeon and professor at UAMS. On August 20, 2001, Dr. Nelson stated that the claimant suffered from advanced degenerative arthritis of the knee, and would need total knee replacement sometime in the future. The claimant had a total knee replacement in November, 2001. On December 21, 2001, Dr. Vander Schilden sent a letter to the claimant's attorney stating: ""Mr. Dickerson's injury of 6/10/2001 did aggravate and accelerate the  5   nee d for th e kn ee re plac em ent s urge ry. I cannot provide him a permanent impairment rating secondary to the injury. H is un de rlying d eg en era tive a rthritis wa s so sev ere tha t the fall d id not cau se an y further dege neration tha t was no t already presen t prior to the injury."" (Cx-1, p. 19)(E m phas is added .) Dr. Carl Ne lson, wh o perform ed claim ant's total kne e replace m ent, sen t a letter to the attorney for respondent on August 5, 2003. The letter stated: ""I did not evaluate Mr. Dickerson to determine if his knee injury was associated with his subsequent surgery and I therefore have no opinion or no knowledge that I can impart to you in this area. ... ... I have no idea whether this surgery was necessitated by the advanced degenerative condition of his knee resulting from previous accidental injury."" (Rx-1, p. 1) Dr. Vander Schilden gave a deposition in this case on May 19, 2003. He stated that his opinions were within a reasonable degree of medical certainty. He is a professor of orthopaedic surgery at UAMS, and has been there for 18 years. Dr. Vander Schilden testified that when he saw the claimant on June 12, 2001, the claimant had ""en d st ag e de ge ne rative arth ritis."" H e te stifie d w ha t the def inition of e nd sta ge arth ritis was: ""There are three compartments in the knee, the inside of the knee, the outside of the knee, and around the kneecap, and all three compartment had ex trem ely severe degen erative arth ritis."" (Rx-3, p. 6)(Em phas is added .) X-rays taken by Dr. Vander Schilden showed ""strong possibility of a patellar fracture ."" ""Q. Okay. Ikay. W as it obvious the first time you saw him on June 12 that he wa s hea ding for a tota l knee rep lacem ent?  6   A. Yes. Q. Okay. And then I - - I think you saw him again on July 17? A. Tha t's correct. Q. An d at tha t tim e you obs erve d th at - - I'm rea ding from your re po rt, his presen t injury caused no increase d m orbidity to the knee w hatso ever. Is that still your opinion? A. Yes. Q . O ka y. A. It did not - - the arthritis was there. You're not going to make the arthritis any worse. Did it hasten his chances of having a knee replacement? Yes, because it's like throwing gasoline on a sm oulder ing fire."" (Rx-3, p. 7, 8)(Em phas is added .) Dr. Vander Schilden stated that as of July 17, the fracture line that he could se e in the x-ray in June h ad disap peared . Dr. Vander Schilden testified as follows: ""Q. And once a fracture like that heals, does it typically cause residual symptoms? A. The fracture itself did not. The trauma to the knee, as I mentioned, was like throwing gasoline on a smouldering fire. I mean the arthritis was there, but the traum a to the kn ee cau sed an exace rbation o f his symp tom s w hich un doub tedly led to his kn ee rep lacem ent sooner rather than later. Q. Did the injury - - whatever injury - - well, let me back up. You un de rsta nd m y clien t do es n't dis pu te th e fa ct th at h e fe ll and tha t he hit his knee and that he was hiving pain. A. He would have required a knee replacement anyway in the future. Q . O ka y. A. The fall made - - required him to have the knee replacement  7   soon er rathe r than later. Can I give you an exact time? No. Q. All right. W ell, I was going to ask you that question. Is your opinion tha t his Jun e - - th is ac cide nt h ap pe ne d on Jun e 10 - - tha t his Jun e 10 fall in which h e hit his knee acce lerated the k nee fo r knee rep lacem ent surg ery som ewh at spec ulative since o bviously we ca n neve r know wheth er or not - when he would have needed a knee replacement surgery had he not fallen? A. Ex ac tly. Q . O ka y. A. But I believe it did hasten the requirement for a knee replacement because of the intractable pain that he was having. Q. That was my next question. W hy did he - - why do you believe he had the knee placement when he did? A. Because of pain. Q. Because of pain? A. I mean you don't replace a knee, no matter how bad the x-rays look, unless the patient is extremely symptomatic. Q. W hat caused the pain? A. The trauma to the knee. So it's not the small fracture that he had on his p ate lla. It's the trau m a th at ind uc ed the frac ture tha t ca us ed his unde rlying deg enerative a rthritis to flare up."" (Rx-3, P. 10, 11, 12) ..... Q. Do cto r, the term acc eler ate is ap pro pria te a s a d es crip tion of h ow this trauma played into the necessity of ultimately having to have this knee replacement surgery which was done on November the 30th of 2001, true? A. That's true. Q. And you of course mentioned the term throwing gasoline on a smouldering fire. Another term that might be appropriate, the straw that broke the camel's back? A. Tha t is correct.""  8   (Rx-3, p. 16)(E m phas is added .) FI ND IN G S O F F ACT AND CO NC LU SI O NS O F L AW 1. The employee-employer-carrier relationship existed at all relevant times. 2. The temporary total disability rate is $195.00 and the permanent partial disability rate is $154.00. 3. The claimant sustained a compensable left lower extremity (left knee) injury on June 10, 2001. 4. The preponderance of the evidence reflects that the claimant is entitled to medical treatment and costs associated with his total knee replacement. The compensable injury of June 20, 2001 accelerated and combined with claimant's preexisting condition to produce the need for medical treatment. The treatment was rea so na bly n ec es sa ry an d re late d to the co m pe ns ab le in jury. 5. Th e pr ep on de ran ce of th e ev iden ce refle cts tha t the claim an t is entitled to tem porary total disability from Au gust 1, 20 01 to Ja nuary 21, 20 02. 6. Th e pr ep on de ran ce of th e ev iden ce refle cts tha t the claim an t is entitled to an attorney's fee for his attorney Mr. Gary Davis for controversion. DISCUSSION 1. MEDICAL TREATMENT A pre-existing disease or infirmity does not disqualify a claim if the em ployme nt aggra vated, ac celerated or com bined w ith the diseas e or infirm ity to produc e the disa bility for which com pens ation is sou ght. See: Nashville Livestock  9   Comm ission v. Cox , 302 Ark . 69, 787 S .W .2d 664 (1990); St. Vincent Medical Center v. Brown, 53 Ark. App. 30, 917 S.W .2d 550 (1996). As is comm only stated, the employer takes the em ployee as he finds him . In such c ases , the test is not w hether the injury causes the condition, but rather the test is whether the injury aggravates, accelerates, or combines with the condition. However, although a disabling symptom of a pre-existing condition may be compensable if it is brought on by an accident arising out of and in the co urs e of em ploym en t, the em ploye e's e ntitle m en t to c om pe ns atio n en ds wh en his cond ition is restored to the cond ition that existed be fore the injury, unless the injury contributes to the condition by accelerating or combining with the pre-existing condition. The present case turns on an issue of medical causation, and Dr. Vander Sch ilden is the only physician to ha ve rende red an e xpert m edical opinion in this case. As I interpret Dr. Vander Schilden's deposition testimony and reports, Dr. Vander Schilden has concluded that the claimant's work related injury accelerated his left knee condition at issue in this case, causing a need for knee replacement surgery to the left knee. The record is clear that Dr. Vander Schilden's medical opinion regarding ca us atio n ar e ba se d pr im arily on his e xam inat ions and x-rays , ob ject ive d iagn os tic tes ting and his o wn years of e xpe rien ce as a kne e su rge on and pro fes so r of o rtho pa ed ic surgery. Dr. Vander Schilden's medical opinion appears to be based largely on facts not only related to him by the claim ant, but du e to indepe nden t know ledge up on wh ich Dr. Va nd er S ch ilden has bas ed his m ed ical o pinio ns on c au sa tion . Dr. V an de r Sc hilde n is the only expert medical witness to testify in this case, and Dr. Vander Schilden opined that the claimant's work related left knee injury accelerated his left knee condition  10   ca us ing the ne ed fo r re pla ce m en t su rge ry. I cannot find any medical records introduced into evidence regarding the cla im an t's k ne e p rob lem s f rom Oc tob er, 19 92 un til th e d ate of his co m pe ns ab le in jury, June 10, 2001. The claimant apparently had numerous physically stressful jobs from October, 1992 through June 10, 2001. The claimant testified that he did not have the need to go to the doctor for his knee during that period of time, but did certainly have knee pain. However, after his admittedly compensable injury on June 10, 2001, the claimant has demonstrably objective medical findings of an injury which resulted in a recommendation from the chairman of hip and knee reconstruction at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at UAMS in Little Rock, Arkansas that he have a total knee replacement. No one recommended knee replacement for the claimant BEFORE the compensable injury. And, if he needed knee replacement, the preponderance of the evidence certainly reflects that the compensable injury ACCELERATED the need. As Dr. Vander Schilden stated, the claimant's injury was ""like throwing gasoline on a sm ou lder ing f ire."" T he pre po nd era nc e of the evid en ce the n re flec ts th at th e cla im an t's work relate d left knee injury aggravated a nd ac celerated claima nt's left knee cond ition to such extent as to require a left knee replacement. The claimant's medical treatment and costs associated with his left knee replacement is reasonably necessary medical treatm ent and related to his Ju ne 10, 2 001, co m pens able injury. See: W ackenhut Corp. v. Jones , 73 Ark. App. 158, 40 S.W .3d 333 (2001) (affirming Full Commission Opinion, Jone s v. W acke nhut C orp ., E9018 48, Ma y 15, 2000). 2. IS CLAIMANT ENTITLED TO TEMPORARY TOTAL DISABILITY BENEFITS FROM AUGUST 1, 2001, TO A DATE TO BE DETERMINED?  11   The claimant sustained a scheduled injury to his left lower extremity. An injured employee is entitled to temporary total disability compensation for a scheduled injury during the period of time that he is within his healing period and has not returned to work. The respondent alleges that claimant's healing period ended on August 1, 2001. (Rx-2, p. 28) Dr. Vander Schilden, in his report of July 17, 2001, indicated that the claimant's fracture had healed ,according to x-rays. Dr. Vander Schilden stated that the present injury caused no increased ""morbidity"" to the knee whatsoever. He opined that the claimant was going to need a total knee replacement ""in the very near future,"" (and ""the future"" was made more imm ediate because of the compensable injury.) He referred the claimant to Dr. Carl Nelson since Dr. Nelson performs total knee replacements and Dr. Vander Schilden does not. According to Dr. Nelson's report of August 20, 2001, the claimant was complaining of left knee pain when he saw him. Dr. Nelson's x-rays on August 20, 2001, showed ""marked joint narrowing, osteophyte formation in the lateral compartment, a cyst and joint narrowing."" (Rx-2, p. 30) Dr. Nelson scheduled the claimant for a total knee replacement in November, 2001. The hearing period is defined as the p eriod nec essa ry for the healing of a n injury resulting from an acc ident. A.C.A .  11-9-102(12) (Repl. 2002) The healing period continues until the injured employee is as far restored as the permanent character of the injury will permit. The healing period ends once the underlying condition has become stable and when nothing further in the way of m edical treatm ent will impro ve the pe rm anen t charac ter of the injury. Mad Butcher, Inc. v. Parker, 4 Ark. Ap p. 124, 62 8 S.W .2d 582 (1982). Subsequent to the total knee replacement in November, 2001, the claimant told his treating medical personnel that Dr. Nelson had ""dismissed him."" (Rx-1, p. 76)  12   Add itionally, it appears tha t the claim ant re-injured his left knee on Jan uary 21, 200 2. Th e n ote at R es po nd en t's E xh ibit 1 , Pa ge 71 sta tes tha t th e c laim an t ""fe ll tod ay"" (Janua ry 21, 2002) on to his left knee . His left knee was ""w arm , painful."" ""Popping/cracking"" were noted. According to the medical records, Dr. Nelson had dismissed the claimant an d to ld him tha t he wo uld h ave to live with som e sw elling and pain . Ad ditio na lly, it would take speculation and conjecture to state that the claimant's healing period lasted past January 21, 2002. This new injury required the claimant to ""heal."" The new nonwo rk re late d fa ll occ urre d sh ortly af ter th e cla im an t's s urg ery. T he ref ore , the claim an t is entitled to temporary total disability from August 1, 2001, until January 21, 2002. Th e cla im an t ha s sh ow n by a pre po nd era nc e of the evid en ce tha t he is entitled to an attorney's fee for controversion of the above-described and discussed benefits. AWARD The claimant is awarded the benefits specifically described herein, along with the attorney's fee for claimant's attorney, Gary Davis, pursuant to the Arkansas W orkers' Co m pens ation law. Th is Awa rd shall bear intere st at the legal rate u ntil paid. IT IS SO ORDERED.  DON N. CURDIE, Administrative Law Judge DC  13"

The citation stated that ""[a] machine guard was not provided to prevent accidental contact with the v belt drive system, exposing the pinch points that are about 5 feet from ground level, located on the left side of the slate trimmer."" Id.; G. Ex. 5. The trimmer was about three to four feet high and three feet wide, and was located in the garage on a stack of pallets about four to five feet high. 23 FMSHRC at 313; Tr. 64-66, 70-71. A wheelbarrow was located on the ground below the t rimmer to catc h chips of slat e from t he machine. T r. 65 , 163 , 167 . Budd test ified that the oper ating st ation o n the t rimmer had a d rive wheel which t urned t he blade t o tr im the slate , and that below the drive wheel was an electrical motor that drove the pulley to operate the machine. 23 FMSHRC at 313; Tr. 67. He also testified that the v-belt drive was not guarded, exposing a miner standing on the platform to operate the trimmer to two pinch points. Tr. 67. According to Bud d, the upp er p inch p oint was loc at ed w her e t he v- belt dr ive c ont act ed t he u ppe r d rive pull ey, which was about three to four feet above the platform, and the lower pinch point was located where the v-belt came in contact with the drive pulley onto that system, which was about one foot above the platform.

(b) Guards shall not be required where the exposed moving parts are at least seven feet away from walking or working surfaces.  30 C.F.R.  56.14107. 440   Camara admitted that the v-belt was not guarded, but testified that the pulley had a guard on the front. Tr. 165, 169. He also testified that a person would not be standing on the platform while the t rimmer was r unning, and that the o nly way a perso n could g et ca ught in t he moving parts was if he was standing on the ground pointing a stick into the belt drive or was nine feet tall. Tr. 164, 166, 168- 69.

Tr. 165, 167. Camara also testified that the exposed moving parts were towards the back on the side of the trimmer, but did not pose a hazard because benches on both sides of the machine prevented access from the platform. Tr. 163-65, 167-68. He also testified that the moving parts did not pose a hazard to someone standing on the ground because it was about eight feet off the ground. Tr. 163-64. The judge found that the exposed moving parts on the trimmer were not properly guarded, posing a hazard to the machine operator standing on the pallet platform. 23 FMSHRC at 314. He dismissed Ca mara's t estimony as ir relevant because it addr essed w hether the exp osed moving parts posed a hazard to a person standing on the ground. Id. The judg e conc luded t hat t he viola tio n was not signific ant and s ubst ant ial, 2 and assessed a penalty of $55. Id. at 313-14, 319. On re view, Ver mont Slat e ass ert s tha t t he evid ence doe s not supp or t a find ing of a violation because Budd testified that the hazard existed to someone standing on top of the pallets next to the machinery, but Tango's notes and the citation indicate that the hazard exists to some one sta nding bene at h th e mac hiner y. PD R at 3. I t c ont ends tha t t he v- belt is ad equ at ely guarded and that ""a worker on top operating the machine would [not] be exposed to any danger."" Id. The Secretary argues that Budd testified that a miner standing on top of the pallets is subject to the hazard and that he had explained this to Camara during the inspection. S. Br. at 13-14. She asserts that the citation states that ""pinch points are about 5 feet from ground level,"" which corr obor ates Budd's test imony that the haz ard wa s to a miner sta nding or wor king on t he platform. Id. The judg e's cha rac te riz at ion o f Cama ra' s t est imon y as ""i rr elev ant "" be cau se it dea lt ""o nly"" with ""someone standing on the ground"" is incorrect. Some of Camara's testimony was an attempt to r efute t he dange r po sed by the pinch point s to a miner sta nding on t he pallets . Spe cifically, the judge did not consider Camara's testimony that the exposed moving parts did not pose a hazard because benches on the side of the trimmer prevented access from the platform.

We t hus h ave h eld t hat a jud ge mu st a nalyze and w eigh a ll probative record evidence, make appropriate findings, and explain the reasons for his or her decision. Mid-Continent Res., Inc. , 16 FMSHRC 1218, 1222 (June 1994). Camara's testimony regarding the hazard to miners on the platform is clearly relevant. Becaus e the jud ge did no t co nsider t his test imony, he err ed by failing to ana lyze and weigh all t he pro bative re cord evidence t o det ermine whet her t he moving par ts po sed a haz ard t o miners o n the plat for m. Our dissenting colleague appears to agree with our conclusion that the judge erred when he dismissed Camara's testimony based on irrelevance. Slip op. at 11. However, our colleague makes t he mistake of evaluat ing Camara's test imony here as ""mud died and inco nsistent "" and sug ges ts tha t r eman ding to the judg e is n ot nec ess ary. 3 Id. It is for the judge in the first instance, not the Commission on review, to evaluate testimony and make findings of fact. See Grizzle v. Pickands Mather & Co., 994 F.2d 1093, 1096 (4th Cir. 1993) (ALJs have ""sole power to make credibility determination and resolve inconsistencies in the evidence"") (citation ommitted). 2. Tango 's Test imony  In conjunction to its challenge to the citations, Vermont Slate argues that the judge erred when he re fused t o allow it to c all Tango to t estify abou t his not es and t he citat ions writ ten o n the date of the inspection. PDR at 1. At the hearing, when Camara cross-examined Budd about Tango's notes, he stated, ""Mr. Baskin [the Secretary's counsel] said on the phone that Mr. T[ a]n go and M r. Bud d wa s [s ic] g oing to be he re, and M r. T[ a]n go is no t he re. No w I w ou ld think that maybe possibly he should be here."" Tr. 114. The judge responded, ""that's up to Mr. Baskin or you, no t -- if he's [ Tango ] not here, he's not here. "" Tr. 114. At ano ther point during the hearing, Camara sta ted, ""I wo uld like Mr. T[a]ngo t o be here during t hese questions. He 's obviously not here."" Tr . 132. The judge responded, ""Well it may be, but the Government chose not to call him."" Tr. 132. Camara then asked the judge, ""Can I call him?"" Tr. 132. The judge replied, ""To get him here, we're going to have to continue the case."" Tr. 132. He explained to 3  Our d issenting co lleague re lies on the Commission's de cision in Arch of Kentucky, 20 FMS HRC 132 1 (D ec. 199 8), to sup po rt her op inion t hat rema nding this mat te r t o t he jud ge is unnecess ary. In Arch, the Commission held har mless the judg e's err or in sus taining t he Secre tar y's object ion to the o perat or's quest ioning of her witness o n cros s-examinat ion, effectively excluding evidence the operator sought to submit. Id. at 1328-29. However, Arch is distinguisha ble because in that c ase, t he judge ha d the o ppor tunit y to co nsider t he value o f the excluded evidence in light of the Secretary's objection and the parties' arguments at the hearing. Unlike Arch, here, Vermont Slate did not know at the hearing that the judge would not consider Camara's testimony and thus did not have an opportunity to present alternative evidence or its arguments below. 442   Camara t hat he d oesn't ""tell the p art ies who t hey have to prese nt as w itnesses , the y decide,"" and that it was ""up to the solicitor [what witnesses to call], and they are not calling him [Tango]."" Tr. 132-33. Camara asked ""What do I do?"" Tr. 133. The judge explained that he could ""tell us your versions of all these citations."" Tr. 133. The judge then recessed for 15 minutes, and upon resuming, asked C amara ""[w ]hat would yo u like to do?"" T r. 13 3-34 . Camar a resp onded that he wanted to call Carl Onder and proceeded with the presentation of his case. Tr. 134. After Camara questioned Onder, he stated that he did not want to testify and attempted to rest his case. Tr. 147-48. The judge persuaded Camara to take the stand to testify about each citation. Tr. 148. On review, Vermont Slate contends that it did not subpoena Tango because counsel for the Secretary indicated that Tango would be present at the hearing. PDR at 1. The operator point s out that much of t he tes timony of Bu dd, t he inspect or w ho acc ompanied T ango o n the inspection, was inconsistent with Tango's notes, and that it was more appropriate for Tango to testify about his notes. Id. at 1- 2. Vermont Slate thus co ntends that it was prejudiced by Tango's absence. Id. The Secretary responds that the record does not support Vermont Slate's assertion that she indicated Tango would be at the hearing, and also denies that the operator made a showing of prejudice. S. Br. at 5-9. While the judge did pro vide a measur e of guid ance t o Camar a, a pr o se litiga nt, w e find he sent mixed signals to Camara in response to his request to call Tango as a witness. For example, when Camara asked the judge whether Tango should be present, the judge did not inform Camara tha t he co uld c all Ta ngo , o r o f the pro ced ure for do ing so . I n fact , wh en Ca mara spe cifica lly asked t he judge w hether he cou ld call Tango , the judge r espo nded t hat t he case w ould have to be cont inued, a nd did not direct ly respond to C amara's q uest ion. The judge's r espo nse may have confused Camara, because he again asked the judge what he could do, and ultimately did not pursue calling Tango in spite of his insistence that the inspector's testimony would be key to Vermont Slate's case. We do not suggest that the judge abused his discretion. However, as a matter of fairness and in the interest of justice, V ermont Slate sho uld be given an opportu nity to present Tango's testimony in support of its case, particularly in light of the fact that the company is proceeding pro se. Ba sed o n the r ecor d, t he compa ny clearly expres sed its int ention t o call Tang o to test ify and offered an explanation for its failure to su bpoena him. It also po ints to inconsistencies in Tango's inspection notes, the citations, and Budd's testimony as a basis for its allegation of prejudice. In light of these circumstances and the judge's dismissal of Camara's testimony, Tango's absence from the hearing may have prejudiced Vermont Slate. Accordingly, we vacate the judge's finding of a violation and remand to him with instruc tions t hat he r eope n the r ecor d and pe rmit Ver mont S late t o pr esent Tango 's tes timony relating to t he guar ding hazar d on t he tr immer. At t he same time, the judg e must r econc ile any  443    conflicting evidence and determine if the guarding was adequate to protect a miner standing or working on the platform next to the trimmer.4 B. Citation No. 7720768  MSHA issued Citation No. 7720768 to Vermont Slate for insufficient lighting in an area of the garage where the control panels were located, alleging a violation of 30 C.F.R.  56.17001.5 Budd described the area as a ""dark closet,"" a two foot by seven foot open space next to the garage entrance. Tr. 34. The electrical control panel boxes and first aid supplies were located in this space. Tr. 34. Budd testified that in order to read the panel boxes, ""you had to get right u p in front of the m and really look ,"" which he a ssert ed was u nsafe if the po wer nee ded t o be shut do wn t o a piec e o f equ ipment in an e merg ency. Tr . 35 -36 . Bu dd a dmit te d t hat he co uld read the tag on the fire extinguisher which was the subject of Citation No. 7720767 and was kept in this area, but explained that the extinguisher was located immediately next to the door way where t here wa s more na tur al light from t he gara ge. T r. 38 -40. The Se cret ary cont ends t hat t he area's lighting was ""not sufficient to provide safe working conditions"" as required by the standard because in an emergenc y, a miner co uld mistake nly switch the wro ng elect rical box o ff due to the lack of light. S. Br. at 12. The judg e fo und tha t t he sp ace in que stio n had no a rt ificial ligh ting and t hat the only lighting in the area was natural light which came into the area through the garage door. 23 FMSHRC at 312. He found that the lighting was insufficient to illuminate the interior space where the switch panels were located. Id. The judg e conc luded t hat Ve rmont Slate vio lated t he regulation, affirmed the citation, and assessed a penalty of $55. Id. at 312, 319. On r eview , we first not e t hat the judg e cr edit ed B udd 's t est imony t hat the nat ura l light in the contro l panel area was not adequate to per mit a person to read t he labels on the panels.6 A  We agree with the Se cretar y that the rec ord do es not supp ort V ermont Slate's assertions that the judge refused to allow it to call Okey Reitter, MSHA's Assistant District Manager , to test ify. First, c ontr ary to the o perat or's sugge stion, ther e is no indicat ion in the reco rd t hat at any time befor e the he aring, V ermont Slate r equest ed tha t Reit ter be pres ent at the hearing, or t hat t he Secr etar y objecte d to its req uest , or that the judg e consid ered t he matt er and sus ta ined t he S ecr et ary' s ob ject ion. In fa ct , t he r eco rd in dica te s th at at the hear ing, Cama ra d id not attempt to call Reitter to testify. Moreover, Reitter's absence from the hearing did not prejud ice Vermo nt Slat e, beca use Reit ter was neit her pr esent at t he inspect ion nor a part y to t he post-inspection telephone conference between MSHA and the operator.

Farmer v. Island Creek Coal Co., 14 FMSHRC 1537, 1541 (Sep t. 1992).

Her e, w e find n ot hing in t he r eco rd t hat wo uld warrant us taking the extraordinary step of reversing the judge's credibility determinations with regar d to this cita tion. 7 Accor dingly, we affirm the judge's finding o f a violatio n. C. Citation No. 7720772  Vermont Slate received Citation No. 7720772 for failing to provide a safe means of access to the trimmer, allegedly in violation of 30 C.F.R.  56.11001.8 This is the same trimmer that was the subject of Citation No. 7720771, located on a stack of pallets about five-feet high. 23 FMSHRC a t 315 . Budd test ified that Camara t old t he inspect ors t hat an o perat or ac cessed the trimmer by climbing the pallets. Id. Budd a lso te stified tha t a miner had to s tick his feet in the holes between the pallets and pull himself up. Tr. 79-80. There were no handrails, steps, or ladder p rovide d for miners access ing the t rimmer. 23 FMSHRC a t 315 . Camar a's te stimony corroborated Budd's description of this arrangement. Id.; Tr. 170- 71. T he judge fo und tha t t he pallets, without steps or handrails, failed to provide a safe means of access to the trimmer. 23 FMSHRC a t 315 . He co ncluded t hat Ve rmont Slate vio lated t he sta ndard, affirmed the c itatio n, and assessed a penalty of $55. Id. at 315, 319. Notwithstanding Vermont Slate's assertion that the pallets were a safe means of access to the t rimmer (PD R at 3 -4), the judg e's co nclusion t hat, in the absenc e of st eps o r handr ails, the pallets were an unsafe means of access is both reasonable and amply supported by the record. See Donovan ex rel. Chacon v. Phelps Dodge Corp., 709 F.2d 8 6, 92 (D.C . Cir. 1 983) (the Commis sion may no t ""s ubst itu te a co mpet ing vie w o f the fact s for the view [ an] ALJ r eas ona bly reached""). Accordingly, we affirm the judge's finding of a violation.  doorway. Vermont Slate a ssert s that the judg e's dec ision to vacat e anot her cita tion at issue at the hearing (No. 77 20769) based o n his decision to credit Camara o ver Budd undermines Budd's credibility with respect to Citation No. 7720768. PDR at 2. The Commission has rejected, however, the ""false in one, false in everything"" rule of testimonial evidence, noting that ""it is not unco mmon, and c ert ainly no t r ever sible e rr or , fo r t he t rier of fa ct to find a w itne ss t o be cre dible on some, but not other, matters.""

Section 56.11001 provides: ""Safe means of access shall be provided and maintained to all working places."" 30 C.F.R.  56.11001. 445 8 7   D.  Citation No. 7720773  MSHA issued Citation No. 7720773 to Vermont Slate for allegedly violating 30 C.F.R.  56.150049 because the slat e saw o perat or w as not wearing e ye prot ectio n. The s aw was ""a radial saw arm"" with a circular blade about 28 inches in diameter and a half hood over the blade. 23 F MSH RC a t 3 15; Tr . 87 -88 . T he sa w o per at or wo rke d at the co ntr ol st at ion w ith t he sa w in front of him and po sitioned the slat e betw een himself and the blade. 2 3 FMSHR C at 3 15.

Bud d t est ified tha t c hips of s lat e co uld f ly off t he blo ck p os ing a haz ard of e ye injury while a miner positioned the slate with a crowbar, which could slip, and while a miner operated the saw. Tr. 91-92. It is undisputed that the saw operator was not wearing eye protection. 23 FMSHRC at 315. Camara testified that the common practice at most quarries was not to wear eye protection. Tr. 158. However, he also admitted that most of the miners at the quarry put on eye protection whe neve r ins pec to rs v isit ed t he s ite . T r. 158 , 1 80. He t est ified tha t t her e wa s no risk of e ye injur y beca use the saw had a hoo d o ver the blade and s pra yed w at er, and d enied tha t c hips w ou ld fly off the block of slate. Tr. 178-79. The judg e cr edit ed B udd 's t est imon y and fou nd t hat the saw po sed a ha zar d o f eye in jur y, and concluded that Vermont Slate violated the standard by not requiring the saw operator to wear eye protection. 23 FMSHRC at 316. He also found that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that the violat ion was significant and subst antial and mo dified the cit ation, deleting t he S&S designation. Id. The judge affirmed the citation as modified and assessed a penalty of $55. Id. at 316, 319. First, we find no reason to disturb the judge's crediting Budd's testimony that the saw posed a hazard that required eye protection. Farmer, 14 FMSHRC at 1541. As for whether Vermont Slate vio lated t he sta ndard, while the o perat or ar gues t hat it w as not aware of the req uir emen ts of s ect ion 5 6. 150 04, the rec or d r eve als t hat saw op era to rs a t t he mine did w ear eye protection. In fact, Camara admitted that saw operat ors would wear eye protection when MSHA inspec to rs visit ed t he sit e. T r. 1 58, 180 . Acc or dingly, we affir m the ju dge 's finding of a violatio n.  Section 56.15004 provides: ""All persons shall wear safety glasses, goggles, or face shields or other suitable protective devices when in or around an area of a mine or plant where a hazard exists which could cause injury to unprotected eyes."" 30 C.F.R.  56.15004. 446  9   E.  Citation No. 7720775  MSHA issued Citation No. 7720775 to Vermont Slate for failing to provide a safety lock on the hose to a jack hammer, alleging a violation of 30 C.F.R.  56.13021.10 Budd testified that the hose connected to the jack hammer was making a hissing sound and concluded that it was bleed ing air . 23 FMS HRC at 317 ; Tr . 10 5. H e als o t est ified t hat he sa w sla te and o the r mat eria ls in the area that are used in conjunction with hammering. 23 FMSHRC at 317; Tr. 105. Budd test ified that althou gh the ha mmer was no t being us ed at the t ime of the inspe ction, because the hammer cou ld be used , the lack of a s afety device on the hose t o pr event it from co ming apart and causing a whipping action was a violation of the standard. 23 FMSHRC at 317; Tr. 104-05. In suppo rt o f the S&S designat ion on t he citat ion, Bu dd te stified tha t it w as likely that during u se the hos e wo uld d isco nnec t if no safe ty lo ck w as in p lace , an d t hat if it d isco nnec te d, t he ho se w ou ld whip around out of control and potentially inflict serious of even fatal injuries. 23 FMSHRC at 317. Camara admitted that the hose did not have a safety device, but testified that the hammer was no t in use o n the da y of the inspe ction. Tr. 182- 83. T he judge c redit ed Bud d's te stimony and found that Vermont Slate vio lated t he sta ndard. 23 FMSH RC at 317. He also fo und tha t t he violation was significant and substantial and assessed a penalty of $140. Id. at 317, 319. On review, there is no dispute that the connection between the hose and the jack hammer had no safety lock. We also find nothing in the recor d that wo uld lead us to o verturn t he judge's crediting of Budd's testimony regarding his observations that he heard air hissing out of the hose and saw materials used in connection with hammering activities lying in the same area as the jack hammer. Farmer, 14 FMSHRC at 1541. Finally, the judge's conclusion that the hammer had recently been used was a reasonable inference for him to draw from Budd's testimony. MidContinent Res., Inc., 6 FMS HRC 11 32, 1 138 ( May 1984 ) (empha sizing that inferences d rawn by the judg e are ""p ermissible pro vided the y are inherent ly reasona ble and the re is a log ical and rat iona l co nnec tio n bet wee n th e ev iden tia ry fa ct s an d t he u ltima te fact infer red ."" ). Acc or ding ly, we affirm the judge's finding of a violation. F. Citation No. 7720778  MSHA issued Citation No. 7720778 to Vermont Slate for failing to provide a miner trained in first aid at the site during the work shift, alleging a violation of 30 C.F.R.  56.18010.11 The individual trained in first aid was sent to another site because there was not enough work at the Blissville Quarry. 23 FMSHRC at 318; Tr. 128-29. The judge found that the evidence  Section 56.13021 provides: ""Except where automatic shutoff valves are used, safety chains or other suitable devices shall be used at connections to machines of high pressure hose lines . . . and between high-pressure hose lines . . . where a connection failure would create a hazard."" 30 C.F.R.  56.13021. Section 56.18010 pro vides in pertinent part: ""An individual capable of providing first aid shall be available on all shifts."" 30 C.F.R.  56.18010. 447 11  10   regarding this citation was undisputed, that the miner trained in first aid was sent to another location, and that there was no one at the quarry trained in first aid. 23 FMSHRC at 318. He reject ed Ver mont S late's a rgument that the abs ence o f a first aid miner w as not a violatio n of the regulation because the medical center was only 1.3 miles from the quarry, and concluded that Vermont Slate violated section 56.18010. Id. The judge assessed a penalty of $55. Id. at 319. The record evidence clearly supports the judge's finding that Vermont Slate failed to provide a miner trained in first aid at the Blissville Quarry on the date of the inspection. Accor dingly, we affirm the judge's finding o f a violatio n. III. Conclusion For t he fore going r easons , we vac ate a nd remand C itatio n No. 77207 71, a nd affirm the judge's d ecision wit h respe ct t o Cita tion No s. 772 0768, 77207 72, 7 72077 3, 77 20775 , and 7720778.  Theodore F. Verheggen, Chairman  Robert H. Beatty, Jr., Commissioner  448    Commissioner Jordan, concurring in part, and dissenting in part: I join the majority in affirming the judge's decision with respect to five of the citations at issue in this case. However, I would also affirm the judge's finding that the operator failed to adequately guard the trimmer, in violation of 30 C.F.R.  56.14107(a).1 Inspector Budd prese nted d etailed t estimony re garding the lack of guar ding of t he moving par ts o f the v-be lt drive of the trimmer. Tr. 64-69. As my colleagues note, slip op. at 2, the inspector clearly delineated the loc ation o f the t wo pinch p oints. He te stified tha t t he tr immer was ungu arded and tha t t he machin e o per at or wo uld s ta nd wit hin a fo ot of t he v- belt , an d ""ab ou t a rm's rea ch, maybe a litt le less"" from the pinch points. Tr. 64, 67, 69. He stated that because the v-belt areas were not guarded, an individual could possibly stick a hand in the v-belt drive or be drawn in from clothing, possibly resulting in the loss of fingers or a hand. Tr. 64. Consequently, I would hold that subs ta ntia l evide nce s upp or ts t he jud ge' s de te rminat ion, as a rea son able p ers on c ou ld ce rt ainly find this testimony adequate to support the judge's conclusion that the trimmer was not adequately guarded. My colleagues in the majority find that the judge erred by failing to properly analyze all of the probative evidence to determine whether the moving parts on the v-belt drive posed a hazard to miner s on t he platfo rm who w ere o perat ing the t rimmer. Slip o p. at 4. Sp ecifically, the majority faults the judge's conclusion that the evidence Camara presented on that issue was irrelevant because the t estimony ad dress ed only whet her t he expo sed moving p art s on t he equipment were hazardous to a person standing on the ground. Id. at 3-4. While the judge charac ter ized Camer a's evidenc e (which co nsisted s olely of his tes timony and a drawing of the trimmer) as irrelevant, I would call it muddied and inconsistent. It was not clear from his statements whether he actually ever confronted MSHA's concern about the dangers of t he v- belt to a t rimmer op era to r, beca use he sp ent a lot of t ime disc uss ing ho w impo ssible it wo uld be to rea ch t he pin ch po ints fro m the gro und . T r. 164 , 16 6, 1 68- 69. He ne ver clea rly explained how a machine operator would be protected from contact with the pinch point areas. Tr. 162-70. In fact, when asked about the v-belt, Camera testified: ""Was not guarded."" Tr. 169.2 This c ase is in a pr oce dur al po stu re s imilar to tha t o f Arch of Kentucky, 20 FMSHRC 1321 (Dec. 1998). There, the Commission found that the judge had improperly sustained an objection by the Secretary, thus excluding evidence the operator had tried to have admitted. Id. at 13 28. H oweve r, a u nanimous Co mmission held that althou gh the jud ge's evide ntiary ru ling was incor rect , his err or w as harmless, in part because the exc luded t estimony co uld not have  Sect ion 56. 14107 (a) r equires that moving machine par ts be g uarde d to pro tect perso ns fro m mov ing p art s t hat may ca use injur y. Camara did initially insist that the trimmer was guarded, but apparently only in the front. Tr. 163- 65.

I am hard pressed to think of another case where the Commission (or any appellate body) vacated a decision without even deciding whether the claimed error occurred. 4 It appears as if my colleagues are actually vacating and remanding this case because they believe the judge failed to provide the operator, who was appearing pro se, with adequate guidance about its right to call the witness.

HAVITZ Brian E. H avitz, M onro e, OH , Claim ant. Diana E. Settelmeyer, Chief, Claims and Correction of Records, Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Denver, CO, appearing for Department of Defense. HYATT , Board Judge. Claim ant, Brian E. H avitz, is a civilian employee of the National Guard Service of the De partm ents of the Army and the Air Force. His permanent duty station at the time of travel was the Air National Guard's 123 rd Air Control Squadron in Blue A sh, Ohio. In August 2000, he perfo rmed a tem porary duty (TDY) assignment at Hill Air Force Base in Utah. The issue presented to the B oard for re view conc erns M r. Hav itz's return trip to Ohio, which was routed from Salt Lake City, Utah, to Dayton, Ohio, through Chicago, Illinois. M r. Hav itz landed in Chicago as planned, but was unable to take the connecting flight to Dayton because it had be en overbooked. Instead of taking a later flight that day, or staying overnight in Chicago and flying to Dayton the next day, claimant rented a car an d dro ve fro m C hicag o to his h ous e in M onr oe, O hio . Upon his retu rn to O hio, M r. Hav itz requested reimbursement for the cost of the rental car. When the unused portion of claimant's ticket was turned in, the commercial transportation office (CTO) advised that it would not be possible to obtain a refund for the partial por tion of th e retu rn f ligh t. Ad ditiona lly, although M r. Hav itz was authorized to rent a car while in Utah, his travel orders did not authorize rental of a car to drive from Chicago to Ohio. The command would like to approve the ex penses; the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) regards the claim as doubtful, expressing the view that claimant drove from Chicago to Ohio for his personal convenience. DFAS takes the position that the claim mu st be den ied. Discussion   GSBCA 15523-TRAV  2  Under the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR), Government employees who travel on official business are expected to use common carriers for transportation unless the authorizing agen cy determ ines tha t an altern ative m eans of trav el is more adva ntage ous to the Government. 41 CFR 301-10.5(a ) (2000). When the employee does not travel by the method of transportation sele cte d b y the agency, the employee must bear any additional expenses. Id ., 301-10.6. The Joint Travel Regula tions (JTR), which apply to civilian employees of the De partm ent of De fens e and supp leme nt t he FTR, contain a similar provision. JTR C2001-A.3.d. The reco rd p rov ided to u s do es n ot es tabli sh w heth er M r. H avitz v olun tarily relinquished his seat on the overbooked flight or whether he was denied boarding rights by the airline. Although the FT R p ermits e mp loyees to voluntarily vacate a seat on a scheduled airline flight to the ex tent it w ill not interf ere w ith of ficia l duties, th e em ployee is nonetheless responsible for any addition al costs incurred. FTR 301-10.117. When an employee is ""bum ped"" invo luntarily, the e mp loyee is gene rally entitled to reimbursement for additional subsistence costs that may be incurred, but is required to ensure that any financial remuneration provided by the airline is mad e payab le to the "" Tre asu rer o f the Un ited S tates ."" FTR 301 -10.1 16; Om ar J. N orris , B-224590 (Nov. 10, 1986). The rationa le und erlying this regulation is that since the Government has contracted with the airline for the reserved seat and may incur additional travel expenses on behalf of the employee denie d the re serve d sea t, it is entitled to the compensation as a form of ""liquidated damages."" See John B. Currier, 59 Comp. Gen . 95 (1979 ); Ch ester S ipkin , B-148879 (Aug. 28, 1970). The proper disposition of this claim depends, therefore, on whether the relinquishment of the reserved seat was vol unt ary or i nvo lun tary. To the ex tent M r. Havitz volunteered to give up his reserved seat on the scheduled flight, he is fu lly respon sible fo r the ex cess c osts of travel h e incurred b y renting a car to perform the final leg of his return trip. In ge neral, Go vern men t emp loyees w ho v olun teer to be bum ped from an ove rbooke d flight are better serv e d to await a later flight, if possible, rather than arrange alternative transportation. In any eve nt, if claim ant vo luntarily ag reed to give up his seat, while he canno t recou p the c ost of the ren tal car, he is perm itted to re tain any compensation that the airlin e aff orde d him for ag reeing to give up h is seat. JTR C2201B; Charles E. Armer , 59 Co mp. G en. 203 (1 980). If Mr. Havitz was involuntarily denied a seat on the plane, the airline was requ ired to book him on another flight to Dayton as soon as possible and, depending on the length of the delay attributable to the need to reschedule, may also have been requ ired to f urnish him w ith compensation. If th is w oul d ha ve r equ ired an o ver nig ht sta y, Mr . Havitz may have been entitled to subsistence expenses for lodging and meals and incidental expenses, to the extent the airline w ould not have absorbed these costs. At the same time, if the airline compensated Mr. Ha vitz f or the loss of his reserved seat, he would be required to turn over that compensation to the Government. If this is the situation, and Mr. Havitz chose to rent a car and return home rather th an stay ov ernigh t in the Chicago area, he may be compensated for the expense he incurr ed to th e exte nt it does not exceed the cost the Government would have incurred for lodging and per diem as a result of the d elayed travel. He sho uld, how ever, also remit a ny com pens ation re ceive d fro m the airline to the G over nm ent. This matter is returned to the agency for disposition in accordance with the above.   GSBCA 15523-TRAV  3  _________________________________ CATHERINE B. HYATT Board Judge"
GX251-10-13559211	5  Chap ter 1 The Approach  Background Each year, approximately one percent of the U.S. population, some two to three million individu als, experiences a nigh t of homelessn ess that puts them in contact with a hom eless assistance provider. The estimate is conservative  it does not include those affected by natural disasters, nor those who do not contact a homeless assistance provider, e.g., who m ay b e tak en in by a friend or spe nd the n igh t in a car. Th e circu m stan ces th at ca use hom eless nes s for tw o to th ree m illion Am erica ns a re va ried. However, research conducted since the late 1980's shows that interactions among the supply of affordable housing, poverty, and disability account for most of the precipitating factors. Among poor persons, the risk of a night of homelessness is far higher than for the general pop ulation. Som ewh ere between four to six percent of the poor experience hom elessn ess an nua lly. Mos t of these ex perien ces are sh ort-term and the ind ividu als exit homelessness with minimal assistance and generally are not seen again. But the subgroup that tends to be the most visible is a group of about 200,000 people who experience homelessness on a protracted or repeated basis. On any given night, this group will represent almost half of those who are homeless. This subgroup has been identified as the chronically or long term homeless. There is increasing consensus that we can take actions that w ill reduce and en d this level of chronic hom elessness.  Exploring Solutions Beginning in March, 2001, the Secretary's office initiated several activities to improve the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) response to the services needed by pers ons exp erien cing hom eless nes s.         Secretary Tommy Th omp son met with Secretary Mel Martinez of the Departmen t of Hou sing and Urba n D evelop m ent (H UD ) and Secreta ry Tho m pson com m itted his Depa rtmen t to a collaboration that cap italized on the exp ertise of HHS in service delivery and of HUD in housing. HHS staff initiated regular, informal discussions with HUD and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) staff to understand the programs and opportunities that could be involved in a colla bora tion . HHS, HUD and VA staff explored goals and activities of mutual interest and recom m end ed to lea dersh ip tha t collabo ration w as bes t achie ved b y ado pting a specific and targe ted focus on the issue of long term an d repeated h om elessness. Discussions with the HHS Operating Divisions were held to determine what options they saw to m ake their program s more accessib le to hom eless persons. Budget formulations and other administrative scenarios within HHS were considered.   6    An am bitiou s partn ership with States wa s initiated that ac know ledg ed the role of State agen cies in settin g the p riorities for using HHS assistan ce. The S ecretary se nt all Governors an invitation to participate in the partnership. Beginning in November 2001, a series of Po licy Aca dem ies for State and Local Po licym akers w as beg un. Th irty-six States applied to participate in the first of these, knowing that only eight could be accomm odated.  Th roug hou t the se ex plo ratio ns, a lead ing con cern wa s for HH S-a ssiste d serv ices to be m ore acce ssib le to e ligib le ho m eless perso ns b ein g pl aced in H UD -su pp orted hou sing .

By sum m er's end, it w as clear th at the co m plexity of HHS ' structure an d prog ram variety obviated a simple linear plan, i.e., one that involved an easily introduced change that exp an ded opp ortu nitie s for acc ess b y ho m eless ind ivid ua ls. The final development of significance came in the release of the Adm inistration's budget for fiscal year 2003. President George W. Bush endorsed as goal of his administration ending chro nic h om eless nes s in a deca de.  The Secretary's Work Group on End ing Chronic Homelessness At th e sta rt of cale nd ar ye ar 20 02 , Sec retary Tho m pso n es tab lish ed th e Se creta ry's W ork Group on Ending Chronic Homelessness. He asked Deputy Secretary Claude Allen to lead the Work Group in a comprehensive review of the Department's relevant programs. The W ork Grou p w as to repo rt recom m end ation s for a Dep artm ent-w ide ap proach that w ould contribute to the Administration's goal of ending chronic homelessness and improve HHS' ab ility to assis t pers ons exp erien cing chro nic h om eless nes s.  Representation on th e Secretary's Work Group On Ending Ch ronic Homelessness:  The action simultaneously ad dressed two needs: First, it brought the relevant HHS agen cies into a collabo ration to formulate a Department-wide strategy that addressed the multiple needs of this subgroup. Seco nd, b y focusin g on chron ic homelessness, it established a compelling link to themes that had been articulated by the White House, HUD and VA on this same issue.

Representatives were chosen by agency administrators for their knowledge of ag enc y pro gra m s an d th eir ab ility to repre sen t the age ncy aut hori tativ ely (A pp end ix A ).   7 Mr. Alle n item ized ch arges to the W ork Grou p m em bers an d offered a plan of app roach to und ertake four tasks: 1. Define the po pulation th at experiences chron ic hom elessness and itemize their service needs. Analyze the response of relevant HHS m ainstream assistance programs to the itemized service needs. Specify outcomes and objectives that would improve the response of these mainstream program s to long term a nd repea ted hom elessness. Offer actions the agencies could take that would improve access to and coordination of services that wou ld contribute to reducin g and ending chronic hom elessness. An Interagency Subcom mittee was formed im m ediate ly (Ap pen dix B ) and charg ed w ith pursuing each of the four tasks. The Subcom mittee met formally over a dozen times and held numerous informal meetings to analyze d ata, formulate recom me ndation s, an d ed it wri tten wo rk. To accomplish its work, the Subcom mittee: Reviewed epidem iological and services research literature that documented what is known about those who experience long term and repeated homelessness and about treatments, services, and supports that are effective with these persons. This material is su m m arize d in Ch ap ter 2. 2. Developed, administered and tabulated a service inventory for eight relevant mainstream HHS programs. The inventory sought not only to understand the adm inistrative features of each program, but their specific response to the services need ed by person s expe riencin g chro nic ho m elessn ess. The findin gs are su m m arized in Chapter 3.

GX253-43-11732476	"The Institute for Energy Law of The Center for American and International Law 53rd Annual Institute on Oil And Gas Law Remarks by William L. Massey Co mmissioner U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ""The Current and Future Gas Industry"" Houston, Texas February 21, 2002  Good M orning. I am honored to address this distinguished gathering of lawyers, corporate officials, academics and policy makers. I am a lawyer by FERC nine years ago. I living practicing before than le gal an alysis. A d training, and eagerly anticipated bringing my legal prowess to the quickly learned that, although thousands of lawyers make a good FERC, we primarily are engaged in energy policy making rather egree in eco nom ics w ould actua lly be mo re help ful.  Th e f ed er al l aw s th at g ov er n t he na tu ra l g as an d e lec tric ity in du str ies ha ve n't changed much in the past decade, yet there has been a sweeping policy revolution in the way in which natural gas and electricity are sold and transported. The federal courts have told us that a just and reasonable price can be set by cost of service regulation  we know how to do that, and regulators did it for years, for good or for ill. But now, we have come to believe that markets can allocate resources and set efficient prices better than regulators. And in validating market based policy choices made by the FERC in Order Nos. 636 and 88 8, the federal courts have declared that a market-based approach can also prod uce a just and reaso nable outco me, b ut only if the m arket f unctio ns w ell eno ugh to actually discipline the price. And so now virtually all of the Commission's orders ask this foundational question either implicitly or explicitly: what policy choice will facilitate a well functioning market? This is the common thread in all of our decisionmaking.   -2Wh en w e certificate a new pipeline or L NG facility, we are motivated b y a desire to ens ure tha t the ga s ma rket ha s an a dequ ate inf rastruc ture. T he C aliforn ia electric ity crisis tha t bega n in the sum mer o f 20 00 m ade u s pain fully aw are tha t an ina dequ ate energy infrastructure can lead to soaring prices and unacceptable volatility. It also made us painfully aware of the limitations on our jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act and Natural Gas Act. We cannot site electric transmission lines, even if they are vital to a we ll func tioning wh olesale mark et. Th at is left to th e states, a s is the sitin g of electric generation. We cannot ensure that there is sufficient intrastate take away capacity at interstate delivery points. A well functioning market requires the necessary interstate and intrastate infrastructure. We encourage states in this area, yet there is little we can do if a sta te f ail s to ac t. T hi s d iv isi on of au th or ity, w hi le p er ha ps po liti ca lly n ec es sa ry, som etime s frustra tes the d ecision mak ing n ecess ary for w ell fun ctionin g w holes ale markets. When we told pipelines in Order No. 637 that they must allow shippers to segment capacity, we did so with the needs of a well functioning market in mind. I could give scores of other examples. Our policy promoting the formation of Regional Transmission Organizations is aimed at facilitating independent, large regional platforms on which vibrantly competitive electricity markets can flourish. My point is that the policy evolution at FERC is focused on ensuring good markets for gas and electricity, and that will be the focus in the future as well. The Comm ission remains committed to making a market-based approach wo rk for energy consumers. This may seem obvious, yet in the wake of the California energy crisis and the demise of Enron, some are suggesting that energy deregulation is a failure. They argue that the California crisis was strike one, and that the Enron bankruptcy was strike two. The disaster in California taught us that the elements of a well functioning market mu st be in p lace f or co mp etition to d iscipline prices . Tho se elem ents ar e ade quate sup ply, su ffic ient t ran sm issio n ca pab ility, for wa rd c ont racti ng a nd a ppr opr iate h edg ing , good congestive management protocols, and a limited reliance on the spot market for meeting a purchaser's needs. The California crisis literally shouted to us that good markets that produce reasonable prices must be well structured. Federal and state policy makers must cooperate rather than blame each other. It does not mean, however, that the mo vem ent to c om petitive m arkets is a failu re. It me ans a bsolu tely that w e mu st redo uble our efforts to ensure that the market is structured to produce just and reasonable prices. Enron's demise is shocking and a disaster for many reasons, among them thousand s of w orkers lost their jobs an d retirement ne st eggs, and inv estors lost their   -3shirts. There are ce rtainly important policy lessons, but based upon w hat I've seen so f ar, these lessons seem to arise in other policy arenas such as retirement, accounting and securities regulation. All of these issues will be thoroughly investigated by Congress and federal agencies, as well they should be. Several members of Congress and some market participants are claiming that Enron may have used Enron Online or its broader market position to distort electric and gas m arkets in the W estern Un ited Sta tes. In res pon se, the C om missio n has recen tly opene d a broad investigation into w hether any entity manipulated We stern marke ts. In the co urse o f this inv estigatio n, w e w ill look a t both p hysical an d fina ncial m arkets , both short and long term. If En ron's de mise o ffers lesson s for o ur ev olving energ y policy, we mo st certain ly must heed those lessons. If there was market manipulation by any entity, we must uncover it as soon as possible and impose appropriate penalties. Based upon what I've seen so far, however, nothing persuades me that the Commission's general policy direction is unsound. I have seen no evidence that Enron's demise was a result of a flawed energy policy. Moreover, the market seemed to adjust well. Our largest energy trader failed, but other market participants quickly stepped in. It may be that some long term contracts still must be unraveled, but the energy market itself seemed to have the dep th an d fle xib ility to ad just w ell. Thus, the Commission remains undeterred. Although we have had bumps in the roa d, w e co ntin ue to belie ve th at a m ark et ba sed app roa ch h old s pro mis e fo r co nsu me rs. Unless Congress tells us to change policy directions, and I do not see that happening, we will continue to promote robust markets for gas and electricity. We will insist that cons um ers be nefit. If I may return now to the issue of our infrastructure, the tragic events of September 11 have brought a more immediate focus on the need to ensure that our critical energy infrastructure facilities  gas, electric, oil and hydroelectric  are protected from terrorist threats. On Sep temb er 14 , the C om missio n issue d a po licy stateme nt indic ating th at it would give ""its highest priority"" to processing any filing made for recovery of extraordinary expenditures to safeguard jurisdictional facilities. The Comm ission took another step to safeguard critical energy infrastructure on Oc tober 1 1 in an nou ncing that w e w ere lim iting ac cess to certain pub lic doc um ents containing specific information on energy facilities. Generally, this information consists   -4of m aps a nd o ther ge ogra phic d ata tha t wo uld h elp loc ate en ergy fac ilities. This information has been removed from the Commission' s website and the public reference ro om . H ow ev er , it r em ain s a va ila bl e u nd er th e F re ed om of In fo rm ati on A ct. O n J an ua ry 14, w e initiated an inq uiry into ho w th e Co mm ission s hou ld pro vide p ublic a ccess to critical energy infrastructure information while ensuring that this information cannot be misused by potential terrorists. The deadline for public comment on this notice expires shortly, and I am confident that we will receive many constructive suggestions. On October 12, the Commission issued an order approving the reactivation of the Cove Po int LNG fa cility. Our action, coming just one month after the terrorist attacks, stirred up a hornet's nest. We were besieged by criticism from Capitol Hill and local Maryland officials. The environmental analysis of the proposed plant reactivation prepared prior to September 11 specifically considered the impact of a terrorist act, and dismissed it as being remote. However, in view of the events of September 11, a number of parties sou ght rehearing of the certificate ord er. These p etitioners expressed concern about the proximity of Cove Point to the Calvert Cliffs nuclear generating facility located fo ur m ile s a w ay. W e to ok th es e c on ce rn s v er y se rio us ly. In the end, in response to these concerns, the Commission held a closed hearing on the safety implications of allowing LNG tankers to enter the Chesapeake Bay for deliveries at the facility. The Commission heard testimony from landowners, local offic ials, the F BI, C oast G uard , the N RC and e xper ts in LN G sa fety. We ultima tely determined that the facility could be operated safely, and does not pose a specific national se cu rity c on ce rn or a th re at t o t he se cu rity o f th e C alv er t C lif fs fa cil ity. At this point, the future of the Cove Point facility is in the hands of the U.S. Coast G ua rd w hi ch , al on g w ith th e D ep ar tm en t o f T ra ns po rta tio n, b ea rs t he re gu lat or y responsibility for approving the siting and safe operation of the dock and appurtenant facilities for offloading LNG from tankers.

In additio n to the Co ve P oint rea ctivation , the C om missio n has issued a certific ate autho rizing D ynegy's plans to con struct an d op erate L NG impo rt facilities a t its Ha ckbe rry, Louisia na ga s proc essing plant.   -5In a December, 2001 study, the EIA identified 13 new LNG facilities that have been proposed to serve U.S. markets. The study concludes that, even if only a few of thes e pr ojec ts are bui lt, the y cou ld still h ave a ve ry pos itive eff ect o n U .S. g as m ark ets. The high capital costs associated with LNG import facilities mean that they can be undertake n only by compa nies that have s trong balan ce sheets. N evertheless, it appears that a n um ber o f com panie s are g oing to un dertak e the c onstru ction o f LN G im port facilities. I lo ok f orw ard to e valua ting the se pro jects as th ey com e to us for ce rtificate approval. I expect LNG to increase in importance in meeting our energy needs in the years ahead. In addition to LNG impo rts, the Com mission has followed with some interest discu ssions on C apitol H ill conc erning wa ys to bring natura l gas fr om Alas ka to m arkets in the Lower 48 states. Several alternative pipeline routes exits, each one having a unique set of environmental and economic advantages and disadvantages. I have met with a number of potential Alaska gas pipeline sponsors, but thus far, none of the proposed pipelin e rou tes had been filed w ith the C om missio n. Th e only qu estion I have at this juncture is a business question, not a regulatory question: will the current price of natural gas support the construction of such facilities? My own view is that, once the economics justify such an investment, natural gas from Alaska will become an important means of meeting this nation's energy needs. As far as where the pipeline should be built, I have an open mind and w ill await the filing of certificate applications. I am generally pleased with the direction of our certificate policy. As the EIA has frequently reported, under virtually all economic scenarios, natural gas use increases dramatically over the next two decades, and substantial pipeline expansion will be required. The Commission is aware of this and is ready to process and evaluate 7c applications in a timely manner. Our processing time has decreased significantly over the pas t few years. T he to ugh est is sue con tinu es to be h ow to h and le lan dow ner con cern s. Th ese are e spe cially c ont entio ns w her e fa cilitie s m ust c ross hea vily po pul ated area s. Obviously, we must balance all concerns. Projects that serve the Northeast have been particularly challenging. Millennium Pipeline, for example, will interconnect with Con Edis on at a locatio n w ithin the dens ely popu lated C ity of M t. Vern on, m uch to the ch agrin of its citizenry. Certificating necessary pipeline facilities remains one of our most challenging jurisdictional arenas. Th e bottom line is that necessary pipeline infrastruc ture has to go somewhere, and we have to make some very tough siting decisions to meet our natio n's en erg y nee ds. L ast yea r, w e ce rtific ated 11.7 bcf/day in new capacity, and anoth er 7.1 b cf/da y is proposed for certification in 2002. These are significant additions to our nation's energy infrastructure.   -6Alt hou gh t he n atur al ga s m ark etpla ce a ppe ars to be f unc tion ing reas ona bly w ell, I do hav e a conc ern about the boom or bust cycle we have experienced with natural gas prices. You know the scenario. In 1998, wellhead prices stayed below $2.00 for much of the year, and the rig count dropped dramatically. Demand outpaced supply and prices rose sha rply in 2 000 . Th e rig cou nt th en in crea sed dra ma tically to we ll ov er 1 ,000 rigs, storage was filled, we have had a warm winter, and prices along with the rig count have aga in p lum me ted. O f co urse , you m igh t sim ply res pon d th at thi s is th e m ark et at w ork , and maybe it is. Yet, the price swings seem more volatile than in recent years, and such swin gs ca use p olitical rea ctions th at ultima tely are no t goo d fo r the m arket. We face a similar issue with electric markets. Electricity is critical to the social fabric of o ur na tion. W e w ant it to b e ava ilable an d reas onab ly priced. S om e vola tility is inevita ble, bu t extrem e vola tility over a su stained period is not u nacc eptab le. On e w ay to smo oth o ut the v olatility is with re serve requ ireme nts an d cap acity obliga tions. C apac ity markets are comp lex, but we need so me fea ture in our electricity market design to ensure that ad equa te gen erating capa city is being built. A capa city short m arket th at lead s to extrem e price volatility is not in the pu blic inter est. In gas and electricity markets, the peaks and valleys of course can be smoothed somewhat by appropriate hedging strategies, and we at FERC m ust ensure that pipeline bottlenecks do not keep prices artificially high. Timely certificate decisions are a ne ce ss ity. Now let me turn briefly to the issue of the standards of conduct for energy affiliates. Commission policy is to keep the pipeline and its gas marketing affiliate at arms leng th to guard a gainst self dealing . Unde r current policy, gas pipelines an d their mark eting a ffiliates m ust m aintain fun ctiona l separ ation, an d any inf orm ation d isclose d to a pipeline's marketing affiliate is disclosed simultaneously on the pipeline's website. Nev ertheless, there is a grow ing conc ern that the standa rds of con duct are insufficient to address the potential for self-dealing. This concern is fueled by the significant changes that have occurred in the energy industry. Mergers and consolidations in the gas and electric sectors have taken place at a brisk pace. Transmission providers often now have a number of gas and electric affiliates. Both physical and financial transactions by pipeline affiliates have burgeoned. The current regulations must be revised to govern the relationship between regulated transmission providers  both gas and electric  and all of their energy affiliates, not just their gas marketing affiliates. On Sep temb er 26 , we is sued a N otice o f Pro pose d R ulem aking to cov er all affiliates of the transmission provider. The Commission proposes to broaden the   -7definition of ""energy affiliate"" to prevent information concerning transmission operations or confidential customer information from being used to benefit any energy affiliate, inclu din g af filiate s en gag ed in fina ncia l trad ing of g as a nd e lectr icity ins trum ents . Pipeline affiliates that engage in electronic trading or energy-related financial transactions would be subject to the separation of function requirement and information sharing proh ibitions in the stan dard s of c ond uct. Our proposal is highly controversial. Pipelines assert that it is unnecessary and will have some unintended consequences. For example, they believe the proposed rule will limit legitimate dealings between a pipeline and its LDC affiliate. They raise num erou s othe r con cerns , as w ell. I have an open mind about this proposal. I must believe our affiliate standards must be updated, and so I support the basic thrust of our NOPR. W e must ensure, however, that we guard against any unintended consequences that would diminish legitimate operational efficiencies. We have received extensive comment, and now have a full record before us. Surely we can finalize this rule in the spring. Before I close, let me touch on a couple of other issues. A prominent feature of Order No. 637 was the removal of the price cap on secondary pipeline capacity. This was 2 year experiment that, by its terms, will sunset in September of this year. Extending the removal of the price cap would require a rulemaking. Our staff is now in the process of ev aluatin g the im pact o f this ex perim ent on the m arketp lace an d on cons um ers. I w ill await their recommendation. I had reservations about removing the cap in the first place, and will have to be persuaded that leaving it off is in the public interest. Does this policy make the market more liquid, or simply impose additional and unnecessary costs on consumers? W e will take up this issue in the next few months. Now, let me comment briefly on OCS issues. For years, the Commission has wre stled w ith the e xtent o f its auth ority to regu late on the O CS . A co uple o f years ag o, in a decision involving Sea Robin Pipeline, the C om missio n yet aga in attem pted to deline ate our primary function test as it applies to distinguish gathering from jurisdictional tran spo rtatio n, un der the N atur al G as A ct. W e are now bac k be for e the Co urt o f A ppe als. The case was recently argued, and we will await the Court's decision. Th e C om m iss io n's O C SL A ju ris di cti on ha s re ce nt ly b ee n c all ed in to qu es tio n b y a federal court. The Comm ission had adopted a rule that imposed a reporting requirement on OCS pipeline operators. We based the decision on the OCSLA's requirement that OCS pipelines may not discriminate in granting access to their pipelines. We reasoned that i t is po ssib le to s et tra nsp orta tion rates at su ch a hig h lev el as to p reclu de a cce ss,   -8which would be discriminatory and unlawful. The court did not buy our rationale and struck what could be a mortal blow to any regulatory oversight of OCS activities based on the O CS LA . I think w e sho uld ap peal. In conclusion, it is my view that under virtually any economic scenario, the long term future for natural gas appears very bright. The Comm ission is committed to completing the transition to seamless electric markets based upon the RTO platform, and this should provide significant trading opportunities for gas fired generation. There is a clear focus o n infrastructure issue s for both g as and elec tricity markets, and we are com mitted to issuin g certif icates in a time ly fashion for p rojects th at are in the pu blic interest. In the nine years I have been at the Commission, our focus has been on making markets work for consumers. We have had some setbacks, and we must heed the lessons that arise from crisis, bu t our fo cus re main s the sa me. T he m ain thin g is to k eep th e ma in thin g th e m ain th ing .

Burrql Kevin R Weir,"" and Earl C. Redman INTRODUCTION This report presents geochemical analyses from 516 stream-sediment, 29 pan-concentrate, and 1439 rock samples collected in the Haines-RI&wan-Porcupine area (fig. l), treats the results statisticialIy, and discusses various elemental concentrations and anomalies. The report is part of a cooperative project between the Alaska Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys (DGGS) and the U.S. Bureau of Mines (USBM) to evaluate the mineral resources of the Skagway subdistrict of the Juneau mining district. Samples were collected analyses have been reported (1984), Still and others (19X5), (1989), but a small amount of during 1981-1988, previously by Still Gilbert and others new analytical data with most being collected during 1984-1987. Most of these (1984a, 1984b), StiIl and others (1984), Redman and others (1987, 1988), Gilbert (1988), StilI (1988), and StiIl and others is also included in the report.  To evaulate the mineral resource potential of the Haines-Khrkwan-Porcupine area this report should be used with its companion report, ""Economic geology of Haines-ICI&wan-Porcupine area"" (Ah&a Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys Report of Investigations 91-4) by StiU and others (1991) and with the discussion of the study-area geology by Gilbert and others (1991). PREVIOUS WORK Geochemical studies in the Haines-Klukwan-Porcupine area previous to this cooperative study include analyses of Haines and Klukwan ultramafic rocks by Robertson (1956) and geochemical sample results from the Skagway B-3 and ChiIkat Peninsula areas by Winkler and MacKevett (1970), MacKevett (1971), and MacKevett and others (1974). Reconnaissance hydrogeochemical and stream-sediment analyses from the study area are reported as part of the National Uranium Resource Evaluation Program U.S. Department of Energy (US DOE, 1981). Geochemical analyses from the adjacent area east of the study area are reported by Gilbert and others (1990), and from the adjacent area to the south by Brew and others (1978). METHODOLOGY This report includes geochemical analyses from most mineral occurrences within the Haines-KIukwanPorcupine area and from reconnaissance stream-sediment, pan-concentrate, bedrock float, and bedrock samples collected during geologic mapping and prospect and deposit evaluation (see StiU and others, 1989, for sampling and processing techniques). Most geochemical analyses from the study-area deposits and prospects are reported in the companion to this report (Still and others, 1991). Although there is a concentration of stream-sediment samples from known placer areas in the western part of the study area, an effort was made to provide sample coverage for ah accessible drainages within the study area, However, bedrock float and bedrock samples are strongly biased toward samples that exhibited iron staining or visible sulfides. Multiple samples were commonly collected at mineralized localities. This report includes analyses for gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, cobalt, and barium (tables 1-4)4, although some samples, primarily from plutonic rocks, were analyzed for molybdenum (table 5). Some samples collected within areas containing ultramatic rocks were also analyzed for piatinum and palladium (table 6).

Copper, lead, zinc, and cobalt were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma analysis and barium by X-ray flourescence.  Four different laboratories processed the samples presented in this report, Samples collected during 198183 and some samples collected during 1984 were analyzed by the USBM, Reno Research Center, Nevada.  3   Most of the remaining 1984 samples were analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy in the DGGS Geochemistry Laboratory in Fairbanks for gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, cobalt, and molybdenum, Some 1984 samples from the Porcupine area were analyzed for gold (by fire assay) and for barium (by X-ray fluorescence) by Bondar-Clegg, Inc., Lakewood, Colorado. Most samples collected during 198588 were analyzed by Bondar-Clegg. For these samples, gold was analyzed by fire assay; silver, copper, lead, zinc, cobalt and molybdenum by atomic-absorption spectroscopy; and barium by X-ray flourescence. A few samples (mainly of plutonic rocks) collected during 1984-87 were analyzed by X-Ray Assay Laboratories, Ontario, Canada. Gold was analyzed by fire assay - direct-current plasma analysis, silver by direct-current plasma analysis, and copper, lead, zinc, cobalt, barium, and molybdenum by X-ray flourescence.  ANOMALIES Anomaly threshold levels for gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, cobalt, and barium were determined by a combination of factors. Because only a few samples were analyzed for molybdenum, platinum, and palladium, anomaly thresholds were not calculated for these elements. The primary statistical tools used to determine threshold levels for anomalous values were univariate statistics and histograms of analytical value versus frequency of occurrence. These histograms (figs. 2-15) Sallow rapid visual inspection for significant breaks and tailing out of values; they can also be compared with histograms from previous studies made to the south of the study area, in the Alexander Terrane (Brew and others, 1978) and the Taku Terrane (Grybeck and others, 1984). Because samples were derived from different geologic terranes and rock types, stream-sediment and panconcentrate samples were segregated into two groups those from the metamorphic-plutonic Alexander terrane south and west of the Chilkat fault (Porcupine area), and those from the plutonic-volcanic Taku terrane north and east of the Chilkat fault (Haines-Klukwan area) (Monger and Berg, 1987). Anomalous values of streamsediment samples were selected from natural breaks that generally fell between the 95th and 98th percentile on the histograms (table 1). Bedrock samples were segregated into 11 major lithologic types within the two terranes (table 1). Because of the strong bias of bedrock samples toward mineralized specimens, anomalous bedrock values were generally selected on the basis of natural breaks at the upper end of the distribution of values (table 1). Thirty-five percent of all bedrock samples are anomalous in one or more elements, and most bedrock sample anomalies would be considered ""highly anomalous"" when compared to similar studies that have identified ""weakly anomalous"" and ""distinctly"" or ""highly anomalous"" values (Grybeck and others, 1984; Still and others, 1989). Bedrock float samples were not included in calculation of bedrock anomalies, and most would be anomalous in one or more elements when compared with in-place bedrock samples. As source indicators, bedrock float samples are plotted together with stream-sediment and pan-concentrate samples on sheet 1. Because of the variation between individual laboratories and between analytical methods, there is considerable variation in detection limits within the sample population. However, lower detection limits for all elements analyzed, except gold, were far below anomaly threshold levels. Lower detection limits for gold varied from 0.001 to 0.1 ppm; thus, the threshold anomaly level for gold was arbitrarily set at 0.1 ppm for all samples, This level is higher than generally calculated for gold, and readers should examine tables 2-4 when assessing gold potential in the study area.  STREAM-SEDIMENT SAMPLES In both the Porcupine and Haines-Klukwan parts of the study area about 6 percent of the stream-sediment samples are anomalous in gold (0.1 ppm or above). Anomalous samples are scattered throughout the study 5Histogramn are on pages 58-75.   area, with minor concentrations in the Shakyseyi Creek area in the southern Takshanuk Mountains and near the Road Cut prospect on the Chilkat Peninsula (Still and others, 1991). However, there is a concentration of detected but nonanomalous gold from drainages with known placer production in the Porcupine area and near the Road Cut prospect on the Chilkat Peninsula (table 2, sheet 1). The Porcupine area contains elevated background silver values when compared with the Haines-Klukwan area, resulting in significantly different anomalous threshold values in the two parts of the study area (fig. 3, table 1). In the Porcupine are, silver anomalies are generally scattered throughout the known placer-producing drainages, whereas the Haines-Klukwan area has a concentration of anomalies on the Chilkat Peninsula (table 2, sheet 1). The Haines-Klukwan area exhibits significantly higher background copper values than the Porcupine area (fig. 4). Although widely scattered throughout the study area, anomalies tend to be concentrated in creeks in the Haines-Klukwan area that drain mafic metavolcanic bedrock (Gilbert and others, 1991) (table 2, sheet 1). Lead is slightly elevated in stream-sediment samples in the Porcupine area compared to the Haines Klukwan area (fig. 5). Fourteen of seventeen lead anomalies are from the Klehini and upper Tsirku River drainages in the Porcupine area (table 2, sheet 1). Compared to the Haines-Klukwan area, the Porcupine area has significantly elevated zinc values; its threshold zinc anomaly level is four times higher (table 1, fig. 6). About 10 percent of stream-sediment samples from the Porcupine area are anomalous in zinc. Zinc anomalies are concentrated in streams that drain finegrained, argillaceous Paleozoic rocks (Gilbert and others, 1991) (table 2, sheet 1). Cobalt concentrations from stream-sediment samples from the Porcupine and Haines-Klukwan parts of the study area are similar (fig. 7). Four percent of samples from the Porcupine area (mainly in the Klehini and upper Tsirku River drainages) are anomalous in cobalt, whereas about one percent from the Haines-Klukwan area are anomalous. About one-half of the stream-sediment and pan-concentrate samples in the study area were analyzed for barium. Background barium values and anomaly threshold values are higher in the Porcupine area than in the Haines-Klukwan area (table 1, fig. 8). All barium anomalies are located in the Klehini and upper Tsirku River drainages in the Porcupine area (table 2, sheet 1). BEDROCK SAMPLES  Bedrock geochemical samples were separated into 11 lithologic catagories, five found only in the Porcupine area (Alexander terrane), four found only in the Haines-U&wan area (Taku terrane), and two found in both parts of the study area but located mainly in the Porcupine area (figs. 9-15). The strong bias of bedrock geochemical samples toward samples displaying mineralization has resulted in a bedrock population with average elemental values far above normal background levels and threshold anomaly levels above those previously calculated for these samples (Still and others, 1989). In the Haines-Klukwan-Porcupine area, 68 of 8% bedrock samples (about 8 percent) are anomalous (above 0.1 ppm) in gold (table 4, figs. 9a-b). In the Haines-Klukwan area, however, about 28 percent of bedrock samples are anomalous in gold, primarily from mafic volcanic rocks and quartz veins in the southern Takshanuk Mountains the Chilkat Peninsula (table 4, sheet 2). Bedrock samples from the Haines-Klukwan area are twice as likely to be anomalous in silver as those from the Porcupine area, largely because of the numerous mineralized quartz veins and plutonic rocks there (table 4, sheet 2, fig. lob). In the Porcupine area the average background concentration of silver in argillaceous rocks is high, but quartz veins and carbonate-skarn samples yielded most of the silver anomalies (fig. lOa, table 4, sheet 2).  5   Background copper levels are higher for all lithologies in the Haines-Klukwan area than those in the Porcupine area (figs. lla-b, table l), and samples from Haines-Klukwan are three times as likely to be anomalous in copper. Samples anomalous in copper in the Haines-Klukwan area are primarily from quartz veins, plutonic rocks, and basalt (fig. llb, table 4, sheet 2). Background lead levels are slightly higher for rocks from the Porcupine area than for the Haines-Klukwan area; 40 of the 65 samples anomalous in lead are from the Porcupine area (figs. 12a-b, table 1). A large proportion of lead anomalies are from samples of felsic volcanic rocks and quartz veins (table 4, sheet 2). Most lithologies from the Porcupine area exhibit markedly higher zinc background levels than do samples from the Haines-Klukwan area (figs. 13a-b, table 1). Except for ultramafic rocks in the Haines-Klukwan area, zinc anomalies are found in all litholgies (table 4, sheet 2). There is little noticeable difference in background cobalt levels between samples from the Porcupine and Haines-Klukwan areas (table 1, figs. 14a-b). However, 68 of 70 samples anomalous in cobalt are scattered amoung various lithologies in the Porcupine area (table 4, sheet 2). Seventy-seven percent of bedrock samples in the Haines-Klukwan-Porcupine area were analyzed for barium. Barium concentrations are elevated in felsic volcanic rocks, chert, and, in particular, argillaceous rocks from the Porcupine area (figs. 15a-b, table 1). Thirty-four of 36 samples anomalous in zinc are found in various lithologies in the Porcupine area (table 4, sheet 2).  CONCLUSION The southern and western parts of the study area (Porcupine area) is underlain by metamorphic and plutonic rocks of the Alexander terrane and yields stream-sediment values higher in silver, lead, zinc, and barium than the northern and eastern parts of the study area. Bedrock samples in this area are also relatively enriched in lead, zinc, and barium. Stream-sediment and bedrock samples from the northern and eastern parts of the study area (Haines-Klukwan area), which is part of the volcanic-plutonic Taku terrane, are relatively enriched in copper. No clear diffference in gold and cobalt concentrations between the two terranes is suggested by stream-sediment-sample analyses, but a high proportion of bedrock samples samples from the Haines-Klukwan area are anomalous in gold and silver. The Porcupine area produces most bedrock samples anomalous in cobalt.

Picolo Regional Director Doyle Jourdan Mr. Wayne Nesmith  Honorable Jeb Bush Governor President John McKay Florida Senate Speaker Tom Feeney Florida House of Representatives  Dear Governor Bush, President McKay, and Speaker Feeney: On behalf of Florida's Domestic Security Oversight Board, and pursuant to 943.0311, F.S., I am pleased to submit the enclosed Annual Report detailing Florida's domestic security progress to date. Our funding request for the 2003-2004 Fiscal Year will be formally transmitted on December 1, 2002. Vice President Dick Cheney recently lauded Florida's comprehensive response, calling it ""...a model of how homeland security coverage should operate at the state level,"" and ""...a security network that is a model for our states and communities all across the country."" Such praise speaks volumes about the hard work, dedication, and commitment of hundreds of public safety professionals throughout the state. The achievements we have made reflect upon a journey that has seen a collective effort and an unflinching cooperative spirit. Florida has made significant progress in providing training and equipment to thousands of first responders. We have expanded intelligence and information sharing networks, forging new communication channels with our federal counterparts and maximizing technology to share intelligence with our state and local law enforcement partners. We have increased health lab capacities across the state, and have improved our ability to identify and track bio-terrorism threats. We have raised the bar for security at our deepwater seaports, and we are adding new layers of protection at our highway interdiction stations. Each day, our state rises to a new level of readiness. I thank you for your continued support, guidance, and leadership in our state security matters. We look forward to continuing our work to help make Florida safer. Sincerely,  James T. Moore, Chairman Florida Domestic Security Oversight Board Commissioner, Florida Department of Law Enforcement  Craig Fugate, Vice Chairman Florida Domestic Security Oversight Board Director, Division of Emergency Management   D OM ESTI C SECURI TY I N FLORI D A: N ove m be r 2 0 0 2 Annua l Re por t TABLE OF CON TEN TS  Pa ge 1 .

Hurricanes, and t he st at e's preparat ions and response t o t hem, have proven Florida's leadership in t he f ield of disast er operat ions. The st at e's emergency management operat ions are of t en used as an example of how t o cope wit h nat ural cat ast rophes, such as t ornadoes, t ropical cyclones, and wildf ires, t hat might impact a st at e. For years Floridians have t aken j ust if iable pride in t heir abilit y t o overcome, as well as could be planned f or and expect ed, t he worst t hat nat ure might visit t hem. Then, on t he 11th day of Sept ember, 2001, t his nat ion endured a horrif ically moment ous milest one wit h t he at t acks in New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Though t he enemy assault s on our count ry occurred a t housand miles away f rom t his st at e, Florida would soon learn t hat she was not immune f rom t he t errorist s. Floridians were st unned t o f ind out t hat t hirt een of t he ninet een Sept ember 11th at t ackers had lived in, t ransit ed t hrough, or t rained f or t heir deadly missions wit hin Florida's borders in t he mont hs and years prior t o t he massacres. Floridians would also quickly f eel t error of a dif f erent kind right inside t heir own st at e--bio-t errorism in t he f orm of ant hrax. Thus, in t he early aut umn of 2001, government leaders at every level in t he st at e of Florida had t o reevaluat e t heir priorit ies and plans. The most f undament al and awesome responsibilit y of elect ed and appoint ed leaders t hat govern our cit izens - prot ect ing t he very lives of our people f rom a rut hless enemy willing t o do anyt hing t o kill Americans had been brought out in st ark, graphic det ail. Florida' Govern st at e's privat e s response was swif t and cert ain. I mmediat ely f ollowing t he at t acks, Florida or Jeb Bush issued Execut ive Order # 01-262, declaring a St at e of Emergency. The Emergency Operat ions Cent er was act ivat ed, securit y height ened at key public and f acilit ies, and 24-hour int elligence and invest igat ive ef f ort s begun.  Just days lat er came a second order, t his one direct ing FDLE and t he Division of Emergency Management t o j oint ly conduct a comprehensive assessment of Florida's capabilit y t o prevent , mit igat e and respond t o a t errorist at t ack. Wit hin t he week, several hundred subj ect mat t er expert s converged in Tallahassee t o work around t he clock in f our workgroups based on t he St at e's exist ing emergency support f unct ions: Emergency Services, Human Services, Crit ical I nf rast ruct ure, and Public I nf ormat ion and Awareness.

As part of this effort, MAG conducted a series of focus groups to identify and document transportation issues and concerns. The focus groups were held throughout the Valley to capture ideas from geographically and ethnically diverse groups of participants. The find ings will assist MAG in identifying regional values, goals, and objectives that will guide the development of the Regional Transportation Plan. The format of the Focus Groups included an opportunity for interactive discussion among participants, as well as a voting exercise that provided insight on priorities. To help structure the process, the discussions were organized into five topics areas. The topics included:      Demographic and Social Change; The New E con omy; Environmental and Resource Issues; Land Use and Urban Development; and Tran spo rta tio n an d Te chn olo gy.  Participants were encouraged to provide their own issues and concerns that related to each topic, both individually and in a roundtable discussion. The responses received were documented in essentially a ""verbatim"" format so that the message intended by the participant was accurately conveyed. The results of the Ahwatukee/Guadalupe/Tempe Focus Group are attached. This material has been divided into three parts as follows:  3  MAG R  EGIONA L  T RANSPORTATION P LAN F OCUS G ROUP R ESULTS A UGUST 2001   A  HWATUKEE  /GUADALUPE /T  EMPE  F  OCUS  GROUP  Part I.

When the mill shut down each winter, Falk residents had t o b e self sufficient. They planted orchards and garde n s, and preserved their harvests to sustain the m through the winter. The land along the trail had been cleared and used for agricultural purposes, so many of the original tre e r e -sprouts you now see are less than 20 years old.  1  R e mn a n ts o f giant re dwoods a re found along t he trail. They wer e logged as early as 150 years ago. Notice the large notch at the top of th e stump. Sawyers u sed giant 2-person handsaws to cut the trees, a s they had no chain saws in those days. The notches held spring boards for the sawyers to stand on while cutting. The loggers worked all day to cut one t r e e d own. They earned about $3 a day. Th e younger t r e es forming the circular pattern around the la r ge stump are actually sprouts originating from the stump.  3  concentrated the site was ghost town. the mill was  This is the site of t he Falk mill. Houses and the cookhouse stretched along the hillside. This area held the town's population of 400 people. When abandoned it became a virtual Some of the timber used to build salvaged.  5  The train was used not only to haul lumber for the mill, but it was the primary means of transportation for families to take shopping excursions, to send children to school, and for the residents to go into town to socialize.

Charlie was reputed to chase off trespassers with a rock salt-loaded shotgun.  2  Behind th e alder grove is a large l o g pol e o n which is nailed a piece of wood. This is the remnant of a trestle. Trestles were used as bridges to cross the rivers or mainta in level grades for the railroad. Leaning up aga in st the hillside is an intact portion of t h is trestle.

GX265-87-7398017	"Chapter Five  Advance Planning  F inancial Matters  A.  Pl anning for Everyday Financial Matters After Inca pac ity 1. Current law  The common law of agency has long permitted a perso n with ca pacity, as p rincipal, to vest an other, as a gent, with the power to conduct business transactions on the principal's behalf. Under the commo n law, however, these powers of attorney became ineffective if the principal lost capa city.1 They were thus unsuitable as a device for preventing financial disruption in the event of long-term incapa city. Co nsequ ently, a new statutory tool was created: the durable power of attorney (DPA). Under Maryland law, a DPA is defined as ""a power of attorney by which a principal designates another as an attorney in fact or agent and the a utho rity is exercisable notwithstanding the p rincipa l's sub seq uen t disab ility or inca pac ity.""2 A DP A is sur ely a valu ab le p la nnin g to ol for a pers on wit h e arly A D. T he com bin atio n o f a w elldrafted DPA and a well-chosen agent can assure that income will be managed an d bills paid after the indivi dual is no longer able to handle these financia l m atters pers ona lly.  55   2.  Prepr inted forms  In rea lity, ... man y peo ple are likely to fill out a DPA form obtained from a stationery store, the Internet, or some other sour ce. W hile ther e is nothing inherently wrong with the use of a stock form for this purpose, the danger  especially for someo ne w hose capa city for processing complex material may be diminished  is that the individual will sign the form and grant an agent broad authority without sufficiently understanding the consequences of the action.  Ideally, som eo ne with ea rly A D w ill obta in legal and, if need be, fi na nc ia l plan nin g a ssis tan ce in preparing a DPA , so that th e D PA can be ta ilored to the pers on's individu al ne eds . In rea lity, howeve r, many pe op le a re lik ely to fill out a D PA form obtained from a statione ry store, the Internet, or some other source. W hile there is no thing inhe re ntly wro ng w ith the use of a stock form for this purpo se, the d ang er  es pe cia lly for som eon e wh ose cap acity for processing complex m ate rial ma y be diminished  is that the individual will sign the form and grant an agent broad auth ority without sufficie ntly understanding the consequences of the action. In several states, legislatively requir ed disclosu re statements help address this problem (Calvo 2002 ). Two years ag o, a bill wa s intr od uc ed in the Maryland Se nate to ac hieve this res ult. In addition to other provisions on powers of attorney not relevant here, Senate Bill 105 of 2001 would have required pre prin ted D PA forms to include a specified notice, de scri bing the purpose and scope of a DPA and urg in g the rea de r to c on sid er g ettin g h elp : ""If the re is anything about this d ocum ent that you do not understand, you should ask a lawy er t o exp lain it to you ."" Senate Bill 105 would also have re quired a preprinted DPA to include substantive provisions specifying the ba sic fiduciary duties of the agent. The bill faile d in com m ittee; i t is not clear whether any of the opposition in the committee focused on t he disclosure provision. RECOMMENDATION 5-1: Th e General As se m bly should enact legislation requiring preprinted dura ble power of attorney forms (other than those used by la wye rs o r fina nc ial ins titutio ns under circumstances that allow for personal explanation of the document's significance) to c on tain a p lain ly  56   worded disclosure about the effect of executing the doc um ent.  B.  Planning for the Cost of Future Care: LongTerm Care Insurance 1. Current law  One important issue about long-term care insurance is whether consumers understand the nature of the insuran ce, its costs and lim itations, and its relation to other aspects of personal financial planning.  As of Janua ry 28, 200 3, 52 insu rers we re approved to offer individual long-term care insurance po licie s in Maryland.3 Long -term c are po licies are subject to a comprehensive set of regulations, adopted by the Maryland Insuranc e Adm inistration to reflect model regulations of the National Association of Insurance Comm issioners.4 These regulations offer a variety of protections. A long-term care policy, for example, may not impose a ""limit or exclusion for Alzheimer's diseas e or se nile de m en tia diso rder s."" 5 Other provisions in th e regulations broa dly be nefit bo th pe ople with AD and others with serious chronic disease. For example, the regulations requ ire tha t insur ers o ffer a h om e he alth care ben e fit and set certain minimum standards that might foster the kind of in-hom e care tha t m os t pe op le prefer. 6 One impo rtant issue abou t long-term care insurance is whether consumers und ers tand the nature of the insurance, its cos ts and limitations, and its relatio n to other aspects of personal financial planning. W hile ma ny con sum ers will find long-term care insurance to be a valuable tool for protecting the ir assets, espe cially if a policy is purchased when they are com para tively young and premiums a re affordable,  57   long-term care insurance is by no means t he be st ch oice in all circumstances. Consequently, potentia l purch asers need access to reliable, u nd ers tan da ble information to help them decide. One strategy for financing long-term housing and health care n eeds is moving to a continuing care retirement com m un ity (C CR C). A CCRC provides housing, meals, recreational and other amenities, transportation , and health care services, usua lly at a single campus. A CCRC allows ""aging in place."" To this end, the Insurance Administra tion 's regulations req uire de live ry of a b uye r's gu ide to prospective ap plica nts , the form at o f wh ich is developed by the Nation al Association of Insurance Co mm issioners or approved by the Maryland Insura n ce Com miss ioner. 7 The regulations also require insurers to use a standa rdized d isclosure form titled ""Things You Should Know Before You Buy LongTe rm Ca re Ins uran ce,"" which, coupled with a personal wo rksh eet, is inten ded to ena ble pros pective purch asers to de cide whe th er l ong -term c are insurance is suitable for them.8 In light of the Insurance Administration's com prehe nsive regulator y regime, we offer no recommendations abo ut Sta te reg ulato ry po licy with respect to long-term care insurance and AD.9  C.  Planning to ""Age in Place"": Continuing Care Retirement Commu nities 1. Current law  One strategy for financing long-term hous ing and hea lth care needs is moving to a con tinuing ca re retirement community (CCRC). A CCRC provides housing, me als, re crea tiona l and othe r am eniti es , transportation, and health care services , usu ally at a sin gle campus. A CCRC allows ""aging in plac e."" That is, assuming that a CCRC is finan cia lly stable and well-managed, its continuum of care enables a healthy  58   older perso n to en ter a com mu nity a nd liv e in de pe nd en tly as long as possible, with assurance tha t necessary medical and o ther care will be ava ilab le in the event of AD or other disabling co nd it ion (Ma rtin 2000; Sanders 1997). One st udy has shown that CCRCs with pr ep aid lon g-te rm car e co vera ge ho ld down use of nursing home services, even after controlling for poten tially conf ounding factors (Sloan, Sha yne, an d Co nove r 1995 ). Th ere are 31 CCRCs in Maryland.10 The financing arrang em ents vary wid ely. One CCRC, for example, indicates that its entrance fees range from $75,000 to more than $200,000; the fees are refu nd ab le only on a prorated basis until four years of residen cy, whe n they a re no lon ger r efundable a t all. Th is type o f ""extensive"" contract ensures that an ind ividu al's future health care need s will be met regardless of ava ilab le resources at the time of need, be cau se the c osts are p aid o n be half o f all resid ents from the pooled entrance fees. Under other contractual arrangements, the entrance fee wo uld be lower or fully refundable, but some health care and related services w ould re m ain paya ble on an individual fee-for-service basis. W hatever the particulars of the funding arra nge m ent, the objectives of som eon e de ciding to live in a CCRC are thwarted if the CCRC bec om es inso lvent. Preventing insolvency is a ke y element of Sta te regulatory policy. By statute, anyone who seeks t o operate a CCRC must, among other registratio n requirements, sub m it a feasibility study for approval by the D epa rtm ent of Aging.11 Th e D epa rtme nt is to app rove the study only if it is satisfied that the provider has ""a reasonable f inan cial pla n"" co vering both development of the CC RC and its ongoing operation;  Wh atever the particulars of the funding arrangement, the objectives of someone deciding to live in a CCRC are thwarted if the CC RC becom es insolvent. Preventing insolvency is a key elem ent of State regulatory policy.  59   a ""market for the facility appe ars to exist""; and an autho ritative a ctuarial forecast ""supports the projections fo r the p rojec t.""12 Re gis tratio n re ne wa ls require updated projections. 13 Providers are also required to meet certain requirements for operating reserves.14 In addition, the registration statute, as implemented in the Department's regulations,15 provides oversight of a CCRC 's contracts and advertising ma te rials.16 Further, the statute specifies the elem ents of a d isclos ure s tatem ent to prosp ective resid ents of a CCRC and provides for the De pa rtm en t's review of the sta t em ent. 17 The se are important safeguards for so sub stan tial an in vestm ent. Ma rylan d's CC RC statute was amended recen tly, in 2002.18 W hile it is alw ays po ssib le to iden tify ways in which a consumer protection regime might be strengthened, the Attorney General's Office does not have policy recommendations at this time.  The statute specifies the elements of a disclosure statement to prospective residents of a CCRC and provides for the Department's review of the statement. These are important safeguards for so substantial an investm ent.  References Calvo, J.C. 2002. ""Reforming Durable Power of Attorney Statutes to Combat Financial Exploitation of the Elderly.""

EH-41 Performance Report for Fiscal Year 1998 This report presents a brief overview of the fiscal year 1998 (FY 1998) activities and accomplishments of the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Office of Environmental Policy and Assistance (EH-41). EH-41 is within the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Environment (EH-4) under the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Environment, Safety and Health (EH). The following pages (a) describe the measures used to gauge EH-41's performance for the Department and its stakeholders and (b) demonstrate the office's effectiveness in meeting those measures during FY 1998. Performance measures for EH41's activities are founded on the office's mission functions, which can be categorized into three interrelated areas: Regulatory Interface. To monitor emerging regulatory requirements and issues and lead the Department in developing and advocating DOE's position on those requirements and issues to avert potential environmental protection and compliance problems. Policy and Guidance. To develop Departmentwide environmental policies, regulations, orders, technical standards, and guidance to protect workers, the public, and the environment and to comply with environmental requirements. Management Support. To assist DOE program and field offices in interpreting and implementing environmental policies and requirements and developing strategies to resolve compliance issues. These mission functions and performance measures are indicative of the wide diversity of skills and resources available from EH-41 to assist in the Department's dealings with environmental policy and regulatory issues.  The office has been led admirably by Raymond F. Pelletier, EH-41 Director for several years, including part of FY 1998. A tribute to Mr. Pelletier's leadership and management prowess is evidenced by the continued effectiveness of EH-41, following his departure, in areas critical to the Department's environmental program. EH-41 coordinates and provides its services through the two following divisions:  4 4  Air, Water, and Radiation Division, EH-412, Andrew Wallo, III, Director; and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)/Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) Division, EH-413, Thomas T. Traceski, Director.  A complete listing of EH-41 staff members, including their responsibilities, telephone numbers, and e-mail addresses, is outlined on the following page in Table 1.

Regulatory Interface Federal Environmental Regulations-- Responding Proactively for DOE EH-41 serves as the corporate resource within DOE for developing positions on environmentrelated rulemakings proposed by other Federal agencies that may impact DOE programs or operations. The office monitors the development of significant rulemakings, solicits and considers the views of all of the Department's program offices and field organizations with regard to a proposed regulation, and develops a consolidated Departmental response. Direct coordination with affected DOE elements is conducted to ensure that comments and concerns submitted to the applicable regulatory agency reflect the needs and interests of the entire complex. Thereafter, the office is the lead advocate for DOE's position in any further communications or interactions with the regulatory agency. EH-41 also (1) performs scientific and technical reviews of draft standards and documents prepared by other Federal agencies and national/international organizations, (2) determines the potential impacts of proposed environmental legislation on DOE, and (3) represents the Department in various interagency and international standard-setting efforts of relevance to DOE. In FY 1998 the office monitored more than 300 regulations, standards, policy statements, and guidance documents that may affect DOE operations and programs. On their own initiative or in response to requests, EH-41 reviewed numerous draft/proposed rules and standards on the Department's behalf and submitted 15 sets of written comments to regulatory agencies. Listed in Table 2 (see pages 4-8) by environmental statute are several examples of regulatory initiatives and the actions EH-41 took in FY 1998 to positively influence them so as to benefit and/or minimize impacts to DOE's environmental compliance and protection activities.  Federal Technical, Legislative, and Executive Reviews The office also reviews and comments, in response to both internal and external requests, on technical reports, draft legislation, and Presidential Executive Orders (EOs). EH-41 submitted comments on 16 such documents during FY 1998. Examples of EH-41's activities in these areas during the year are highlighted below.  Technical Reviews  4  Submitted extensive comments to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on its draft Institutional Controls: A Reference Manual. As DOE moves to remedy selection, design, and implementation at its cleanup sites, the consideration of various types of institutional controls will become an integral part of the remedial alternatives analysis for many DOE sites. Provided comments and recommendations to EPA on its draft Federal Guidance Report No. 13, Health Risks from Low-level Environmental Exposure to Radionuclides, Part 1, Interim Version, the availability of which was announced in the Federal Register (FR) of April 13, 1998 (63 FR 18008). Coordinated with the Office of Technical Services (EM-37) in providing DOE comments and suggestions to the staff of the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors (CRCPD) regarding a possible task plan to provide technical input on DOE's Radiation Control Criteria Project. Along with the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Environmental Restoration (EM-40), represented DOE in an interagency review, with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and EPA, of a draft International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safety guide titled Strategies and Protocols for the Safe Management of Waste from the Mining and Milling of Uranium and Thorium Ores. EH-41 submitted DOE and NRC comments to the IAEA on April 28, 1998. (text continues on page 9)  4  4  4  3  EH-4 1 Perf orm ance Report   Table 2.

Responded to EPA's request for DOE review and comment on its draft report concerning the need for a rule requiring the certification of recycling and recovery equipment for halons, which are used throughout DOE for fire protection. EH-41's comments indicated that the report findings amply demonstrate that such a rule is not warranted.  Reviewed, for EH-4, the proposed EO entitled Deference to Indian Tribal Governments. The Office of the Assistant General Counsel for General Law (GC-80) had solicited comments from program offices in order to respond to OMB's request for DOE's views on the proposed EO. Provided comments to the Office of Pollution Prevention (EM-77) and GC on proposed EO, Recycling, Waste Prevention, and Environmentally Preferable Acquisition, which would revise EO 12873, Federal Acquisition, Recycling, and Waste Prevention. The comments focused on several definitions that differ from regulatory definitions and could cause confusion among Federal facilities. Submitted DOE comments to EPA on proposed revisions to EO 12856, Federal Compliance with Right-to-Know Laws and Pollution Prevention Requirements.  4  Legislative Reviews  4  4  Provided comments to the Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Legislation (GC-71) on a draft letter from the Departments of the Interior (DOI), Commerce, and Agriculture to the House Commerce Committee Chairman. The letter provided the Administration's position on a July 23, 1997, committee proposal to amend the Natural Resource Damages (NRD) title of CERCLA. Upon direct request from the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ)/DOI workgroup leader on natural resource damage assessment (NRDA) issues, provided input on proposed CERCLA language for "" protection of the environment."" Upon request, provided GC-71 with extensive comments on a draft Senate bill to amend RCRA by adopting the Environmental Restoration, Improvement, and Cleanup Acceleration Act of 1998. Reviewed EPA's draft specifications for RCRA legislation and provided GC-71 with comments. OMB had asked DOE for its reaction to the draft. Provided the Office of the General Counsel (GC) with comments on an EPA letter to U.S. Senator Lieberman that presented the agency's position under CERCLA regarding the adequacy of NRC's standards on decommissioning in 10 CFR 20.  Interagency and International Regulatory Standards Development EH-41 actively engages in discussions and standard development initiatives with other Federal agencies on issues and challenges of importance to the Department's environmental program. The office's experience is also sought out by international organizations. Summarized in Table 3 (see pages 10-12) are some of these activities, including their significance to DOE and EH-41's role in them.  4  4  Additional Interagency Regulatory Development Activities Other significant interagency regulatory development activities that EH-41 played a part in during FY 1998 included:  4 4  4  Representing DOE in an initiative to develop the Multi-Agency Radiation Laboratory Protocols (MARLAP) Manual.

Examples of EH-41's activities in this area during FY 1998 are provided below.  4  4  Responded to two requests from EPA for information concerning data on non-liquid PCBs, which the agency needed to make a "" no unreasonable risk"" determination and complete the "" Use Authorization"" rule for non-liquid PCBs at 40 CFR 761.30(q). EH-41 conducted conference calls with EPA and Savannah River Site (SRS) representatives to clarify various issues associated with the request. Led the Department's participation in the development of Vice President Gore's Clean Water Action Plan (CWAP). Specifically, EH-41:   Pollution Prevention (P2)  Along with EM-77 met with EPA's Office of Federal Facilities Enforcement to discuss each agency's P2 initiatives, including EPA's plans for P2 goals after the year 2000 and their emphasis on attaining environmental compliance with P2 activities. EPA Federal Environmental Roundtable  Participated in several of EPA's monthly Federal Agency Environmental Roundtable meetings during the year. The meetings allow Federal agency representatives to hear presentations and receive up-to-date information from EPA offices on a wide range of issues related to environmental compliance at Federal facilities. Materials from these meetings are regularly distributed by EH-41 to DOE program and operations offices for their use and information. Defense CAA Issues  Attended the July and September 1998 meetings of DOD's CAA Services Steering Committee where discussion focused on current regulatory, legal, compliance, and implementation issues, most of which are relevant to DOE operations. Environmental Program Reinvention  Met with staff of DOD's Office of Environmental Security to discuss how DOD services were implementing the Reinventing Environmental Program. The purpose of the meeting was to evaluate the DOD program to determine potential opportunities for DOE programs. DOE NR and CERCLA Policy  At the September 1998 DOD Tri-Services Meeting on Ecological Risk Assessment, shared DOE's experiences with CERCLA NR trustees and the DOE policy on integrating NR concerns into environmental restoration response actions. DOE/EPA Interface  External Regulation of DOE Nuclear Safety  Met with EPA staff to discuss potential environmental issues related to the pilot study for the external regulation of nuclear safety at DOE facilities. The discussions focused on the DOE/EPA interface that may need consideration as part of the external regulation study.  4  4  represented DOE on the Watershed Work Group, which was formed to address the management of watersheds on Federal lands; assisted in reviewing and commenting on the Work Group's action plan; participated in interagency meetings to review drafts of the CWAP and discuss related activities; and provided input to a multiagency agreement on offering Federal technical assistance to state/local agencies in performing source water assessments for public water systems.  4      4    4  In response to an invitation from EPA's Office of Solid Waste, participated in a July 1998 roundtable discussion concerning the land disposal restrictions (LDR) program under RCRA. The "" LDR Roundtable II"" was part of an EPA reinvention initiative and served as a forum for discussing concerns and suggestions relative to the implementation of the LDR requirements.  4  4  Information Sharing and Strategizing EH-41 routinely interacts with representatives of other Federal agencies (e.g., EPA, NRC, DOD) to remain updated and "" brainstorm"" on the latest developments and ideas for environmental compli-  13  EH-4 1 Perf orm ance Report   International Representation  Radioactive Waste Management and Safety Standards EH-41's expertise in matters related to radioactive waste management and radiation protection are of use not only to DOE and other Federal agencies but to international organizations as well. During FY 1998, EH-41 represented the United States:  detailed but concise coverage of the latest ES&Hrelated rules and notices published in the FR. Departmental staff and the general public are able to view the Digest, including issues dating back several years, on the EH-41 Web site.  4  at the IAEA Radioactive Waste Advisory Committee meeting in Vienna, Austria, during the week of December 1, 1997. The meeting covered the status of future guidance documents and focused primarily on completing a requirements document and associated guidance document on performance assessments (PAs) for surface disposal. in meetings of the IAEA's Radioactive Waste Safety Standards Advisory Committee in Vienna, Austria, June 15-19, 1998. The meeting focused on the review of several documents pertaining to radioactive waste management and protection. Many of the documents were forwarded to NRC and EPA to allow them to provide input for EH-41's consideration before the meeting. One of the documents to be reviewed concerned a draft safety requirement on predisposal radioactive waste management, for which EH-41 provided extensive input for earlier versions of the document.  4  Regulatory Alerts Daily tracking of pertinent regulatory actions allows EH-41 to remain current on, and notify DOE personnel of, the latest environmental rulemakings and related notices having significance to Departmental operations. During FY 1998 the office announced more than 70 rules and notices to DOE staff. Many of the announcements were made available on the EH-41 Web site as well. (See page 19 for additional information on the EH-41 Web site.) Table 4 (see pages 15 and 16) provides a sample of the rules and notices, published in the FR, that EH-41 alerted DOE program and/or field offices of during FY 1998 via memorandum or electronic mail (e-mail). In addition, EH-41's Weekly Federal Register Digest continues to provide DOE personnel with  Fiscal Year 1998  14   Table 4.

Environmental Policy and Guidance EH-41 benefits DOE environmental policy and standard development activities, both as a competent lead office and a knowledgeable source of assistance on various Departmental initiatives and directives. The office also prepares guidance for DOE and contractor staff on new or changing environmental requirements. In FY 1998 EH-41 provided more than 40 environmental guidance documents, including manuals, regulatory bulletins, information briefs, memoranda, and electronic guidance materials. Additionally, EH-41 continued to offer relevant environmental workshops to DOE and DOE contractor personnel and give presentations on important environmental issues. Information on the office's activities in these areas are presented below.  4 4  worked on refining the draft implementation guide, Evaluating Radiation Doses to Aquatic and Terrestrial Biota for Compliance with 10 CFR 834; actively participated in the DOE Environmental Radiation Control Coordinating Committee (ERCCC) to keep DOE personnel updated and in agreement regarding the standards and associated implementation guides; and met with representatives of the Defense Nuclear Facility Safety Board (DNFSB), the Federal oversight body for DOE nuclear facilities, to discuss the status and content of Part 834 and progress in resolving EPA's comments.  4  Order DOE 450.1 Proposed Order DOE 450.1, Environmental Protection Management Program, is intended to replace Order DOE 5400.1. Among other things, the purpose of this Order is to establish environmental protection requirements to ensure that all Department elements manage DOE property and conduct DOE activities in a manner that is protective of public health and the environment. A primary component of the proposed Order is the requirement to develop an Environmental Protection Management Program (EPMP) to address potential hazards to the public and environment. The EPMP is to be incorporated into DOE's missions and ISMS. EH-41 is preparing the Order for DOE, including drafting DOE M 450.1, Environmental Management Protection Program Manual, and DOE G 450.1, Implementation Guide for Use with Order DOE 450.1. The office worked on the development of the Order during FY 1998, including the solicitation and review of comments on drafts of the Order.  DOE Policy and Standard Development 10 CFR 834 Title 10 CFR 834, Radiation Protection of the Public and the Environment, is being developed by EH-41 to provide protection for the public and the environment from exposure to radiation from DOE operations. It is intended to codify and/or update provisions in Order DOE 5400.5, Radiation Protection of the Public and Environment, and Order DOE 5400.1, General Environmental Protection Program. [Proposed 10 CFR 834 was published for public review on March 25, 1993 (58 FR 16268), with a supplemental notice issued on February 22, 1996 (61 FR 6799). Associated implementation guides are also being developed.] During FY 1998 EH-41 continued working towards resolution of intra- and interagency comments regarding the draft final Part 834. Specifically, the office:  DOE Guide 450.4 EH-41 is serving on the writing team for the revision of DOE G 450.4, ISMS Guide, to clarify its intent and improve implementation of the DOE ISMS by appropriate personnel. (ISMS is in response to DNFSB Recommendation 95-2, concerning the safety management of DOE facilities and activities. The focus of ISMS is not solely on incorporating safety objectives  4  provided a written response to EPA comments on the draft final standards;  17  EH-4 1 Perf orm ance Report   into DOE operations management; equal emphasis is placed on health and environmental protection objectives as well.) During FY 1998 EH-41 submitted extensive comments on the guide, including those focusing on the integration and visibility of environmental protection, P2, environmental performance indicators, and EMSs within the ISM concept.  of applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements (ARARs) for CERCLA non-time critical removal actions.  P2 Policy EH-41 provided input to the development of the DOE P2 Policy Statement as part of its role on the Waste Reduction Steering Committee. The statement was released by the Secretary of Energy (S-1) on Earth Day in FY 1998. It confirms to DOE managers and employees the Department's commitment to P2 and specifically calls for P2 to become an essential part of DOE's ISMS.  Order DOE 435.1 Proposed Order DOE 435.1, Radioactive Waste Management, is being developed to update Departmental requirements on the proper management of radioactive wastes. [The draft Order was published for public review in the FR on August 6, 1998 (63 FR 42012).] EH-41 continued as a solid contributor to the development and review of the draft Order during FY 1998. The office conducted reviews of several versions of the draft Order and participated in several comment resolution meetings.  ES&H Policy The Secretarial policy statement on ES&H was issued on April 14, 1998. EH-41 provided assistance with respect to preparing the "" environment"" portion of the statement and gave extensive input to EH-5 in developing the definition of "" Serious Accident/Major Environmental Contamination"" within the policy statement.  Radiological Control Position EH-41 prepared Radiological Control Technical Position 97-E01 (RCTP 97-E01), the DOE/EH technical position on the appropriate descriptors of property containing residual radioactive materials that is released from DOE radiological control under the requirements of Order DOE 5400.5. The position was prepared in response to requests from a number of field and program offices for the appropriate description or label for property containing residual radioactive material that meets DOE authorized limits for release. The position was coordinated with GC and is consistent with proposed 10 CFR 834.  Biota Dose Assessment In late FY 1998 EH-41 established the Biota Dose Assessment Committee (BDAC), a technical standards topical committee under the DOE Technical Standards Program. BDAC assists in developing and promoting technical standards and associated guidance for DOE-wide application in assessing radiation doses to aquatic and terrestrial biota. It serves as a forum within DOE for obtaining technical assistance, discussing technical issues, and sharing lessons learned regarding biota dose standards and assessment methods.  ES&H and Facility Disposition The office assisted the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Nuclear and Facility Safety (EH-3) and the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Worker Health and Safety (EH-5) in developing DOE-STD-1120-98, Integration of Environment, Safety and Health into Facility Disposition Activities. EH-41 reviewed and commented on drafts of the standard and also developed an appendix for it on the identification  Guidance Documents EH-41 ensures that DOE and contractor staff are aware of the latest developments in environmental protection, cleanup, and management through the preparation of a variety of informative and helpful guidance materials. A guidance manual is a published document providing a comprehensive overview of environmental regulatory issues and the means of complying with them. A regulatory bulletin is a paper that provides an overview, including impacts to DOE, of a recent  Fiscal Year 1998  18   environmental rule. A Technical Assistance Project (TAP) report provides guidance or compliance assistance on a specific topic or issue, including actual or hypothetical compliance scenarios. An information brief is a two-to-four page document that discusses and provides answers to an environmental regulatory or compliance issue. A guidance memorandum contains or introduces attached guidance or compliance information in the environmental regulatory arena. Most EH-41 guidance documents are posted on the office's Web site to ensure wide access to the information. Please see Table 5 (pages 2023) for a listing of FY 1998 guidance documents. Unless marked with an asterisk, all of these guidance documents are available on the EH-41 Web site.  4 4 4 4  summaries of the major Federal environmental laws that affect DOE facilities and programs; environmental workshops developed or sponsored by EH-41, including on-line access to materials (e.g., slides, viewgraphs) from these workshops; environmental compliance data and reports on DOE facilities, both complex-wide and site-specific, compiled by EH-41; a forum Web page providing the opportunity to informally participate in open discussions on various environmental topics such as dose and risk assessments at DOE facilities and ARARs under CERCLA; and a "" focus area"" page with links to separate parts of the Web site providing detailed information on topics such as ODSs and DOE cultural resources management. During FY 1998 a focus area page called "" Envirosearch"" was added. It offers on-line retrieval of key environmental standards and requirements for: ecological benchmarks, PCBs, RCRA toxicity characteristic leaching procedures and LDRs, air emissions, and drinking water contaminants.  EH-41's Web Site Visitors to EH-41's Web site at http://tis.eh.doe.gov/oepa have at their disposal a well-organized and userfriendly system for accessing a wealth of environmental information and services. Since opening in 1994, the Web site has been visited by nearly 90,000 users. Besides the ability to view more than 1,400 environmental guidance documents and FR notices in portable document format (PDF), users are able to quickly find:  4  4  Additional Environmental Guidance on the EH-41 Web Site Besides placing traditional written guidance documents on its site, EH-41 also develops and makes available other materials providing updated information on various environmental regulatory issues. Below are some of the materials EH-41 added to the site during FY 1998 for the use and benefit of DOE environmental personnel.  general information about EH-41 and its staff, including the mission of the office and its divisions and staff members' telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, and areas of technical expertise; DOE consolidated comments, prepared and/or submitted by EH-41, on other Federal agencies' rulemakings and regulations currently under review by the office; updated regulatory information pertaining to ES&H issues, such as (1) the Weekly Federal Register Digest, a summary report of ES&H rules and notices published each week in the FR and (2) the upcoming actions search option, an interactive reference guide for tracking recent and upcoming regulatory actions of environmental interest for DOE;  4 4  4  Air Quality Designations and Classifications for DOE Facilities (posted October 1997)  A current, comprehensive listing of air quality attainment/nonattainment designations and classifications for geographic areas in which there is a DOE facility, office, laboratory, or site.

Automated Environmental Guidance EH-41 also develops automated guidance tools for its Web site to aid DOE and contractor environmental personnel with various tasks and procedures. Three examples are given below. The RQ-calculator assists in determining whether a hazardous substance release is subject to the reporting requirements of CERCLA Section 103 (a) (i.e., it has exceeded its RQ within a 24-hour period). The RQ-calculator is a Web accessible computer program that allows the user to quickly determine whether any substance that has been spilled is a regulated substance and to advise whether the amount spilled exceeded its RQ. During FY 1998 EH-41 added the Special Requirements Applicable to Hazardous Waste automated guidance to its collection of on-line programs designed to assist DOE personnel in hazardous waste management activities. The program is Windows-based and designed to help users determine what regulations apply when dealing with a RCRA hazardous waste. A series of questions and answers guides the user through modules to determine which RCRA regulations apply to the waste in question. The questions and answers include all major information from the RCRA regulations found in 40 CFR 261. EH-41 released its Site Conceptual Exposure Model (SCEM) Builder in FY 1997. It is a Windows-based program that develops the familiar site conceptual models that EPA requires as part of the documentation for CERCLA and RCRA risk assessments. The SCEM Builder allows users to automatically enter site or problem specific parameters or choose from the program menu the waste release or environmental parameter details to be entered into the model. The model is then automatically developed and printed as program output, thereby significantly decreasing the time required to generate the needed documents for risk assessments. Project managers use SCEMs to develop their initial and advanced understanding of how a hazardous waste site "" works"" (i.e., they  4  4  4  4  4  Fiscal Year 1998  24   use SCEMs to conceptualize and visualize relationships between waste sources, release mechanisms, exposure pathways, and human and ecological receptors). The SCEM continues to be a useful risk assessment tool. It is being used in DOE risk assessment training that EH-41 is involved in, and EPA's RCRA office has considered it as a training aide in its Corrective Action Workshops. EH-41 has offered EPA assistance in use of the software.  EH-41 Workshops and Courses during FY 1998 Since September 1989, EH-41 has developed and conducted environmental training workshops that provide another avenue to assist DOE and contractor staff in understanding and implementing Federal environmental regulatory programs and DOE environmental orders, directives, and guidance. In FY 1998 13 different types of workshops were held or sponsored by EH-41 that were attended by numerous participants. The following are highlights of these workshops. t Site Environmental Report (SER) Workshop  Recognition EH-41's Web site and various automated guidance tools have already begun to gain attention for their quality. During FY 1998 EH-41 submitted nominations for its Web site and underlying automated programs and databases (i.e., EnviroText, RQ-Calculator, and SCEM) for the Global Information Infrastructure (GII) Awards. The Web site and programs/databases all made the semifinal round of judging, and EnviroText was selected as one of the six finalists in the government (both state and Federal) category. EnviroText is an on-line regulatory database that contains congressional information, Federal environmental laws and regulations, as well as Indian tribal codes and treaties.  Articles for DOE Environmental Newsletters In addition to developing environmental guidance materials and computer tools, EH-41 regularly contributes articles to DOE's ES&H Synergy and Envirowatch newsletters. ES&H Synergy is a quarterly newsletter published by EH to promote awareness and information exchange of all ES&H issues impacting DOE personnel and contractors. It is available on the Internet at http://tis.eh.doe.gov/docs/synergy/synergy.html. Envirowatch provides EM professionals with headline-worthy articles on new and emerging environmental policies, regulations, legislation, and litigation. It is available for viewing on the Internet at http://www.em.doe.gov/em75/envwatch. Please see Table 6 on the following pages for a listing of articles that EH-41 prepared during FY 1998.  This one-day workshop presented proposed changes, fostered an exchange of ideas, and encouraged sharing of "" lessons learned"" in the preparation of the annual SERs as required by DOE 5400.1, General Environmental Protection Program, and DOE 231.1, Environment, Safety and Health Reporting. The workshop also provided an opportunity for discussion of additional reporting suggestions, streamlining the SERs, public involvement, and mechanisms for stakeholder participation. The use of the Internet as a tool for information sharing in the development and accessibility of SERs, both within DOE and with its stakeholders, was a topic of discussion as well. This workshop provided an information exchange forum that would result in increased quality, consistency, and timely release of the SERs to the public and other DOE customers in the future. This workshop was presented in Washington, D.C., to 30 people. t Radionuclide National Emission Standards  for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) Workshop This one-day workshop was held to promote information exchange and covered areas associated with NESHAPs implementation at sites. Topics discussed included NESHAPs/DOE National Status; finalization of ANSI N13.1; CAP88-PC, version 2.0; and the impact of reindustrialization and new technologies on stack sampling. This workshop was presented in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to approximately 30 attendees. (text continues on page 28)  25  EH-4 1 Perf orm ance Report   Table 6 .

Interactive lecture sessions interspersed with video presentations and case studies were used to describe how DOE facilities could manage the corrective action program to achieve results. Subjects that were discussed included the 1990 proposed rule; the stabilization initiative; determinations of technical impracticability; risk assessment and land use assumptions; management of remediation waste; regulator and stakeholder relations; Corrective Action Management Units and Temporary Units; integrations with other programs, especially CERCLA; and recent and future developments, including EPA's ANPRM and the proposed HWIR, and their impacts on the corrective action program. The course ended with a roundtable discussion aimed at providing practical suggestions for addressing today's problems at participants' DOE facilities. At the conclusion of the workshop attendees were able to describe the corrective action process; discuss how the program has evolved over time; identify key decision points; identify options for proceeding at these decision points, including accelerated options; and develop a plan for completing facility corrective action obligations. This course was presented in Las Vegas, Nevada, to 14 participants. t Emergency Planning and Community Right-  vised interpretation of the "" otherwise use"" threshold and new industry categories that must be reported. This course was presented in Aiken, South Carolina, and Idaho Falls, Idaho, to 35 attendees. t Release Reporting and EPCRA  This two-day course focused on the episodic release reporting requirements in CERCLA Section 103 and EPCRA Section 304. The course explained the notifications that must be made to Federal, state, and local entities as required under CERCLA Section 103 and EPCRA Section 304 and also covered the Occurrence Reporting and Emergency Management notification and classification systems established by DOE Orders. The course covers the types of releases that must be reported, when and by whom; use of the "" mixture rule"" in reporting releases of hazardous wastes; continuous release reporting; emergency planning; hazardous chemical inventory reporting; a case study of the tritium release at the SRS plant; and insight into state and local regulators' expectations. This course was presented in Aiken, South Carolina, and Idaho Falls, Idaho, to a combined total of approximately 45 participants. t Facility Disposition Principles: Integrating  to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA) Section 313 Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) Reporting Requirements--NETO This three-day course consisted of a series of presentations covering the reporting requirements of EPCRA Section 313 and the PPA of 1990. The course also addressed the reporting requirements as they apply to Federal agencies as a result of EO 12856, Federal Compliance with Right-to-Know Laws and Pollution Prevention Requirements. A variety of hands-on exercises using the TRI reporting Form R and associated guidance materials were used to help participants understand the TRI reporting process. A half-day module covered the re-  Safety and Enhancing Project Cost Effectiveness--Pilot Course This course addressed regulatory requirements for decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) under CERCLA, other laws, and DOE Orders; principles of environmental restoration and other streamlining programs that could apply to D&D activities; project management of D&D and programs under CERCLA; strategic evaluation of direct and indirect cost impacts associated with D&D projects; and methods that effectively combine the above issues to present an integrated set of strategic tools to assist workshop attendees in streamlining D&D projects. The training approach was an interactive classroom lecture setting extensively supplemented with "" lessons learned"" experiences and case studies that were carried through the workshop. This pilot course was presented in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to approximately 40 participants.  Fiscal Year 1998  28   t RCRA Orientation for Facility Managers--  Self-Study Course This self-study course was developed to introduce users to RCRA. Course materials were derived from the more formal three-day RCRA orientation classroom training, but were expanded by developing two new modules to meet the needs of Nuclear Safety Managers. One of the new modules compares and contrasts RCRA closure and corrective action with CERCLA remedial action by incorporating the Oak Ridge Reservation as an example of a radioactively contaminated site that was closed under RCRA, but is undergoing remediation under CERCLA. The other module focused on emerging regulations and offered a snapshot of those expected to impact the Department most dramatically. Electronic files containing the subject course viewgraphs and handouts in PDF format can be accessed via the EH-41 Web site. t Multi-Agency Radiation Survey and Site In-  vestigation Manual (MARSSIM) Training This four-day workshop covered an overview of the radiation survey and site investigation process, survey planning and design, field measurement methods and instrumentation, and interpretation of survey results. The workshop was presented in Denver, Colorado; Richland, Washington; Chicago, Illinois; Albany, New York; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; and Long Island, New York. t Natural Resource Damage Assessment  environmental restoration activities. The instruction introduced the "" Streamlined Approach for Environmental Restoration (SAFER),"" which provides for problem identification, data collection, decision making, and the use of early actions in a phased-response mode for rapid risk reduction. The course emphasized the importance of early stakeholder involvement and also presented the concepts of presumptive/generic remedies and how to identify when and how they can be used at DOE sites. The course presented four principles: (1) building an effective core team, (2) defining the problem clearly and consistently, (3) identifying likely response actions early, and (4) actively managing uncertainty as the underlying strategic basis for successful streamlining of environmental restoration projects. One of the goals of the course was to provide a forum where all the parties responsible for environmental restoration at DOE sites could begin to work collaboratively in a team environment that could then carry over to actual projects. During the training participants applied the principles by working in small, multi-organizational groups, or "" core teams,"" to complete several exercises and participate in case studies based on actual site cleanups. This course was presented in Berkeley and Burbank, California, to 50 participants and Chicago, Illinois, to 49 participants. The courses held in California were sponsored by NETO and the State of California. t Site Conceptual Exposure Model (SCEM)  (NRDA) and Related Natural Resource Trustee (NRT) Topics--Pilot Workshop Topics covered during this half-day pilot workshop included implementing NR trustee responsibilities, understanding CERCLA's NRDA regulations, implementing DOE's policy on integrating NR risks into environmental response actions, and overview of NRDA and trustee issues at the SRS. This workshop was presented in Washington, D.C., to approximately 20 participants. t Principles of Environmental Restoration--  NETO This two-day course provided participants with a conceptual framework, logic process, and proven tools that can be used to make efficient and effective decisions in the conduct of  Builder Pilot Workshop This one-day pilot workshop was developed to demonstrate SCEM Builder applications and to provide instruction on conceptual modeling in the environmental restoration setting. The topics covered included application of SCEMs in the project planning, site assessment, and remedy selection and post implementation phases of environmental restoration projects; SCEM Builder functionality demonstration and hardware requirements; and demonstration cases using the SCEM Builder. This workshop was presented in Washington, D.C., to approximately 15 participants.  29  EH-4 1 Perf orm ance Report   t Technical Assistance Workshop on Conduct-  4 4 4 4  ing a Preliminary Gap Analysis This one-day workshop was developed to identify gaps, strengths, and weaknesses of current management systems and to provide recommendations on implementing an EMS that conforms to the ISO 14001 standard. This workshop was presented in Idaho Falls, Idaho, to approximately 35 attendees. t Workshop Establishing a DOE Topical Com-  Multi-Agency Radiation Survey and Site Investigation Manual (MARSSIM)--X-change '97: The Global D&D Marketplace Conference DOE's Process for Establishing Authorized Limits for Material and Equipment Release Streams--X-change '97: The Global D&D Marketplace Conference EPA's Proposed Air Emission Standards for Hazardous Waste Combustors--Briefing of EH and EM staff and management "" Phase III"" Negotiations with EPA on an Agreement to Conduct Annual Environmental Management Systems Audits--Integrated Safety Management System Lessons-learned Workshop New Developments in Radionuclide Continuous Emission Monitoring (CEM)--2nd Annual Meeting of the Interagency CEM Coordinating Committee (ICCC) Use of the Site Conceptual Exposure Model (SCEM) Builder during Environmental Site Investigations--Waste Management '98 Conference The Expanding Role of Environmental Management Systems in DOE--Waste Management '98 Conference Draft Results on the Radiological Control Criteria Approach for Hazardous Wastes-- CRCPD Workshop Implementation of Environmental Management Systems in the Federal Government-- Global Environmental Management Initiative annual meeting EPA's Waste Minimization Prioritization Tool -- P2 Workshop DOE's Policy for Management of Environment, Safety and Health (DOE Policy 450.4) -- National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Compliance Officers meeting Using Environmental Management Systems as a Self-Assessment Tool--National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration conference  mittee on Environmental Management Systems (EMS) The primary purposes of this one-day workshop were: (1) to introduce DOE EMS practitioners to the benefits the EMS Topical Committee can provide as a forum for identifying issues, meeting peers, developing cross-cutting activities, and fostering information exchange; (2) to review, and amend as needed, the Draft Charter for the DOE Topical Committee on EMS; (3) to discuss current EMS issues and the status of EMS implementation at DOE; and (4) to develop a work plan of priority interests and activities for the Topical Committee on EMS. This workshop was presented in Washington, D.C., to 40 participants.  4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4  Special Presentations The office also addresses DOE policy and guidance needs by giving special briefings and presentations on selected issues to program and field offices and at various DOE conferences. Additionally, to inform outside organizations of DOE policies, EH-41 gives talks at national seminars and meetings.

Management Support The combined experience and technical expertise of EH-41 staff members in the environmental arena provide EH and other Departmental organizations with a broad knowledge base to draw from in dealing with various regulatory and compliance issues. EH-41 utilizes several different avenues to ensure its abilities support and enhance DOE environmental protection activities. First, the office initiates or actively participates in projects and activities designed to improve Departmental compliance with environmental standards. Second, EH-41 routinely responds to requests for technical assistance or information and performs reviews of Departmental ES&H documentation. Lastly, the office provides needed leadership or expert advice as a chair of or participant in DOE work groups and committees. Examples of EH-41's performance in these areas during FY 1998 are listed below.  monitoring at SRS. SRS requested the review as a means of responding to a recent DOE Office of Inspector General's (IG's) report that recommended revisions to the QA/QC procedures to reduce costs. EH-41 and the review team visited SRS to conduct the review and, thereafter, developed a report containing observations and recommendations concerning the technical adequacy of the QA/QC procedures and the data validation process used at the site. The recommendations were aimed at providing adequate quality data, based on customer needs, with lower costs and a more rapid turn-around time.  Environmental Restoration Streamlining As part of a DOE peer review process, EH-41, in conjunction with the Office of Program Integration (EM-43), select DOE sites, EPA, and state agencies, prepared and disseminated information on the application of streamlining principles to successfully address environmental restoration situations at DOE facilities. The streamlining principles were developed by DOE, including EH-41, and EPA to improve cleanups under RCRA and CERCLA and were first described in the joint DOE/EPA "" Principles of Environmental Restoration"" course, which is currently provided by DOE's NETO in association with EM-43, EH-41, and EPA. Below are the titles of the documents and the benefits achieved at each site from applying the principles. (Each document is available on EH-41's Web site.)  Environmental Compliance/ Assistance Projects Low-level Waste (LLW) Facility Reviews EH-41 contributed significantly to the DOE LLW Federal Review Group (LFRG) in determining the technical adequacy of the PA/Composite Analysis (PA/CA) for various LLW sites around the DOE complex. EH-41 took part in LLW technical review team visits to SRS and the Nevada Test Site (NTS) as part of the PA/CA review for the LLW facilities at those sites. Reviews of the PA/CA for LLW disposal sites at ORNL and LANL were conducted as well. Besides the site visits, EH-41 provided both written and oral input to the reviews, including participation in numerous meetings and teleconferences with other DOE personnel.  4  Expediting the Removal Approach for Remediating and Releasing the Mound Plant  The benefits achieved at Mound amount to an estimated lifecycle cost savings of $2 billion. The expected acceleration of the site exit schedule is 25 years. Accelerating the RI/FS Process for the Old Radioactive Waste Burial Ground at the Savannah River Site  The benefits achieved at SRS amount to a project cost savings of $5 million and a schedule reduction of two years. A Lessons Learned Review of the Double Tracks Project at the Nevada Test Site  The benefits achieved at NTS amount to an estimated cost savings of $1422 million.  4  Ground Water Monitoring at SRS EH-41 had a leadership role on the DOE Ground Water Protection Work Group's technical peer review of the quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedures for ground water  4  Fiscal Year 1998  32   Risk Assessment Strategies Because of EH-41's experience with risk assessment issues, they were asked by EM during FY 1998 to assist in strategic planning for the EM Center for Risk Excellence (CRE). The CRE seeks to develop strategies for addressing environmental risk issues that are relevant to DOE programs and operations. During the year EH-41:  Communicating NR Issues The office maintained open lines of communication within DOE regarding NR issues. EH-41 accomplished this, and continues to do so, through its leadership role on the DOE NR Trustee Coordinators Steering Committee. For example, EH-41 conducted a video conference on January 29, 1998, to provide committee members, composed of various DOE program and field office representatives, with:  4 4 4 4  participated in strategic planning meetings for EM's CRE, prepared a module identifying long-term stewardship issues and strategies for inclusion in the CRE strategic plan, partnered with CRE in developing strategies to address environmental risk issues, and served as a technical editor and prepared articles for the EM CRE's Risk Excellence Notes.  4  updated information on relevant NR issues, including EPA's position on incorporation of NR risks in CERCLA documents and Departmental interactions with other Federal NR trustees, and the opportunity to share information on sitespecific NR issues and activities.  4  EcoRisk Tools EH-412 sponsored/coordinated the development of various ecological risk projects and associated reports that became available at the beginning of FY 1998. The projects/reports were funded through an Interagency Agreement between DOE and EPA's National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA), under the auspices of the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP). The following deliverables were provided to NCEA during FY 1998:  Such meetings allow EH-41 to stay aware of the progress of DOE sites in implementing NR concerns into environmental response actions and to respond to pertinent issues.  NR/Environmental Restoration Integration A DOE policy to address the Department's responsibilities as both an NR trustee and a lead response agency for environmental restoration activities at its sites was signed by the Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management (EM-1) at the end of FY 1997. EH-41 worked with EM to develop the policy and has since then made itself available to various DOE sites to assist with implementation. The following examples highlight the office's activities in this arena during FY 1998.  4 4 4  Methods and Tools for Estimation of the Exposure of Terrestrial Wildlife to Contaminants, Effects of Ionizing Radiation on Terrestrial Plants and Animals: A Workshop Report, and A Guide to the ORNL Ecotoxicological Screening Benchmarks.  4  These deliverables provide DOE program managers with a better understanding of the technical basis, appropriate application, and regulatory acceptance of ecological screening benchmarks in general and the ORNL benchmarks in particular. A Guide to the ORNL Ecotoxicological Screening Benchmarks was made available on the EH-41 Web site.  Visited SRS on several occasions to assist the SRS Environmental Protection Division (EPD) and the Environmental Restoration Division (ERD) with a project to integrate CERCLA's ecological risk assessment requirements with the SRS NR Trustees' concerns. Specifically, EH-41 assisted EPD/ERD with project scoping meetings and work plan development concerning plans for ecological risk assessments of CERCLA operable units at the site.  33  EH-4 1 Perf orm ance Report   4  Traveled to the Fernald Environmental Management Project (FEMP) site in Fernald, Ohio, on March 2627, 1998, to meet with DOE and contractor staff working on NRD issues and remediation of an operable unit at the site. EH-41 provided technical assistance regarding FEMP's attempt to implement an innovative procedure that will integrate the response action and the NR restoration plan. EH-41 also toured potential restoration areas, consulted staff on trustee coordination and NRDA issues, and reviewed a draft of the integrated plan.  lated activities conducted by EH-41 during FY 1998.  4  EMS Implementation EH-41 is leading the way for DOE in understanding and applying the EMS concept to Departmental facilities. In addition to its other EMS promotional activities during FY 1998 (see Table 3), the office established a DOE Topical Committee on EMSs to:  Hosted the Fourth Annual DOE Cultural Resources Forum on March 25, 1998, in Seattle, Washington. (The Forum was held in conjunction with the annual Society of American Archaeology meeting.) DOE historic preservation contacts or representatives from DOE sites and Tribal representatives participated. The focus of the meeting was the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). A National Park Service representative discussed NAGPRA and responded to DOE questions. Hosted a DOE meeting with the National Council on Public History (NCPH) Program Committee on April 15, 1998, in Austin, Texas. The purpose of the meeting was to:   4  4 4  meet with NCHP members and others regarding DOE history-related activities, introduce the DOE Cultural Resource Management Program and the DOE History Division Program, establish a dialogue with people who are doing DOE history-related work, identify and discuss common issues, and provide DOE sites with an opportunity to discuss their history-related activities.  provide a forum within DOE to share experiences and lessons learned in developing and implementing EMS and serve as the DOE focal point for EMS standards and issues, including actively working with other EMS organizations within DOE and in other Federal agencies.         The committee is open to all DOE and DOE contractor personnel with responsibilities for developing, evaluating, or implementing EMSs at Departmental sites, facilities, or laboratories. EH-41 hosted several meetings of the committee during FY 1998. Agenda items included lessons learned at DOE facilities, implementation issues, development of a committee charter, and EMS auditing issues. Finally, EH-41 assisted staff at the following DOE sites in understanding and/or implementing EMSs: Fernald Field Office, Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), and Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL).  4  Coordinated the Departmental response to DOI's Federal Archeological Activities Questionnaire for FY 1997. The DOE Federal Preservation Officer, an EH-41 staff member, annually requests that DOE field sites submit information regarding their archeological programs and projects for the fiscal year. The information provided is compiled for DOE submission's to DOI. It also assists EH-41 in evaluating DOE's archeological activities and further developing DOE's cultural resource management program. Prepared for its Web site an updated DOE Cultural Resources Directory, which provides DOE complex-wide information on points of contact and expertise available for historic preservation, Indian issues, and other aspects of cultural resources.  4  Awareness of Cultural Resources EH-41 promotes and develops cultural and historical resource management programs for DOE and its facilities. The following are some of the re-  Fiscal Year 1998  34   Emergency Response Preparedness EH-41 provides technical support to numerous DOE emergency response exercises that ensure proper preparation in the event of accidents or hazardous materials releases at DOE sites. Examples of EH-41's participation in such drills and exercises during FY 1998 are provided below.  (2) the preferred option would result in a substantial reduction in DOE operating costs. The initiative was presented to the DOE Environmental Executive (EE-1) who was looking for "" missed opportunities"" to reduce waste and conserve energy throughout the DOE complex. EE-1 requested that EH/EE move ahead with the initiative and develop a decision package for S-1 with EE in the lead. The initiative progressed to the level of a proposed Secretarial directive by the end of FY 1998. Additionally, to disseminate information on successful DOE efforts to phase out the use of ODSs, EH-41 posted three ODSs phaseout-case studies on its Web site. The case studies (involving a refrigerant replacement at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, a halon replacement at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, and an ozone-depleting solvent replacement at the Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant) discuss issues such as approach used, funding sources, and lessons learned. Electronic copies of the case studies can be accessed from the EH-41 Web site at: http://tis-nt.eh.doe.gov/oepa/guidance/ozone/ phaseouts.html.  4  A November 6, 1997, drill from the DOE headquarters' Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to test the emergency plan for the NTS Device Assembly Facility in preparation for its operational readiness review. A February 10, 1998, technical operations cadre drill at the EOC, based on an SRS scenario in preparation for SRS' upcoming annual emergency preparedness exercise. An April 1, 1998, annual emergency response drill for Sandia National Laboratory (SNL); participated with other members of the Emergency Management headquarters team in this delayed drill from the EOC while maintaining communications with Albuquerque Operations Office (AL). A July 15, 1998, emergency response exercise at the EOC for LANL. An August 28, 1998, annual integrated emergency response exercise for Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) at the EOC.  4 4  4 4  Environmental Planning and P2 EH-41 is actively involved in Departmental P2 planning and reporting. Two examples of the office's FY 1998 participation in this area are described below.  Stratospheric Ozone Protection EH-41 and the Office of Federal Energy Management Programs (EE-90) are working on an initiative to accelerate DOE's phaseout of Class I ozone-depleting refrigerants (i.e., the class of chemicals most damaging to the stratospheric ozone layer). They are promoting the use of privatized funding mechanisms (such as Energy Savings Performance Contracts) to acquire new, energy-efficient refrigeration and air conditioning systems. During FY 1998 EH-41 and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EE) combined to prepare a draft decision paper on the various options available. The paper clearly indicates that: (1) the options would bring about major P2 and energy efficiency benefits and  4  The office coordinated an interim and final DOE response to EPA's Office of Federal Facilities Enforcement's request for updated information on the department's FY 1999 plans, or FEDPLAN, for controlling environmental pollution. These plans are required under EO 12088, Federal Compliance with Pollution Control Standards. EH-41 prepared for EH-1's signature the Third Annual Progress Report on Executive Order 12856, which was submitted to EPA in Fall 1997 in accordance with EO 12856. The report includes information submitted by DOE sites to TRI for reporting year 1995 and describes DOE's P2 activities during 1995 through early 1997. It discusses DOE's progress in meeting the 50-percent reduction goal under the EO and also meeting DOE's reduction goals for  4  35  EH-4 1 Perf orm ance Report   sanitary wastes and radioactive, low-level mixed, and hazardous wastes. The Department's success in reaching affirmative procurement goals is also covered. The report was made available to a larger audience through its placement on the EH-41 Web site.  examples of the office's technical assistance (Table 7, see pages 3739) and documentation review (Table 8, see pages 4043) activities are provided on the following pages.  ES&H Performance Indicators EH-41 routinely reviews and analyzes DOE environmental compliance data to identify trends and summarize the information for interested DOE elements. The summaries are provided to the Office of Operating Experience Analysis and Feedback (EH-33) for incorporation in quarterly DOE ES&H Performance Indicators reports. During FY 1998 EH-41 reviewed and summarized the following data/information:  Participation in Work Groups and Committees EH-41 chairs or participates in various DOE, interagency, national, and international work groups and committees.

Radionuclides NESHAPs Issues EH-41 co-hosted with DOE's Hanford Site the Radionuclide NESHAPs Annual Meeting on August 4, 1998, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The meeting was held in conjunction with the 25th DOE/NRC Nuclear Air Cleaning and Treatment Conference, August 3-6, 1998. The NESHAPs Annual Meeting addressed important issues such as implementing the new American National Standards Institute (ANSI) N13.1 standard on representative sampling; implementation problems with 40 CFR 61, Subpart H; and the DOE Privatization/Reindustrialization initiative and its impact on NESHAPs compliance.  Technical Assistance and ES&H Documentation Reviews EH-41 offers further value to the Department's environmental programs through its ability to successfully respond to requests for ES&H technical assistance and documentation reviews.

In August of 1995, Plaintiff Alicia Torres-Gustave (""Gustave"") commenced employment wit h the Go vernment a s Depu ty Commissioner of the Depar tment o f Tour ism for the island of St. Croix (""Deputy Commissioner of Tourism""). 6. In April of 1998, Gustave requested a transfer to the vacant position of Regional 2   Dire ct or of O ffsho re O ffices (""Re gio nal Dir ect or ""), head qua rt ere d in At lant a, G eo rgia . T his transfer request was granted on or about May 26, 1998. 7. Gustave held both the Deputy Commissioner of Tourism position and the Regional Dire ct or po sitio n as a n exe mpt emplo yee, and in reg ard to bot h po sitio ns she neve r ap plied to join the classified service. 8. Gu stave test ified that the De part ment of T our ism is one of t he most import ant depar tments in the Go vernment a nd that she wo uld desc ribe it as t he life blood o f the Government's economy. 9. As Regional Director, Gustave had oversight responsibilities for all of the Offshore Office s of t he De par tme nt o f To uris m. T he De par tme nt o f To uris m has o ffsho re o ffices in Atlanta; Los Angeles; Miami; New York City; Chicago; Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. Gustave's testimony revealed that she had a substantial amount of contact with the public in order to promote the Virgin Islands as a tourist destination. She testified that, as Regional Director, she traveled representing the Virgin Islands and acted as a spokesperson for the Commissioner and Dep art ment of T our ism. Gust ave furt her t estified t hat she made rec ommendat ions reg arding the Offshore Offices' budgets. 10. Gustave publicly supported G overnor Roy L. Schneider (""Schneider"") during his first election campaign in 1994, but she was off-island during his reelection campaign in 1998. 11. O n March 1 , 199 9, Gu stave received writt en not ice that her employment with t he Government was terminated effective March 5, 1999. No reason was given for her termination. 12. O n Januar y 31, 19 95, P laintiff Francisco D. Jar vis (""Jarvis"") commenced employment with the Government as Deputy Commissioner of Housing, Parks and Recreation. His Notice of 3   Perso nnel Action ( ""NOPA"") lists this po sition as exempt. Jarvis never applied t o join t he classified service. 13. On December 24, 1997, Jarvis received a contract permitting him to attend college for one year while still receiving his salar y. Thus, he is on st udy leave and prese ntly not employed by the Government. 14. Ja rvis is Schneide r's nephe w, and publicly suppo rte d his reelec tion ca mpaign, ser ving as co- Chair of t he You ng Virgin Is landers fo r the Twent y-First C entur y committee and at tending rallies and fund raisers. 15. T here ar e no pr escribed duties for a D eput y Commissioner o f Housing, Park s and Recreation as performed by Jarvis. However, Section 301, Title 3 of the Virgin Islands Code autho rizes t he Gove rnor to a ppoint such Dep uty Co mmissioners as he deems nece ssary for the efficient operation of the Department to carry out such duties as prescribed by the Commissioner. 16. Jarvis testified that his duties included developing recreational programs;1 running t he athlet ic and rec reat ional pro grams at parks and facilities o n St. Thomas a nd St . John; a nd, in the absence of the Commissioner and the two Assistant Commissioners, the authority to act as Commissioner. 17. On Fe bru ary 3 , 19 99, Jar vis wa s no tifie d t hat beca use of bu dge ta ry co nst rain ts h is employment with the Government was terminated, effective immediately. 18. On November 29, 1995, Plaintiff Audrey Callwood (""Callwood"") commenced employment with the Government as Coordinator of Special Events for the Department of  However, Jarvis later testified that he never actually developed any new recreational programs. 4  1   Tourism. Callwood was hired as an exempt employee. On August 13, 1999, approximately four years after Callwood first joined the exempt service, she notified the Division of Personnel of her election to become a member of the classified service. 19. Ca llwood ha d no de fined job spec ification. S he tes tified tha t her unders tanding o f the duties and res ponsibilities o f her po sition ca me from the Commissioner who t old her that the Government wanted to emphasize local and federal holidays. In accordance with this request, Callwood testified that she organized special events which revolved around historical and cultural affairs. Fo r example, for Mar tin Lut her King Day she creat ed and implement ed a marc h from the Catholic Cathedral to the Emancipation Garden where a festival was then held. 20. Ca llwood s uppo rte d Schneide r in his electio n and ree lection c ampaigns, s erving o n both the Friends of Roy and Women for Roy Committees and on the Public Relations Committee of the Friends of Roy Committee. 21. Callwood testified that prior to receiving her termination notice, she was threatened on a daily basis by Turnbull supporters who told her that ""she was going home."" 22. Callwood was terminated by notice dated February 11, 1999, effective February 12, 1999. At tha t t ime no reas on was given for he r te rmination. Howe ver, a t t rial, Assist ant t o the Governor of the Virgin Islands for Public Affairs and Policy Initiatives, James O'Bryan, Jr. (""O'Bryan"") testified that Callwood was fired because her position had originally been assigned to Go ver nment Ho use , an d wa s bein g t ran sfer red fro m To uris m back to Go ver nment Ho use . T his testimony contradicts Callwood's NOPA which states that her position was newly created and not transferred. 23. Plaintiff Patrick Sprauve (""Sprauve"") was hired as a Special Projects Coordinator 5   with the Department of Finance in June of 1995. 24. As Special Project s Coord inator with the D epartment o f Finance, Sprauve's respo nsibilities included aud iting depa rtment s, par ticipat ing in the re stru ctur ing of the Department, and other duties as assigned. 25. On March 26, 1997, Joanne Bozzuto, Acting Commissioner of Finance, notified Sprauve that effective April 1, 1997, he was being assigned to the Governor's Home Protection Roo fing Prog ram ""for t he dura tion o f the ro ofing pro gram."" His resp onsibilities included acting as a coordinator between the Program and the Department of Finance. 26. A new NOPA, reflecting Sprauve's reassignment, was issued on May 7, 1997. Sprauve retained his title as Special Projects Coordinator. Sprauve's NOPA lists his position as exempt. He never applied to join the classified service. 27. During the time that Sprauve worked for the Home Protection Roof Program with the Department of Property and Procurement, he was still considered part of the Department of Finance and received his pay from that Department's funds. 28. The evidence indicates that Sprauve's assignment to the Home Protection Roof Pro gram was a tempo rary o ne, and it was und erst ood that he wou ld ret urn t o his dut ies with t he Dep art ment of Fin ance at the co nclus ion o f the Pro gra m. 29. Sprauve publicly supported Schneider in the 1998 reelection campaign. Sprauve was a membe r o f the Men fo r Ro y Commit te e, c o- chair of t he Yo ut h Co mmitt ee a nd ac te d as a Pu blic Rela tio ns as sist ant . He also ser ved o n th e Cu ltu ral C ommit te e, a nd ap pea red on r adio pro gra ms in support of Schneider. On Election Day, Sprauve went around to each polling station with food and drink for the Schneider campaigners. 6   30. On February 19,1999, Sprauve received a letter informing him that because of changing program needs and budgetary constraints, he was being terminated effective March 5, 1999. 31. T he evidence ind icates t hat since G overno r Tur nbull too k office, 2 4 pers ons have been newly hired by the Department of Finance. 32. Plaintiff Eileen Jackson (""Jackson"") was employed by the Government on September 8, 1995, as Special Aide for JOBS within the Department of Human Services, a federally funded po sitio n des igned to tr ansit ion w elfar e wo rke rs ba ck t o t he jo b for ce. Jac kso n's N OPA lists this position as exempt. She never applied to join the classified service. 33. Ja ckso n test ified that the du ties and respo nsibilities of her po sition involved giving mot ivat iona l spe eche s to stu dent s, c oo rdin at ing t heir app rec iat ion a war ds, and in str uct ing t hem in the basic skills necessary to find employment, including use of the telephone and preparation of resumes. 34. Jackson publicly supported S chneider in his election and reelection campaigns, serving on the Cultural Committee, the Fund Raising Committee, the Women for Roy Committee, the Friends of Roy Committee, and as chairperson for the Public Relations Committee. Jackson also has a weekly radio prog ram on WSTA which she used as a platform to assist Schneider's reelection efforts. On Election Day, Jackson actively campaigned at the Bertha C. Boschulte polling station, where she was seen by Governor Turnbull and Lieutenant Governor, Luz James. 35. By letter dated April 9, 1999, Jackson was notified that because of budgetary const raints t he Gove rnment w as te rminating her employment, effective immediat ely. At t rial the Government argued that the decision to terminate Jackson was also based upon the determination 7   of Commissioner Halbert of the Department of Human Services that her position was one of thirteen (13) positions within that Department deemed unnecessary and excess. 36. T he evidence ind icates t hat o f the eleven ( 11) p rog rams rec eiving funding from t he identical federal source, Jackson was the only individual within said programs who was ter minated. The evidenc e also indicat es tha t of t he thirt een (13 ) employees identified as ho lding non-essential positions within the Department of Human Services, Jackson was the only individual from the list who was terminated. 37. Plaintiff Maxwell George (""George"") was employed by the Government on November 11, 199 6, as the Revenue Acco unts Manager at the Depart ment of Health. Geo rge's NOPA lists this position as exempt. He never applied to join the classified service. 38. George testified that his duties and responsibilities as Revenue Accounts Manager involved running the department, making sure the revenues came in, and doing the collections for St. Thomas, St. John and St. Croix. George also testified that his job required the management of a staff of 26. 39. George actively supported Schneider in his reelection campaign, serving as Chairman of the Men for Roy Committee. 40. O n April 6, 19 99, G eorg e rece ived a not ice that because of budg etar y const raints t he Gover nment was ter minating him, effective immediat ely. At t rial the Go vernment a rgued that the decision to terminate George was also based upon the recommendation of the Commissioner of Health, Dr. Wilbur Calendar, who advised Governor Turnbull that George's position was an unnecessary excess position which should be eliminated. 41. Plaintiff Laura Hassell (""Hassell"") was employed by the Government as Director of 8   Environmental Health within the Department of Health on August 21, 1995. Hassell's NOPA lists this position as exempt. 42. Hassell served as the Territorial Director of Environmental Health for the entire Virgin Islands. 43. O n November 12, 1 997, less than 9 0 days aft er her second anniversar y in the pos ition, Hassell notified the Division of Personnel of her election to become a member of the classified service. The Division o f Perso nnel has never respo nded t o her no tice o f election. 44. T he dut ies inherent in the Po sition o f Direct or o f Environment al Health a s signed and certified by Hassell in the Position Description Questionnaire (PDQ) are: 2  (a) t o plan, org anize and d irect a pro gram o f Environment al health for the Depart ment of Healt h; (b) to act as a n exp ert advis or or co nsult ing sp ecia list o n san ita tio n and Pub lic Health p roblems t o the Commissioner , ot her go vernmenta l depart ments and nonofficial organizations; (c) t o dire ct all enginee ring investiga tions, surveys and inspect ions per formed by personnel of the Health Department; (d) to p repare the budget for d ivisional programs; (e) t o enfor ce Public He alth St andard s for all t hree pr ogr ams within the division;  At trial, Hassell testified that a later job description, identified as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 67, which she created, is the official job specification for the Director of Environmental Health posit ion. Ho wever, the Co urt finds that both t he later job desc riptio n and the PDQ sho uld be considered in determining the job duties inherent to the position of Director of Environmental Health. Becaus e Plaintiffs' Exhibit 6 7 doe s not expand u pon t he dut ies alread y reflected in the PDQ, the Co urt will not list t hose d uties se parat ely in this opinion. 9  2   (f) to develop, plan and direct programs for the control of disease vector such as mosquito es, flies, rat s and ro aches; (g) to p erform in-service trainings; (h) to pre par e ann ual a nd o the r pe rio dic r epo rt s for the Commis sion er a nd all pro grams wit hin the division; (i) to att end numerou s meetings repr esenting t he Commissioner and t he division; (j) to supervise all employees in executing assignments. Approximately forty per cent of H asse ll's wo rk in clud es t he fo llowin g su per viso ry t ask s: d irec ting daily perio dic act ivities of subo rdinat es, giving da ily work ass ignments, d isciplining subor dinates , app roving t heir time shee ts and leave req uest s, and int erviewing and hiring job applicants for vacant positions within the Environmental Protection unit. 45. Hassell actively supported Schneider's reelection campaign, serving as a member of Women for Schneider, Co-Chair of the Public Relations Committee of the Friends of Roy Committe e and at tending fu nd raising eve nts. H assell also ca mpaigned for Schneider at t he Kirwan Terrace polling station where she was seen by Charles Turnbull, Luz James, and James O'B ryan on E lect ion D ay. 46. Hassell was terminated from her employment by letter dated February 18, 1999 effective on February 19, 1999. No reason was given for her termination. The Government now alleges that Hassell was terminated because the Governor wanted to replace her with a Director of his own choosing. 47. Plaintiff Jeremiah Lee (""Lee"") was a former temporary Government employee under a FEMA grant. He was assigned to the Department of Planning and Natural Resources (""DPNR"") 10   as a Pr oject Inspec tor in the Haz ard Mit igation P roject following Hu rricane Marilyn. The position of Project Inspector is an exempt position. Lee was terminated when the program expired. 48. Subsequent to his termination from the temporary Building Inspector position, Lee, on M ay 8, 199 8, a pplie d fo r t he po sitio n of T rad es I nspe ct or in th e DP NR. Lee was the only applicant for t he pos ition. 49. The Government claims that Lee was never hired by former Governor Schneider to the po sition o f Trade s Inspe cto r, t hat he is no t qua lified for the p ositio n, and t hat t he Gove rnment lacks the money to hire him. The evidence contradicts the Government's assertions. 50. Le e was given a n accep tance form by the G overnment , dat ed Oct ober 8 , 199 8. The form pro vides in relevant part : ""I her eby accept the ap point ment te ndered me [Jere miah Lee] by you [the Government], of Trades Inspector in the Dept. of Planning & Nat. Res. of the District of St. Thomas - St. John . . .."" Plaintiff Lee Exhibit No. 9. 51. Lee subsequently completed a number of forms required to begin his employment, including a W-4 form and a Loyalty Statement, also dated October 8, 1998. 52. A for m lett er w as p lace d in Le e's p ers onn el file c ong rat ulat ing him o n his appointment to his new permanent position with the Government. 53. A N OPA for Lee's new posit ion was g enerat ed by DPNR and delivere d to the Divisio n of P ers onn el. T he NO PA be ars the sta mp o f the Divisio n of P ers onn el, in dica ting tha t it was received by the Department. 54. The Government has failed to produce the original NOPA for inspection by the Court. 55. The Assistant Director of Personnel, Mr. Godfrey Fredericks, Jr. (""Fredericks""), 11   te stifie d t hat NOP As ar e maint ained in loc ked file ca binet s in t he Div ision of P ers onn el, w hich is respo nsible for maintaining t hem. The o nly other places t hat a N OPA co uld be loca ted w ould be in the applicable Department, at the Office of the Governor, or in the possession of an employee of t he G ove rnme nt w hile in t ran sit bet wee n th os e lo cat ions . I n all c ase s, t he N OPA wo uld a lways remain in the possession of the Government. 56. On or about December 17, 1998, Lee had a telephone conversation with then Gover nor S chneider, in which Schneider ackno wledged to L ee tha t he had signed Lee 's NOPA. 57. The Court concludes that the NOPA was signed by Schneider. 58. T he Gove rnment's second argument for failing to either hir e or r etain Lee - - t hat he is not qualified for the position - - is also not persuasive. The statement that Lee was unqualified for t he pos ition o f Trade s Inspe cto r, up on which t he Gove rnment r elies, is co ntained in a Qualification R ating S heet s igned by Joa nne Christ opher on Apr il 22, 199 8. This d ocument indicates that Lee is not qualified for the position, because he did not possess a license in a trade such as p lumbing, elect rical or cont ract ing. Ho wever, the No tice o f Vacancy set s out the qualificatio n requir ements fo r the posit ion of Tr ades I nspect or, and tha t do cument c onta ins no suc h re quir ement . T he au the ntic at ion o f the Qua lificat ion R at ing S heet is also highly su spe ct in that it was purportedly signed on April 22, 1998, whereas Lee did not submit his written applicat ion for t he pos ition unt il May 8,1998 - - 16 days afte r he had p urpo rte dly been found unqualified for the position. Moreover, Lee was subsequently accepted for the position and was 3 3  Altho ugh the Cou rt initia lly exclu ded , at the req ues t o f the Go ver nment 's co unse l, testimony regarding the statement of Schneider to the effect that he had signed the NOPA, that same counsel subsequently elicited exactly that same testimony during cross-examination of Lee. Defense counsel never objected to that testimony, nor did counsel move to strike the testimony. Thus, the statement is admissible. 12   given an acceptance form which contains an acknowledgment that the Government had offered him the position of Trades Inspector. 59. T he Gove rnment's final reason fo r not hiring Lee - - lack of mone y in the Depa rtment - - is also highly suspect. The evidence indicates that since January, 1999, DPNR has given out raises of at least $14,000 per year to employees of the DPNR and has hired a total of 26 new employees at rates of pay ranging from $7.21 per hour to $31.25 per hour. 60. The position of Trades Inspector is a classified position. 61. Lee and his wife Betty Mann Lee were both active in the reelection campaign of Schneider. Mr. Lee served on several committees, assisted in fund raising, and accompanied Schneider in door to door canvassing. Mrs. Lee was also on a number of committees, and spoke at public meetings in support of Schneider. Findings o f Fact Common to all Plaintiffs 62. G overno r Tur nbull (""Turnbu ll"") test ified that he made t he final decision as t o the termination of the Plaintiffs in this case. 63. P laintiffs were t old t hat unles s they signed a writ ten r equest to be placed in t he exempt service, they would not be paid. 64. Fr ederick s test ified that ther e was no indication in any o f the per sonnel files tha t t he Dire ct or of P ers onn el eve r no tifie d any o f the Plaint iffs, w ith mo re t han t wo year s ser vice, of t heir right to elect to become classified. 65. During a press conference held on February 18, 1999, Defendant Governor Charles Turnbu ll attr ibuted c ert ain decisions fo r firing go vernment e mployees t o ""disloyalt y to t he administration."" 13   66. The Co ur t fin ds t hat Defe nda nts fire d P laint iffs fo r t heir po litic al ex pr ess ion, name ly, for their public support of Schneider's election and reelection campaigns. 67. The Court finds that in regard to Plaintiff Lee, Defendants failure to hire him was based o n his political exp ressio n, namely, his public sup por t of S chneider' s reelec tion ca mpaign. 68. The Court finds that the Defendants' reason for firing Plaintiffs, namely budgetary concerns, is unpersuasive based on the evidence of raises and new hires.  Conclusions of Law Conclusions of Law applicable to all Plaintiffs, except Jeremiah Lee 1. Defendants may lawfully terminate government employees for politically-motivated reasons if the employees are policymakers. Elrod v. Bur ns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976). In order to determine whether an employee holds a policy-making position, the Court must evaluate several factors: an individual's technical competence; power to contr ol others; authority to speak in the name o f policymakers; influenc e on pr ogr ams; ability to a ffect go vernment d ecision-mak ing on issues where t here is ro om for d isagree ment; deg ree o f meaningful input into decision- making concerning the nature and scope of a major program; authority to prepare budgets; authority to hire or fire employees; and public perception. See Brown v. Trench, 787 F.2d 167, 169-170 (3d Cir. 1986 ); Nekolny v. Painter, 653 F.2d 1164, 1170 (7th Cir. 1981 ); Ecker v. Cohlan, 542 F.Supp 896, 901 (E.D.N.Y. 1982). 2. Furthermore, the Court must focus its analysis on the ""function[s] of the public office in question and not the actual past duties of the particular employee involved."" Brown, 787 F.2d at 168 ; see also O'Connor v. Steeves, 994 F.2d 905, 911 (1st Cir. 1993)(""the actual past duties of 14   the disc harged employee ar e irrelevant if the po sition inhere ntly encompa sses mor e expansive powers and more important functions that would tend to make political affiliation an appropriate requirement for effective performance"" (citation omitted)). 3. App lying t he a bov e st and ard s, t he C ou rt finds the follo wing po sit ions to be p olic ymaking pos itions: G usta ve's po sition as Regiona l Directo r of Offsho re Offices in t he Depa rtment of To urism, Jar vis' posit ion as Dep uty Co mmissioner of Ho using Par ks and Re creat ion, and Hassell's position as Director of Environmental Health. Therefore, Defendants termination of their jobs did not violate the First Amendment. See Elrod, 427 U.S. at 373. 4. Ap plying t he same sta ndar ds, the Cou rt finds t hat the pos itio ns held by Plaint iffs George, Jackso n, Sprauve and Callwood were not po licy-making positions; thus, firing these Plaintiffs for their political expression violated the First Amendment. See Elrod, 427 U.S. at 375. 5. For public employees to succeed on a Fourteenth Amendment due process claim, they must have a property interest in their continued employment. See Cleveland Bd. of Edu c. v. Lou der mill, 470 U.S. 532, 541 (1985) . The property interests protect ed by the Due Process Clause o f the Fo urt eenth Amend ment ""are creat ed and t heir dimensions a re defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law - - rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to t hose benefits."" Bd. of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972). 6. In the instant case, any property interests Plaintiffs may have in their continued emplo yment der ive fr om t he Vir gin I sland s st at ut e go ver ning t he t err ito ry's Per son al Me rit System. 3 V.I.C.  451-690 (1967 and Supp. 1999). Specifically, Sec tion 5 30, T itle 3 of t he Virgin Islands Code states: ""[W]here a department head . . . decides to dismiss, demote, or 15   suspend a regular employee. . . he shall furnish the employee wit h a writ ten st atement of the char ges aga inst him. T he emp loyee shall ha ve t en da ys follo wing t he da te of r ece ipt of sa id statement of the charges to appeal the proposed action to the Public Employees Relations Board."" 3 V.I.C.  530 (Supp. 1999)(emphasis added). 7. Section 451a divides all government positions into two categories: the ""career service"" (synonymous with ""classified service"") and the ""exempt service"" (synonymous with ""unclassified service""). See 3 V.I.C.  451a (1995). Those employees found to be in the career service have a ""`clear and legitimate expectation o f continued employment,' and enjoy extensive safeguards against arbitrary dismissal."" Richa rds on v . Fe lix, No. 84-72, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16027, at *7 (D.V.I. July 9, 1987), aff'd 856 F.2d 505 (3d Cir. 1988), (quoting Shuster v. Thraen 18 V.I. 287, 295 (D.V.I. 1981)). Exempt employees are not guaranteed the same protection. Shuster, 18 V.I. at 294; see also 3 V.I.C.  530 (Supp. 1999). 8. The ""exempt"" positions include, inter alia, tho se of De puty Co mmissioners and employees in positions of a policy-determining nature. 3 V.I.C.  451a(b)(1) & (8). Further, ""[a]ll positions in the Executive Branch of the United States Virgin Islands Government not exempted under subsection (b) of [ 451a] shall be in the career service."" 3 V.I.C.  451a(c). 9. Plaintiffs George, Jackson, Sprauve and Callwood held positions that are not exempt under subsection (b) of Section 451a. Furthermore, it is the definition of ""career"" and ""exempt"" in Section 451a of Title 3 of the V.I. Code and not the NOPA which determines whether a position is in the career service or the exempt service. See Richa rds on v . Fe lix, 856 F.2d 505, 511 ( 3d Cir. 1988) . Ther efore , the Cour t finds t hat Plaint iffs Georg e, Jac kson, Spra uve, and Callwood held positions in the career service. 16   10. Fu rthe rmore , the electio n forms t hat Plaint iffs were re quired to e xecut e were of no legal effect. See Hassell v. Department of Health, PERB-GSA-99-30, stating that Act 5336 ""applies only to those employees in a career service pos ition before the Go vernment's reor ganizat ion in 1987 , who were mad e exempt by Act 522 5. Tho se employees may not be for ced into an ex empt po sitio n, a nd may o nly be so plac ed if t hey vo lunt arily e lect in wr iting . T his form of letter does not apply to every exempt position, even though the Government seems to have made a practice of making every employee in an exempt position sign such a letter."" Because Plaintiffs did not hold their positions prior to 1987, Act 5336 does not apply to them. Moreover, even if Act 5336 applied to Plaintiffs, the Court finds that because Plaintiffs' written reque sts t o join t he exempt service w ere no t volu ntar y elections , the y have no lega l effect o n the status of their employment. See Act March 24, 1988, No. 5336,  6(b), Sess. L. 1988, p. 124. 11. Ad ditionally and fo r the sake o f argument , the fact t hat Plaint iffs Georg e, Jac kson a nd Sprauve did not elect to become members of the career service and that Callwood did not make a timely election does not affect their career-service status or their right to elect to join the career service w ithin a reas onable pe riod o f time from t he dat e of ent ry of this Ju dgment . See 3 V.I.C.  498(a) (1995). The 90-day time period to make an election to join the career service as prescribed by 3 V.I.C.  498(b) is not an absolute bar against granting career status when such election is made after 90 days of being eligible. As this Court stated in its Memorandum Opinion dated September 21, 1999: ""It is inequitable for the Government to escape liability for failing to inform a Government employee of his ability to elect to join the [career] service, see Brando n v. Dist rict of C olu mbia Bd . o f Par ole , 823 F.2d 644, 648 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (`a state does not violate an individual's federal constitutional right to procedural due process merely by deviating from its 17   own es tablished p roce dures '), if an o ther wise qualified emplo yee can be pr evente d from ent ering the [career] service because his application was fourteen months late."" Sumt er v . T urn bull, No. 99-0045 (D.V.I. Sept. 21, 1999). 12. To receive the pro cedural benefits of Section 530, t he government employee ""must have been at the time of his [or her] termination not only a career service employee but also a regular employee."" Richardson, 856 F.2d at 509. A ""regular employee"" is defined as ""an emplo yee w ho h as be en ap po inte d t o a po sitio n in t he [ car eer ] se rvic e in ac co rda nce w ith t his chapter after completing his working test period."" 3 V.I.C.  451 (1995). Accor ding to the personnel regulations, the maximum length of an employee's probational or ""working test"" period shall be no more t han twelve mont hs. V.I .R. & Reg s. tit. 3,  45 4-161( b) (198 6); see also Richardson, 856 F.2d at 509. 13. Plaintiffs George, Jackson, Sprauve and Callwood were employed for more than twelve (12) months. Therefore, each of these Plaintiffs has a constitutionally protected property interest in his or her position as a regular employee of the Government of the Virgin Islands. See 3 V. I.C .  5 30 ( Sup p. 1 999 ). A cco rding ly, th e Fo urt eent h Amendme nt r ight s of P laintiffs George, Jackso n, Sprauve and Callwood were violated by Defendants. 14. On June 16, 1999, this Court ruled that Gustave and Jarvis were exempt employees who could be terminated without notice under Virgin Islands law. The Court therefore concluded that Gustave and Jarvis held no protected property interest in their continued employment. See Has sell, et al v. Tur nbull, et al. , No . 99- 0053 ( D.V. I. Ju ne 16, 1999) (or der gr anting in par t and denying in part Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment). 15. Because Hassell held a position of a policy-determining nature, she is an exempt 18   employee under Section 451a(b)(8) of Title 3 of the Virgin Islands Code. See 3 V.I.C.  451a(b)(8) (1995). Furthermore, Hassell's election to be placed in the career service pursuant to Section 498(a) of Title 3 of the V.I. Code is of no effect, because the provisions of Section 498 do not apply to those employees in the exempt service pursuant to Section 451(b). 3 V.I.C.  498 (d) (19 95) . T her efo re, as a n exe mpt emplo yee, Has sell ha d no pro te ct ed p ro per ty int ere st in her continued employment and could be terminated at any time. See Richa rds on v . Fe lix, 856 F.2d 505, 509 (3d Cir. 1988). Accordingly, Hassell's Section 530 claim is denied. 16. T he Cou rt c onclude s that Defendant s did not violate t he Four teent h Amendment righ ts o f Plaint iffs Gu sta ve, Jar vis, a nd Ha ssell. Conclusions of Law applicable to Plaintiff Jeremiah Lee 17. When the contents of a document are relevant to an issue in a case, the trier of fact generally may receive the fact of the document's nonproduction or destruction as evidence that the par ty t hat has p rev ent ed p ro duc tio n did s o o ut of w ell-fo und ed fe ar t hat the co nte nts wo uld harm him. See Gumbs v. International Harvester, Inc., 718 F.2d 88, 96 (3d Cir. 1983). In Gumbs, the cour t pr ovides: ""For t he rule t o app ly, it is essent ial that t he evidence in q uest ion be within the party's possession or control. Further, it must appear that there has been an actual suppr ession o r withho lding of the evidence; no unfavor able inference a rises when t he circumstances indicate that the document . . . in question has been lost or accidentally destroyed, or where the failure to produce it is otherwise properly accounted for."" Gumbs, 718 F.2d at 96. 18. I n the inst ant ca se, bas ed upo n the st atement of Schneid er t hat he ha d signed t he NOPA fo r Lee, the ad mission of Fred ericks t hat t he orig inals of all the NO PAs sho uld always be in the physical possession of the Gover nment, a nd the G overnment 's failure t o pr oper ly account 19   for its inability to produce the original NOPA, the Court concludes that the information contained in the NOPA would harm the interests of the Government. Therefore, the Court concludes that the NOPA for Lee was actually signed by the Governor of the Virgin Islands at the time, Schneider , and t hat t he NOPA w as signed s ome time befo re t he December 17, 1 998, telepho ne conversation between Schneider and Lee. 19. Further, ""where the written instrument cannot be pro duced either through its loss, dest ruct ion or cust ody by one w ho fails or refuses to p rod uce it, it is compe tent for t he part y who asserts its existence to prove its contents by secondary evidence either parol or written."" Cooper v. Brown, 126 F.2d 874, 877 (3d Cir. 1942). 20. Ina smuc h as t he NO PA fo r Le e wa s sig ned b y the the n Go ver nor of t he Vir gin Islands, Schneider, Lee's employment became effective at the time of the signing, on or about December 17, 1998. See 3 V.I.C.  526(a) (1995) (""Ap po intme nts to the clas sified ser vice s hall be effective as and when made by the Governor . . . .""). 21. The protection of First and Fourteenth Amendment rights are guaranteed in the case of a failure t o hire, just as t hey are in the case o f a ter mination base d upo n political sp eech and political activity. See Rut an v. Rep ublica n Pa rt y of I llinois , 497 U.S. 62 (1990) (holding that Elrod and Branti apply to promotion, transfer, recall, and hiring decisions based on party affiliation and support). Therefore, Defendants' failure to hire Lee for his political activity was unlaw ful. 22. Finally, beca use t he Cou rt finds t hat t he issue o f back pay is mor e appr opr iate for the damages p hase of t his claim, the de ter mination re garding Lee's claim for back pa y will not be decided at this time. 20   Qualified Immunity 23. Defendant Turnbull has plead as an affirmative defense that this action is barred as to him by t he d oc tr ine o f qu alifie d immu nit y. 24. ""[ G]o vernment officials performing discretionary functions . . . generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known."" Harlow v. Fitz ger ald, 457 U.S. 800 , 818 (1982). In addressing a qualified immunity claim, the Court must first asc ert ain wh et her Plaint iffs' cla ims make ou t a viola tio n of a co nst itu tio nal r ight . On ly if suc h a vio lat ion is sho wn, need the Cou rt pro cee d t o d et ermine whet her in light of ""c lear ly est ablishe d law ,"" t he un lawfu lness of t he ac tio n wo uld ha ve be en ap par ent to the rea son able official. See Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 231 (1991). 25. Plaintiffs George, Jackson, Sprauve, Callwood, and Lee have made out a violation of a co nst itu tio nal r ight . Fu rt her , t he la w vio lat ed in the inst ant cas e is c lear ly est ablis hed . Fin ally, since a re aso nably c omp et ent offic ial sho uld k now the law g ove rning his co ndu ct , t he Go ver nor is not entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the constitutional claims of Plaintiffs George, Jackson, Sprauve, Callwood and Lee. See Goo d v. Da uphin Cou nty So cial Serv. 891 F.2d 1087, 1091 (3d Cir. 1989). 26. Beca use P laintiffs J arvis , Gu sta ve and Hass ell have n ot made o ut a violat ion o f a constitutional right, Defendant Turnbull is immune from personal liability with respect to t hese Plaintiffs.

T he par t icipat ing depar tment s on the Task Force are: * Aust in, TX / IA FF Local 975 * Los Angele s Count y, CA / IA FF Local 1014 * Calgar y, ALB / IA FF Local 255 * Metro Dade Count y, FL / IA FF Local 1403 * Charlot te, NC / IA FF Local 660 * Ne w York Cit y, N Y / IA FF Local 94/854 * Fair fa x Count y, VA / IA FF Local 2068 * Phoenix, AZ / IA FF Local 493 * India napolis, IN / IA FF Local 416 * Seat tle, WA / IA FF Local 27 T he Task Force succe ssful ly de velop ed t he Fire Ser v ice Joint Labor-Ma nagement Wel lne ss-Fitne ss Init iat ive in 1997 to addre ss the need for a holist ic and non-punit ive approach to wel lne ss a nd fitne ss i n the fire serv ice. T he Task Force then discovered t hat municipalit ie s were h iring people who would not be physical ly capable of a succe ssful career i n t he fire ser v ice. T he Task Force, t herefore, una nimously agreed to develop a physical abilit y te st for pre-employment te st ing of ca ndidate s. T he Task Force has de veloped a nd validated t he Candidate Physical Abilit y Te st (CPAT), re sult ing in a consistent te st for hiring of candidate firefighter s. lated to t he se 31 tasks. T he crit ical a nd physical task ski l ls t hat al l firefighter s should posse ss were validated (t hrough que st ionnaire s) by 1,000 firefighter s from t he ten depar tment s. Select ion of t he 1,000 firefighter s was ra ndom a nd a nonymous, but consistent w it h t he race a nd gender diver sit y of t he specific depar tment. T he completed re sult s of t he sur ve ys re sulted i n t he de velopment of a serie s of physical abi lit y te st s t hat were selected based on t he result s of t he data i ndicat i ng t he physicalit y a nd cr it icalit y of t he tasks per for med by firefighter s. Props for each event were built and modified to obtain t he nece ssar y i nfor mat ion regar di ng ca ndidate's abi lit y. T he props were t hen placed i n a sequence t hat would be st simulate t heir use i n a fire scene. T he Technical Committee chose to move t he ca ndidate s along a predetermi ned pat h from e vent to e vent i n a cont inuous ma nner requiring a ma ndator y walk bet ween e vent s. Because of t he te st set up, individual event t ime s would be a n ineffect ive measure of a candidate's abilit y, so an overal l te st t ime needs to be e stablished. Numerous individuals were r un through t he te st i ncluding technical staff members, incumbent firefighters, lay people and a recruit class. T he overal l consensus found t he te st to be a goo d predictor of a n applicant's abi lit y to per for m basic fire fighti ng tasks. T he Technical Commit tee was confident t hat t he abi lit y te st would prov ide t he fire ser v ice w it h a physically competent recruit. There was also unanimous agreement t hat t he te st equaled or was super ior to cur rent te st s r un by each of t he ten jurisdict ions. T he se te st s were fi lmed at different sp eeds a nd pre sented to super v isor s i n t he ten jurisdict ions (captains a nd bat talion ch iefs w it h exp erience i n firefighter traini ng). At t he complet ion of t h is proce ss, a n entr y te st was fi nalized a nd pre sented to t he Task Force for adopt ion. T he Task Force una nimously adopted t he ful l Ca ndidate Physical Abi lit y Te st w it h a pass/fai l t ime of 10 mi nute s a nd 20 seconds. T he te st may only be admi nistered on a pass/ fai l basis; municipalit ie s may not ra nk ca ndidate s based upon CPAT complet ion t ime s.  Developing the CPAT T he Task Force directed t he Technical Commit tee to develop a per forma nce te st for t he ten jurisdict ions t hat measure s t he crit ical ski l ls of firefighter ca ndidate s. Commit tee member s re v ie wed six of t he ten jur isdict ions' job a nalysis and job task surveys. They also reviewed each of the ten jur isdict ions' cur rent ca ndidate per for ma nce te st s and job de scr ipt ions. Addit ional ly, a complete equipment a nd demograph ics sur ve y was also completed by t he ten jur isdict ions. T he equipment sur ve y prov ided t ype s a nd weight s of al l firefighter protect ive clot h ing, protect ive equipment, fire depar tment equipment a nd fire depar tment tools. It also asse ssed t he average weight of firefighter s i n each jur isdict ion as wel l as t he average weight of emergenc y room a nd hospital-admit ted pat ient s. Demograph ic profi l e s of each jurisdict ion were also de veloped. Usi ng t he data collected, t he Commit tee t hen der ived a list of 31 tasks to i nve st igate. T he y de velop ed sur ve y que st ions directly re-  Administering the CPAT In developing the CPAT Program, the Task Force recognized t hat t he fire depar tment should reflect t he communit y it ser ve s. In to day's societ y, communit ie s are increasi ngly diver se a nd firefighter s are cont inual ly challenged to operate in mult i-cultural environment s. T he goal of t he CPAT is to te st for those individuals physical ly qualified to per form t he job of firefighter w it hout separat ing from the depar tment's broader goal of at taini ng a properly trai ned   Page 8 Candidate Physical Ability Test - and Explanation Continued  The Fire Service News  and physically capable workforce whose members reflect the diver sit y of t he communit y. Diver sit y should never come by lowering validated entr y standar ds. Rather, it should come from act ively recr uit ing qualified men and women candidate s from all racial and ethnic backgrounds for careers in the fire ser v ice. It is t he posit ion of t he IA FF/ICHIEFS Joi nt L abor Ma nagement Wel lne ss-Fitne ss Init iat ive Task Force that fire depar tment s should i ncrease t he diver sit y of their workforce by act ively recr uit ing ca ndidate s from t hroughout their communit ie s rather t han lowering candidate physical abi lit y sta ndar ds. T he CPAT Program detai ls avenue s fire depar tment s can pur sue to raise awarene ss of job oppor tunit ie s and to recr uit men or qualified candidate s w it h in the fire serv ice before the te st is administered. The CPAT goal was to develop a fair and valid evaluat ion tool in the select ion of firefighters to ensure that all firefighter candidate s posse ss t he physical abi lit y to complete crit ical tasks effect ively and safely. T his CPAT Program covers e ver y aspect of administering t he CPAT: from recruit ing and mentoring programs, to providing recruit s w ith fitne ss guidance to help prepare them for the CPAT, to set t ing up and administering t he te st. T he ent ire validat ion proce ss is discussed in detail, as well as the legal issue s that depar tments might face when implement ing the actual program. After a municipalit y has completed al l aspect s of recr uiti ng a nd mento r i ng ca ndidate s, t he y may admi nister t he actual eight-e vent te st. Dur i ng t he ent ire te st t he ca ndi-  date must wear a 50-pound weighted ve st (simulat ing t he weight of a firefighter's protect ive clot h ing a nd equipment). The eight events are:  Stair Climb (climbi ng stair s wh ile car r ying a n addit ional 25-pound simulated hose pack),  Ladder Raise and Extension (placing a ground ladder at the fire scene and extending the ladder to the roof or a w indow),  Hose Drag (stretching uncharged hoseline s, advancing line s),  Equipment Car r y (remov ing a nd car r yi ng equipment from fire apparatus to fireground),  Forcible Entr y (penetrat ing a locked door, breaching a wal l),  Search (crawling through dark unpredictable areas to search for v ict ims),  Re scue Drag (remov i ng v ict im or par tner from a fire building), and  Ceiling Pul l (locat ing fire and checking for fire extension). T he Wel lne ss/Fitne ss Init iat ive and t he Candidate Physical Abi lit y Te st Program have been re v ie wed a nd ut ilized by fire depar tment s t h roughout t he United State s a n d Canada.

GX260-30-9496326	"2001 - 2003 U.S. GOVERNMENT TTY DIRECTORY  PREFACE The Telecommunications Accessibility Enhancement Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-542) tasks the General Services Administration (GSA) with ensuring that the Federal Technology Service be fully accessible to individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have speech disabilities. To accomplish this, GSA established the Federal Relay Service (FRS) in 1989. In 1998, the FRS program was expanded and services were made available to meet evolving requirements for enhanced services and f eatures. FRS relays calls between individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have speech disabilities and individuals who speak and hear without difficulty. FRS is accessible domestically (fif ty stat es as well as Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and the District of Columbia) and non-domestically (280 countries worldwide). It enables Federal employees to conduct official duties and the general public to conduct business with the Federal government and its agencies. Many of you are either users of the Federal Relay Service or have employees who are benefiting from using this vital service. Another requirement of Public Law 100-542 is for GSA to publish and maintain a directory of Federal Government TTY (t ext t elephone) numbers. In addition to the published U.S. Government TTY Directory, information is available on-line via the Automat ed Federal TTY Directory and through the worldwide web. You will find information on the inside cover of this directory under TTY Usage. Developing the directory and maintaining its accuracy are difficult tasks. Your assistance in keeping us post ed about the accuracy of these listings is very important. If there has been an omission or if a change is necessary, please inform us immediat ely using the form provided in the directory. Thank you for your support in helping to ensure accessibility to the Federal Government for all citizens.  Sandra N.

Section I displays tables for selected variables in the core. In Section I, there are three tables for each risk factor or preventive measure unless otherwise noted. Estimated prevalence and relevant statistics are provided for the total population sampled and by sex. Prevalence estimates for both 1999 and 2000, or where appropriate 1998 and 2000, and the percentage point difference between the estimates are given for variables in the core. Section II shows tables for selected variables in modules used by at least 13 states. Section II contains two tables for each risk factor or preventive measure of interest in the modules. These tables show the estimated prevalence and relevant statistics for the total sampled population and both sex groups who responded to selected questions in the optional modules. Section III contains tables for preventive health measures that are related to women's health issues. Estimated prevalence and relevant statistics are provided for the total population sampled. Prevalence estimates for both 1999 and 2000 and the percentage point difference between them are given. Three tables (Tables 1.1-1.3) from Section I will be used as examples to explain the information contained in this report. Each table describes a behavioral risk factor or preventive health measure from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) instrument. Table 1.1 (page 1) shows the estimated prevalence and relevant statistics for each participant. (Participants refer to all states, and the District of Columbia and territories of the U.S.). The table shows the estimated prevalence and relevant statistics for ""fair or poor health status"" in the population surveyed by each BRFSS participant. This prevalence estimate excludes respondents with unknown information on self reported health status or respondents choosing not to answer the question. The columns in Table 1.1 provide the following information:  vii   COLUMN HEADING Participant Sample size  CONTENTS Name of the participant. Participants refers to all states including the District of Columbia and territories of the United States. The number of individuals who responded to the specific BRFSS question. These are unweighted numbers. These numbers exclude individuals who reported ""not sure, don't know"", those who refused to answer the question, or had no response coded (missing or skipped). An estimate of the percent (or prevalence or mean number) of residents who report the behavioral risk factor of interest. This is weighted to the participant's population to estimate the true prevalence or mean in the population. A measure of the amount of variability that exists in the calculation of the prevalence estimate.  Percent/Mean  Standard error  95% confidence interval A range which contains the true population prevalence estimate 95% of the time, if repeated sampling of the population is performed. SUMMARY STATISTICS are given at the bottom of the table: Number of participants Median Range The total number of participants who asked question(s)regarding the respective ""risk factor"". The middle value of all estimated prevalences. The lowest prevalence and the highest prevalence among all participants.  For example, in Table 1.1, there were 2237 individuals in the state of Alabama who responded to the ""self reported health status"" question. Of those responding, the estimated prevalence of Alabama's population who reported that they had fair or poor health status is 19.3%. This prevalence estimate has a standard error of 0.9. The 95% confidence interval for this estimate is (17.6,21.0). Ninety-five percent (95%) of confidence intervals generated under repeated sampling will contain the true population prevalence of Alabama's population who ""had fair or poor health status"".  viii   Table 1.2 (page 2) shows the estimated prevalence and relevant statistics by sex for each state participant. The same statistics are displayed in Table 1.2 as in Table 1.1, except that Table 1.2 shows the estimated prevalence of Aself reported fair or poor health statusA for males and females separately. This side by side display of the tables permits each participant to compare estimates for males and females in their respective state. Table 1.3 (page 3) shows the percent difference between the prevalence estimates of self reported fair or poor health status in 1999 and 2000 survey years. A negative change indicates a decrease in prevalence from 1999 to 2000, while a positive change indicates an increase in prevalence between the two years. This difference gives state health officials a quick method to examine changes that may have occurred in their respective state. Some of these changes may have resulted from legislative actions (or inactions) in the state, programs funded, or programs that came into existence because of results that states may have shown from the BRFSS. Since changes between two years may be attributable to many factors, conclusions drawn from this table should be interpreted with extreme caution. Sample Size. Sample sizes vary by question. Some estimates may be based on responses from less than 50 respondents. Interpreting estimates that are based on a small number of respondents can mislead the reader into believing that a given finding is much more precise than it actually is. The BRFSS recommends not interpreting percentages where the denominator is based upon fewer than 50 unweighted respondents (sample size).  ix   DEFINITIONS OF TERMS AND RISK FACTORS IN THIS REPORT  AIDS KNOWLEDGE/ATTITUDES HIV TEST - Respondents, age 18-64, who did not have an HIV test in the past 12 months.

The information was obtained from the data files of individual states. Therefore, while all participants use telephone surveys to collect the data, the data in this report vary somewhat with respect to data collection, sampling design and sample size. A. Data Collection, Sample Design and Sample Size All states conduct interviews using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) software program. All states use probability-based methods to select their sample. The BRFSS standard for sample designs is that sample records must be justifiable as a probability sample of all households with telephones in the state. All participating areas met this criterion in 2000. For data year 2000, one state, Minnesota used the Mitofsky-Waksberg method of sampling. Fortynine states and the District of Columbia used a disproportionate stratified sample (DSS) design. Puerto Rico used a simple random sample design. In a few states, a portion of sample records intended for use during one month may have been completed in another month. This deviation should only affect analyses based on monthly, rather than annual data. Illinois used a dual questionnaire or split sample survey design. Several states did not collect data for all twelve months of the year. Ohio did not collect data January through March, or July through September. Their data include interviews completed in January and February of 2001. Arizona is missing data in July, August, September and December. The District of Columbia did not start the survey until April. Hawaii did not release telephone numbers in accordance with protocol and may have introduced bias into the survey. More information about the quality of the survey data can be found in the 2000 BRFSS Summary Quality Control Report. B. Sample Size, Estimates and Other Limitations of the Data Although almost all states collect data monthly, the annual number of interviews range from 1717 in the District of Columbia to 8149 in Massachusetts. Estimates for some states are therefore based upon smaller sample sizes, and for rare events (e.g. diabetes), may yield unstable estimates. Some items such as immunizations are affected by seasonality, and estimates for these items may be biased for subpopulations. As in previous years, California modified the wording of mammography, breast exam and Papanicolaou (PAP) smear questions, and are therefore excluded from those tables in the report. The physical activity, fruits and vegetables, and weight control questions were asked of only half of Illinois sample due to their dual survey design. These estimates are presented in Tables 10.110.3 through 14.1-14.3. More than 7%, (n=309) of Puerto Rico=s respondents did not answer the fruit and vegetable questions and are counted as missing values in the calculation of the five or more servings a day estimate in Tables 13.1-13.3. All data collection systems are subject to error, and records may be incomplete or contain inaccurate information. Respondents may not remember essential information, a question may xv   not mean the same thing to different respondents, and some individuals may not respond at all. It is not always possible to measure the magnitude of these errors or their impact on the data. The data user must make his or her own evaluation of the data. Overall estimates generally have relatively small sampling errors, but estimates for certain population subgroups may be based on small numbers and have relatively large sampling errors. When the number of events is small and the probability of such an event is small, considerable caution must be observed in interpreting the estimates and/or differences between groups and areas.  xvi   TABLE 1.1 2000 BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE DATA ESTIMATED PREVALENCE AND RELEVANT STATISTICS FOR SELF REPORTED HEALTH STATUS* DENOMINATOR EXCLUDES MISSING, DON'T KNOW, AND REFUSED SAMPLE SIZE 223 207 267 300 390 305 390 275 171 518 410 601 497 379 291 360 422 641 500 459 458 812 259 285 217 438 301 309 210 195 377 324 334 301 191 324 368 374 353 353 331 498 303 500 289 362 198 357 235 271 238 420 7 9 1 0 5 3 9 7 3 4 3 1 3 2 6 7 4 0 2 3 3 7 8 1 4 2 6 2 0 2 3 4 9 0 3 6 2 2 2 8 2 5 2 4 0 4 7 2 1 0 7 1 STANDARD ERROR 0.9 1.1 1.4 0.8 0.8 0.9 0.7 0.8 0.9 0.6 0.7 0.6 0.6 0.7 0.7 0.6 0.6 0.7 0.6 0.9 0.7 0.5 0.7 0.6 1.0 0.7 0.7 0.6 1.3 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.8 0.7 0.8 0.9 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.5 0.8 0.7 0.8 0.6 0.9 0.6 1.0 0.7 0.8 0.9 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( 17. 8. 12. 17. 15. 10. 12. 10. 10. 14. 13. 11. 12. 11. 12. 9. 11. 20. 15. 12. 11. 12. 12. 8. 18. 13. 9. 10. 13. 8. 14. 15. 13. 15. 9. 11. 14. 15. 13. 13. 13. 11. 16. 18. 10. 10. 11. 10. 23. 11. 11. 31. 6, 2, 1, 5, 1, 9, 6, 8, 5, 2, 8, 3, 0, 7, 7, 7, 3, 3, 1, 9, 5, 6, 2, 5, 3, 9, 9, 1, 2, 6, 4, 7, 2, 2, 9, 6, 1, 4, 0, 5, 6, 2, 8, 9, 0, 0, 4, 7, 5, 3, 6, 0, 21 12 17 20 18 14 15 14 14 16 16 13 14 14 15 12 13 22 17 16 14 14 15 10 22 16 12 12 18 11 17 18 16 18 13 14 16 18 15 16 16 13 19 21 13 12 14 13 27 14 14 34 .0) .3) .6) .5) .2) .5) .2) .0) .0) .4) .6) .5) .2) .3) .4) .0) .5) .9) .5) .5) .1) .4) .1) .9) .1) .7) .8) .5) .3) .5) .1) .5) .3) .1) .0) .9) .6) .3) .7) .2) .4) .1) .9) .5) .1) .3) .8) .1) .3) .2) .7) .7)  1  PARTICIPANT ALA ALA ARI ARK CAL COL CON DEL DIS FLO GEO HAW IDA ILL IND IOW KAN KEN LOU MAI MAR MAS MIC MIN MIS MIS MON NEB NEV NEW NEW NEW NEW NOR NOR OHI OKL ORE PEN RHO SOU SOU TEN TEX UTA VER VIR WAS WES WIS WYO PUE BA SK ZO AN IF OR NE AW TR RI RG AI HO IN IA A SA TU IS NE YL SA HI NE SI SO TA RA AD H J M Y TH TH O AH GO NS DE TH TH NE AS H MO GI HI T CO MI RT MA A NA SAS ORNIA ADO CTICUT ARE ICT OF CO DA IA I OIS NA S CKY IANA AND CHUS GAN SOTA SSIP URI NA SKA A AMPS ERSE EXIC ORK CAR DAK OMA N YLVA ISL CAR DAK SSEE  PERCENT 19 10 14 19 16 12 13 12 12 15 15 12 13 13 14 10 12 21 16 14 12 13 13 9 20 15 11 11 15 10 15 17 14 16 11 13 15 16 14 14 15 12 18 20 11 11 13 11 25 12 13 32 .3 .3 .8 .0 .7 .7 .9 .4 .3 .3 .2 .4 .1 .0 .1 .9 .4 .6 .3 .7 .8 .5 .7 .7 .2 .3 .3 .3 .8 .1 .7 .1 .8 .7 .5 .3 .4 .9 .4 .8 .0 .1 .3 .2 .6 .2 .1 .9 .4 .8 .1 .8  ETTS  PI  HIRE Y O OLINA OTA  NIA AND OLINA OTA  NT NIA NGTON VIRGINIA NSIN NG O RICO  SUMMARY STATISTICS: NO.

DECISION FOR BLY MTN.

Tim ber S ale. T his w ill involve harv estin g ap prox ima tely 1 .1 million board feet (MBF) over approximately 700 acres. The EA addresses a number of issues inc lud ing tho se rais ed du ring the pu blic sco pin g a nd tou rs. T ho se issu es tha t are ad dre sse d in the EA include;                 Number and size of trees to be removed (partial cutting versus clearcutting) Redu ction of g round fu els Availab ility of firew ood for th e public Forest health problems on federal lands on the eastside Project Maps Impact on deer herds Access into the area and on-going trash and dumping problems in Bly Mtn. Area Roadless areas > 1000 acres Treatment of older forest stands Roads (new construction and obliteration) Salvage Soil disturbance Vegetation disturbance Use of prescribed fire Riparian Reserve treatments Wate rshed A nalysis  Some of the public scoping issues that were raised are not applicable to the proposed treatments because the proposed treatments are outside the Northwest Forest Plan geographic boundary and the issue is non existent in the area. These issues include:        Soil and Vegetation disturbance in Key Watersheds (No Key Watersheds in the project area) Soil and Vegetation disturbance in Municipal Watersheds (No Municipal Watersheds in project area) Activities in late successional reserves (Outside NFP boundary) Surveys for ""Survey and Manage Species""(Outside NFP boundary) Pacific Yew (No Pacific Yew in the project area) Northern Spotted O wl critical habitat (Outside the NFP boundary - Eastside s ale) Fragmentation o f large blocks of mature fores t (No large blocks of ma ture forest)  The treatment area is outside the known range of the Northern Spotted Owl and the boundary of the a rea a naly zed in the No rthw est F ores t Plan .

DECISION RATIONALE The decision is consistent with the goals and objectives of the: C Final Klamath Falls Resource Area Resource Management Plan (RMP) and its Record of De cision (Jun e 19 95). C Klam ath Fa lls Reso urce A rea F ire Ma nag em ent E A (O R-01 4-94-0 9) C Klam ath Fa lls Reso urce A rea Integ rated W eed Con trol Plan E A (O R-01 4-93-0 9). C The proposed trea tments and projec ts are being planned und er the direction of:  Range Reform FEIS (August 1995)  Standards For Rangeland Health And Guidelines For Livestock Management For Public Lands Administered By The Bureau Of Land Management In The State Of Oregon And Washington (August 12, 1997)  Final Environmen tal Impact Statem ent, Vegetation Treatm ent On BLM Lands In Thirteen W estern States(1991)  Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project/Eastside Draft Environmental Impact Statement (ICBEMP)May 1997. A comparison of the proposed treatments with the direction of the preferred alternative in the draft EIS for ICBEMP indicates that the proposed action meets the intent and general direction of that alternative. The final decision for ICBEMP could amend direction for future treatment under this EA . As n oted in th e FO NS I determ ination, the im pacts c reated by the abov e dec ision do not req uire further analysis. Altern ative A w as s elec ted b eca use it repre sen ts the ma jor pre scrip tion p rovid ed b y the Klam ath Fa lls R M P. A ll imp ac ts id en tified in th is as se ssm en t an d id en tified by the ge ne ral p ub lic ar e w ithin the sco pe of th e F EIS . So il dist urb an ce leve ls co ntin ue to b e m on itore d a nn ua lly to de term ine if impacts exceed those analyzed in the Klamath Falls FEIS. Two seasons of pre and post treatment stand exams of RMP timber sales indicate that post-harvest stand characteristics (inc lud ing ca no py clos ure , res idu al la rge tree co m po ne nt, s truc ture , an d d ow n w oo dy m ate rial) are in co mp liance w ith the Klam ath Fa lls RM P. In ad dition, pos t-harves t biological su rveys a re indica ting th at po st-ha rves t stan ds a re co ntinu ing to serv e as late s ucc ess iona l hab itat. Po stharv est s tand exa ms are a lso ind icating that fo llow- up p resc ribe fire s (un derb urns ) are p oss ible to furthe r redu ce fire risks. Alternative B (exclude Swan Lake Rim) was rejected because the density and juniper encroachment issue is relevant to forest and woodlands on Swan lake Rim. If helicopter logging on Swan Lake Rim is too costly, only those commercial forest stands that can be ground based logged will be treated. Altern ative C (s alva ge o nly) w as a lso re jecte d be cau se it d oes not a deq uate ly ad dres s de nsity control needed to improve stand resiliency. The Roaming Salvage Timber Sale Environmental Assessment (EA # OR-014-96-02) address salvage harvest in the Klamath Falls Resource Area. Altern ative D (n o trea tme nt) w as re jecte d be cau se it w ould not re solv e the imm edia te ne ed to address manual density control concerns for improved forest health in the areas covered under the environmental analysis. The only density control under Alternative D would be through the use of prescribed fire. Although prescribed fire has proven to be an effective way to reduce densities, prescribed fire may sometimes result in loss of entire patches/canopy, preferred spe cies , and large r trees in are as w here fuel loa ds a nd ris ks a re hig h an d un con trollab le. Deferring harvest would result in continued suppression and loss of existing shade-intolerant   sp ec ies (po nd ero sa pin e, s ug ar p ine , an d D ou gla s-fir) . Ex istin g c on ditio ns wo uld no t sig nific an tly impro ve if the are as w ere de ferred from harve st. The im pacts o f future ha rvest w ould n ot vary substantially from those anticipated under the proposed action. Under the no treatment alternative, the ongoing mortality in many existing stands may result in deteriorated stand con dition s, incr eas ed fu el loa ds, a nd a corre spo ndin g inc reas ed ris k of s tand -rep lacing wildfire s. Alternative D provides no economic benefit to communities associated with harvesting and processing forest products. Mitigating Measures 1) During the public scoping, there was some requests that firewood be made available upon completion of harvesting. Some additional requirements will be incorporated into the Timber Sale Contract that would allow easier access to residual slash. However, the Purchaser is entitled to all wood designated for removal and there is no guarantee that there would be any firewood available if the Purchaser chooses to remove the nonmerchantable material. Some of the juniper woodland treatments should provide som e fue l wo od m ateria l for loca l resid ents . One of the issues raised during the public scoping and tours was the illegal dumping of trash on public lands in the area. The Klamath Falls Resource Area is in the initial phase of planning a clean-up of illegal dump sites in the Klamath Forest Estates Area. The community will be asked to volunteer with the cleanup. In addition, the BLM's law en forc em en t offic er is inve stig atin g th e p res en t site s to de term ine if ha za rdo us m ate rial is involved and responsible parties.  2)  _____________________________________ Teri Raml Klamath Falls Resource Area Manager  Date_____________"

GX260-58-15285898	"An update on  Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation of resources affected by mining that took place before the Surface Mining Law was passed in 1977. itle IV of SMCRA -- the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Program -- provides for the restoration of lands mined and abandoned or left inadequately restored before August 3, 1977. Implementation is accomplished through an Emergency Program (problems having a sudden danger that presents a high probability of substantial harm to the health, safety, or general welfare of people before the danger can be abated under normal program operating procedures) and a non-emergency program. Just as in the regulatory programs, states and tribes with approved programs carry out these responsibilities. Expenditures from the fund are made through the regular budgetary and appropriation process. In 1992, under authority of Public Law 101-508, the Office of Surface Mining began investing abandoned Fund Collections 1978-1996  mined underground, and 10 cents per ton of lignite are collected from coal producers at all active coal mining operations. The fees are deposited in the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, which is used to pay the reclamation costs of abandoned mine land reclamation projects. The fund consists of fees, contributions, late payment interest, penalties, administrative charges, and interest earned on investment of the fund's principal. From January 30, 1978, when the first fees were paid, through September 30, 1996, the fund collections total $4,408,918,411.  tion program, or within Indian lands where the tribe has an approved reclamation program, are to be allocated to that state or tribe. This 50 percent is designated as the state or tribal share of the fund. The remaining 50 percent (the federal share) is used by the Office of Surface Mining to complete high priority and emergency projects under its Federal Reclamation Program, to fund the Small Operator Assistance Program (SOAP), to fund projects  directly through state reclamation programs, and to pay audit and administrative costs. In 1991, at the direction of Congress, a formula to distribute federal-share money to the state reclamation programs was established based on historic coal production. Table 9 shows collections and funding by states for 1996. The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-508) extended fee collection authority through September 30, 1995; the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-468) further extended fee collection authority until September 30, 2004.

Total investment earnings for 1996 were $81.53 million. The average interest earned during the year was 5.07 percent. At the end of the year, the Office of Surface Mining had more than $1.4 billion invested in Treasury securities. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-486) stipulated  Grants to States and Tribes Beginning with Texas in 1980, the Office of Surface Mining began approving state reclamation programs. Currently, all primacy states except Mississippi have approved abandoned mine land reclamation programs. During 1988, the Navajo and Hopi Tribe programs were approved, and in 1989 the Crow Tribe received approval for its program. In 1996, the states and the tribes received grants totaling $179,690,736.

The 1979-1996 net grant awards for abandoned mine land construction projects totaled $1.6 billion, and construction obligations at the state/ tribe level totaled $1.5 billion. Grant amounts for 1996 are shown in Table 10. On-the-ground coal mine reclamation accomplishments resulting from grant funding through 1996 are included in Table 13.  Simplified grant funding of state abandoned mine land programs started in 1994. This grant application process eliminates the requirement for advance approval of each reclamation project before a grant is awarded to the state. States receive amounts based on appropriated spending levels and are held accountable for using those funds in accordance with their approved abandoned mine land plan.

Subsidence Insurance Public Law 98-473 authorized states and tribes with approved reclamation programs to use abandoned mine land funds to establish self-sustaining, individually administered programs to insure private property against damage caused by land subsidence resulting from abandoned underground coal mines. Implementing rules were promulgated in February 1986. Under those rules, states can receive a subsidence insurance grant of up to $3,000,000, awarded from the state's share of the abandoned mine land fund.

A non-emergency is defined in 30 CFR 870.5 as ""a condition that could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to  147,991 1,263,409 50, 998 2,222,792 585,044 94, 206 60, 188 138,738 14, 300 1,838 73, 267 125,009 2,000 $325,687, 632  * Inc ludes prior year cont ract deobligations and upward adjustments.  24   persons, property, or the environment and to which persons or improvements on real property are currently exposed."" Until 1980, when states and Indian tribes began to receive approval of their abandoned mine land programs, all reclamation was administered by the Office of Surface Mining. However, as state and tribal programs were approved and the states and tribes assumed responsibility for correcting abandoned mine land problems, the Office of Surface Mining has greatly reduced its direct participation in the non-emergency portion of the program and during 1996 completed nonemergency projects in Georgia, Michigan, Tennessee, and Washington. Table 13 summarizes emergency and nonemergency abandoned coal mine reclamation project accomplishments through 1996. The Abandoned Mine Land Fund also is used to reclaim some problems created by non-coal mines. To be eligible for funding a noncoal project must be a Priority 1 (threat to health and safety) or the state or Indian tribe must certify it has addressed all known coal related problems. Noncoal reclamation project accomplishments are shown in Table 14.  Post-SMCRA Reclamation As authorized in the 1996 appropriations, federal civil penalties collected under Section 518 of SMCRA were used to reclaim lands mined and abandoned after August 3, 1977. In 1996, the Office of Surface Mining funded eight reclamation projects costing a total of $548,216 in Georgia and Kentucky. An additional $308,403 in unobligated funds will be carried over for use in 1997 reclamation projects.  Appalachian Clean Streams Initiative The Appalachian Clean Streams Initiative was started in the fall of 1994 by the Office of Surface Mining with the intent of developing remediation clean-up strategies to reduce and eliminate acid mine drainage from the Nation's streams. The principal source of acid mine drainage pollution in Appalachia is abandoned coal mines. Because of the extent and high reclamation cost of the pollution, this problem cannot be eliminated by any single government agency or group. As a result, the Clean Streams Initiative is designed to facilitate development of partnerships. Through this effort,  the Office of Surface Mining has partnered with over 100 government agencies, private watershed groups, environmental groups, private foundations, coal producers, and private individuals representing a strong beginning for the Clean Streams Initiative. Building on this foundation the FY 1997 appropriation is providing ""seed-money"" for 13 acid mine drainage clean-up projects in nine states. In addition, during 1996, Congress provided authority through the Interior Department's appropriation to allow states to use Abandoned Mine Lands grant money to match other funds committed to acid mine drainage projects. This will ensure  Early Spring seeding on a reclaimed burning refuse pile in Eastern Pennsylvania.  25   TABLE 13  ABANDONED MINE LAND COAL RECLAMATION ACCOMPLISHMENTS Industrial/Residential Waste2  PRIORITY 1 & 2 (Protection of Public Health, Safety, and General Welfare) and Emergency Projects 1978-1996 Clogg ed Streams Lands2 Piles & Embankments2 Equipment & Facilities Polluted Water: Human Consumption Underground Mine Fires2 4  Polluted Water:Ag./Ind.  4  4  Clogged Streams1  Impoundments  Water Bodies4  Al abam a Ala ska Ar kan sas Califor nia CE RT* Colo ra do Cr ow Georgi a Hop i Il lin ois In dia na Io wa Kan sas Ke ntucky Ma ry la nd Michig an M isso uri M onta na Nav aj o N.Ca ro li na N.

The Office of Surface Mining maintains its inventory on the Abandoned Mine Land Inventory System (AMLIS), a computer system that generates reports on abandoned mine land accomplishments and problems that still require reclamation. During 1996, for the second year, the states and Indian tribes managed their own data, entering it electronically into the Office of Surface Mining's inventory system. This process resulted in 437 records added, 1,401 modified, and 57 deleted.  Inventory of Abandoned Mine Land Problems SMCRA, as amended by the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-508), requires the Office of Surface Mining to maintain an inventory of eligible abandoned coal mine lands that meet the public health, safety, and general welfare criteria of Section 403(a)(1) and (2). This inventory is maintained and updated to reflect reclamation accomplishments as required by Section 403(c).  Abandoned underground mine portals are extremely dangerous and should never be entered.

A problem area is a geographic area, such as a watershed, that contains one or more abandoned mine problems. Problem area boundaries are delineated by the extent of their effect on surrounding land and water, not just the abandoned mine sites. The Surface Mining Law requires the Abandoned Mine Land Program to concentrate its efforts on high priority coal sites (those affecting health,  safety, and general welfare - Priority 1 and 2). Although the Abandoned Mine Land Program is one of the nation's most successful environmental restoration programs, with over $1.1 billion worth of coal-related high priority problems reclaimed, many projects have yet to be funded. The inventory of unfunded coalrelated problems is reduced each year by state, Indian tribe, and federal reclamation projects. Unfortunately, new problems are uncovered as development expands into old coal mining areas. As of September 30, 1996, a break-down of costs from  the National Inventory of Abandoned Mine Land Problems is as follows: Completed $1.1 billion 28.5% Funded $0.2 billion 5.6% Unfunded $2.3 billion 65.9% Total $3.6 billion 100%  of Surface Mining has presented awards to those individuals responsible for completion of the outstanding reclamation. Due to funding limitation, the Office of Surface Mining did not present awards in 1996. In 1997, reclamation awards once again will be presented to recognize the most exemplary reclamation in the country.  Reclamation Awards After more than 18 years of abandoned mine land reclamation funded under SMCRA, thousands of dangerous health and safety problems throughout the country have been eliminated.

GX001-00-4722605	KORZYSTAJ MĄDRZE Z LEKARSTW    Około 30% do 50% z tych, którzy zażywają lekarstwa nie robią tego według wskazówek lekarza. Z tego powodu ludzie muszą częściej iść do lekarza, pozostawać w szpitalu, tracić zarobki i zmieniać leki.  W konsekwencji Amerykanie z tego powodu każdego roku wydają $76.6 bilionów.   Często kobiety są odpowiedzialne nie tylko za swoje, ale również za lekarstwa dla całej rodziny. Musimy więc czytać opis na etykietkach jak dozować lek, unikać problemów, zadawać pytania i prowadzić zapis.    1. CZYTAJ OPIS NA ETYKIETKACH    Zanim zaczniesz brać jakiekolwiek lekarstwo, przeczytaj jak je stosować. Na etykietce powinny być:    Lista składników  - Jeśli wiesz, że masz uczulenie na jakiś składnik zawarty w danym leku, nie zażywaj go. Poproś lekarza lub farmaceutę o inne lekarstwo.    Ostrzeżenia  - Przeczytaj uważnie.    Data ważności  - Nie zażywaj lekarstwa po dacie ważności podanej na opakowaniu. Lekarstwo nie będzie już tak skuteczne.    O więcej informacji na temat lekarstwa zapytaj farmaceutę .    2. UNIKAJ PROBLEMÓW    Lekarstwa mogą spowodować problemy zdrowotne lub mieć działanie uboczne: takie jak bezsenność, wymioty, krwawienie, ból głowy lub podrażnienie skóry. Zapytaj o działanie uboczne leku, który zażywasz. Porozmawiaj z lekarzem, farmaceutą lub pielęgniarką.    Zorganizuj swoje lekarstwa.     Nie opuszczaj terminu zażycia lekarstwa.     Nie dziel się z nikim swymi lekarstwami.     Nie bierz leku po ciemku.     3. ZADAWAJ PYTANIA       Jaka jest nazwa lekarstwa?   Czy jest dostępny lek o nazwie niezastrzeżonej?   Dlaczego mam przyjmować ten lek?   Czy mam go zażyć na pusty żołądek czy razem z jedzeniem?   Czy można wypić kieliszek alkoholu zażywając lek?   Jeśli zapomnę zażyć lekarstwo, to co mam zrobić?   Ile lekarstwa mam wziąć jednorazowo?   Jak długo mam zażywać lekarstwo?   Na jakie efekty uboczne powinnam zwrócić uwagę?      Jeśli jesteś w ciąży lub karmisz dziecko piersią, zasięgnij zawodowej porady zanim przyjmiesz jakiekolwiek lekarstwo lub produkt uzupełniający jedzenie. Porozmawiaj ze swoim lekarzem, farmaceutą lub pielęgniarką. On/ona będą zadowoleni, że mogą ci służyć radą.   Lista alergii:   Lekarz:  Numer letefonu:    4.

GX002-26-7148182	"MATALINONG PAGGAMIT NG MGA MEDISINA          Halos tatlumpung hanggang limampung porsiyento ng mga gumagamit ng medisina ay hindi    sumusunod sa direksyon. Ito and dahilan kung bakit napapadalas and pagpunta sa doktor,    paghaba ng pagkaospital, pagbawas ng sahod, at pagpalit ng preskripsyon. Dahil nito,    nakakagastos ng 76.6 bilyong dolares bawat taon ang mga Americano.          Mga babae ang madalas na namamahala ng mga medisina para sa kanyang pamilya at sa    sarili. Gayon kailangan nating basahin ang mga etiketa, iwasan ang mga problema,    magtanong, at itala ang mga gamot.                           1. BASAHIN ANG ETIKETA           Basahin muna ang etiketa bago inumin ang gamot. Ito ay tagahiwatig ng:           Listahan ng mga sangkap -  Huwag gamitin ang medisina kung alam mong isa sa    mga sangkap ay mapinsala sa iyong kalusugan. Humingi ng ibang preskripsyon sa iyong    doktor o parmasyutiko.           Paalaala-  Basahin itong mabuti.           Petsa ng Pagwakas ng Bisa -  Huwag gamitin and medisina pagkaraan ng petsa    dahil maaaring wala na itong bisa.                                2.
