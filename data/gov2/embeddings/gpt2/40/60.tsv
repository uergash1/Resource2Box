The Gimp includes (among many other things) a wide variety of scripts for automatically generating logos. I used the ""Neon"" script, with the ""Blippo"" font and a pure green (RGB = 0.00, 1.00, 0.00) glow color. I then flattened the resulting multi-layered images and saved them as jpeg and as gif."

GX003-27-5654426	GNU tar   1.3: How  tar  Archives are Named    Conventionally,  tar  archives are given names ending with ` .tar '.  This is not necessary for  tar  to operate properly, but this manual follows that convention in order to accustom readers to it and to make examples more clear.     Often, people refer to  tar  archives as `` tar  files,'' and archive members as ``files'' or ``entries''.  For people familiar with the operation of  tar , this causes no difficulty.  However, in this manual, we consistently refer to ``archives'' and ``archive members'' to make learning to use  tar  easier for novice users.
