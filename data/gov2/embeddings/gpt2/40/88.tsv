The three-day battle ended with federal          troops surrendering to Commander of the State Guard Gen. Sterling Price.          In response to the state guard's victory, the Union rallied a massive          force and drove Price out of the Missouri Valley and back to the southwest          corner of Missouri.                   In May 1961,          between 20,000 and 25,000 spectators gathered to watch a reenactment of          that 1864 Civil War battle.

Nine dangerous mine shafts will be closed using a variety of reclamation              techniques in the Webb City area. These shafts, located on private              property, are the result of lead and zinc mining in the area from              1848 to 1970 and pose safety hazards to landowners and citizens.              The department has been actively involved in reclamation on abandoned              coal mines since 1980. This is the first year the abandoned mine land              funds have been used for non-coal reclamation. The U.S. Department              of the Interior, Office of Surface Mining and Missouri's Land Reclamation              Commission authorized the use of Missouri abandoned mine land funds              for reclamation of dangerous non-coal mine shafts.              Funds for abandoned mine land projects originate from fees collected              from active coal mines by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Office              of Surface Mining. These funds are then disbursed to state and tribal              abandoned mine land programs that have problems associated with coal              mining that occurred prior to 1977.              Previous studies and inventories conducted on the lead and zinc areas              in southwest Missouri indicate the possible existence of many more              mine openings.

Nine dangerous mine shafts will be closed using a variety of reclamation              techniques in the Webb City area. These shafts, located on private              property, are the result of lead and zinc mining in the area from              1848 to 1970 and pose safety hazards to landowners and citizens.              The department has been actively involved in reclamation on abandoned              coal mines since 1980. This is the first year the abandoned mine land              funds have been used for non-coal reclamation. The U.S. Department              of the Interior, Office of Surface Mining and Missouri's Land Reclamation              Commission authorized the use of Missouri abandoned mine land funds              for reclamation of dangerous non-coal mine shafts.              Funds for abandoned mine land projects originate from fees collected              from active coal mines by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Office              of Surface Mining. These funds are then disbursed to state and tribal              abandoned mine land programs that have problems associated with coal              mining that occurred prior to 1977.              Previous studies and inventories conducted on the lead and zinc areas              in southwest Missouri indicate the possible existence of many more              mine openings. The department is anticipating future abandoned mine              land funds will be available to close additional dangerous shafts.

The three-day battle ended with federal          troops surrendering to Commander of the State Guard Gen. Sterling Price.          In response to the state guard's victory, the Union rallied a massive          force and drove Price out of the Missouri Valley and back to the southwest          corner of Missouri.                   In May 1961,          between 20,000 and 25,000 spectators gathered to watch a reenactment of          that 1864 Civil War battle. The photo at right shows students of Wentworth          Military Academy reenacting the battle for the Oliver Anderson House.          During the course of the battle, the house ­ which was considered one          of the finest west of St. Louis ­ changed hands three times. The 1853          mansion is now open to the public as part of the  Battle          of Lexington State Historic Site.

The goal is to educate people and provide              alternative options, such as obtaining commercial trash service or              using a  permitted landfill ,  transfer              station , or  recycling              facility  for environmentally sound disposal.              The evidence contained on the tapes resulted in 14 guilty pleas of              23 counts of littering. Some of those caught on tape were frequent              visitors to the roadside dumpsite that has plagued Saline County for              many years.

GX000-31-7495214	"Privacy Statement      Thank you for visiting the White House Website and reviewing our privacy   policy. Our privacy policy is clear: We will collect   no  personal   information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide   that information to us.      Here is how we handle information about your visit to our website:        Information Collected and Stored Automatically      If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website, read   pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information   about your visit automatically. This information does  not  identify you   personally. We automatically collect and store  only  the following   information about your visit:                 The Internet domain (for example, ""xcompany.com"" if you use a     private Internet access account, or ""yourschool.edu"" if you connect from a     university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is     automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from     which you access our website;             The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;                 The date and time you access our site;             The pages you visit; and             If you linked to the White House website from another website, the     address of that website.            We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors   -- to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of   technology our visitors use. We do  not  track or record information about   individuals and their visits.        If You Send Us Personal Information      If you choose to provide us with personal information -- as in an e-mail   to the President, Vice President or someone else, or by filling out a form with   your personal information and submitting it to us through our website -- we use   that information to respond to your message and to help us get you the   information you have requested. We treat emails the same way we treat letters   sent to the White House. We are required to maintain many documents under the    Presidential Records   Act  for historical purposes, but we do not collect personal information for   any purpose other than to respond to you. We only share the information you   give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency,   or as otherwise required by law. Moreover, we do not create individual profiles   with the information you provide or to give it to any private organizations.   The White House does not collect information for commercial marketing.        Links to Other Sites       Our Website has links to many other federal agencies. In a few cases we   link to private organizations, with their permission. Before leaving the White   House website, a page will appear informing you that you are leaving our   server. Once you link to another site, you are subject to the privacy policy of   the new site.        Kids' Page      We at the White House are especially concerned about protecting   children's privacy. We hope parents and teachers are involved in children's   Internet explorations. It is particularly important for parents to guide their   children when children are asked to provide personal information on line. The   White House homepage for kids encourages children to send email messages to the   White House. We ask children to type their name, email address, and home   mailing address as part of their message so that we can respond personally to   them. Providing this information is entirely optional. We specifically ask   children to get their parents' permission before providing any information on   line -- at our site or any other site -- and hope parents will always be   involved in those decisions. Most importantly, when children do provide   information through the White House website, it is only used to enable us to   respond to the writer, and not to create profiles of children.
