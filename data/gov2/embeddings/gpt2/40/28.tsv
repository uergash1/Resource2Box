Yosemite Planning Page                  Chapter V:  Merced  Wild and  Scenic    River    Introduction    In 1987, the U.S. Congress designated the Merced River a Wild and Scenic River to protect its free-flowing condition and to protect and enhance its unique values for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations (16 United States Code 1271). This designation gives the  Merced  River  special protection under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and requires the managing agencies to prepare a comprehensive management plan for the river and its immediate environment.    After reaching a Record of Decision on the final environmental impact statement, the National Park Service released the  Merced Wild and Scenic River Comprehensive Management Plan  (referred to hereafter as the Merced River Plan) in February 2001, which outlines how the Merced Wild and  Scenic    River  corridor will be managed. The Merced River Plan applies seven management elements to prescribe desired future conditions, typical visitor activities and experiences, and park facilities and management activities allowed in the river corridor. The management elements include boundaries, classifications, Outstandingly Remarkable Values, the Wild and Scenic River Act Section 7 determination process, the River Protection Overlay, management zoning, and the Visitor Experience and Resource Protection framework.     The National Park Service uses the management elements as a set of decision-making criteria with which to evaluate projects in the Merced Wild and  Scenic   River  corridor, such as the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project. This chapter evaluates the consistency of the proposed action with the management elements of the Merced River Plan. An overview of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and of the Merced River Plan and its management elements may be found in the Merced River Plan (incorporated by reference) (NPS 2001a).    This chapter summarizes the consistency analysis with the Merced River Plan, including the findings of the Cascades Diversion Dam Project Wild and Scenic River Act Section 7 Determination, which is included in Appendix B, Merced Wild and Scenic River Section 7 Determination.    Consistency with Management Elements of the   Merced River  Plan    Relationship to the Boundary    The proposed action would occur within the Merced Wild and  Scenic   River  boundary in Segment 3A, Impoundment.    Classification Compatibility    The river segment at the dam from the top of the pool to 200 feet below the dam is classified as recreational, due to the human-made impoundment at the site. The river segments upstream and downstream of the dam are classified as scenic, a designation reserved for sections of rivers that are “free of impoundments, with shorelines or watersheds still largely primitive and shorelines largely undeveloped, but accessible in places by roads.” Upon implementation of the proposed action, the river segment through the dam site would be restored to a free-flowing state, near natural conditions. It would then be reclassified as scenic, as is called for in the Merced River Plan. The proposed action would reduce the aggregate amount and type of shoreline development. As a result, the proposed action is compatible with the resultant scenic classification.    Changing the classification from recreation to scenic would not affect visitor experience, natural, cultural, or social resources, or the associated Outstandingly Remarkable Values. Changing the classification is a technical adjustment consistent with the post-project site conditions, which will be “free of impoundments, with shorelines or watersheds still largely primitive and shorelines largely undeveloped, but accessible in places by roads.”      Outstandingly Remarkable Values    The proposed action would remove Cascades Diversion Dam and attendant structures, restoring the free-flowing condition of the Merced Wild and Scenic  River  and returning this portion of the river to a more natural state, thereby enhancing its integrity. Table B-2 (see Appendix B, Merced Wild and Scenic River Section 7 Determination) describes the effects of the proposed action on each of the Outstandingly Remarkable Values that apply to the Impoundment, Gorge, and El Portal river segments. As indicated in Table B-1, the proposed action would have a beneficial effect on the biological and hydrologic processes Outstandingly Remarkable Values. The proposed action would not result in any changes to the current level of protection and enhancement of the scientific, scenic, geologic processes, recreation, or cultural Outstandingly Remarkable Values. As a result, implementation of the proposed action would allow the National Park Service to protect and enhance the river’s Outstandingly Remarkable Values.    Wild and Scenic Rivers Act Section 7 Determination Process    Pursuant to the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, the National Park Service must carry out a Section 7 determination on all proposed water resources projects to ensure that they do not affect free flow and do not directly and adversely impact the Outstandingly Remarkable Values for which the river was designated. The proposed action would remove a human-made structure from the bed and banks of the Merced Wild and Scenic  River . Free-flow and natural fluvial processes (e.g., sediment transport, fish passage) would be returned to a more natural condition. Upon dam removal, the channel of the Merced Wild and Scenic  River  would naturally narrow and deepen. The floodplain in the immediate vicinity of the impoundment would be enlarged and stabilized. Riparian and floodplain extent, functions, and values would be enhanced. The proposed action would have a beneficial effect on the biological and hydrologic processes Outstandingly Remarkable Values. The proposed action would not result in any changes to the current level of protection and enhancement of the scientific, scenic, geologic process, recreation, and cultural Outstandingly Remarkable Values. The National Park Service concludes that the proposed action would enhance free flow of the Merced Wild and  Scenic   River  and would protect the Outstandingly Remarkable Values for which the river was designated Wild and Scenic. For additional detail, refer to Appendix B, Merced Wild and Scenic River Section 7 Determination.    River Protection Overlay    The proposed action would remove a human-made structure from the bed and banks of the Merced Wild and Scenic  River . Free-flow and natural fluvial processes would be returned to more natural conditions. One of the purposes of the River Protection Overlay is to protect and restore hydrologic processes within the river corridor. In the vicinity of Cascades Diversion Dam, the River Protection Overlay includes the Merced Wild and Scenic  River  channel itself, and extends 150 feet on both sides of the river, measured from the ordinary high-water mark. Presence of a nonessential facility within the River Protection Overlay is inconsistent with the River Protection Overlay purpose described above. Removal of the dam from the River Protection Overlay would rectify this inconsistency.      The proposed action is consistent with this management element of the Merced River Plan.    Management Zoning    The management zones applicable to the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project include:      §           Discovery (2B) north of the river in the Impoundment segment    §           Open Space (2A) south of the river in the Impoundment segment    The dam itself is located in management zones 2A and 2B. The Open Space (2A) zone allows for relatively undisturbed natural areas that receive only incidental or casual use, while the Discovery (2B) zone is characterized by relatively quiet natural areas, where visitor encounters are low to moderate. Because the proposed action would remove a human-made structure from the bed and banks of the Merced Wild and Scenic  River  and return this segment of the river to more natural conditions, the proposed action is consistent with this management element of the Merced River P

Search ALL of USGS   Feedback                     Estimating the Volume of Fine-Grained Sediments Behind Four Low-Head Dams, Kalamazoo River, Michigan            In cooperation with the  Michigan Department of  Environmental Quality,  Environmental Response  Division (MDEQ-ERD), the U.S. Geological Survey is estimating the volume of fine-grained materials within the impoundments of four low-head dams (Plainwell, Otsego City, Otsego, and  Trowbridge), located on the Kalamazoo River.         The restoration of natural flow regimes to rivers can have significant environmental and aesthetic benefits. In many cases, restoring the natural flow regime requires the removal of non-functioning low-head dams. A series of dams exists on the Kalamazoo River between Plainwell and Allegan, Michigan. All are under consideration for removal in the future. Removal of these dams will return the Kalamazoo River to its pre-dam flow, increase recreation uses and safety of the river, and improve aquatic habitat in this section of the river.    The removal of any dam comes with some risks. The two most common problems encountered are the movement of contaminated sediment downstream and the migration of invasive species from the Great Lakes upstream to the headwater areas. Since additional dams downstream of the project will remain in place, migration of invasive species should not be an issue; however, movement of contaminated sediments is a major concern. The USEPA has designated the Kalamazoo River from the city of Kalamazoo to where it discharges into Lake Michigan as a Federal Superfund site. The bed sediments are known to contain PCBs from paper-mill carbonless copy paper production (up to 150 ppm PCB--Blasland, Bouck, & Lee, 1994). Therefore, it is essential that the volume, grain-size distribution, degree of contamination, and potential for down-stream movement of sediments from behind these dams are known before dam removal can take place.    This ongoing multi-phase study will provide valuable information for dam removals on the Kalamazoo River and other dam removal projects in the Great Lakes watershed. This multi-year effort has provided estimates of volume of fine-grain sediment behind three dams; is currently collecting sediment coring data below the Plainwell Dam; plans to continue monitoring streamflow and sediment transport before, during, and after dam removals; and proposes an additional volume estimate at the Otsego City Dam. A sediment-transport model on the upstream Plainwell Dam could be designed and calibrated and would be useful in predicting downstream sediment movement before dam removal takes place.                 Objectives         Estimate the volume, grain-size distribution, and potential for down-stream movement of sediments from behind the Plainwell, Otsego City, Otsego, and Trowbridge Dams. Continue to operate two daily-discharge gaging stations; one above and one below this multi-dam reach. Continue to collect background suspended sediment data (before removals) using automatic samplers at the downstream Trowbridge gage. Design and calibrate a sediment-transport model at the upstream Plainwell Dam that will predict sediment movement from the City of Plainwell to the Otsego City Dam and possibly project similar effects at other dam sites downstream. Document the effects of removal of these dams on the Kalamazoo River environment, including suspended-sediment, bed load, and stream flow.      While the figures  depicted  illustrate the grids for the Plainwell dam, the procedure was identically applied to each dam in the study.                 Benefits    Although engineering studies and construction efforts have addressed the stabilization of some of these dams on the Kalamazoo River (CDM, 1999, 2000, 2001), the consequences of the removal of the dams are basically unknown. The study of these sites provide an opportunity to monitor the actual mobilization, transport, and ultimate fate of contaminated sediment and has substantial potential to advance the understanding of these hydrologic processes and transfer knowledge to other sites. Refinement and improved accuracy of mathematical approaches to contaminated-sediment transport and other impacts at the Plainwell Dam removal site may mean that future downstream dam removals may only require pre-removal “snapshots” of sediment availability and geomorphic assessments, rather than long-term monitoring, at substantial decrease in cost. Data from the proposed study will aid in making decisions regarding removal of the downstream structures more cost effective and scientifically based.          Products       Rheaume, S. J., C. M.

Study Goals, Objectives, End Product Fish Passage at the Price-Stubb Diversion Dam.  IV.  Past Performance During the preparation of the Draft EA for providing fish passage at the Price-Stubb Diversion dam several issues were identified. Dam removal appears to be the most cost effective passage alternative and is the most natural form of passage.  Before Reclamation could remove the dam, four outstanding issues would have to be resolved: 1) 2) 3) 4) Develop mitigation measures to resolve the Ute Water pumping plant issue Determine whether a hydropower plant will be developed at the dam site Obtain permission for dam removal from owners of the dam. The Mesa County Irrigation District has expressed support for dam removal, but the Palisade Irrigation District is currently opposed to removal. Preliminary geologic investigations indicate landslide stability is not an issue. However, if further investigation and monitoring show that dam removal would decrease landslide stability, this alternative would be eliminated from further consideration.  Ute Water Pumping Plant Intake Issue: Dam removal would adversely affect Ute Water's ability to pump water from the Colorado River. Existing Conditions: Ute Water provides water to about 60,000 residents of the Grand Valley. Their primary water supply is transported via a pipeline from the Plateau Creek drainage off the  CAP-5 - Page 1   Grand Mesa. Ute Water's pumping plant, located approximately 2,000 feet upstream of the dam, is normally used as an emergency backup water supply. Ute Water is currently reconstructing their primary water supply pipeline from Plateau Creek. Whenever the Plateau Creek pipeline is out of service during the next 3 to 4 years, the pumping plant will be used to pump water from the Colorado River. The pumping plant can supply about 15 cfs, which is about 60 percent of the peak daily demand during the summer. As a result, the pipeline reconstruction work will take place during lower demand periods in the winter and spring. Unfortunately, the schedule for this fish passage project coincides with Ute Water's pipeline replacement. Pumping operations require a water surface elevation of about 4,722 feet in the river (Collins, 1999). The dam helps maintain the required water elevation for pumping operations, especially during low flow conditions. Impacts Dam Removal: As discussed above, the Ute Water pumping plant requires a river elevation of at least 4,722 feet. With the dam removed, the river elevation would drop below 4,722 feet whenever the flow is less than 5,500 cfs. Review of historic flow data (average of monthly mean flows from 1933 through 1996) shows Colorado River flows are usually below 5,500 cfs for 9 months each year, from August through April. While the Plateau Creek pipeline is being reconstructed, the pump plant will be the primary water supply during the winter and spring. Consequently, until the pipeline project is completed, severe impacts to water supplies for Grand Valley residents could occur for 9 months each year. Even after the pipeline is complete, the pump plant will still be needed as a backup water supply. Ute Water and Reclamation have identified a number of options to mitigate im pacts to pumping operations caused by dam removal. Ute Water anticipates construction of their new Plateau Creek pipeline will be complete in the fall of 2002. The increased capacity, improved design, and better route of this pipeline will be a dramatic improvement over the existing Plateau Creek pipeline. Ute Water expects the new pipeline to be much more reliable, which will reduce their need to use the pumping plant. Consequently, Ute Water would be more receptive to mitigation measures for dam removal after the new pipeline is completed (meeting with Ute Water, 4/7/99).  Hydropower License Issue: The alternatives could affect the licensee's use of the site to generate hydroelectricity. Existing Conditions: The Jacobson Hydro No. 1 Project proposes to produce hydroelectric power using the Price-Stubb Diversion Dam. After 7 years of study, FERC issued a license on June 19, 1990 to allow non-Federal development of this hydropower project. The project's development has been delayed for several reasons, and plans are underway to amend development plans for the project. On August 7, 1996, the licensee filed an application to amend the project. Proposed amendments included: 1) reduce the installed capacity of the project turbines to 999 kilowatts; 2) locate the power house next to the dam (eliminating the need for a power canal);  CAP-5 - Page 2   3) dedicate up to 100 cfs of water to be used for a fish ladder, attraction flows, and larval separation in the endangered fish recovery effort; 4) dedicate construction and operation and maintenance easements for a fish passage structure. Allowing construction of a fish passage is a condition of the existing hydropower license (FERC No. 4515) to remove jeopardy of the development on the endangered fish. According to Article 411 of the existing FERC license, ""FERC reserves the authority to require the licensee to construct, operate and maintain, or provide for the construction, operation and maintenance of, such fishway as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior"" (FERC, 1990) . FERC prepared a Draft EA on the proposed amendment. The amended project specifically proposes to: ""dedicate a right-of-way or similar property easement to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) for the installation of a fish ladder which is being fully funded by the USBR as partial mitigation for reductions in habitat due to large dam projects below the Jacobson Hydro No. 1 Project on the Colorado River"" (FERC, 1996). The amendment's reduction in the installe d capacity corresponds to a reduced diversion requirement of about 1,000 cfs (FERC, 1995). Reclamation's implementation of any fish passage proposal at the Price-Stubb Dam would be affected by FERC's decision on the license for the Jacobson Hydro No. 1 Project and/or the licensee's decision to proceed with hydropower development. Impacts Dam Removal: Removal of the Price-Stubb Diversion Dam would preclude development of the dam site for power generation. Economic impacts related to dam removal, if any, would be considered following FERC's licensing decision. Reclamation contracted with a licensed appraiser to determine the value of the FERC license. The appraiser found that the project is not economic and that the license had no value. The developer contends that it is viable but his analysis is supported by power rates that are not currently available and construction costs that are very low.  Conclusion: Alternatives to solve the Ute Water pumping issue to Ute Water's satisfaction could easily approach an additional $1,000,000. However, if the Recovery Program delays pursuing passage at the Price-Stubb Dam until after their pipeline is complete, a more economical, but not as reliable solution would be acceptable to Ute Water. This option would costs about $150,000 $250,000 to implement. Even though the option is less reliable, Ute Water would be agreeable to this option since their pipeline is more reliable. The FERC hydropower license issue will be resolved in the ongoing NEPA process. An EA has been released by FERC. A final decision regarding which passage alternative to pursue is dependent on the resolution of the Ute pumping plant, Jacobson hydropower license and ongoing geologic monitoring and evaluations.  Recommendation: Wait until FERC makes a decision on the proposed license amendment. The only passage option that is compatible with hydropower development is a fish ladder similar to the Redlands Fish Ladder. Since the Reclamation's preferred alternative is dam removal, FERC would have to make a decision to revoke the current license. New Alternative: An alternative was identified during the comment period on the Draft Environmental Assessment that would permit construction of fish passage prior to the completion CAP-5 - Page 3   of Ute Water's pipeline. This alternative would be similar to the passageway constructed at Grand Valley Irrigation Company's Diversion dam. The existin g dam would be left in place and a passageway would be constructed downstream. Positive aspects of this alternative include no potential disturbance to the upstream landslide, no effect to Ute Water, and no potential threat to the upstream river siphon. This option would not be compatible wit h hyropower development. Costs estimates indicate that this alternative would cost 25 to 50 percent more than the delayed dam removal option. Recreational interest in the Grand Valley including the Grand Junction River Front Commission have indicated a willingness to pay for the increased cost due to the recreational potential. Fiscal Year 2000 activities include developing physical model to determine if this option is possible. V. Task description 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. VI.

May 1st was spent in a classroom setting. After introductions each Region and TSC gave an overview of the activities in their respective offices.           The Great Plains Region was not represented and they were missed. However, since TSC is within the GP Region boundaries they took the liberty of presenting those activities that they are aware of on behalf of the Region.           Ten technical papers were given. A list of papers and authors is appended to this review so that anyone wishing to contact authors for further information or discussion may do so. An attendance roster with phone numbers and email addresses is also attached.           The morning sessions centered around advances in computer technology in the ground water and drainage arena. After lunch Chuck Hennig, RSC Research Coordinator, gave a brief summary of Reclamation research activities and conducted a survey to get a sense of direction for future research needs as seen by the group.           This was followed by papers on plastic pipe drain issues, well drilling, and coupling of surface and ground water models.           The final presentation of the day was an introduction to the Elwha River Restoration Project. This laid the foundation for the field trip on May 2nd. There are numerous ground water components in the restoration project. Wells near the reservoirs may go dry as water table levels fall. Some wells within the flood plain may be subject to surface flooding after the dams are removed. A ground water collection system of some sort may replace Elwha Diversion Dam that supplies water to a local mill. Reclamation Ground Water and Drainage personnel have been addressing these issues.           The group toured the project with stops at Elwha Dam and Power Plant which was constructed from 1910 to 1912 and is still in operation. The power plant requires the operator to manually perform many tasks which is  different from the modern automated power plants of today.  The dam and power plant will be removed as part of the restoration project.           The next stop was at Glines Canyon Dam built in 1926 a few miles upstream from Elwha Dam and within the boundaries of Olympic National Park. Glines Canyon Dam will be breeched but the spillway structure will be preserved as an historic monument and tourist attraction. The tour of the dams was led by Rick Parker who operates the dams and power plant and will oversee their removal.           The third stop was at Elwha Diversion Dam where we observed drilling in preparation for aquifer tests to be used in decision making as to the type of replacement structure (i.e. infiltration gallery or Ranney collector) to supply municipal and industrial water during dam removal. .           The next stop was at the State Rearing Channel and City of Port Angeles Ranney Collector, where box lunches were provided. The final stop was on the Lower Elwha Reservation where we discussed ground water impacts to on-site septic systems from anticipated higher ground water levels after dam removal.           The TSC would like to thank Joe Spinazola and Kayti Didricksen for their super efforts in organizing and leading the workshop. WELL DONE!

GX250-64-13976878	State of California Regional Water Quality Control Board North Coast Region  Andrew Jensen September 12, 2002  EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S SUMMARY REPORT 8:00 a.m., September 26, 2002 Regional Water Quality Control Board Hearing Room 5550 Skylane Boulevard, Suite A Santa Rosa, California ITEM: SUBJECT: 9 Update on Request for a Report of Waste Discharge for Del Rio Woods Summer Dam DISCUSSION Current Status Staff of the Regional Water Board have requested a Report of Waste Discharge (ROWD) for the installation and operation of a summer dam in the Russian River near the Del Rio Woods Recreation Area near the City of Healdsburg, Sonoma County. At this time, no ROWD has been received from the Del Rio Woods Recreation and Park District (District) and, therefore, Regional Water Board staff has not prepared proposed Waste Discharge Requirements or a Waiver of Waste Discharge Requirements. Regional Water Board staff continue to work with the District and other resource agencies to find a suitable summer dam structure that will not result in violations of the water quality objectives of the Water Quality Control Plan for the North Coast Region (Basin Plan), or detrimental impacts to the beneficial uses of the Russian River. Project History and Overview For several years, the District has constructed a temporary dam in the Russian River to impound water during the summer months. The dam has been constructed between river mile 34 and 35.75 of the Russian River near Healdsburg, Sonoma County (Attachment 1). The District states that it has installed a dam in this area each year for over 50 years. The stated purpose of the annual dam construction has been to create an impoundment to improve recreational swimming, canoeing, and fishing opportunities for local and regional residents.   Item 9  -2-  The summer dam has been constructed by using heavy equipment to collect earthen material from the floodplain. This earthen material, consisting of river-run gravel, sand and fines, is pushed up by bulldozer on both ends of a permanent concrete weir structure (Attachment 2). Approximately 2,400 cubic yards of earthen material is pushed into stockpiles outside the wetted channel. During construction of the left bank berm (east berm), the bulldozer repeatedly pushes lifts of stockpiled material into the wetted channel, creating a work pad, until the flow of the Russian River is completely blocked. Following the construction of the left berm, the bulldozer is used to cut a low flow channel in the work pad downstream of the weir structure. The construction of the berms typically occurs around June 20th of each year, approximately one week prior to the installation of flashboards at the downstream Healdsburg Memorial Dam. The overall construction of the summer dam generally takes 4-6 days to complete. After the berms are constructed, the river flow is routed through the permanent weir structure. The volume of water impounded by the dam structure is gradually increased and deepened through the installation of flashboards on the weir structure over several days, until the impoundment ranges from 5-11 feet deep and extends upstream for approximately 5,800 feet. When complete, the berms have the following dimensions: the right berm (west berm) contains approximately 1,690 cubic yards (cu3yd) of earthen material, and is approximately 80 feet long, 15 feet high, and 20 feet wide with 2:1 sideslopes; the left berm contains approximately 445 cu3yd of earthen material, and is approximately 40 feet long, 15 feet high, and 20 feet wide with a 1:1 sideslope. Seasonal berm construction requires the discharge of approximately 1,800 cu3yd of fill material below the plane of ordinary high water, raising the substrate elevation up to 15 feet over the 0.12 acre of riverbed. The collection and stockpiling of floodplain material for the berm construction results in the lowering (dredging) of the substrate elevation by an average of six inches over 2.3 acres of riverbed. The dam remains in place throughout the summer and has then been breached beginning the week following Labor Day of each year. The breaching was historically achieved by driving a bulldozer across the river below the dam structure and up onto the east berm. The bulldozer was then used to create a trench through the berm to match the water level of the impoundment, which was completed by hand shoveling a small notch in the trench to allow water flow through it. Over a period of a couple of hours the water entering the trench would eventually erode the trench through the berm and finally resulted in a sudden blowout of the berm and a major turbidity release to the downstream river. All of the bermed material would be allowed to discharge downstream. Last year the District attempted to reduce the turbidity associated with the breaching of the summer dam. It spaced the removal of the flashboards out over several days time, to gradually lower the impoundment water level and minimize the effects of drawdown below the dam. In addition, the west berm was scraped down to wet sand, and a small trench was manually excavated in the berm alongside the permanent weir structure to daylight the water level of the recently lowered impoundment. The resulting flow velocity was allowed to erode and breach the remaining west berm material until a new low-flow channel formed, which took several hours. This protocol still resulted in a major turbidity release into the river.   Item 9 Regulatory Background  -3-  In 1979, the Regional Water Board requested that the District file a Report of Waste Discharge as the initial step in obtaining a permit for the dam. Subsequently, the Regional Water Board adopted Waste Discharge Requirements, Board Order No. 80-48, for the construction and removal of the summer dam. Order No. 80-48 required that there be no increase in turbidity by more than 10 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTUs) by the construction and/or removal of the District's summer dam structure as measured at a point 500 feet downstream of the dam site. The Notification, Monitoring and Reporting Program No. 80-48 required the District to monitor and report to the Regional Water Board whenever a visible turbidity event resulted during construction, normal dam operations, and removal of the structure. This self-monitoring should have resulted in reports of any turbidity problems, however Regional Water Board records indicate that only one report was ever filed (August 15, 1979) reporting visible turbidity. In 1995, during a routine review of all permitted facilities, the Regional Water Board determined that the District operations were a low threat to water quality, based in part on the lack of reported turbidity levels. Staff inspections did not occur during the construction or breaching of the dam, and staff relied on the District's self-reporting of turbidity releases. Based on the available information, and a lack of reports of any turbidity problems, staff recommended that the Regional Water Board rescind its Waste Discharge Requirements and allow the dam to operate under a categorical Waiver of Waste Discharge Requirements established by Regional Water Board Resolution 87-113. Conditions on the categorical waiver require compliance with the Regional Water Board Basin Plan and control of sediment discharges. Present Regulatory Posture While this dam has been constructed for many years, only recently has the magnitude of the sediment discharges become evident to the Regional Water Board. The Regional Water Board received complaints in 2000 and 2001 regarding excessive turbidity in the river attributed to discharges occurring from the removal of the summer dam. Regional Water Board staff investigated and learned that discharges from the 2000 breaching of the dam resulted in significant sediment discharges, and turbidity levels well in excess of those allowable in the Basin Plan for over a mile downstream of the dam, which persisted for several hours. The 2000 dam breaching was videotaped by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and a copy of the video was sent to the Regional Water Board as well as other permitting agencies. The video documents the catastrophic turbidity event associated with the dam removal. These discharges violate the Basin Plan, and result in detrimental impacts to the beneficial uses of the Russian River. In addition, they do not comply with the conditions of the categorical waiver contained in Resolution 87-113. Since the Russian River is listed under Section 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act as impaired due to sediment and concerns over impacts to endangered species have been expressed, there is a need to re-evaluate this discharge. Based on this investigation, the Regional Water Board staff advised the District in August of 2001 of the need to take corrective actions to eliminate the sediment discharges, which were in violation of our Basin Plan. During the meeting, which included the District and other   Item 9  -4-  permitting resource agencies, a detailed step-by-step plan to remove the dam to minimize sediment discharges was discussed and agreements were reached. During a site visit on August 15, 2001, the Regional Water Board inspector informed the District that they needed to conduct turbidity sampling during the removal of the dam. The District's consultant asked whether the Regional Water Board staff could conduct the necessary sampling instead because of the limited funds of the District. Although staff normally would not conduct the monitoring, we indicated in this case that the Regional Water Board could come and take turbidity samples during the removal of the dam provided that they coordinated with us to schedule it and provided us with sufficient advance notice for preparation. The District was to call us to coordinate the timing to ensure appropriate sampling, however the District never called Regional Water Board staff. Eric Shott of the NMFS called the Regional Water Board staff to inform us that the District was removing the dam, but our inspector was out of the office on business for a week, and sampling could not be mobilized. Regardless, the District did not follow through with our agreement on coordinating Dam removal with our agency to arrange turbidity sampling, nor did the District conduct the needed sampling. A major release of turbid water still occurred during the 2001 dam removal and the Regional Water Board received reports of excessive turbidity similar to the 2000 discharges. The Regional Water Board issued a 13267 Order on January 10, 2002, ordering the District to submit a report outlining the sediment discharges associated with the 2000 dam removal, notifying the District that a new Report of Waste Discharge would need to be submitted, and indicating that the previously issued Waiver of Waste Discharge Requirements no longer applied. In a letter to the District dated March 20, 2002, we reiterated this point. On April 1, 2002, the District submitted a letter regarding the sediment releases associated with the dam removal of 2000, but the letter lacked a new report of waste discharge. On April 29, 2002, the Regional Water Board staff issued a letter reiterating the need to submit a Report of Waste Discharge in response to the 13267 Order issued on January 10, 2002. Staff have also coordinated closely with other permitting resource agencies during this process. Staff has met with the District several times, on August 15, 2001, January 10, 2002, March 14, 2002, April 22, 2002, and on August 26, 2002. During these meetings, staff advised the District of its options, the permitting process, and has been working with the District to find a solution that satisfies all parties involved, while protecting the beneficial uses of the Russian River. Comment letters have been received regarding this issue, which have been forwarded to the Regional Water Board members. Recently received letters that have not been forwarded to the Regional Water Board members previously are attached for reference. The District submitted a request to appear before the Regional Water Board, and this agenda item was calendared. PRELIMINARY STAFF RECOMMENDATION: (EOSRDELRIOWOODSSUMMERDAM)  This is an informational item. No Board action is necessary at this time.

To date, there have been at least 469 dams                                        removed nationwide for reasons such as fish                                        passage, safety, erosion control, and habitat                                        restoration (American Rivers, 2000). In                                        California, at least 77 dams have been removed                                        since 1922. There are no centralized records,                                        so that number may be even higher. From                                        1990 to 1999, 10 dams were removed. And                                        in 2000, at least 18 dams were removed,                                        including Saeltzer Dam and several small                                        check and diversion dams. The  table                                          lists dams that have been removed                                        in California for which documentation was                                        located.                                                                         There                                      are many reasons for removing a dam. Some                                      lack economic benefits; others are taken down                                      to restore ecosystems or fisheries; and some                                      are unsafe. Many older dams are filled with                                      sediment and can no longer function or provide                                      the benefits for which they were built. In                                      addition, operators of some dams find it too                                      expensive to bring the structures into compliance                                      with the new laws and regulations. Coordination                                      and cooperation between all parties-including                                      resolution of key issues-is a key to successful                                      dam removal. key issues include funding, removal                                      techniques, construction logistics, sediment                                      disposal, configuration of new fish-friendly                                      water diversions, and how to avoid or minimize                                      environmental impacts of demolition.

Through restoration projects such as the Crocker Creek Dam Removal Project, the Agency strives to improve habitat for fish and other aquatic species and restore runs of salmonid species that have been negatively impacted by current and historic watershed uses.                                     Historic information relevant to the construction and use of the Crocker Creek Dam is limited.                       Long time residents believe that the dam was constructed to impound water for recreational use by the original landowners.  The exact year of construction is unknown, however field investigations by Agency engineers estimate the initial construction to have occurred in the early 1900s.  The dam appears to have been raised and widened at least three times.  The final configuration of the Crocker Creek Dam was a concrete buttress, flashboard dam approximately 30 feet high and 100 feet wide with two concrete spillways (one used and one abandoned), each approximately 150 feet long.  At no point in the dam's history were any attempts made to facilitate fish passage.                                     The current property owner acquired the property on which the dam is located in 1993. The dam began to show signs of impending structural failure as early as 1974, however,                      major structural failure did not occur until 1995.  In 1995, the entire northern side of the dam, with the exception of the original base, collapsed.                       Further failure occurred in 1997.  The impact to Crocker Creek as a result of the failures has been significant. The creek downstream of the dam was inundated with the sediment that had been trapped behind the structure.  The creek upstream of the dam has experienced major erosion and collapsing of banks as a result of the acute loss of the major grade control structure.  Currently, all that remains of the Crocker Creek Dam are the north and south abutments, both spillways, the original base, and a large pile of concrete and other structural debris directly below the base of the dam.  While the elevation of the base is significantly lower than the previous top of the dam, the structure and associated debris pile remains a potential barrier to anadromous salmonids.                                     Project Description                   There are three primary goals for this project: 1) provide upstream and downstream passage for anadromous salmonids, 2) remove the remains of the failed dam, and 3) prevent                      further bank erosion/re-establish riparian vegetation.                    The proposed project would consist of several restoration activities; including demolishing and removing the remaining structures and debris, bank recontouring, biotechnical                      channel adjustments, and revegetation.                   Restoration activities would occur at three locations within the project site.                       Areas 1 and 2 comprised of the remnants of the dam, the spillways, and the adjacent north and south banks.  Area 3 is located approximately 150 feet upstream of Area 1 on the north bank.  This site is an erosional scarp approximately 21 feet high and 170 feet long.  Area 4 is approximately 400 feet upstream of Area 3 on the north bank and encompasses an area that contains a previous bank stabilization project that has failed.                                     At Areas 1 and 2, the remains of the north and south bank abutments and the two concrete spillways would be demolished.  As a result of the dam failure, the north                      abutment has become unstable and is subject to collapse. Stabilizing the abutment would require removing the soil material and recontouring the bank to a 2:1 slope at the north abutment and upstream and downstream for                      approximately 150 feet to match existing grades.  The upstream extent of the recontoured north bank would terminate at the base of a culvert that is failing.                       A down drain would be installed on the culvert and rock would be placed at the base to dissipate stream energy.  Recontouring of the bank would require removal of an abandoned powerline and associated power poles, two transformers, and a concrete pad.                                     The south abutment and concrete spillways (Area 2) are only partially supported in the streambanks.  There are signs of significant erosion and undercutting of the                      banks around these structures.  The abutment and spillways would be demolished and removed.  Concrete rubble from the failed dam would also be removed from the stream channel.  Soil removed from the abutments                      would be used to recontour eroded portions of the spillway along the existing slope.                   The eroding bank at Area 3 would be recontoured to a 2:1 slope.  The slopes would be protected with stabilization fabric to reduce erosion and planted with native                      vegetation.                       An approximately 1,500 cubic yard bench would be created at the base of the slope to reduce stream velocity along the bank and to move the creek back to its original low flow channel.  Two redwood log spurs would be installed at the top and bottom of the constructed bench to deflect stream energy away from the bench.                                     Recontoured slopes at Areas 1, 2, and 3 would be planted with native vegetation based upon surveys of riparian habitat upstream and downstream of the project site.                       Planting of vegetation would help stabilize existing soil to reduce erosion and improve aquatic habitat quality by providing shade over the creek.  An irrigation system would be installed to water the vegetation at all three sites until it is well established.                                     At Area 4, concrete blocks installed during a previous attempt to stabilize the north bank would be removed.                       The bank would then be recontoured to a 2:1 slope and the toe of the bank would be reinforced with a willow revetment and four redwood log spurs.                   The access road leading to the staging area and construction site crosses an ephemeral stream.                       The stream would be surveyed at the crossing and clean drain rock and a culvert would be installed to provide access to the construction site.  The fill and culvert would be removed and the pre-existing grade would be re-established upon completion of the project.                                     Container plants will be contract grown using a local source of propagules.  Container plants will be planted in late fall/early winter 2002.  Willow sprigging                      will be conducted when willow trees are dormant (November- January of 2002/2003).  All planting materials have been collected from areas in or near the Project Site.                                                                                                                                       Back to top
GX001-33-8556735	Volcanic History of the Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field                                 Welded Huckleberry Ridge Tuff at Golden Gate above       Mammoth Hot Springs                 Y ellowstone's world-famous natural       history is marked by such colossal volcanic events that their reflections        in today's landscape are difficult to grasp and impossible to take in at        just a glance, even for those familiar with the signs of past volcanism.                         Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone slices through       thick accumulation of rhyolite                                                  The stunning features of Yellowstone National Park result from great            explosive eruptions and profound collapse of the ground, enormously            thick lava flows, uplift and extensive faulting, and the erosive power            of flowing water and ice. For more than a century, geologists have            discovered and analyzed evidence of the dramatic events that have shaped the            land here. When combined with growing knowledge about how volcanoes            work and the never-ending motion of Earth's surface, the evidence tells            a remarkable story of the Yellowstone landscape.                                                Top of six-sided column of basalt at Sheepeater         Cliff                           Columns of basalt lava flow at Sheepeater         Cliff, outside youngest caldera                           Toe of basalt lava flow, Kilauea Volcano, Hawai`i                                             The volcanism most directly identified with the Yellowstone region       has, during about the past 2 million years, built an immense volcanic       plateau that straddles a high mountain divide—the Yellowstone       Plateau volcanic field. This volcanic region has evolved through 3       cycles of voluminous outpourings of  rhyolite         lava and volcanic ash, each of them climaxing with one of Earth's greatest  pyroclastic-flow  eruptions and the resulting collapse of a central        area to form a large caldera. Other eruptions have poured out  basalt        lava flows around the margins of the volcanic field.                                                        Yellowstone's volcanism is only the most recent         in a 17 million-year history of volcanic activity that has occurred progressively          from southwestern Idaho to Yellowstone National Park. At least six          other large volcanic centers along this path generated  caldera -forming          eruptions; the calderas are no longer visible because they are buried          beneath younger basaltic lava flows and sediments that blanket the          Snake River Plain.  Click on image for larger size and explanation;          image is from  Smith and Siegel (2000) .                                           Three Volcanic Cycles of Yellowstone    Overview    Three extraordinarily large explosive eruptions in the past 2.1  million years each created a giant caldera within or west of  Yellowstone National Park with the spread of enormous volumes of hot,  fragmented volcanic rocks as pyroclastic flows over vast areas within  times as short as a few days or weeks. The accumulated hot ash,  pumice ,  and other rock fragments welded together from their heat and the weight  of overlying material to form extensive sheets of hard lava-like rock.  In some sections, these welded ash-flow tuffs are more than 400 m thick!  These ash-flow sheets—from oldest to youngest, the Huckleberry Ridge,  Mesa Falls, and Lava Creek Tuffs—account for more than half the  material erupted from Yellowstone. The enormous outpouring of magma,  280 to 2,450 km 3  during each explosive event, led to the  collapse of magma-chamber roofs, causing the ground above to subside  by many hundreds of meters to form the calderas.     Before and after these caldera-forming events, eruptions in the Yellowstone area produced rhyolitic and basaltic rocks—large rhyolite lava flows and some  smaller pyroclastic flows in and near where the calderas collapsed and  basalt lava flows around the margins of the calderas.                          Welded tuffs form capping layer on top of Mount Everts             Huckleberry Ridge and Lava Creek ash-flow tuffs         At the top of Mount Everts east of Mammoth Hot Springs, a brownish-colored cliff       held an important clue about the number of caldera-forming eruptions at       Yellowstone.  Click on image for the clue.                  A general sequence of events was repeated in the evolution of each of  Yellowstone's three volcanic cycles:        A broad area, larger than that which will become the caldera is slowly      uplifted. This uplift reflects the development and rise of large volumes of      rhyolite to form a magma chamber at shallow depths in the Earth's crust.      Stretching of the crust above the inflating magma chamber leads to concentric and     radial fracturing and faulting at the surface, typically accompanied by the      extrusion of lava flows from these fractures.         At a critical stage in the evolution of the magma chamber, enormous     volumes of the overpressurized rhyolite magma erupt explosively through      the ring-fracture zone created above the magma chamber during inflation      and uplift, producing extensive ash-flow sheets. As the eruptions partly      empty the chamber of its magma, the roof of the magma chamber collapses      along the same ring fractures to produce a large caldera.         Postcollapse volcanism includes the extrusion of rhyolite lavas and     smaller explosive eruptions of pyroclastic flows within or adjacent to the     the caldera. In the present-day Yellowstone caldera, lakes formed where streams      draining into or along the margin of the caldera were dammed by these thick      intracaldera rhyolite flows, including Shoshone, Lewis, Heart, and Yellowstone      Lakes. Shortly following collapse, the caldera floor may be uplifted by hundreds      of meters in a process known as resurgent doming; this uplift reflects      renewed pressure as magma rises again into the magma chamber. Hydrothermal      activity (such as hot springs and geysers) occurs during all three stages but,      in the third stage, it becomes the dominant or only visible sign at the      surface of magmatic activity below.                                 Thick rhyolite lava flows of the Madison Plateau                 Scientists infer that rhyolite lava flows (left photo) as          well as the caldera-forming ash-flow tuffs were fed from shallow magma          chambers filled by the melting of rocks of the lower continental         crust below Yellowstone. The heat needed to facilitate the melting         process was supplied by the repeated injections of basalt magma from the         mantle into the shallow crust                                      Click on images for a larger-sized       image and description.                                               Undine Falls spills over basalt lava flow                 Basalt lava flows (left photo), though subordinate in         volume to rhyolites, have erupted throughout the 2.3 million-year          volcanic history of the Yellowstone area. The magma feeding these          eruptions originated in the upper part of Earth's mantle and resided          only briefly in the crust before erupting at the surface.                                 The long-term nature of volcanism in this part of North America suggests that      more eruptions will occur as the Yellowstone National Park continues to evolve. The      most recent series of eruptions, 160,000 to 70,000 years ago, extruded      more than 20 thick rhyolite lava flows and domes, most of them within the      youngest caldera. Other postcaldera lavas are basalts, erupted around the margins      of the rhyolitic calderas. Based on Yellowstone's history, the next eruptions      are likely to expel lavas, which might be either rhyolites or basalts, possibly      accompanied by moderate explosive activity. Far less likely would be another      enormous outpouring of material that could lead to a fourth caldera.

The major ash-flow tuffs that erupted at the climax of each cycle are the primary rock units of Yellowstone in areas beyond the caldera complex.  The table below represents the work of geologists who identified, described,  and mapped the different volcanic rock deposits in the Yellowstone area and  determined the order in which they erupted during each of the three  cycles of activity. The units are shown in stratigraphic sequence  (the youngest at the top of the table, oldest at the bottom). Table is from  Christiansen  (2001).

Flows  of the contemporaneous basalts (Madison River basalt, etc.) range in age  from > 110,000 to < 640,000 years ago.    3    Part of the Big Bend Ridge Rhyolite comprises  postcaldera flows of the first cycle and part comprises precaldera  flows of the second cycle.         References    Christiansen, R.L., 2001,  The Quaternary and Pliocene  Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana : U.S.  Geological Survey Professional Paper 729-G, 145 p., 3 plates.

GX001-21-4722956	U.S. Geological Survey   Open-File Report 99-437   Online Version 1.0   Volcano Hazards in the Three Sisters Region, Oregon      By  W.E. Scott, R.M. Iverson, S.P. Schilling, and B.J.    Fisher     Vancouver, Washington   2001    U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR   Bruce Babbitt, Secretary    U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY    Charles G. Groat, Director    This report is preliminary and has not been reviewed for conformity with U.S.   Geological Survey (USGS) editorial standards or with the North American   Stratigraphic Code. Any use of trade, firm, or product names is for descriptive   purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government.                 Summary         Aerial view from southeast of Three Sisters volcanic center (South, Middle,  and North Sister left of center; Broken Top right of center). Light colored  areas on south flank of South Sister are 2,000-yr-old lava flows. Much of  area on lower flanks of Broken Top is mantled by pumice and ash erupted just  prior to emplacement of these lava flows.  Photo by William E. Scott, USGS            Three Sisters is one of three potentially active volcanic centers that   lie close to rapidly growing communities and resort areas in Central Oregon.   Two types of volcanoes exist in the Three Sisters region and each poses   distinct hazards to people and property. South Sister, Middle Sister, and   Broken Top, major composite volcanoes clustered near the center of the   region, have erupted repeatedly over tens of thousands of years and may   erupt explosively in the future. In contrast, mafic volcanoes, which range   from small cinder cones to large shield volcanoes like North Sister and   Belknap Crater, are typically short-lived (weeks to centuries) and erupt   less explosively than do composite volcanoes. Hundreds of mafic volcanoes   scattered through the Three Sisters region are part of a much longer zone   along the High Cascades of Oregon in which birth of new mafic volcanoes   is possible.      This report describes the types of hazardous events that can occur in the   Three Sisters region and the accompanying volcano-hazard-zonation map outlines   areas that could be at risk from such events. Hazardous events include   landslides from the steep flanks of large volcanoes and floods, which need   not be triggered by eruptions, as well as eruption-triggered events such   as fallout of tephra (volcanic ash) and lava flows. A proximal hazard zone   roughly 20 kilometers (12 miles) in diameter surrounding the Three Sisters   and Broken Top could be affected within minutes of the onset of an eruption   or large landslide. Distal hazard zones that follow river valleys downstream   from the Three Sisters and Broken Top could be inundated by lahars (rapid   flows of water-laden rock and mud) generated either by melting of snow   and ice during eruptions or by large landslides. Slow-moving lava flows   could issue from new mafic volcanoes almost anywhere within the region.   Fallout of tephra from eruption clouds can affect areas hundreds of kilometers   (miles) downwind, so eruptions at volcanoes elsewhere in the Cascade Range   also contribute to volcano hazards in Central Oregon.      This report is intended to aid scientists, government officials, and citizens   as they work together to reduce the risk from volcano hazards through public   education and emergency-response planning.

Rapidly developing areas   in Deschutes County occupy the eastern border of the region, and westward   several small communities dot the McKenzie River valley along its course   to the Eugene-Springfield metropolitan area. Three Sisters volcanic center,   one of three volcanic centers in Central Oregon along with Newberry volcano   and Mount Jefferson, has erupted repeatedly for hundreds of thousands of   years, most recently about 1,500 years ago. When a volcano erupts again   in the Three Sisters region, areas close to the erupting vent will be severely   affected. Even areas tens of kilometers (or miles) downstream along the   valleys that head near the vent may be at risk, as may be areas hundreds   of kilometers (miles) downwind. Moreover, areas along valleys that head   on slopes of large, steep volcanoes can be affected by landslides, floods,   and debris flows that can occur without eruptive activity. This report   describes the kinds of hazardous geologic events that have occurred in   the Three Sisters region in the past and shows, in the accompanying volcano-hazard-zonation   map, which areas will likely be at risk during future such events.       Past Hazardous Events      The last eruption in the Three Sisters region occurred before written records   were kept. Therefore, we rely on geologic study of deposits formed by prehistoric   events to assess the frequency, type, and scale of past eruptions, which   serve as a guide for forecasting the character of future eruptions  [1;   numerals in brackets refer to notes listed at the end of this report] .   We also use data from similar volcanoes around the world to gain a general   idea of possible eruption scenarios and hazards.       Two Types of Volcanoes      Two types of volcanoes are found in the Three Sisters region—composite   and mafic.  Composite volcanoes  are restricted to the Three Sisters volcanic   center, erupt episodically over tens to hundreds of thousand of years,   build large cones, and can display a wide range of eruption styles and   explosivity. Middle and South Sister are composite volcanoes that have   been active frequently during the past 100,000 years. Broken Top, a more   deeply eroded composite volcano, has probably not been active during this   period.  Mafic volcanoes   [2]  typically erupt for brief time intervals (weeks   to perhaps centuries), but some can grow almost as large as composite volcanoes.   Subsequent eruptions in the region typically issue from new vents and,   over tens to hundreds of thousands of years, build broad fields of many   volcanoes. Prominent mafic volcanoes in the Three Sisters region include   North Sister, Mount Bachelor, Belknap Crater, Black Butte, and Mount Washington.   Hundreds more mafic volcanoes form the High Cascades of central Oregon   between the neighboring composite volcanoes of Mount Jefferson, 60 kilometers   (40 miles) north of Three Sisters, Newberry volcano, a similar distance   southeast, and Crater Lake, 120 kilometers (75 miles) south (Figure 1).                        Figure 1. Regional setting of Three Sisters region in Central  Oregon showing major rivers, highways, cities, and counties.       Hazardous Events at Composite Volcanoes         All of the types of hazardous events depicted in the accompanying illustration   of a composite volcano (Figure 2) have occurred at South and Middle Sister   in the past and could occur in the future. Most are driven by the eruption   of molten rock, or  magma , but some, like debris avalanches and some lahars,   can occur even without eruptive activity.      As magma nears the surface, gases dissolved in the magma are released.   Rapid release can fragment the magma and propel it upward from the vent   in a rush of expanding hot gas. The resulting solidified rock fragments,   called  tephra , range in size from large bombs (fist-sized up to 1 meter   or more in diameter) to fine dust. Large tephra particles will fall back   to the ground within a few kilometers (miles) of the vent, but frothy pumice   particles and ash (ash is tephra that is sand-sized and finer) can rise   more than ten kilometers (30,000 feet) upward in an eruption cloud. As   the cloud drifts downwind, tephra falls out and blankets areas for tens   to hundreds of kilometers (miles) away. Unless tephra blankets reach thicknesses   great enough to collapse roofs, tephra falls offer little direct threat   to life or structures, but tephra clouds can create tens of minutes to   hours of darkness as they pass over a downwind area, even on sunny days,   and reduce visibility on highways. Ash suspended in air can irritate eyes   and respiratory systems, and prolonged inhalation of certain kinds of tephra   can cause chronic lung disease. Deposits of tephra can topple or short-circuit   electric transformers and power lines, especially if the tephra is wet,   which makes it adhere to surfaces. Tephra ingested by vehicle engines can   clog filters and increase wear. Tephra clouds commonly generate lightning   that can interfere with electrical and communication systems and start   fires. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, even small, dilute tephra   clouds pose great hazards to aircraft that fly into them.             Figure 2. Hazardous events at composite  volcanoes. Illustration modified from USGS Fact Sheet 002-97.      Lessons learned during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in downwind   Washington communities such as Yakima, Ritzville, and Spokane are now used   throughout the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere to prepare governments,   businesses, and citizens for future tephra falls. These three communities   experienced significant disruptions in transportation, business activity,   and community services as a result of fallout of from 0.5 to 8 centimeters   (1/4 to 3 inches) of tephra. The greater the amount of tephra that fell,   the longer a community took to recover. As perceived by residents, tephra   falls of less than 0.5 centimeters (1/4 inch) were a major inconvenience,   whereas falls of more than 1.5 centimeters (2/3 inch) constituted a disaster.   Nonetheless, all three communities recovered to nearly normal activities   within two weeks.      If all or part of a rising eruption column is denser than the surrounding   atmosphere, a slug of tephra and hot gas can collapse downward to form   a  pyroclastic flow , a mobile, hot (hundreds of degrees) mixture of rock   fragments, ash, and gas that surges down the flanks of a volcano at speeds   of 50 to more than 150 kilometers per hour (30-90 miles per hour). Most   pyroclastic flows are confined to valley floors, but accompanying clouds   of hot ash and gas rise higher and can overwhelm even ridge tops. Owing   to their great velocity and high temperature, pyroclastic flows are particularly   dangerous hazards to life and property, but pyroclastic flows would probably   not travel more than 10 kilometers (6 miles) except in extraordinary events.      Less explosive release of gas from ascending magma results in extrusion   of lava (magma that reaches Earth’s surface) from vents. Depending on its   viscosity and rate of discharge, lava will form a bulbous  lava dome  over   the vent or a  lava flow  that extends several to more than 10 kilometers   (6 miles) downslope. Observations of lava flows at similar volcanoes elsewhere   suggest that lava flows in the Three Sisters region would move down valleys   as tongues of liquid lava a few to tens of meters (10-100 feet) thick encased   in a thick cover of hardened lava rubble. Such lava flows can destroy all   structures in their paths and start forest fires, but they advance so slowly   that they seldom endanger people.  Lava domes that grow on steep slopes   are typically unstable and collapse repeatedly as they grow higher and   steeper. Such collapses are another mechanism by which pyroclastic flows   can form.      The latest eruptions on South Sister, which occurred in two closely spaced   episodes about 2,000 years ago (Figure 3), illustrate a relatively modest   scale of eruptive activity. Initial explosive eruptions produced small   pyroclastic flows and tephra fallout from several aligned vents low on   the south flank. Tephra fallout deposits more than 2 meters (7 feet) thick,   composed of pumice, rock fragments, and ash, blanketed areas within 2 kilometers   (1 mile) downwind of vents; at 13 kilometers (8 miles) about 10 centimeters   (4 inches) fell. Less than one centimeter (0.5 inch) of ash fell at least   as far as 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the vents (at Cultus Lake)   and east of the vents (at Bend). Following tephra eruptions, lava emerged   from two vent areas, forming a large lava flow, Rock Mesa, and several   small lava domes. Decades to a few centuries later, a similar eruptive   sequence occurred along a zone of vents that extended from just north of   Sparks Lake to high on the southeast flank of South Sister, as well as   along a shorter zone on the north flank near Carver Lake. Some of the lava   flows and domes of that episode are shown in the accompanying photograph   (Figure 4). Similar-style eruptions, but up to about ten times larger in   terms of volume of ejecta, occurred during and just before the last ice   age, about 30,000 to 15,000 year ago.            Figure 3. Volcanic activity in the Three Sisters region and  other Central Oregon volcanoes during the past 15,000 years [ 1 ]. Bars indicate  approximate age of events or age ranges of several events. Arrow indicates that  ages of eruptions are poorly known and may predate 15,000 years ago by several  thousand years.      The geologic record shows that even much larger eruptions with much wider   impact have occurred in the Three Sisters volcanic center. At least four   times in the past 700,000 years, explosive eruptions that were probably   sited near the present location of Broken Top and Three Sisters produced   pyroclastic flows that swept over a broad area from Sisters to south of   Bend. A tephra fallout deposit as thick as 13 meters (42 feet) composed   largely of fist-sized and smaller white pumice clasts from one of these   eruptions is exposed in numerous pumice quarries. Distal tephra deposits   from this event have even been found in northern California and in cores   from the northeast Pacific Ocean. Such an event today would be catastrophic   for Deschutes County, but, fortunately, events of this magnitude are infrequent.   Furthermore, there is no evidence that the large volume of magma necessary   to drive such an eruption is present in the Three Sisters region today,   nor would such a volume likely be generated in the near future.      Pyroclastic flows on volcanoes like South and Middle Sister can melt snow   and glacier ice and generate  lahars . Lahars are watery flows of volcanic   rocks and mud that surge downstream like rapidly flowing concrete. Lahars   can devastate valley floors tens of kilometers (or miles) from volcanoes.   Small lahars were generated by eruptions 2,000 years ago. Much larger lahars   swept down valleys during earlier eruptions, but their deposits have been   largely removed by erosion or buried by younger glacial and stream deposits.   During the past century, at least five small lahars were generated by glacier-outburst   floods or by failure of glacial-moraine dams that impounded small lakes   on each of the Three Sisters and Broken Top. Serious effects of these events   were largely restricted to undeveloped areas within 10 kilometers (6 miles)   of sources.          Figure 4. Aerial view of the south flank of South Sister  composite volcano showing numerous blocky lava flows erupted about 2,000 years  ago. Early eruptions formed Rock Mesa (just above center, far left), a broad  flat flow emplaced on nearly level ground. Subsequent eruptions formed a line of  lava domes and flows that extend from Sparks Lake meadow (lower right) to Green  Lakes (just above center, far right). Several small lava domes were also formed  on the northeast flank, out of view. Cratered cone in lower left is Talapus  Butte, a basaltic scoria cone.  Photo by William E. Scott, USGS      The steep upper flanks of volcanoes can collapse and spawn rapidly moving   landslides called  debris avalanches . Composite volcanoes are particularly   susceptible to debris avalanches because ground water warmed by residual   volcanic heat and acidified by volcanic gases circulates through porous   zones and weakens rock by transforming it to clay. Small debris avalanches   produced by failures of rock masses on steep cliffs can be triggered by   storms or rapid snowmelt, but the onset of volcanic unrest, with its earthquakes,   steam explosions, and intrusion of magma, greatly increases the likelihood   of debris avalanches and the probability of  catastrophic, large-volume   events. The largest debris avalanches involve failure of entire sides of   volcanoes, and some contain or acquire sufficient water to transform into   lahars that travel down valleys many tens of kilometers (or miles).     Lahars also affect downstream areas by filling stream channels with sediment   and by providing a source of sediment for continued erosion and valley   filling. Examples from many volcanoes, including Mount St. Helens, show   that these effects can persist for years or decades. In such situations   channels become unstable and shift rapidly. Channel capacity shrinks and   susceptibility to flooding increases.       Hazardous Events at Mafic Volcanoes      Mafic volcanoes typically erupt less explosively than do composite volcanoes,   so their eruption impacts are less widespread. Most mafic eruptions in   the Three Sisters region have produced limited tephra deposits and lava   flows that traveled typically 5-15 kilometers (3-9 miles) and rarely 15-20   kilometers (9-12 miles) from vents. Tephra deposits from such eruptions   locally have thicknesses of several meters (6-12 feet) within 2 kilometers   (1.2 miles) of vents, but seldom exceed 10 centimeters (4 inches) at distances   10 kilometers (6 miles) away from vents, and are typically much less. Some   eruptions built scoria cones (piles of volcanic rubble centered around   vents) with aprons of lava flows, like Pilot Butte in Bend. Others constructed   broad shield volcanoes like Belknap Crater (Figure 5) north of McKenzie   Pass, which has lava flows that cover 100 square kilometers (40 square   miles). At about 1,500 years old, Belknap Crater is one of the youngest   mafic volcanoes in the Oregon Cascades.  Some mafic eruptions constructed   only a single small volcano, probably in a matter of days or weeks, while   others involved eruptions along chains of several to tens of vents that   may have continued for decades or centuries. The cluster of scoria cones   and lava flows in the Sand Mountain area west of Santiam Pass was formed   during three eruptive episodes between about 2,000 and 4,000 years ago.    Mount Bachelor, a 1,000-meter-high (3,500 feet) mafic shield volcano,   lies at the north end of a 25-kilometer-long (15 mile) chain of scoria   cones and shield volcanoes that together cover 250 square kilometers (100   square miles). The entire chain formed over a period of several thousand   years that ended about 12,000 years ago.          Figure 5. Belknap Crater (on skyline, right of  center) and Little Belknap (right) mafic shield volcanoes lie just north of  McKenzie Pass. Both are formed of lava flows and scoria deposits that were  erupted about 1,500 years ago.  Photo by William E. Scott, USGS         Lava flows that dam or divert streams and rivers generate additional hazards.    Lakes formed behind lava dams can submerge large upstream areas depending   on dam height and topography. For example, about 7,000 years ago a lava   flow from Lava Butte dammed the reach of the Deschutes River just below   Sunriver and flooded much of the broad basin from Sunriver to almost La   Pine. Popular recreational lakes like Clear Lake in the upper McKenzie   valley and Sparks, Elk, and Lava Lakes in the upper Deschutes valley are   all dammed by lava flows. Lakes dammed by lava flows can also cause flooding   downstream if conditions favor rapid erosion of lake outlets.      The most hazardous events at mafic volcanoes occur when rising magma interacts   explosively with surface water or shallow ground water. Such explosions   form craters and can generate pyroclastic flows that sweep outward several   kilometers. North and South Twin Lakes, near Wickiup Reservoir, fill two   of a series of explosion craters formed in this way. Future mafic eruptions   in areas of abundant ground or surface water like the basins of Sparks   Lake, Crane Prairie, and Wickiup Reservoir might result in this type of   explosive activity.       Volcano-Hazards Zonation Map         The accompanying volcano-hazards zonation map shows areas most likely to   be affected by future hazardous geologic events in the Three Sisters region.   Individual events typically affect only part of a hazard zone. The location   and size of an affected area will depend on the location of the erupting   vent or landslide, the volume of material involved, the snow and ice conditions   around and down slope from the vent, and the character of an eruption,   especially its explosivity.      Hazardous areas around composite volcanoes are divided into  proximal  and    distal hazard zones  depending on distance from the volcano. Some zones   are subdivided further on the basis of their relative degree of hazard.   Zone boundaries are positioned on the basis of (1) the magnitude of past   events at the volcano, as inferred from deposits; (2) mathematical models   that use calibrations from other volcanoes to forecast the probable extent   of future pyroclastic flows, debris avalanches, and lahars; and (3) our   experience and judgment derived from observations and understanding of   events at other similar volcanoes. A regional hazard zone for lava flows   of mafic volcanoes is also shown. Hazard zones for tephra falls are shown   as small-scale inset maps.      Although the hazard map shows sharp boundaries for hazard zones, the  degree   of hazard does not change abruptly at these boundaries . Rather, the hazard   decreases gradually as distance from the volcano increases and decreases   more rapidly as elevation above valley floors increases. Areas immediately   beyond outer hazard zones should not be regarded as hazard-free, because   the boundaries can only be located approximately, especially in areas of   low relief. Too many uncertainties exist about the source, size, and mobility   of future events to locate the boundaries of zero-hazard zones precisely.       Proximal Hazard Zone         The proximal hazard zone includes areas immediately surrounding the three   composite volcanoes, Middle and South Sister and Broken Top, and the large   mafic volcano, North Sister. This zone, which extends outward from summits   for as little as 2 to as many as 10 kilometers (6 miles) depending on local   topography, is subject to several types of rapidly moving, devastating   flows including pyroclastic flows, debris avalanches, lahars, and dam-break   floods  [3] . Lava flows could also affect these zones, but they would move   much more slowly.      On the basis of eruptive activity during the recent geologic past, Middle   and South Sister are the most likely locations for explosive eruptions   that could generate pyroclastic flows. As in the past, vents may open anywhere   on these volcanoes, from the summit to lower flanks. Because such flows   are driven by gravity, those that originate at higher altitudes will generally   travel farther. Eruptions on these peaks would also melt sufficient snow   and ice to generate lahars large enough to extend into the distal hazard   zones.      The probability of future explosive eruptions at Middle and South Sister   is difficult to estimate from the geologic record owing to its fragmentary   nature. Since the last ice age ended, about 12,000 years ago, only two   episodes of explosive eruptions occurred at South Sister, and these were   so closely spaced in time about 2,000 years ago that we regard them as   a single eruptive period that lasted several decades to a few centuries   and encompassed numerous separate eruptive events. Erosion by ice-age glaciers   makes detailed identification and dating of explosive activity during and   prior to the last ice age difficult, but preliminary studies suggest that   at least several eruptive periods occurred at South Sister between about   30,000 and 12,000 years ago although none of these periods are well dated    [1].  This fragmentary record indicates that major periods of eruptive activity   may be separated by several thousand to as much as 10,000 years of dormancy,   which implies an annual probability of entering a new period of eruptive   activity at South and Middle Sister of one in several thousand to 1 in   10,000. However, any signs of restlessness at these volcanoes will increase   these probabilities dramatically. Annual probabilities would likewise rise   greatly if a volcano were to enter an eruptive period.      South, Middle, and North Sister as well as Broken Top are high, steep-sided   peaks that could also produce debris avalanches. Avalanches of modest volume   (less than about 10 million cubic meters) are the most probable and would   affect areas primarily within the proximal hazard zone. Nevertheless, even   modest-sized avalanches that contain sufficient water could transform into   lahars that travel well into distal hazard zones. Very large avalanches,   those involving hundreds of millions of cubic meters of rock debris would   likely be preceded by pronounced volcano deformation driven by intrusion   of magma. Such activity would be detectable by seismometers and volcano   surveys, and thus would elicit advance warning.      Failure of glacial moraine dams that impound high-altitude lakes around   the Three Sisters and Broken Top could release floods of water and debris   whose major impact would be restricted to the proximal hazard zone but   which could inundate parts of distal hazard zones adjacent to streams.   Carver Lake, which lies in the headwaters of the South Fork of Squaw Creek,   and the lake on the east side of Broken Top that drains to Sparks Lake   by way of Crater Creek and Soda Creek, are judged the most likely lakes   to generate future floods or debris flows large enough to affect areas   beyond the proximal hazard zone  [4] . Others of less hazard include several   small lakes in the headwaters of Squaw Creek and the basin (currently with   no lake) below Collier Glacier at the head of White Branch.       Distal Hazard Zones         Explosive eruptions or large debris avalanches on the volcanoes in the   proximal hazard zone can generate lahars of sufficient volume to travel   tens of kilometers (or miles) from source areas. The hazard-zonation map   shows that distal hazards from such events are concentrated in the valleys   of the McKenzie River and its tributaries (White Branch, Separation Creek,   and Horse Creek), the upper Deschutes River, and two Deschutes tributaries   (Tumalo and Squaw Creeks). Debris avalanches and lahars will tend to funnel   into these valleys as they leave the slopes of the large volcanoes within   the proximal hazard zone.      Eruptions 2,000 years ago did not melt enough snow and ice to generate   lahars that traveled much beyond the proximal hazard zone. Some previous   eruptions probably generated  lahars that inundated distal zones, but geologic   evidence of such events is scant and provides little guidance to forecasting   the extent of lahars that may be produced by future eruptions. Likewise,   we have no record of large lahars generated by debris avalanches from which   to assess potential hazards. We therefore use a mathematical technique   that uses data from other volcanoes to estimate the extent of distal inundation   by future lahars of various volumes  [5] .      For each of the major valleys draining the Three Sisters and Broken Top   volcanoes, we computed three nested distal hazard zones that depict anticipated   inundation by hypothetical lahars of three volumes. The largest of these   hypothetical lahar volumes yields the largest distal hazard zone in each   valley; it results from our estimate of the maximum quantity of debris   that might descend suddenly from South or Middle Sister. However, such   extreme lahars would require wholesale failure of a large part of an upper   volcano flank and are unlikely to occur without precursory volcanic activity.   The smallest distal hazard zone in each valley depicts anticipated inundation   patterns from lahars 25 times smaller, which might occur without volcanic   precursors. A hazard zone for only this smallest hypothetical event is   shown in the valley of Tumalo Creek on the east side of Broken Top, because   larger events are very improbable given the small volume of material available   in the drainage area upstream.      Because large lahars are less likely to occur than are small lahars, the   nested distal hazard zones show that the likelihood of lahar inundation   decreases as distances from volcanoes and elevations above valley floors   increase. On the basis of no prior events in the past 10,000 years, we   estimate that a lahar voluminous enough to inundate the largest of the   distal hazard zones in any valley has an annual probability less than 1   in 10,000. A lahar voluminous enough to inundate the smallest of the distal   hazard zones in any valley has a greater annual probability, perhaps between   1 in 1000 to 1 in 10,000. Still smaller lahars that result from phenomena   such as moraine-dam failures are much more likely to occur (annual probability   greater than 1 in 100 in potentially affected valleys), but are apt to   inundate only parts of the smallest distal hazard zones immediately adjacent   to streams. In such instances, some debris may travel farther downstream   but stay mostly confined within stream banks.          Figure 6. This house in a distal hazard zone of  Mount St. Helens was partly buried by lahars from the 1980 eruption. Note the  high mud line on the house and large amounts of woody debris carried by the  lahars.  Photo by Lyn Topinka, USGS.            McKenzie River Valley      White Branch and Separation Creek drain the west slopes of North, Middle,   and South Sister. Separation Creek joins the valley of Horse Creek, and   the valleys of both Horse Creek and White Branch enter the McKenzie River   valley near McKenzie Bridge. Smaller-volume lahars will largely come to   rest here as material is deposited in this broad and relatively gently   sloping reach of the valley. Parts of these lahars could continue downstream,   but be largely restricted to channels and flood plains. The potential exists   for deposits in the area around Belknap Springs or McKenzie Bridge to temporarily   impound water in the reach of the McKenzie immediately upstream. Breaching   of these temporary debris dams could send floods and lahars racing further   downstream. Larger-volume lahars will travel much farther westward.      Flushing of sediment from lahar-impacted areas in the years and decades   following eruptions could fill the McKenzie River channel, decreasing its   capacity to carry flood water and causing the channel to shift across the   valley floor. Depending on the volume of lahar deposits and degree of disturbance   to the watershed, such effects could spawn ongoing sediment problems in   the lower McKenzie valley and along the Willamette River below the McKenzie   confluence, far beyond the initial path of lahars.       Upper Deschutes River Valley      The upper Deschutes River valley, which heads on the south flank of South   Sister and the south and west slopes of Broken Top, consists of a series   of broad lava-dammed basins such as those containing Sparks, Elk, and Lava   Lakes and Crane Prairie Reservoir. These basins will effectively retard   the downstream advance of lahars by causing deposition. However, persistent   sediment problems could follow lahar emplacement as sediment is flushed   through these shallow basins, into Wickiup Reservoir, and farther downstream.   Large developed areas of Sunriver and Bend lie close to the flood plain   of the Deschutes River and could be affected by channel aggradation and   migration resulting from increased sediment loads.       Tumalo Creek Valley      Tumalo Creek drains the area east of Broken Top and is unlikely to experience   large lahars owing to lack of much volcano mass in its headwaters. Nevertheless,   small lahars might descend Tumalo Creek if rapid sedimentation in Crater   Creek accompanied a large landslide or failure of the moraine dam on the   east side of Broken Top and diverted debris over a low divide into Tumalo   Creek. Some debris might also enter Tumalo Creek by way of Crater Creek   Ditch to the south of Broken Top.         Squaw Creek Valley      Squaw Creek and its tributaries drain the east flanks of North, Middle,   and South Sister and the north flank of Broken Top. The headwater streams   join above a narrow valley that opens into a broad, gently sloping debris   fan occupied, in part, by the city of Sisters. Below Sisters, Squaw Creek   enters a narrow, deepening canyon that joins the canyon of the Deschutes   River just upstream from Lake Billy Chinook.      The broad fan of Squaw Creek around Sisters is of particular concern with   regard to potential lahar inundation because Squaw Creek drains a large   sector of the major volcanoes and the distance to Sisters is relatively   short (about 30 kilometers or 20 miles). Typical flow velocities for lahars   through terrain like that along Squaw Creek yield travel times to Sisters   of as little as 30 minutes to one hour, depending on lahar size and point   of origin.       Regional Lava-Flow Hazard Zone      The regional lava-flow hazard zone outlines the area of the Three Sisters   region subject to lava flows from eruptions of mafic volcanoes. The zone   is defined by the distribution of mafic volcanoes that formed during roughly   the past one million years. Hazards from thick tephra fall, ballistic projectiles,   and pyroclastic flows would be restricted to within a few kilometers of   vents, but lava flows could travel much farther. As past lava flows from   mafic volcanoes in the region  traveled typically less than 10 to 15 kilometers   (6 to 9 miles) and rarely 15-20 kilometers (9-12 miles) from vents, we   locate the hazard zone boundary about 10 kilometers downslope from the   margin of the potential vent area, but caution that exceptional lava flows   could extend farther. The hazard zone covers a broad area in central Oregon,   including Bend, Sisters, and La Pine.      The lava-flow hazard zone includes areas on the lower flanks of Newberry   volcano that are described in a report similar to this one (U.S. Geological   Survey Open-File Report 97-513, see References and Suggested Additional   Reading).      The annual probability of an eruption of a mafic volcano within the Three   Sisters region can be estimated from the frequency of past activity as   shown in the middle column of Figure 3. During the past 6,000 years, four   episodes of activity, each lasting up to several centuries long and consisting   of eruption of scoria and lava flows from several vents, have affected   the region. Such a frequency suggests that the average annual probability   of future mafic eruptions is roughly 1 in 1,500  [6] . Because most recent   activity has been concentrated in the area between the North Sister and   Santiam Pass, future activity is probably more likely there than in other   parts of the lava-flow hazard zone to the south and east, which includes   most of the settled areas in the region. Furthermore, because only a relatively   small part of the entire lava-flow hazard zone is affected during one eruptive   episode, the annual probability of any given point in the hazard zone being   affected is considerably less than the average annual probability of 1   in 1,500. We estimate the range of annual probabilities falls between 1   in 10,000, for some areas near the Cascade Crest around Three Sisters and   on the upper flanks of Newberry volcano, to 1 in 1,000,000 elsewhere.          Figure 7. Even a minor tephra fall can be  disruptive in populated areas. Visibility was reduced by this tephra fall of  less than 3 millimeters (1/8 inch) in Anchorage, Alaska, produced by an eruption  of Mount Spurr, which lies 130 kilometers (80 miles) away. Wind and vehicles  resuspended the tephra for days following the initial fall. The simple dust mask  worn by the bicycle rider is an effective way to minimize inhaling ash  particles.  Photo by Richard Emanuel, USGS.            Tephra Hazard Zones      Eruptions of composite and mafic volcanoes in the Three Sisters region   as well as more distant volcanoes in the Cascade Range are all sources   of potential tephra fall in local communities. In fact, since the last   ice age, the thickest tephra fall in the Bend area, probably about 30 centimeters   (one foot), originated from the huge eruption of ancient Mount Mazama that   created Crater Lake about 7,600 years ago.      The inset maps on the hazard-zonation map show the annual probability of   tephra fall affecting the central Oregon region from all major Cascade   volcanic centers. The maps are based on the combined likelihood of tephra-producing   eruptions occurring at Cascade centers, the relationship between thickness   of a tephra-fall deposit and distance from its source vent, and regional   wind patterns  [7] . Probability zones extend farther east of the range because   winds blow from westerly directions most of the time. One map shows annual   probabilities for a fall of one centimeter (about 0.4 inch) or more and   the other for a fall of 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) or more. The map   patterns illustrate clearly the dominating influence of Mount St. Helens   as a tephra producer. Because small eruptions are more numerous than large   eruptions, the probability of a thick tephra fall at a given locality is   lower than that of a thin tephra fall. The most densely populated areas   of Central Oregon have an annual probability of a tephra fall of 10 centimeters   or more of no greater than 1 in 10,000 and an annual probability of a fall   of 1 centimeter or more of about 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 5,000. The annual probability   of a fall of a few millimeters (fraction of an inch) of tephra is probably   greater than 1 in 1,000.       Hazard Forecasts and Warnings      Scientists recognize several signs of impending volcanic eruptions. The   upward movement of magma into a volcano prior to an eruption causes changes   that can usually be detected by geophysical instruments and visual observation.   Swarms of small earthquakes are generated as rocks break to make room for   rising magma or as heating of fluids causes underground pressures to increase.   Heat from the magma can increase the temperature of ground water and boost   temperatures and steaming from fumaroles; it can also generate small steam   explosions. The composition of gases emitted by fumaroles can change as   magma nears the surface. Injection of magma into the volcano can cause   swelling or other types of surface deformation.      A regional seismic network, the Pacific Northwest Seismograph Network,   operated jointly by the Geophysics Program at the University of Washington   and U.S. Geological Survey has located few earthquakes in the Three Sisters   region during the past two decades. The onset of earthquake activity would   quickly gain scientists’ attention and prompt deployment of additional   seismometers to better locate earthquakes. At monitored volcanoes elsewhere   in the world similar to those in the Three Sisters region, a notable increase   in seismicity has occurred days to months before eruptions. Earthquakes   associated with volcanic unrest are typically small (rarely exceeding magnitude   4) and generally pose little direct hazard to structures in surrounding   communities.      Scientists have conducted other studies aimed at developing baseline data   to help detect precursory activity at South Sister. A network of precisely   surveyed points has been remeasured several times. An increase in seismicity   would prompt the resurvey of this network or creation of new networks to   look for slight ground movements that might indicate upward movement of   new magma. Concurrently, ground-based and airborne techniques would be   employed to search for signs of volcanic gas release, another sign of magma   movement.      Periods of unrest at volcanoes are usually times of great uncertainty.   Although outstanding advances have been made in volcano monitoring and   eruption forecasting over the past few decades, scientists are often able   to make only very general statements about the probability, type, and scale   of an impending eruption. Precursory activity can go through accelerating   and decelerating phases, and sometimes die out without leading to eruption.   Government officials and the public must realize the limitations in forecasting   eruptions and be prepared for such uncertainty.         Protecting Our Communities and Ourselves From Volcano Hazards      Communities, businesses, and citizens need to plan ahead to mitigate the   effects of future eruptions, debris avalanches, and lahars. Long-term mitigation   includes using information about volcano hazards when making decisions   about land use and siting of critical facilities. For example, development   could avoid areas judged to have an unacceptably high risk or be planned   to reduce the level of risk.      When volcanoes erupt or threaten to erupt, appropriate emergency responses   are needed. Such responses will be most effective if citizens and public   officials have an understanding of volcano hazards and have planned the   actions needed to protect communities. Because an eruption can occur within   days to months of the first precursory activity and because some hazardous   events can occur without warning, suitable emergency plans should be made   beforehand. Public officials need to consider issues such as public education,   communications, and evacuations. Emergency plans already developed for   floods may apply, with modifications, to hazards from lahars.      Businesses and individuals should also make plans to respond to volcano   emergencies. Planning is prudent because once an emergency begins, public   resources can often be overwhelmed, and citizens may need to provide for   themselves and make informed decisions. The Red Cross recommends numerous   items that should be kept in homes, cars, and businesses for many types   of emergencies that are much more probable than a volcanic eruption. A   map showing the shortest route to high ground will also be helpful.      The most important additional item is knowledge about volcano hazards and,   especially, a plan of action based on the relative safety of areas around   home, school, and work. Lahars pose the biggest sudden threat to people   living in valleys that drain the Three Sisters. The best strategy for avoiding   a lahar is to move to the highest possible ground. A safe height above   river channels depends on many factors including size of the lahar, distance   from the volcano, and shape of the valley. For areas beyond the proximal   hazard zone, all but the largest lahars will probably rise less than 30   meters (100 feet) above river level.

[2]  Mafic refers to the type of lava erupted by these short-lived volcanoes.   Most are composed of basalt or basaltic andesite—a few are andesite. This   contrasts with composite volcanoes that erupt mafic lava as well as more   silica-rich lava such as dacite or rhyolite. Eruption of silica-rich lava   is typically more explosive than that of mafic lava.       [3 ] The proximal hazard zone was created by projecting so-called energy   cones described by  H/L  = 0.2 from the summits of four high peaks (South,   Middle, and North Sister and Broken Top) on a digital topographic base   map of the Three Sisters area ( cf. e.g. , Malin, M.C., and Sheridan, M.F.,   1982, Computer-assisted mapping of pyroclastic surges, Science, 217, 637-640;   Hayashi, J.N., and Self, S., 1992, A comparison of pyroclastic flow and   debris avalanche mobility, Journal of Geophysical Research, 97(B), 9063-9071;   Iverson, R.M., Schilling, S.P. and Vallance, J.W., 1998, Objective delineation   of lahar-inundation zones: Geological Society of America Bulletin, 110,   972-984). Here  H  is the vertical distance of descent from the summit, and    L  is the horizontal distance of travel from the summit. Pyroclastic flows   typically exhibit energy-cone slopes no lower than  H/L  = 0.2. Debris avalanches   of large volume (more than 100 million cubic meters) can exhibit lower   energy-cone slopes than do pyroclastic flows (travel farther for a given   drop), and most such far-traveled avalanches at Three Sisters would funnel   from the proximal hazard zone into valleys encompassed within distal hazard   zones.       [4]  Detailed assessments of floods and lahars associated with emptying   of moraine-dammed lakes in the Three Sisters region have been described   elsewhere (Laenen, A., Scott, K.M., Costa, J.E., and Orzol, L.L., 1987,   Hydrologic hazards along Squaw Creek from a hypothetical failure of the   glacial moraine impounding Carver lake near Sisters, Oregon, U.S. Geological   survey Open-file Report 87-41; O’Connor, J.E., Hardison III, J.H., and   Costa, J.E., in press, Debris flows from failures of Neoglacial moraine   dams in the Three Sisters and Mt. Jefferson Wilderness Areas, Oregon, U.S.   Geological Survey Professional Paper 1608). These assessments indicate   that moraine-dammed lakes in the Three Sisters region contain less than   1 million cubic meters of water each. On the basis of this water volume,   lake geometry, and the past behavior of dam-breach floods in the Three   Sisters region and elsewhere (i.e., Walder, J.S., and O’Connor, J.E., 1997,   Methods for predicting peak discharge of floods caused by failure of natural   and constructed earthen dams, Water Resources Research, 33, 2337-2348),   we estimate that water discharges resulting from future failures of moraine   dams in the Three Sisters region will probably not exceed 300 cubic meters   per second (10,000 cubic feet per second). Flood magnitude might increase   where substantial volumes of sediment are entrained to form lahars, but   the resulting lahar volume is unlikely to exceed several million cubic   meters. The resulting areas of downstream innundation will probably be   smaller than those shown for the smallest (inner) distal hazard zone shown   on the map.       [5]  Distal lahar hazard zones were constructed by assuming hypothetical   lahar volumes of 20 million, 100 million, and 500 million cubic meters.   Using mathematical and digital cartographic techniques described by Iverson,   R.M., Schilling, S.P., and Vallance, J.W., 1998, Objective delineation   of lahar-inundation zones: Geological Society of America Bulletin, v. 110,   p. 972-984, these three volumes were used to compute the probable extent   of inundation downstream from the proximal hazard zone. The largest assumed   volume (500 million cubic meters) represents the largest event that we   believe could occur at the Three Sisters, and it produces the largest distal   hazard zones. The smaller assumed volumes produce smaller nested hazard   zones.       [6]  The average frequency is one eruptive episode per 1,500 years (6,000/4   = 1,500). The average annual probability of the onset of a future episode   is therefore 1 in 1,500.       [7]  Tephra-hazard maps were generated by computer program developed by   R.P. Hoblitt (U.S. Geological Survey, Cascades Volcano Observatory, 1996).             To contact the author, email   William Scott  (wescott@usgs.gov).

The relative ages of lavas can be  readily established from morphological relations, with the oldest capping mesas or buttes, and the most recent  occupying present drainage valleys.  Many of these young flows have no soils developed on them and have well preserved  flow features and associated cinder cones.  The youngest measured age is 12,500 years ago for a young  flow at the Grand Canyon.      The  Uinkaret volcanic field  (1.2 million years ago  to 12,500 years ago) at the north rim of the Grand Canyon  in the Grand Canyon National Park is especially noteworthy.  The lavas are alkalic and commonly contain periodotite inclusions.           Vulcan's Throne , a    Quaternary cinder cone    on the rim of the Canyon is cut by recent fault movement on the  Toroweap fault . Late Cenozoic lava flows have repeatedly flowed down Toroweap Valley and  several adjacent valleys into the Grand Canyon, at times forming large lava dams.   Flows are exposed on the walls of the Grand Canyon, often interbedded with fluvial and lacustrine sediments, up to 600 meters  above present river level.  Several of the dams are estimated to have been at least 200 meters high.   The most recent flows in the Grand Canyon have cascaded over the rim of the Esplanade to the river 1,000 meters below.       Within the river itself is a volcanic neck,   Vulcan's Forge , 25 meters in diameter and rising 15 meters above the river.                       San Francisco Volcanic Field             From: Priest, Duffield, Malis-Clark, Hendley II, and Stauffer, 2001, The San Francisco Volcanic Field, Arizona: USGS Fact Sheet 017-01         Northern Arizona's San Francisco Volcanic Field , much of                           which lies within Coconino and Kaibab National Forests, is                           an area of young volcanoes along the southern margin of                           the Colorado Plateau. During its 6-million-year history,                           this field has produced more than 600 volcanoes. Their                           activity has created a topographically varied landscape                           with forests that extend from the Pinon-Juniper up to the                           Bristlecone Pine life zones. The most prominent landmark                           is  San Francisco Mountain , a      stratovolcano    that rises to 12,633 feet and serves as a scenic backdrop to the city of Flagstaff.      The San Francisco Volcanic Field, which covers about 1,800 square miles, is part of northern Arizona's spectacular landscape. Much of the field lies within Coconino and Kaibab National Forests. Forest life zones in the region range from Pinon-Juniper at lower elevations through Ponderosa Pine to Fir and Bristlecone Pine at the highest elevations. The varied forests and geologic features of the San Francisco Volcanic Field offer diverse recreational opportunities, including camping, hiking, mountain biking, wildlife viewing, and winter sports.      Almost all hills and mountains between Flagstaff and the Grand Canyon are geologically young but extinct volcanoes of the San Francisco Volcanic Field. Without the volcanoes, this region would be a flat, arid plateau. Instead, the area includes both Arizona.s highest mountain.San Francisco Mountain, with peaks rising to 12,633 feet.and the State's youngest volcano -- Sunset Crater, which erupted less than 1,000 years ago and has been a National Monument since 1930.      Why does Northern Arizona have so many geologically young volcanoes? Most volcanoes are located near boundaries of the Earth's tectonic plates, but Arizona is well within the interior of the North American Plate. Some geologists suggest that there is a site of localized melting, or ""hot spot,"" fixed deep within the Earth's mantle beneath northern Arizona. As the North American Plate moves slowly westward over this stationary source of molten rock (magma), eruptions produce volcanoes that are strung out progressively eastward.      The first volcanoes in the San Francisco Volcanic Field began to erupt about 6 million years ago, in an area where the town of Williams is now. Subsequently, a several-mile-wide belt of successively younger eruptions migrated eastward, to the area of modern Flagstaff, and even a bit beyond, toward the valley of the Little Colorado River. Today, this belt of volcanoes extends about 50 miles from west to east.      Although there has been no eruption for nearly 1,000 years, it is likely that eruptions will occur again in the San Francisco Volcanic Field. With an average interval of several thousand years between past periods of volcanic activity, it is impossible to forecast when the next eruption will occur. U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists believe that the most probable sites of future eruptions are in the eastern part of the field and that the eruptions are likely to be small. These future eruptions may provide spectacular volcanic displays but should pose little hazard because of their small size and the relative remoteness of the area.              Humphreys Peak             The peaks of San Francisco Mountain, an eroded                        stratovolcano.which includes Arizona's highest point,                        Humphreys Peak at 12,633 feet -- tower over the ruins of an                        ancient Native American pueblo in Wupatki National                        Monument. The ancient inhabitants of this area must have                        witnessed the eruption of nearby Sunset Crater, the State.s                        youngest volcano, which erupted in about A.D. 1064. San                        Francisco Mountain and Sunset Crater are only two of the                        hundreds of volcanoes in the San Francisco Volcanic Field,                        which covers about 1,800 square miles of northern Arizona.                                     San Francisco Mountain               Stratovolcanoes    have moderately steep slopes and form by the accumulation of layer upon layer of intermediate-viscosity (andesite) lava flows, cinders, and ash, interspersed with deposits from volcanic mudflows (lahars) at lower elevations. These tall, cone-shaped volcanoes, such as Mount Rainier, Washington, and Mount Fuji, Japan, normally rise to a central peak and are built up by countless eruptions over hundreds of thousands of years.  San Francisco Mountain is the only stratovolcano in the San Francisco Volcanic Field and was built by eruptions between about 1 and 0.4 million years ago. Since then, much of the mountain has been removed to create the ""Inner Basin."" The missing material may have been removed quickly and explosively by an eruption similar to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, Washington, or it may have been removed slowly and incrementally by a combination of large landslides, water erosion, and glacial scouring.             Eldon Mountain and Sugarloaf Mountain             The San Francisco Volcanic Field also includes several     lava domes .   Lava domes are formed by dacite and rhyolite magmas, which have high silica contents. Dacite and rhyolite are so viscous that they tend to pile up and form very steep-sided bulbous masses (domes) at the site of eruption. Domes can be active for decades or sometimes centuries. If a lava dome grows entirely by internal inflation, similar to a balloon, it is called an endogenous dome. If, however, magma breaks out through a dome.s flank during inflation and adds new lava layers to the outer surface, the final dome is called exogenous.  Elden Mountain, at the eastern outskirts of Flagstaff, is an excellent example of an exogenous dacite dome and consists of several overlapping lobes of lava. Sugarloaf Mountain, at the entrance to San Francisco Mountain.s Inner Basin, is a rhyolite lava dome. This dome is thought to be endogenous, but its forest cover hides direct evidence of its internal structure.               SP Crater             Most of the more than 600 volcanoes in the San Francisco Volcanic Field are basalt     cinder cones .   Basalt has the lowest viscosity of all common magmas. Cinder cones are relatively small, usually less than 1,000 feet tall, and form within months to years. They are built when gas-charged frothy blobs of basalt magma are erupted as an upward spray, or lava fountain. During flight, these lava blobs cool and fall back to the ground as dark volcanic rock containing cavities created by trapped gas bubbles. If small, these fragments of rock are called ""cinders"" and, if larger, ""bombs."" As the fragments accumulate, they build a cone-shaped hill. Once sufficient gas pressure has been released from the supply of magma, lava oozes quietly out to form a lava flow. This lava typically squeezes out from the base of the cone and tends to flow away for a substantial distance because of its low viscosity. SP Crater, 25 miles north of Flagstaff, is an excellent example of a cinder cone and its associated lava flow.          From: USGS/NPS Geology of the National Parks Website, Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument, August 2001        San Francisco Peaks  are the remnants of the only     stratovolcano    in the  San Francisco volcanic field . For decades, volcanologists suggested  that the mountain now called San Francisco Peaks had simply worn  away over time, eroded bit by bit to form its current bowl-shaped top.  Then, in 1980, the catastrophic explosion of Mount St. Helens forced  us to rethink our ideas about volcanoes.  Many volcanologists now feel that the scooped-out shape of the San Francisco Peaks  may be the result of a catastrophic sideways blast like that of Mount St. Helens.           From: U.S. National Park Service Website, Geology Fieldnotes - Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument, Arizona, April 2000          The cones and lava flows of the    San Francisco volcanic field ,   which covers about 2,000 square miles of the southwestern Colorado Plateau, result from several million years of volcanic activity. These powerful underground forces changed the landscape dramatically beginning in the winter of AD 1064-65.      Sunset Crater    appeared when molten rock sprayed out of a crack in the ground high into the air,  solidified, then fell to earth as large bombs or smaller cinders.  ...          From: Wood and Kienle, 1990, Volcanoes of North America: United States and Canada: Cambridge University Press, 354p., p.280-281,  Contribution by Stephen Self       The  San Francisco volcanic field  is one of several dominantly basaltic volcanic fields of late     Cenozoic age   near the south margin of the Colorado Plateau.  The volcanic field, which is predominantly of Pliocene and Pleistocene age, is just north of a broad transition zone between the Colorado Plateau and Basin and Range provinces.   K-Ar  ages indicate a general north-eastward progression of volcanism during the past 15 million years across the transition zone from central Arizona onto the plateau.      The  San Francisco field lavas , ranging in composition from basalt to rhyolite, erupted through Precambrian basement and the overlying kilometer-thick cover of nearly horizontal sedimentary rocks, mostly of Paleozoic age.  The volume of volcanic rocks is approximately 500 cubic kilometers; they cover an area of about 5,000 square kilometers. ...       Most of the  San Francisco field  is covered by basalt flows ranging in age from approximately 6 million years to less than 1,000 years.  Flows erupted from approximately 600 individual vents, most of which are marked by    cinder cones .    The basalt is predominantly alkali-olivine basalt and associated plagioclase-rich basalt of hawaiitic composition.  ...         The western centers consist of closely spaced silicic domes and some viscous flows.     Bill Williams Mountain  (4.2-2.8 million years ago),  the oldest of the western centers, is composed primarily of andesite and dacite.     Sitgreaves Mountain  (2.8-1.9 million years ago), consists almost entirely of rhyolite domes.     Kendrick Peak  (2.7-1.4 million years ago), consists dominantly of dacite and rhyolite domes and  flows that were intruded and partly buried by andesite. ...      Two additional intermediate to silicic centers,   San Francisco Mountain  and  O'Leary Peak   in the eastern part of the volcanic field ... and are mostly younger than the western centers.         The upper part of the  San Francisco Mountain  is a truncated    stratovolcano   built primarily of porphyritic andesitic and dacitic flows and pyroclastic deposits erupted approximately 1 million to 400,000 thousand years ago.  These lavas overlie still older dacite and rhyolite, however, that are as old as 2.8 million years.  Except for a small volume of plagioclase-rich basalt, basaltic lavas are conspicuously absent within  San Francisco Mountain , even though basalt of the same general age was erupted abundantly to the west, north, and east.  This virtual absence of basalt may reflect the presence of an evolved magma chamber beneath the stratovolcano that blocked ascent of basaltic magma to the surface. ...      The  Sugarloaf rhyolite dome  erupted on the northeast flank of  San Francisco Mountain  approximately 220,000 years ago.  About the same time, the  O'Leary Peak volcanic center , which includes a pair of dacite-porphyry domes, several dacite flows, an andesite flow, and small rhyolite domes, erupted approximately 9 kilometers to the northeast.  One of the dacite-porphyry domes has been dated at 240,000 years, and a dacite flow at 170,000 years.  The  O'Leary Peak volcanic center  and  Sugarloaf  are the youngest major silicic eruptives in the  San Francisco volcanic field .      A deep linear valley transecting the northeast quadrant of  San Francisco Mountain  was formed between 400,000 years ago, when the youngest unit of the composite cone was erupted, and 220,000 years ago, when  Sugarloaf dome  was emplaced at the valley's northeast end.  After the  Sugarloaf  eruption, glaciation further sculptured the valley. ...      The youngest (less than 200,000 years) basaltic lavas occur north and east of  San Francisco Mountain .  The most recent eruption, which began about 1065, A.D., produced the    Sunset Crater Cinder Cone ,  three lava flows, and an extensive air-fall tephra sheet.

From: U.S. National Park Service Website, Geology Fieldnotes - Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument, Arizona, April 2000          The cones and lava flows of the   San Francisco volcanic field ,   which covers about 2,000 square miles of the southwestern Colorado Plateau, result from several million years of volcanic activity. These powerful underground forces changed the landscape dramatically beginning in the winter of AD 1064-65.   Sunset Crater  appeared when molten rock sprayed out of a crack in the ground high into the air,  solidified, then fell to earth as large bombs or smaller cinders. As periodic eruptions continued over the next 200 years, the heavier debris accumulated around the vent creating a 1,000-foot cone. The lightest, smallest particles blew the farthest, dusting 800 square miles of northern Arizona with ash. Perhaps as spectacular as the original pyrotechnics were two subsequent lava flows: the  Kana-A flow  in 1064 and the   Bonito flow  in 1180. They destroyed all living things in their paths. ... In a final burst of activity, around 1250, lava containing iron and sulfur shot out of the vent. The red and yellow  oxidized particles fell back onto the rim as a permanent ""sunset"" so bright that the cone appears still to glow from intense volcanic heat.           From: Wood and Kienle, 1990, Volcanoes of North America: United States and Canada: Cambridge University Press, 354p., p.280-281,  Contribution by Stephen Self         Sunset Crater  is one of the youngest     scoria cones   in the contiguous United States.  The cone is named for the topmost cap of oxidized, red spatter which makes it appear bathed in the light of the sunset.  In the 1920's H.S. Colton saved the cone from severe damage by averting the attempt of a Hollywood movie company to blow it up in order to simulate an eruption.  This led to the establishment of the     National Monument at Sunset Crater .      The Sunset eruption products are a classic example of a monogenetic    strombolian volcanism .    The eruption began with the opening of a 15-kilometer-long fissure, accompanied by curtain of fire activity and the growth of a small lava flow at the southeast end.  Strombolian fountaining then localized near the northwest end and   Sunset scoria cone    grew, with the simultaneous deposition of a widespread scoria fall layer.  At the same time the 11-kilometer-long  Kana-a lava flow   issured from the cone.  This was followed by further cone building and the production of the   Bonito lava flow .  This flow may have come from the base of the cone, as it has rafted portions of the cone on its surface.  The last phase of the eruption featured low-level fountaining that repaired the cone and deposited the cap of scoria and spatter, which oxidized bright red due to retained heat. ...       The age of the eruption is known from an archaeological site in the vicinity of the crater.        How to get there:  From U. S. Route 66 in Flagstaff, take U. S. Route 89 north toward Cameron.  After approximately 15 kilometers look for the right turn for  Sunset Crater National Monument .

The consolidated deposits of pyroclastic flows, lava flows and domes, and lahars in the Superstition Mountains and adjacent areas testify to a period of intense volcanism about 17 to 25 million years ago in central Arizona.

Introduction Battle Creek is a cold water, mountain stream located to the west of Lassen Peak, in northern California. The creek joins the Sacramento River about midway between Redding and Red Bluff, near the location of the Coleman National Fish Hatchery (see Project Location Map, Appendix A-1). It is largely fed by rainfall and snowmelt from along the western slope of the Cascade Mountain Range, and is supplemented by natural springs. Battle Creek is recognized as one of three remaining Sacramento River tributaries in which spring-run and winter-run chinook salmon, and steelhead trout continue to exist. Its remote, deep-shaded gorges are similar to the once-productive salmon streams now blocked by Shasta Dam to the north. Development of Battle Creek for hydroelectric power by the Northern California Power Company resulted in the construction during the early 1900's of five diversion dams on the North Fork and three diversion dams on the South Fork, along with a complex canal system, to support five separate powerplants [1,2]. Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) has owned and operated the Battle Creek Hydroelectric Project since 1919. The project was initially licensed by the Federal Power Commission in 1932 and was relicensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in 1976 for a period of 50 years (License No. 1121) [3]. Declining salmonid populations in the Sacramento River system have resulted in increased restoration efforts to preserve and enhance current populations, while addressing the needs of various stakeholders. Numerous recent fishery restoration plans have identified the restoration of fish passage in Battle Creek as a top priority. Studies are currently underway to address water quality concerns at the Coleman National Fish Hatchery, and to improve anadromous fish populations on 39 miles of Battle Creek above the fish hatchery and below natural barrier falls. A salmon and steelhead restoration plan is currently being developed by Kier Associates of Sausalito, California [3]. The California Department of Water Resources (DWR) is developing reconnaissance-level designs and cost estimates for various fish ladder and fish screen locations, which will provide reliable upstream passage for adult salmon and steelhead, and downstream passage for juvenile fish [4]. The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) was requested to develop reconnaissance-level designs and cost estimates for the removal of two diversion dams on the North Fork, and one diversion dam on the South Fork, in concert with these studies. B. Project Objectives Stated project objectives are to open up 39 miles of Battle Creek above the Coleman National Fish Hatchery to spring-run and winter-run chinook salmon and steelhead trout, by correcting problems associated with ineffective fish ladders, unscreened diversions, and inadequate streamflows. Selected habitats could also be made available to fall-run and late fall-run chinook salmon, once populations of the more sensitive species are protected. Historical records document Battle Creek's potential as prime habitat for anadromous fish. Proposed actions were initially expected to increase usable instream habitat between 300 and 500 percent, and increase the total anadromous fish runs by nearly 20,000 [1]. Revised estimates will be prepared based on current studies.   The pending deregulation of the power industry has caused PG&E to reevaluate its hydropower assets, including the Battle Creek Hydroelectric Unit. PG&E has shown a willingness to work cooperatively towards a cost effective and equitable resolution for both hydropower and fishery interests, including modification, and in some cases removal, of its existing facilities [1]. The Battle Creek Working Group, a broad-based stakeholder group which includes representatives from state and federal resource agencies as well as from environmental, local, agricultural, power, and urban stakeholder communities, was formed in 1997 to evaluate various alternatives for the development of a final restoration plan. A number of facility modifications are being considered. They include:       Install fish ladders and fish screens at North Battle Creek Feeder, Eagle Canyon, and Wildcat Diversion Dams on the North Fork. Install fish ladders and fish screens at South, Inskip, and Coleman Diversion Dams on the South Fork. Remove Eagle Canyon, Wildcat, Coleman, and South Diversion Dams and associated facilities in lieu of installing fish ladders and fish screens. Connect the Inskip Powerhouse tailrace with the Coleman Canal (Coleman Tailrace Connector). Connect the South Powerhouse tailrace with the Inskip Canal (South Powerhouse Tailrace Bypass Tunnel). Construct an Inskip Powerhouse penstock bypass.  This report provides reconnaissance-level designs and cost estimates for removal of Wildcat, Eagle Canyon, and Coleman Diversion Dams and associated facilities, as developed by Reclamation. Reclamation has also prepared reconnaissance-level designs and cost estimates for removal of South Diversion Dam and associated facilities, and for construction of the South Powerhouse Tailrace Bypass Tunnel, which are described in two separate reports by Reclamation. The California Department of Water Resources (DWR) prepared reconnaissance-level designs and cost estimates for the Coleman Tailrace Connector, Inskip Powerhouse Penstock Bypass, and fish ladders and fish screens at North Battle Creek Feeder, Wildcat, South, Inskip, and Coleman Diversion Dams [12]. In addition, DWR has prepared preliminary designs and cost estimates for fish passage facilities at Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam [2]. C. Existing Project Features The existing project features are described below, with a summary of significant engineering data provided in table 1 (see Project Vicinity Map, Appendix A-2, for dam locations). 1. Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam  2   Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam is located on the North Fork Battle Creek, about 3 miles west of Manton, and about 1 mile north of Manton Road, on private land. The dam and associated facilities were constructed within a deep gorge where the canyon walls are nearly vertical, rising about 175 feet above the main creek channel. Local geology is dominated by volcanics, consisting predominantly of basalt rock types. The drainage area above the Eagle Canyon damsite is 186 mi2, and includes the North Battle Creek Feeder, Keswick, and Al Smith Diversion Dams, Macumber Reservoir, and North Battle Creek Reservoir. The diversion dam provides up to 70 ft3/s to the Eagle Canyon Canal for power generation at the Inskip and Coleman Powerhouses, and was constructed around 1910. Although a minimum streamflow of only 3 ft3/s is legally required by FERC below Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam, PG&E currently operates the canal system to provide minimum streamflow of 30 ft3/s (including natural spring flow) below Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam whenever possible, under the terms of an interim agreement with Reclamation [2]. Principal features of the dam are shown in Appendix A (Exhibit L-18) and Appendix B (photographs 1 through 8). The dam is a masonry gravity structure with a 4-foot crest width at elevation 1412.4, and a total crest length of 66 feet. The dam structure rises about 11 feet above the original streambed surface, with an upstream slope of 0.10H:1.0V, and a downstream slope of 0.25H:1.0V. The dam masonry reportedly consists of local basalt cobbles and boulders generally ranging from 6 inches to 2 feet in diameter, set in concrete. Some concrete repairs have been made to the dam structure over the years, especially near the right abutment (looking downstream). The left half of the dam is believed to be founded on basalt bedrock, while the right half appears to be founded on large, individual basalt blocks up to 15 feet in size. A 4-foot-wide by 10-foot-high radial sluice gate is provided near the center portion of the dam, with a steel cable extending to a hand-operated winch located downstream of the dam's left abutment, for gate operation. A masonry gravity weir structure extends from just left of the sluice gate to the channel bank upstream of the dam's left abutment, for diversions to the Eagle Canyon Canal above the weir crest at elevation 1409.4. The weir structure has a crest width of 2 feet and a crest length of 37.5 feet, and rises a maximum of 8 feet above the streambed surface, with a vertical upstream slope and a downstream slope of 0.5H:1.0V. An Alaska Steeppass fish ladder is provided on the left abutment of the dam, within the original concrete steppool fish ladder structure, with a total length of 57.2 feet and a design capacity of 7 to 10 ft3/s. An abandoned tunnel passes through the left canyon wall, with an entrance about 125 feet upstream of the dam, and an outlet just upstream of the diversion gate structure for the Eagle Canyon Canal. The reservoir behind the dam is mostly filled in with sand, gravel, cobbles, boulders, and debris, so that the depth of water averages only three to five feet below the dam crest. The impoundment covers a surface area of about 1/4 acre at the dam crest. Spring flows of up to 10 ft3/s enter Battle Creek in the vicinity of the dam [3]. Diversions to the Eagle Canyon Canal are controlled by a 3.5-foot-wide by 6-foothigh slide gate on the left abutment with a sill at elevation 1405.9. A second slide gate (3-foot-wide by 6-foot-high) is located about 100 feet downstream, and permits flow return back to the creek, as required. The Eagle Canyon Canal extends over 2.5 miles to its confluence with the Inskip Canal, above the Inskip Powerhouse, and 3   consists of 1,054 feet of rock tunnel sections 7-feet-wide by 8-feet-high; 3,385 feet of metal flume sections with a 3.5-foot-radius on steel supports (type #132); 181 feet of reinforced concrete bench flume sections; and 9,053 feet of excavated channel sections (7,484 feet unlined and 1,569 feet gunite-lined) with a bottom width of 9 feet, a top width of 14 feet, and a flow depth of 4 feet. Canal flows are supplemented by spring flows to the south of Eagle Canyon through an area known as ""Spring Gardens."" The dam is not under the jurisdiction of the DWR Division of Safety of Dams, due to its small size (less than 25 feet in height, and less than 50 acre-feet of storage); however, the physical condition of the dam has been described by DWR as good, considering its age and method of construction. The basalt rocks and cement mortar were reported by DWR to show very few signs of deterioration, and seepage through and beneath the dam did not appear to be critical [2]. FERC has classified the Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam as a low hazard structure, representing no danger to human life in the event of failure. The diversion dam was inspected by FERC in July 1997, and was found to be in good condition, without signs of significant deterioration or structural distress [5]. The facility was visited by Reclamation personnel on June 26, 1998, at which time about 500 ft3/s was being released over the dam crest and 70 ft3/s was being diverted into the canal, which prevented a close inspection of the structures. 2. Wildcat Diversion Dam Wildcat Diversion Dam is located on the North Fork Battle Creek, about 3 miles downstream of Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam, and about 1 mile south of Battle Creek Bottom Road, on PG&E land. The dam and associated facilities were constructed within a deep gorge where the canyon walls rise nearly 100 feet above the main creek channel. The upstream drainage area is 189 mi2, which includes the Eagle Canyon drainage area. The diversion dam was constructed around 1910 to provide up to 18 ft3/s to the Wildcat Canal for power generation at the Coleman Powerhouse, via the Coleman Canal. No diversion of flow for power generation has occurred at the site since August 1995, under the terms of an interim agreement with Reclamation. Principal features of the dam are shown in Appendix A (Exhibits L19 and L-20) and Appendix B (photographs 9 through 14). Exhibit L-19 was superseded by exhibit L-20, but shows some existing details not shown on L-20. The dam is a masonry gravity structure with a 2-foot crest width and a 27-foot overflow crest length at elevation 1074.7, and an overall structure length of about 55 feet including abutment sections to elevation 1077.5. The dam structure rises about 8 feet above the original streambed surface, with a vertical upstream face and a minimum downstream slope of about 0.5H:1.0V. A sluiceway is provided to the right of the overflow crest, controlled by an upstream 24-inch-diameter slide gate with an invert at elevation 1070.8. A concrete steppool fish ladder structure is provided on the left abutment of the dam, with a total length of 37.5 feet, and contains an Alaska Steeppass fish ladder as shown on Exhibit L-20. The reservoir behind the dam is mostly filled in with sand, gravel, cobbles, boulders, and debris, so that the depth of water averages only a few feet below the dam crest. The impoundment covers a surface area of about 1/4 acre at the dam crest.  4   Prior to August 1995, diversions to the Wildcat Canal of up to 18 ft3/s were made through a 30-inch-diameter pipe in the right abutment section, which includes a 6.5foot-long upstream apron of masonry, a 4-foot-wide sloping metal trashrack with an estimated area of 28 ft2, and a 36-inch-diameter slide gate with a manually-operated pedestal lift and an intake sill at elevation 1071.0. The Wildcat Canal extends nearly two miles to its confluence with the Coleman Canal, and consists of 5,530 feet of 24-inch-diameter steel pipe with concrete saddles and occasional 3-inchdiameter steel pipe supports where needed, and 4,421 feet of excavated channel sections (3,504 feet unlined and 917 feet lined) with a bottom width of 4 feet, a top width of 6 feet, and a flow depth of 2 feet. In August 1996, a rockfall damaged a section of the 24-inch-diameter pipe about 1,000 feet downstream of the dam. Pipeline repairs would be required to return the Wildcat Canal to service. The dam is not under the jurisdiction of the DWR Division of Safety of Dams, due to its small size (less than 25 feet in height, and less than 50 acre-feet of storage). FERC has classified the Wildcat Diversion Dam as a low hazard structure. The diversion dam was inspected by FERC in July 1997, and was found to be in good condition, without signs of significant deterioration or structural distress [5]. The facility was visited by Reclamation personnel on July 9, 1998, at which time about 500 ft3/s was being released over the dam crest, which prevented a close inspection of the dam structure. 3. Coleman Diversion Dam Coleman Diversion Dam is located on the South Fork Battle Creek, about 6 miles west of Manton, and about 1/4 mile south of Manton Road, on PG&E land. The drainage area above the Coleman damsite is 102 mi2, and includes the Inskip and South Diversion Dams. The dam and associated facilities were constructed around 1910 for diversion of up to 340 ft3/s to the Coleman Canal for power generation at the Coleman Powerhouse. Although a minimum streamflow of only 5 ft3/s is legally required by FERC below Coleman Dam, PG&E currently operates the canal system to provide minimum streamflow of 30 ft3/s below Coleman Diversion Dam whenever possible, under the terms of an interim agreement with Reclamation. Principal features of the dam are shown in Appendix A (Exhibits L-19 and L-20) and Appendix B (photographs 15 through 21). Exhibit L-19 was superseded by exhibit L-20, but shows some existing details not shown on L-20. The dam is a masonry gravity structure with a concrete overlay, having a 4-foot crest width at elevation 1003.3 and a crest length of 87.5 feet. The dam structure rises about 13 feet above the original streambed surface, with a near vertical upstream face, and a sloping downstream face and apron providing a maximum base width of about 19 feet. A 14-foot-wide by 8-foot-high radial sluice gate is provided at the right end of the dam, with a hand-operated drum winch located on a hoist deck directly above the gate. The original concrete steppool fish ladder located on the left abutment is 56 feet long and has been abandoned in place, with a concrete head wall placed at the upstream intake. The current fish ladder is located on the right abutment and is of the Alaska Steeppass-type, with a design capacity of 7 to 10 ft3/s and a total length of about 54 feet, including two baffled flume sections and a 7foot-long concrete box. A 24-inch-wide slide gate controls releases to the fish ladder, with an intake sill at elevation 1000.68. The reservoir behind the dam is mostly filled in with sand, gravel, cobbles, and debris, so that the depth of water 5   averages only a few feet below the dam crest. The impoundment covers a surface area of about 1 acre at the dam crest.

The weir structure has a crest width of 4 feet and a crest length of 44 feet, with an approximate crest elevation of 1002.3 feet (1 foot below the dam crest). The weir structure rises about 12 feet above the original streambed surface, with a near vertical downstream face and an upstream slope of about 0.33H:1.0V. A masonry gravity retaining wall extends approximately 200 feet downstream from the dam along the Coleman Canal, with a top width of 2 feet, a near vertical downstream face, and an upstream slope of 0.33H:1.0V from the foundation to about 3.5 feet below the top of the wall, where the face becomes vertical. Diversions to the Coleman Canal are controlled by a series of gate structures located downstream of the dam. The Coleman Canal extends nearly 10 miles to the Coleman Forebay and Powerhouse, and consists of 389 feet of rock tunnel sections 11-feet-wide by 9-feet-high; 83 feet of concrete bench flume, replacing a metal flume section; 46,240 feet of excavated channel sections (30,912 feet unlined and 15,328 feet lined) with a bottom width of 15 feet, a top width of 20 feet, and a flow depth of 9 feet; and 4,518 feet of 90-inch-diameter siphon pipe. The dam is not under the jurisdiction of the DWR Division of Safety of Dams, due to its small size (less than 25 feet in height, and less than 50 acre-feet of storage). FERC has classified the Coleman Diversion Dam as a low hazard structure. The diversion dam was inspected by FERC in July 1997, and was found to be in good condition, without signs of significant deterioration or structural distress [5]. The facility was visited by Reclamation personnel on June 26, 1998, at which time about 300 ft3/s was being released over the dam crest and about 300 ft3/s was being diverted to the canal over the upstream weir, which prevented a close inspection of the structures. D. Streamflow Diversion Requirements and Construction Sequence Total streamflow on Battle Creek has been recorded at the Coleman National Fish Hatchery near Cottonwood, California (USGS gauging station No. 11376550) since October 1, 1961. A graphical plot of average daily discharge values from 1961 to 1996 for the 357 mi2 total drainage area is shown on figure 1. Peak flows recorded on Battle Creek since 1961 have occurred during the months of October through May. Minimum total streamflow is shown to be approximately 250 ft3/s for the 35 years of record. Reliable, detailed streamflow data do not currently exist for either North Fork Battle Creek or South Fork Battle Creek. Streamflow gauges currently located on both creeks are used by PG&E to ensure that minimum streamflow requirements are met, and generally do not record higher flows. DWR estimated historic, average daily flows at Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam, having a drainage area of 186 mi2, by multiplying the recorded average daily flows at the Battle Creek stream gauge by the ratio of the drainage areas (186/357, or 52 percent). This was considered reasonable for higher flows, but was not believed to be accurate for lower flows [2]. The same approach was used by Resource Management International (RMI) to determine median monthly flows for each of the three damsites. Two permanent streamflow gauging stations have been proposed for installation downstream of the Coleman and Wildcat Diversion Dams to provide more reliable data for future studies. 7   A square root relationship has been found by Reclamation to be generally more accurate for estimating instantaneous peaks and for short duration volume frequency values (less than 60 days) of ungauged areas [6]. This relationship assumes the ratio of streamflows at two different locations is equal to the ratio of the square root of the drainage areas, rather than the simple ratio of the areas. The square root relationship results in 38 percent higher estimates of streamflow at the Wildcat and Eagle Canyon damsites, and 86 percent higher estimates of streamflow at the Coleman damsite. Median monthly streamflow data recorded at the Coleman National Fish Hatchery for three ""normal"" water years (1985, 1989, and 1993) are averaged and apportioned for each of the damsites, using the square root relationship, in table 2 below. These estimates can be used as an upper bound for determining streamflow diversion requirements under normal conditions. The Battle Creek Working Group has selected 1989 as a typical water year for analysis and modeling purposes [3]. Table 2. - Streamflow Estimates Using Square Root Relationship (Normal Years) - in ft3/s Calendar Months 1985 Streamflow 1989 Streamflow 1993 Streamflow Average of 3 years At Wildcat Dam At Eagle Canyon Dam At Coleman Dam Oct 357 205 134 232 169 167 124 Nov 521 259 204 328 239 237 175 Dec 471 265 237 324 236 234 173 Jan 391 341 701 478 348 345 256 Feb 376 298 640 438 319 316 234 Mar 401 1060 732 731 532 528 391 Apr 517 776 751 681 496 492 364 May 416 479 785 560 407 404 299 Jun 342 381 696 473 344 341 253 Jul 266 270 384 307 223 222 164 Aug 254 229 291 258 188 186 138 Sep 270 245 229 248 180 179 133  The determination of streamflow diversion requirements for dam removals on both the North Fork and South Fork will be based on a combination of the natural streamflow in each drainage area, and on the available diversion capacity upstream of each dam (see Battle Creek Project Schematic, Appendix A-3, and the 1980 Historic American Engineering Record, reference [7]). In order to minimize the streamflow diversion requirements at each damsite during removal activities, thereby minimizing removal costs, a proposed construction sequence and operating plan for removal of all three dams has been developed for this reconnaissance study as follows: 1. Schedule dam removals during historical low flow period for Battle Creek, in July through October, to facilitate construction activities. This will also serve to minimize power generation impacts [2] and potential impacts on spring-run and winter-run salmon. 2. Remove Wildcat Diversion Dam first, with full diversions from North Fork Battle Creek to South Fork Battle Creek of up to 180 ft3/s via the existing Cross8   Country Canal, with a capacity of 110 ft3/s (fed by diversions from the Al Smith, Keswick, and North Battle Creek Feeder Canals), and the existing Eagle Canyon Canal, with a capacity of 70 ft3/s. The upstream North Battle Creek Reservoir, with a total storage capacity of 1,012 acre-feet, and Macumber Reservoir, with a total storage capacity of 860 acre-feet, are kept full through the summer recreation season in accordance with the FERC operating license, and would not be available to provide short-term streamflow reduction. Assume a streamflow diversion requirement of 30 ft3/s for removal of Wildcat Diversion Dam, based on the minimum flow requirement below Eagle Canyon Dam. This assumption is reasonable for normal streamflow conditions in July through October. 3. Next, remove Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam, with full diversions from North Fork Battle Creek to South Fork Battle Creek of up to 110 ft3/s via the CrossCountry Canal. Some additional diversion capacity may be available using the Eagle Canyon Canal and the existing canal wasteway downstream of the dam, to further reduce the streamflow. Assume a streamflow diversion requirement of 70 ft3/s for removal of Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam, based on anticipated flow conditions without diversions to the canal. This assumption is reasonable for normal streamflow conditions in August through October. 4. Complete the direct pipe connection between the Inskip Powerhouse tailrace and the Coleman Canal. This would require no diversions from North Fork Battle Creek to the Eagle Canyon Canal, and minimum diversions from South Fork Battle Creek to both the Inskip Canal and the Coleman Canal (through a temporary bypass pipe), during final construction. This work would be scheduled to minimize potential impacts on all required work activities, and would be concurrent to some degree with the removal of Wildcat and Eagle Canyon Diversion Dams. DWR is preparing reconnaissance-level designs and cost estimates for this feature. (A construction schedule for this work is needed to fully assess the potential impacts.) 5. Remove Coleman Diversion Dam last, with no diversions from North Fork Battle Creek, and with full diversions from South Fork Battle Creek to the Inskip Canal of up to 200 ft3/s through the Inskip Powerhouse to the Coleman Canal through the completed direct pipe connection. If necessary (although unlikely), make additional diversions from South Fork Battle Creek into the Coleman Canal at the Inskip Powerhouse tailrace, via the direct pipe connection, requiring the installation of a temporary fish screen at the pipe inlet. Assume a streamflow diversion requirement of 30 ft3/s for removal of Coleman Diversion Dam, based on the minimum downstream flow requirement. This assumption is reasonable for normal streamflow conditions in July through December. Note that under normal streamflow conditions, the entire flow of South Fork Battle Creek could be diverted to the Inskip Canal at Inskip Diversion Dam, with a minimum of 30 ft3/s returning to the stream through the existing Coleman Canal wasteway downstream of Coleman Diversion Dam, allowing a complete unwatering of the Coleman damsite. Although this is not assumed for the current reconnaissance-level estimate, a determination should be made whether unwatering South Fork Battle Creek between Inskip and Coleman Diversion Dams is environmentally feasible. At a minimum, a greatly reduced streamflow may be found to be acceptable, such as the original FERC requirement of 5 ft3/s, to minimize the dam removal cost. 10   E. Proposed Plans for Dam Removal 1. Wildcat Diversion Dam a. Site access and mobilization. - Site access to Wildcat Diversion Dam is provided by traveling approximately 1 mile south of Battle Creek Bottom Road on an unimproved (dirt) road to the plateau (or north rim) above the dam, and by foot along a narrow trail to the right abutment of the dam. The damsite is owned by PG&E, but the access road crosses private property. Necessary approvals for site access would have to be obtained from private landowners. Electric power (110 V) is currently available at the site via an overhead transmission line. It is assumed that a contractor staging area would be established on the right abutment plateau. Construction equipment would probably be transported down to the damsite by helicopter, except for smaller equipment and tools that could be carried down the access trail. Helicopter service may be available from Redding Air Services, Redding, California (phone 530-221-2851) or from Erickson AirCrane Company, Central Point, Oregon (phone 541-664-7615). The use of a helicopter for site mobilization would probably require removal of the power transmission line at the site. Potential alternative methods using a fixed cableway or a large mobile crane would probably be too costly or otherwise infeasible, and were not assumed for the current cost estimates. The reconnaissance estimate is based on the use of a Skycrane to deliver and remove a Cat 311 excavator with hoe-ram (or equivalent) and other equipment (including air compressors) to the site. b. Streamflow diversion. - Using the construction sequence and diversion assumptions outlined in the previous section, a streamflow diversion requirement of 30 ft3/s was adopted for this study. The existing 30-inch-diameter pipe through the right end of the dam could be used to drain the reservoir under these flow conditions to about elevation 1074, or 0.7 feet below the existing dam crest, provided the canal pipeline is first removed from the downstream end of the 30inch pipe. If the existing 24-inch-diameter sluiceway is also used, the reservoir could be drawn down to about elevation 1073.2, or 1.5 feet below the existing dam crest. Sediment accumulations at the intakes may have to be excavated prior to diversion, since the canal intake and sluiceway have not been used since 1995. Excavation of a 3.5-foot-wide portion of the masonry dam at the fish ladder structure, to the original streambed grade, and subsequent breach of the fish ladder walls, would lower the reservoir an additional 4 feet, to about elevation 1069. c. Structure removal. - Features to be removed at Wildcat Diversion Dam would include the masonry dam overflow and nonoverflow sections, the fish ladder structure, the gated sluiceway, and the canal pipeline. The power transmission line may be retained for the new streamflow gauge below the damsite. Retention of the left abutment nonoverflow section and the fish ladder would unnecessarily constrict the natural channel to about 27 feet, or less than one-half the natural channel widths at both the Wildcat and Eagle Canyon damsites. The fish ladder structure may also pose a potential public safety hazard if left intact, with a maximum pool depth of 6.5 feet and with walls up to 8 feet high. Portions of the 11   24-inch-diameter canal pipeline are currently used as an access walkway to the stream, and represent a potential public safety hazard from falls. Future deterioration of the abandoned steel pipeline and support structures, potential floatation of the empty pipe during flood flows, and simple aesthetics, would also warrant their removal. A potential candidate for retention, however, is the canal intake structure on the right abutment of the dam. Already equipped with an access walkway and handrails, the intake structure could provide a safe vantage point for inspection of the site following removal of the dam, or for access to the new streamflow gauge, while minimizing removal costs. Cost estimates for both partial and full dam removal are included in this study. All structures would be fully documented in an Historic American Engineering Record (HAER) for the damsite. Using the available diversion capacity to maintain the reservoir level below the crest of the overflow section would allow demolition activities to begin on the dam crest. Excavation of a notch within the masonry structure using the excavator with hoe-ram and jackhammers would permit further lowering of the reservoir. Location of the notch within the existing fish ladder structure could provide some additional degree of control by limiting the differential head at the notch. Continued demolition of the masonry structure to the original streambed level would be performed by the excavator in the flow, with water depths averaging less than three feet. The cost estimates assume the masonry would readily break up at the mortared joints, and the masonry rubble would be spread out in the downstream channel. The concrete in the fish ladder structure, amounting to about 10 yd3 (with a total weight of about 20 tons) could be flown out in pieces, including any reinforcing steel, using a helicopter and a skip or bucket. Alternative demolition methods using chemical expansion in drilled holes to promote cracking could also be considered. The use of explosives at this site may create unacceptable environmental, safety, and upper slope stability concerns of the rimrock on the canyon walls, and is strongly discouraged. The cost estimate for partial removal assumes excavation of the masonry structure to the face of the intake structure, including removal of the 24-inch-diameter sluice gate, hoist, and pipe. The 36-inch-diameter slide gate, hoist, trashrack, and 15-foot-long section of 30-inch-diameter pipe would be retained, with the slide gate permanently closed and the downstream end of the pipe capped or plugged. Although the access walkway and handrails to the intake structure would be retained, all other miscellaneous metalwork, including CMP standpipes and automated control equipment, would be removed for salvage. The 24-inch-diameter steel pipeline portion of the Wildcat Canal would be cut up and airlifted out in approximate 20-foot sections over much of its 5,530-foot length. Steel pipe supports, standpipes, and catwalk sections along the canal alignment would also be airlifted out. The cost estimate for full removal includes the complete removal of all concrete saddles and footings along the pipeline alignment, and removal of the canal intake structure and all miscellaneous metalwork. Although both cost estimates include backfilling of the canal channel and removal of a county bridge crossing, a downstream landowner (Mr. Crawford) has reportedly expressed an interest in retaining a portion of the shallow canal section 12   and up to 400 or 500 feet of the steel pipeline for his own use, which may result in some reduction of the estimated removal cost. This would require suitable measures to prevent potential adverse impacts, however. d. Site restoration. - The left abutment and channel sections would be removed to streambed grade, with all concrete removed and with the masonry rubble distributed across the downstream channel. The partial dam removal plan would retain the intake structure and ancillary items on the right abutment, as well as the concrete footings for the Wildcat canal pipeline. Sediment management at the site is discussed in Section G. A final site inspection should be performed following the winter and spring runoff to confirm the adequacy of the dam removal work. 2. Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam a. Site access and mobilization. - Site access to Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam is provided by traveling approximately 1 mile north of Manton Road on an unimproved (dirt) road to a plateau (or south rim) above the dam, and by foot about 1/4 mile along a narrow trail to the left abutment of the dam. The damsite and the access road are located on private property. Necessary approvals for site access would have to be obtained from private landowners. Electric power (110 V) is currently available at the site via an overhead transmission line. It is assumed that a contractor staging area would be established on the left abutment plateau. Construction equipment would probably be transported down to the damsite by helicopter, except for smaller equipment and tools that could be carried down along the existing trail. Helicopter service may be available from either Redding Air Services, Redding, California (phone 530-221-2851) or from Erickson Air-Crane Company, Central Point, Oregon (phone 541-664-7615). The use of a helicopter for site mobilization would probably require early removal of the power transmission line at the site. Potential alternative methods using a fixed cableway or a large mobile crane would probably be too costly or otherwise infeasible, and were not assumed for the current cost estimates. The reconnaissance estimate is based on the use of a Skycrane to deliver and remove a Cat 311 excavator with hoe-ram (or equivalent) and other equipment (including air compressors) to the site. b. Streamflow diversion. - Using the construction sequence and diversion assumptions outlined in the previous section, a streamflow diversion requirement of 70 ft3/s was adopted for this study. The existing 4- by 10-foot radial sluice gate through the center portion of the masonry dam would be used to draw the reservoir level down to about elevation 1406.2, which is 6.2 feet below the dam crest (at elevation 1412.4) and 3.4 feet below the weir crest (at elevation 1409.4). Subsequent demolition of the far right end of the dam would further lower the reservoir level to facilitate other dam removal activities. c. Structure removal. - Features to be removed at Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam would include the masonry dam, the masonry weir crest structure, the radial gate structure, the Alaska Steeppass fish ladder, the concrete steppool structure, the metal canal flume structures, the concrete bench flume sections, and the power transmission line. Retention of the existing canal wall and gate winch block was assumed for the partial removal estimate to reduce removal costs and provide a 13   waste disposal area at the site, within the canal channel. The metal canal flume structures and the concrete bench flume sections would be removed for both cost estimates to avoid a potential public safety hazard and to restore the natural appearance of the canyon. The cost estimate for full removal includes the removal of all reinforced concrete footings along the metal flume alignment, and removal of the canal wall and gate winch block at the damsite. All structures would be fully documented in an Historic American Engineering Record (HAER) for the damsite. Using the available diversion capacity to maintain the reservoir level below the crest of the dam and weir crest would allow demolition activities to begin in the dry. Excavation of the right end of the dam using the excavator with hoe-ram and jackhammers would permit further lowering of the reservoir, assuming the flow would erode a channel through the upstream sediments. Continued demolition of both masonry structures to the original streambed level would be performed by the excavator in the flow, with water depths averaging less than three feet. The cost estimates assume the masonry would readily break up at the mortared joints, and the masonry rubble would be spread out in the downstream channel. Waste concrete, including any reinforcing steel, would be airlifted out using a helicopter and a skip or bucket, or for the partial removal estimate, be placed behind the canal wall to the extent possible. The canal section at the damsite has an average width of about 10 feet and a minimum depth of about 5 feet, for a distance of 142 feet from the face of the dam to the upstream portal of tunnel No. 1. The existing canal wasteway gate would be permanently closed, and the gate hoist would be removed, for the partial removal estimate. Alternative demolition methods using chemical expansion in drilled holes to promote cracking could also be considered. The use of explosives at this site may create unacceptable environmental, safety, and upper slope stability concerns of the rimrock on the canyon walls, and is strongly discouraged. A PG&E employee was killed near the damsite several years ago due to falling rock. The cost estimates include removal of the 4- by 10-foot radial gate and winch, and of the 3.5- by 6-foot structural steel slide gate and Limitorque operator at the canal intake. The intake gate superstructure and metal roof, and CMP standpipes, would also be removed from the site. Retention of the existing metal stairway (constructed about 1985) and pipe handrails would provide safe access along the canal wall for inspection of the site following dam removal, and is assumed for the partial removal estimate to reduce costs. All PVC pipes and selected concrete and timber structures used by PG&E in the past to collect and divert spring flows into the canal should be removed to improve the appearance and safety of the existing trail to the damsite. All accessible tunnel portals should be sealed to prevent entry, including both portals for the diversion tunnel at the damsite, the upstream portal of tunnel No. 1, and at least one other tunnel portal. The use of heavy steel security screens would permit future inspections of the tunnel conditions as required. Alternatively, the installation of tunnel supports (if needed) and concrete or masonry plugs at the portals may be considered for permanent closure. Both cost estimates assume the placement of concrete plugs at four tunnel portals. All concrete and forming materials are assumed to be delivered by helicopter. 14   The metal canal flume sections would have to be disassembled and bundled for removal by helicopter. The cost estimates assume all flume sheets and associated hardware would first be stacked in cradles for airlifting; followed by removal of the cross-beams, longitudinal bracing, and girders from alternating 20-foot spans, and bundling them with the adjacent framework sections. The framework sections with bundled pieces would be unbolted from their footings and airlifted out. Spillway sections, feeder pipes, access walkways, stairways, and other miscellaneous metalwork would also be removed. The weight estimates used for this study were provided by PG&E, based on the original construction quantities from 1980 to 1983 for a type #132 flume, with an additional allowance of 30 percent for I-beam footings, stairways, and other features. It is assumed that all metal items would be airlifted to the canyon rim, for possible use by private landowners or sale as scrap. Removal of the reinforced concrete footings (for the full removal estimate) assumes the footings would be demolished in place and airlifted out in a skip to a suitable disposal site. The reinforced ""L-wall"" portions of the concrete bench flumes would be sawcut and flown out in sections, and the gunite lining would be demolished and flown out in a skip. The open width and estimates; purposes, channel portions of the Eagle Canyon Canal, with an 8-foot bottom a 4-foot depth, are assumed to remain intact for the current cost however, some minor modifications may be necessary for public safety to prevent potential injury to people or livestock.  d. Site restoration. - All portions of the masonry dam and upstream weir structures would be removed to the original streambed grade, with the rubble distributed across the downstream channel. Retention of the canal wall at the damsite for waste disposal (under the partial removal plan) would require the placement of gravel and cobbles from the reservoir sediments on top of the waste materials. The existing springs would flow across this backfill to the river channel. Sediment management at the site is discussed in Section G. A final site inspection should be performed following the winter and spring runoff to confirm the adequacy of the dam removal work. 3. Coleman Diversion Dam a. Site access and mobilization. - Site access to Coleman Diversion Dam is provided by traveling approximately 1/4 mile south of Manton Road on a paved road to the right abutment of the dam. The damsite and access road are owned and maintained by PG&E. Electric power (110 V) is currently available at the site. It is assumed that a contractor staging area would be established on the right abutment near the dam. Construction equipment would be transported to the site using the existing roads. b. Streamflow diversion. - Using the construction sequence and diversion assumptions outlined in the previous section, a streamflow diversion requirement of 30 ft3/s was adopted for this study. The existing 14- by 8-foot radial gate near the right end of the dam would be used to drain the reservoir under these flow conditions to about elevation 996.2, which is 7.1 feet below the dam crest (at 15   elevation 1003.3) and 6.1 feet below the weir crest (at elevation 1002.3). Excavation of a notch within the masonry dam to the original streambed grade would further reduce the reservoir level. As noted previously, it may be possible to divert all natural streamflow into the Inskip Canal at Inskip Diversion Dam, and return 30 ft3/s to the South Fork downstream of Coleman Diversion Dam, permitting complete unwatering of the damsite during construction using existing facilities. Alternatively, the construction of a temporary cofferdam and the installation of a fish screen at the Inskip Powerhouse tailrace could permit the diversion of all streamflow from South Fork Battle Creek into the Coleman Canal at the Inskip Powerhouse, to reduce potential environmental impacts associated with unwatering a greater portion of the stream. This should be evaluated further for future dam removal studies. c. Structure removal. - Features to be removed at Coleman Diversion Dam would include the masonry dam overflow section with concrete overlay, the radial sluice gate structure, and the Alaska Steeppass fish ladder on the right abutment. The original fish ladder structure on the left abutment was abandoned in place about 20 years ago with no apparent problems, and is assumed to remain under the partial removal estimate to reduce demolition costs. Removal of the other structures would result in a channel width of about 100 feet, which is adequate. Retention of the Coleman Canal retaining wall and weir crest structure may facilitate construction of the direct pipe connection between the Inskip Powerhouse tailrace and the Coleman Canal. If retained, the stability of the existing wall should be checked for potential fill loads during final design, with a suitable tieback system (or buttress) added if necessary. All structures would be fully documented in an Historic American Engineering Record (HAER) for the damsite. The cost estimates for this study assume that the direct pipe connection, to be designed by DWR, has been constructed prior to removal of the dam, and that the canal intake area has already been backfilled to the adjoining ground surface. This would provide a working area immediately adjacent to the dam for removal activities, and would also provide a streamflow bypass capacity necessary to minimize diversion requirements. Using the available diversion capacity to maintain the reservoir level below the crest of the overflow section would allow demolition activities to begin on the dam crest. Excavation of a notch within the masonry structure to the original streambed grade, using a Cat 311 excavator with hoe-ram (or similar equipment) and jackhammers, would permit further lowering of the reservoir. Continued demolition of the masonry structure to the original streambed grade would be performed in the flow, with water depths averaging less than three feet. An excavator or a large dozer (such as a Caterpillar D-8 or D-9) could be used. The cost estimates assume the concrete overlay and the masonry would readily break up, and the masonry rubble would be spread across the downstream channel. The concrete sidewalls for the radial gate structure, the concrete box for the Alaska Steeppass fish ladder, and other waste concrete would be removed from the site for disposal in a suitable waste area. Alternative demolition methods using conventional drilling and blasting may be attractive at this site, due to the greater 16   height and thickness of the dam section compared to the Wildcat and Eagle Canyon Dams, and considering the accessibility of the site. The cost estimate for partial removal assumes excavation of the masonry structure between the abandoned fish ladder on the left abutment and the canal wall on the right abutment, including removal of the 14- by 8- foot radial gate and hoist, the 2-foot-wide fish ladder gate and hoist, the Alaska Steeppass fish ladder, and the steel footbridge from the right abutment. Other miscellaneous metalwork to be removed includes the pipe handrails and CMP standpipes. The cost estimate for full removal includes removal of the abandoned fish ladder on the left abutment and of the masonry gravity weir structure on the right abutment. Any removal or modification of the existing Coleman Canal retaining wall are assumed to be included in the cost estimates for the direct connection pipe from the Inskip Powerhouse tailrace. d. Site restoration. - The overflow portion of the masonry dam would be removed to the original streambed grade, with the rubble distributed across the downstream channel and the concrete waste removed from the site. The proposed partial removal plan would retain the original fish ladder structure on the left abutment, which has already been modified for abandonment, and the existing masonry gravity weir structure on the right abutment. Backfill behind the weir structure would be shaped and seeded to provide a natural appearance. Sediment management at the site is discussed in Section G, which may require the excavation of a new channel through the upstream sediment. A final site inspection should be performed following the winter and spring runoff to confirm the adequacy of the dam removal and upstream channelization work. F. Waste Disposal 1. Construction Debris Onsite disposal of construction debris should be used to the maximum practicable extent at all three damsites, to reduce costs. The masonry materials are believed to generally consist of rounded cobbles ranging between 6 inches and 2 feet in size, within a cement mortar matrix, and can safely be left within the stream channels, provided they are distributed sufficiently to prevent ponding. Waste concrete and other debris should be buried outside the stream channels, either within adjoining canals (as at Eagle Canyon Dam) or offsite. If a suitable disposal site cannot be found near each damsite, a commercial site, such as Anderson-Cottonwood Disposal (phone 530-221-4784), may be used. This study assumes disposal sites will be located within 1 mile of each damsite. Mechanical items and miscellaneous metalwork removed from the damsites may have some commercial value, and should be salvaged to help offset removal costs, as well as for environmental (recycling) considerations, if practicable. Landowners in the area have reportedly expressed some interest in the 24-inch-diameter pipe from the Wildcat Canal, and the semicircular flume plate sections from the Eagle Canyon Canal. The California Department of Fish and Game has expressed interest in the Alaska Steeppass fish ladders at the dams, for potential use at other sites. The structural steel slide gate and Limitorque operator, and the access stairways, at Eagle 17   Canyon Dam would probably have some resale value, as would the access footbridge at Coleman Dam. PG&E may wish to retain some of the control equipment for use at their other dams. The older gates, hoists, pipe handrails, CMP standpipes, and miscellaneous steel sections may only have scrap value. Short's Scrap Metal (phone 530-243-4780) or other area recycling firms may be willing to purchase these items. Cost estimates for this study do not include any salvage value for any items removed from the dams.  2. Hazardous Waste Hazardous materials anticipated to be encountered as a result of the dam removal work include minor amounts of lead-based paints, oil, and grease. A slight potential for PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) contamination may exist due to the presence of upstream powerplants. Site assessments should be performed to establish all potential environmental hazards existing at each damsite prior to final designs. A visual inspection and regulatory/literature search should first be performed to establish the possible presence of hazardous materials, followed by a more detailed evaluation to confirm the presence and extent of the hazardous materials and to plan appropriate actions for removal [8]. For the purpose of the current study, no hazardous waste is assumed to be present at any of the sites which would significantly impact costs for dam removal. G. Sediment Management 1. General Sediment has almost completely filled the reservoirs impounded by the three diversion dams proposed for removal on North Fork Battle Creek and South Fork Battle Creek. The Sedimentation and River Hydraulics Group (D-8540) was requested to assess the feasibility of allowing the river to naturally erode the sediment deposited behind these dams. Potential problems associated with allowing the river to naturally erode sediments behind a dam include [8]: Temporary increase of turbidity and associated environmental problems. Sediment deposition downstream, causing increased flood stage, localized blockage of facilities along the river, and damaged fish habitat. Movement of sediment wave downstream. Release of contaminated sediment. Using simple hydraulic and sediment transport analysis, this section addresses the likelihood that such problems will occur at this site.  18   2. River Reach Descriptions Wildcat Diversion Dam is located on North Fork Battle Creek, and Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam is located 2.7 miles upstream. Coleman Diversion Dam is located on South Fork Battle Creek. These two rivers join to form Battle Creek about 2.5 miles downstream of Coleman Dam and about 2.4 miles downstream of Wildcat Dam. Battle Creek continues for about 15 miles before entering the Sacramento River below the Coleman National Fish Hatchery. Battle Creek and its tributaries are characterized by steep slopes and deep canyons. The average slopes of various reaches were taken from USGS maps and indicate that the slopes are steepest along North Fork Battle Creek (0.020 to 0.037) and are slightly less steep throughout South Fork Battle Creek and Battle Creek (0.004 to 0.014), as shown in table 3. Photographs and videotape from the damsites indicate that the sediment sizes at Eagle Canyon and Wildcat Dams can be classified between cobbles to very large boulders, while the sediment sizes at Coleman Dam can be classified between gravel and cobbles. No formal sediment sampling or classification has been performed at these sites. The bathymetry (or surface contours) of the streams is largely unknown except that which can be inferred from the photographs. The small reservoirs behind the dams have been mostly filled in with sediment. At the time of construction, the crest of Eagle Canyon Dam was 11 feet above the river bed, while the crest heights at Wildcat and Coleman Dams were 8 feet and 13 feet, respectively. From visual observation, it is estimated that the river beds are now less than three feet below the dam crests, and may be even with the dam crest in some places. These dams, therefore, have almost no effective storage and essentially behave as run-of-the-river dams. Table 3. Slopes of Various Reaches Along Battle Creek and Sacramento River.

Analysis 19   The general procedure used to analyze the option of allowing the river to naturally erode the sediments deposited behind each dam is as follows: Estimate hydraulic conditions along the river reaches. Estimate sediment volume trapped behind dams. Estimate maximum size of sediment trapped. Estimate minimum size of sediment trapped. Determine the relative potential for sediment problems. a. Estimate hydraulic conditions along the river reaches. - To obtain an estimate of the sediment transport characteristics at each dam, it is first necessary to estimate the hydraulic conditions at the site. A high flow and a low flow condition was considered to get an estimate of the bounds of sediment that could be found at each dam. The high flow condition gives an estimate of the maximum size of sediment that could be transported by the rivers and therefore the maximum size of sediment that could be found behind the dams. The low flow condition gives an estimate of the minimum size that could be deposited behind the dams. Even though this smaller sediment could subsequently be washed out from behind the dams, it could also be deposited in sheltered areas, such as between larger sediment, so that it remains fixed behind the dams. The flow chosen to represent the high flow condition for each river reach corresponds to the average annual peak flow. The low flow condition corresponds to the minimum average monthly flow, which happens to occur in October. For all flows, river widths were assumed to be equal to the dam crest lengths. This was done to give a lower bound on the sediment diameters that would be deposited behind the dams. Given a particular flow rate and channel slope, a more narrow channel will generally have the ability to transport larger sediment than a wider one. Manning roughness coefficients were taken to be 0.050 for South Fork Battle Creek and 0.030 for North Fork Battle Creek and for Battle Creek. Table 4 gives the values used to compute the hydraulic conditions. The shear velocity is an important indication of the river's ability to transport sediment. Table 4.

Estimate sediment volume trapped behind dams. - Because no detailed data of the bed topography were available, a simple geometric analysis was performed. It is assumed that sediment has filled the dams to within two feet of the dam crest. The volume of sediment was then calculated assuming the filled sediment in the shape of a wedge behind the dam, as shown in figure 2 below.  Figure 2. Calculation of sediment volume. S = original bed slope. c. Estimate maximum size of sediment trapped. - The maximum size of sediment transported is based on the incipient motion criteria of Shields. The Shields parameter, , is defined as:  (  s - 1)gd  p  where u* is the shear velocity, s is the specific gravity of the sediment, g is the acceleration of gravity, and dp is the particle diameter. For fully turbulent flow over large sediment, it is commonly assumed that if   0.06, then motion of the sediment will occur [9]. Using this criteria, it is possible to solve for the maximum particle diameter that moves given a particular value of the shear velocity. It is assumed that the maximum particle size found behind the dam is equal to the particle diameter that is just moved by the high flow under consideration. d. Estimate minimum size of sediment trapped. - The minimum size of sediment trapped behind the dams is based on the assumption that deposition of the finest material occurs during the low flow period. Deposition is assumed to occur if wfall/u* 1.0, where wfall is the fall velocity of a particle. This can be related to a particle diameter to obtain the minimum particle size expected behind the dams. A summary of the results from items b-d above for each dam is At Coleman Dam, the minimum sediment size expected behind (classified as a very coarse sand) and the maximum diameter of approximately 4 inches. At Eagle Canyon Dam, the maximum sediment sizes are 1.8 feet and 6 mm, respectively. At Wildcat 21  found in table 5. the dam is 1 mm material is and minimum Dam, they are 1.4   feet and 5 mm, respectively. It is difficult to ascertain the percentages of the various size classes behind the dams because of the limited data. The total amount of sediment trapped behind the three dams is estimated to be approximately 69,000 yd3. Coleman Dam accounts for nearly 80 percent of this volume. Table 5. Sediment Volumes and Sizes Expected Behind Battle Creek Dams. Dam Eagle Canyon W ildcat Coleman River N. Fork Battle N. Fork Battle S. Fork Battle Sediment 3 Vol. (yd ) 9600 4900 54000 Max Size Min Size dp (ft) dp (mm) 1.8 1.4 0.34 6 5 1  e. Determine the relative potential for sediment problems. - Because there are no significant quantities of silts or fine sands expected to be present within the sediment, there should not be a large increase in turbidity of the water or any problems associated with the transport and deposition of fine material during natural erosion. In addition, the sediments should not present any contamination problems, since the streams pass through relatively undisturbed and uninhabited land. Sediment deposition is a potential concern downstream of Coleman Dam. The sediment behind Coleman Dam has the greatest potential to cause downstream problems because it has by far the largest volume and is relatively more fine than that found behind the other two dams. It is expected that most of the sediment behind Coleman Dam will eventually be transported downstream. There should not be any build up of a particular size class anywhere within Battle Creek because the sediment transport characteristics from Coleman Dam to the confluence with the Sacramento River do not change significantly. This is shown in table 4 by the relatively constant value of the shear velocity throughout the length of Battle Creek. If the shear velocity was to decrease significantly along the reach, one would expect deposition there. Based on experience with gravel bed streams, it is likely that the sediment behind the dam will quickly come to equilibrium with the stream after an initial slug of sediment is transported downstream [10]. This initial slug of sediment, if it remains as a coherent wave, would have the potential of causing problems downstream. Whether it remains as a slug or dissipates and distributes itself over the downstream reach is likely a function of particle sizes. It would be expected that, if there is a large range of particle sizes and no one size class dominates, the sediment wave will quickly dissipate. This is because each size class will move at its own rate. The possibility remains that a channel may form naturally at the Coleman damsite in a relatively short period of time, and that the initial slug of sediment will not remain as a coherent wave but rather quickly distribute itself along the downstream reach. If the entire volume of sediment trapped behind Coleman Dam was to become distributed evenly over the bed of Battle Creek for a distance of 13 miles to the Coleman National Fish Hatchery, it would increase the 22   streambed level by only a few inches. If a coherent sediment wave was allowed to occur, however, some damage may result at the existing county bridge located about -mile downstream from Coleman Diversion Dam. Sediment deposition at the bridge could raise the local river stage by 3 to 5 feet. To prevent the possibility of a slug of sediment moving downstream, it is suggested that before Coleman Dam is removed a channel be excavated upstream through the sediment. Mechanical channelization can help the stream return to its pre-dam condition more quickly and with less adverse environmental consequences than through natural erosion alone [11]. Creating such a channel within the deposited sediment would also benefit fish passage. Without such a channel, there could be a barrier to fish passage after the dam is removed. The excavated channel should extend about 500 feet upstream from the damsite, ranging in depth from 10 feet at the dam to daylight at the upstream end, for a channel bed slope of 0.02. The bottom width should be at least 30 feet, and the side slopes should be about 2.0H:1.0V, or equal to the angle of repose of the sediments. Much of the sediment can be distributed along the banks of the channel. For cost estimating purposes, an estimated 5,000 yd3 is assumed to be removed from the channel and hauled to a land disposal site within 1 mile. The excavated channel would be intended only to help start the erosion process, and would not be considered a stable channel. The river would be expected to further alter the channel geometry to suit itself. 4. Conclusions Erosion of the sediment behind the dams by natural river flows should produce satisfactory results. Significant quantities of fine materials are not present behind the dams and therefore the adverse environmental problems associated with such sediments will not occur. In addition, no problems with deposition downstream of the dam should exist since the hydraulic conditions do not change significantly and the volume of sediment trapped behind these dams is relatively small. It is recommended, however, that a channel through the sediment behind Coleman Dam be created artificially, by mechanical methods, if not quickly established naturally. This will provide easier fish passage and prevent the possibility of the formation of a sediment wave which could affect a county bridge downstream. H. Other Environmental Considerations Preliminary information on other potential environmental considerations associated with dam removal is provided below. Additional information on these topics will be developed by others in order to fully meet applicable federal, state, and local regulations. 1. Noise Abatement Noise would be produced by various dam removal activities including the operation of heavy construction equipment, including an excavator with hoe-ram and possibly a dozer; hauling equipment, including trucks and helicopters; drills and jackhammers; air compressors; and possibly occasional controlled blasting at the Coleman damsite. Noise levels may produce short-term, minor adverse impacts close to the damsites, and along the helicopter flight paths, but should not 23   be noticeable beyond about 1 mile. Natural attenuation of noise levels would be provided by trees and the existing terrain. No special noise abatement procedures should be necessary. 2. Air Quality Construction activities during dam removal would send minor amounts of trafficrelated pollutants and some particulates into the air in the immediate areas. Construction-related sources of particulates would include the use of unimproved haul roads, loading and dumping, hoe-ramming, and possibly blasting. Dust generated by construction traffic, and possibly by helicopter operations, may require some mitigation by occasionally spraying water for dust abatement. 3. Water Quality The dam removal process would be expected to increase stream turbidity levels to some degree for short periods of time due to any operations within the channels. Potential adverse impacts are expected to be minor. Significant quantities of finegrained (silt or clay) materials are not expected to be encountered in either the downstream channels or the upstream reservoirs, due to the relatively high flow velocities in the streams, and the relatively short detention times in the small reservoirs. Some investigations will be required to confirm this assessment for final design. No significant long-term impacts to water quality (such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, or turbidity) or flood control are expected, due to the very small storage capacity of the reservoirs. The total surface area of all three reservoirs is less than two acres. Necessary permit applications would be made to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for a Section 404 permit (dredge and fill), and to the California state certifying agency for a Section 401 (water quality) certificate for each construction site. Suitable precautions will be taken to prevent any hazardous material spills (diesel fuel, oil, gasoline) from construction equipment working in the stream channels. The cost estimates prepared for this study include no special mitigation for any potential water quality concerns. Construction is primarily assumed to occur during a time of year for which minimum impacts to anadromous fish would be expected (July and August), although some construction activities may be required through the late summer and fall. 4. Public Health and Safety Applicable construction safety standards will be enforced during all dam removal activities. Any structures remaining at the sites will be modified as required to ensure public safety, and appropriate warning signs will be posted. It is expected that the Coleman damsite will remain inaccessible to the public, due to its location on PG&E property. The Eagle Canyon damsite is located on private property, and the Wildcat damsite may be sold by PG&E to private interests if it becomes no longer necessary for the operation and maintenance of hydropower facilities. 5. Traffic Local construction traffic is expected to be minor, and generally limited to Manton Road, Battle Creek Bottom Road, and Wildcat Road. No special traffic 24   control measures should be required. Helicopter flights would probably originate from the local airport located in Redding. 6. Species of Special Concern The valley elderberry longhorn beetle was listed as a threatened species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in August 1980, providing the species with protection under the federal Endangered Species Act. The valley elderberry longhorn beetle completes its entire life cycle within or upon mature elderberry bushes, having at least one stem greater than one inch in diameter at ground level. One such elderberry bush (with four mature stems) is located within the project area at Eagle Canyon Dam, which will require the development and approval of an elderberry avoidance and mitigation plan prior to dam removal [2]. Some state and federally listed plants and other threatened or endangered species may occur in the project areas [2]. Further investigations will be required at all three damsites for final design. 7. Cultural Resources Removal of the diversion dams would mean the loss of historic structures eligible for listing on the national register. Mitigation would be provided by the preparation of an Historic American Engineering Record (HAER) for each damsite. Although cost estimates for full removal have been prepared, portions of each dam could remain to aid in interpretation of the historic sites, in addition to reducing dam removal costs. Potential candidates for retention include the canal intake structure at Wildcat Diversion Dam, the canal wall and gate winch block at Eagle Canyon Dam, and the concrete steppool fish ladder and masonry gravity weir structure at Coleman Diversion Dam. A cultural resources survey was prepared by Robert I. Orlins, DWR Associate State Archaeologist, for the Eagle Canyon damsite in January 1998, consisting of a record search and a field reconnaissance [2]. No historic sites have been recorded in the vicinity of Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam, and no cultural resources were identified during the survey within the project boundaries, other than the dam itself. Further investigations will be required for all three damsites for final design. 8. Socioeconomics Dam removal would result in the loss of hydroelectric power associated with reduced streamflow diversions. Current diversion capacities for hydropower generation are 70 ft3/s from Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam, about 80 ft3/s from Coleman Diversion Dam (without Inskip Powerhouse releases), and a potential for 18 ft3/s from Wildcat Diversion Dam. Cost estimates for foregone hydropower generation are being developed by Resources Management International (RMI). Minor economic impacts may result from dam removal, due to the employment of construction workers performing the demolition work in the short-term, and due to reduced maintenance requirements for PG&E over the long-term. A major 25   socioeconomic benefit would be the long-term restoration of anadromous fish in Battle Creek (the project purpose). I. Project Schedule and Estimated Costs 1. Development of Construction Logic and Durations A preliminary bar chart indicating principal construction activities, estimated durations, proposed sequence, and associated schedules for partial dam removal is provided in Appendix C. The schedules assume initial work in the stream channel begins on July 1 at Wildcat Dam, and proceeds through August at Eagle Canyon Dam, until completion at Coleman Dam in mid-September. Removal of all features at the dams would increase the estimated durations shown. Pipeline and flume removal activities are assumed to be essentially independent of the dam removal (stream channel) work, with the lone requirement that removal of the Eagle Canyon Canal flume cannot commence until after Wildcat Dam has been removed, due to streamflow diversion requirements. It is assumed that a single helicopter would perform both the Wildcat Canal pipeline and the Eagle Canyon Canal flume removal activities. A larger helicopter, or Skycrane, would be used for equipment mobilization to both canyon sites. Preconstruction activities include the collection of design data, the preparation of final designs and specifications, and issuance of the specifications package for the dam removal project, which is estimated to take approximately 9 months. The bidding process is assumed to take 4 to 6 weeks, at which time the bids would be opened. Concurrent environmental protection and permitting activities may require 2 to 3 months to get agreement and approvals on the action to take, 3 months to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) and receive the expected Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), and between 1 and 3 months to get the necessary 404 and 401 permits required for construction to begin. Administrative activities include an estimated 30 calendar days for contract award and notice to proceed following the bid opening. It is assumed that construction access and demolition plans will be required to be submitted, for approval, by the contractor, which may require 30 calendar days to prepare and 20 calendar days to approve. These activities need to be completed in time to permit site mobilization by about June 24. Dam removal activities at Wildcat Dam would begin with site mobilization and reservoir drawdown to approximately elevation 1073.2, or the lowest level possible, which requires the disconnection of the Wildcat pipeline at the dam, and operation of the canal intake and sluice gates full open to pass streamflow. A Cat 311 excavator, or equivalent, would be delivered to the canyon site using a large helicopter, or Skycrane, to facilitate streamflow diversion and begin demolition of the masonry dam. Demolition of the dam section using a hoe-ram attachment on the excavator, and final spreading of the masonry rubble using a bucket attachment, would require 7 to 10 working days, based on an average production rate of about 1 cubic yard per hour. Demolition of the fish ladder structure, and removal of the waste concrete and mechanical items from the site, would require an additional 3 to 5 working days. This translates to 3 weeks for river channel 26   activities. Demobilization of the heavy equipment would occur around July 23, with an additional duration of from 2 to 5 days for site cleanup. (Removal of the canal intake structure under the full removal plan would add another week to this schedule.) Site mobilization at Eagle Canyon Dam would be concurrent with dam removal activities at Wildcat Dam, but would not be completed until the Cat 311 excavator could be airlifted from the Wildcat site to the Eagle Canyon site, around July 23 (or later, if full removal of Wildcat Dam is required). Reservoir drawdown to approximately elevation 1406.2, or the lowest level possible using the existing radial sluice gate, would expose large portions of the masonry dam and weir crest structure for demolition using the hoe-ram and jackhammers. Excavating a notch through the dam would permit further lowering of the reservoir level for demolition of remaining portions of the structure above the original streambed. Demolition of the dam and weir crest, and placement of the masonry rubble within the canal section and/or river channel at the site, would require about 20 working days, based on an average production rate of about 1 cubic yard per hour. Demolition of the fish ladder structure, and removal of the waste concrete and mechanical items from the site, would require an additional 3 to 5 working days. This translates to about one month for river channel activities. Demobilization of the heavy equipment would occur around August 23, with an additional duration of from 2 to 5 days for site cleanup. (Removal of the canal wall and gate winch block under the full removal plan would add another 2 weeks to this schedule.) Removal of 5,530 feet of pipeline from the Wildcat Canal would be accomplished by airlifting out 10- to 20-foot-long sections of pipe, depending upon equipment capacity, with an estimated weight of about 100 pounds per foot of length. Pipe supports spaced on approximate 20-foot-centers, and miscellaneous metalwork, are assumed to increase the total weight by about 30 percent. Concrete footings for pipe supports are assumed to average about 1 cubic yard for each support. For cost estimating purposes, the pipeline is assumed to be removed at a rate of 20 feet per hour, for a total duration of between 6 and 8 weeks. Concrete footing removal, required under the full removal plan, would likely follow right behind the pipeline removal activities and would use the same helicopter to haul out about 2 yd3 (8,000 pounds) of waste concrete every 4 hours, for a total duration of up to 15 weeks. Backfilling of the Wildcat Canal channel sections and removal of the county bridge would be performed concurrently with pipeline removal activities, using conventional earthmoving and paving equipment. Removal of 3,385 feet of metal flume from the Eagle Canyon Canal would be accomplished by airlifting out bundled materials, with two 20-foot spans removed about every 3 hours, for a total duration of between 6 and 8 weeks. The metal flume is assumed to weigh approximately 100 pounds per foot of length, with supports and miscellaneous metalwork assumed to increase the total weight by about 30 percent. Concrete footings for flume supports are assumed to average about 1 cubic yard for each support spaced on 20-foot centers. Concrete footing removal, required under the full removal plan, would likely follow right behind the flume removal activities and would use the same helicopter to haul out about 2 yd3 (8,000 pounds) of waste concrete every 4 hours, for a total duration of up to 12 weeks. It is assumed the flume would be removed after removal of the Wildcat  27   pipeline, which would be more than a month after removal of Wildcat Dam, when the flume would no longer be needed for streamflow diversion purposes. Dam removal activities at Coleman Dam are assumed to occur following completion of the Inskip Powerhouse tailrace direct connection pipe to the Coleman Canal, in order to permit streamflow diversion around the damsite. No construction schedule for the direct connection pipe was available for this study; however, an August 2 date has been assumed for contractor mobilization to the Coleman site for demolition. No diversions are assumed from North Fork Battle Creek. The reservoir would be drawn down to approximate elevation 996.2 (depending upon streamflow) using the existing radial sluice gate, exposing a significant portion of the masonry dam structure. Excavation of a notch through the dam to the original streambed grade would permit further lowering of the reservoir. Due to the good access to the site, larger equipment and a much better production rate for demolition of the masonry dam structure was assumed, or about 4 cubic yards per hour (compared to 1 cubic yard per hour at the canyon sites), using two or more excavators or dozers, for a duration of about 12 working days (or about 3 weeks). Contractor demobilization and site restoration activities are assumed to begin around September 10, with a duration from 2 to 5 days. (Removal of the masonry weir structure and concrete fish ladder under the full removal plan would add another week to this schedule. Full removal of the features at all three dams would add about 4 weeks to the overall schedule, resulting in a completion date of around mid-October.) If all stream channel activities at Coleman Dam are required to be completed by September 1, completion of the tailrace direct connection pipe would have to be planned for no later than mid-July for the partial removal plan, or Coleman Dam would have to be removed the following year. (Full removal of all features would probably delay the removal of Coleman Dam until the following year.) 2. Field Cost Estimates for Dam Removal Field cost estimates prepared for this study are summarized below. Detailed estimate worksheets are provided in Appendix D. a. Wildcat Diversion Dam. - The estimated field cost for removal of all features associated with Wildcat Dam, including a 25 percent allowance for contract contingencies, is $2,100,000. The estimated field cost for partial removal of Wildcat Dam, which would retain the canal intake structure, some mechanical items and miscellaneous metalwork, and concrete footings along the canal pipeline alignment, is $1,150,000. b. Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam. - The estimated field cost for removal of all features associated with Eagle Canyon Dam, including a 25 percent allowance for contract contingencies, is $2,000,000. (This estimate assumes portions of the Eagle Canyon canal channel would be retained for passage of spring flows.)  28   The estimated field cost for partial removal of Eagle Canyon Dam, which would retain the masonry canal wall, gate winch block, some miscellaneous metalwork, and concrete footings along the canal flume alignment, is $1,300,000. c. Coleman Diversion Dam. - The estimated field cost for removal of all features associated with Coleman Diversion Dam, including a 25 percent allowance for contract contingencies, is $650,000. (This estimate retains all canal features except for the intake weir structure, and includes excavation of an upstream channel through the existing sediments.) The estimated field cost for partial removal of Coleman Diversion Dam, which would retain the existing concrete steppool fish ladder on the left abutment, and the masonry intake weir structure on the right abutment, is $600,000. Costs for removal or modification of the existing masonry canal wall should be included in cost estimates for the Inskip Powerhouse tailrace direct connection pipe. 3. Design and Construction Management Costs For the reconnaissance-level estimates and for comparison purposes, non-contract costs are assumed to represent an additional allowance of 20 percent for engineering designs, 15 percent for construction management, 5 percent for contract administration, and 3 percent for environmental mitigation, or a total of 43 percent of the estimated total field cost (including contingencies). Total estimated costs for each dam are summarized in table 6 for full removal, and in table 7 for partial removal. Real estate costs are not included in these estimates.

Conclusions Removal of Wildcat, Eagle Canyon, and Coleman Diversion Dams is technically feasible, and would require durations between 4 and 6 months to accomplish in the field, for a total project cost between $4,360,000 and $6,830,000 (including contingencies and noncontract costs), depending upon the final removal requirements for the concrete footings along the canal pipeline and flume alignments for Wildcat and Eagle Canyon Dams, and the retention of any other features at the dams. Preliminary construction schedules for partial dam removal, and reconnaissance-level field cost estimates for both full and partial dam removal, are provided in Appendix C and Appendix D, respectively. Construction schedules for full dam removal may require a second construction season. Dam removal would provide unobstructed passage in both North Fork and South Fork Battle Creek for anadromous fish, without the need for special fish passage structures at each damsite. Minimal adverse environmental impacts would be expected. The masonry structures would be demolished in place, with the rubble spread across the downstream channel, or removed if necessary to prevent ponding. All associated waste concrete, reinforcing steel, mechanical items, and miscellaneous metalwork would be removed from the sites, including 3,385 lin ft of metal flume and 5,530 lin ft of steel pipeline. The reservoir sediments would be removed by natural stream erosion and by mechanical removal (at Coleman Dam), with associated turbidity expected to be within acceptable limits. Some mechanical removal of reservoir sediments may be required at all three sites to facilitate streamflow diversion and/or for removal of the dam structures to the original streambed elevations. Selected structural features could be retained at each damsite to permit interpretation of the historic sites, and to minimize dam removal costs. Conceptual photographs of each damsite, reflecting the anticipated appearance following partial dam removal, are provided in Appendix E. K. Additional Investigations for Future Studies The following items should be completed for any future dam removal studies for the project: 1. Prepare site topography for Wildcat and Coleman damsites (by DWR). 2. Develop detailed drawings of existing facilities, for use in estimating quantities and for inclusion in the HAER needed to document each damsite. Provide pertinent construction drawings, correspondence, and photographs, if available. 30   3. Evaluate existing masonry canal walls at the Eagle Canyon and Coleman damsites, if they are to be retained, for stability under proposed backfill loads, using the structural dimensions from item 2. Evaluate potential tieback or buttress systems as required. 4. Identify and perform additional studies related to cultural resources, species of special concern, and all other issues pertaining to compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). 5. Evaluate proposed design and construction schedule for the direct connection between the Inskip Powerhouse tailrace and the Coleman Canal. 6. Obtain streamflow data from new gauges below the Wildcat and Coleman damsites, when available, and compare with data at the existing downstream Battle Creek gauging station. 7. Determine the minimum acceptable flowrate for South Fork Battle Creek at the Coleman damsite during August and September, to facilitate removal activities. 8. Determine final limits of structure removal at all sites (features to be removed and features to be retained), based on economic, public safety, and other considerations. 9. Obtain channel cross-sections and gradations for further sediment analysis. References [1] [2] ""Battle Creek: A Time for Action,"" February 27, 1998.

Bottom substrate and available cover consist of greater than 50% cobble, gravel, submerged logs, and overhanging brush. The banks are lined with post and logs from logging operations of the past. In-stream gravel, logs, cobble, and boulders are somewhat covered with silt and sand, but generally less than 30%. All types of habitat (pools, runs, and riffles) are well represented with none greater than 50%. Streamflow is year around with substantial groundwater inputs. The stream bottom is mostly hard with some areas of soft sand and silt, especially in the pools. The reach consists of mostly riffles, runs and shallow pools, but a large, deep pool exists in the downstream section. The stream banks are moderately stable with some erosion potential in extreme floods. The stream banks are well vegetated with shrubs and trees. Logs and boulders are present along the banks.              REACH            B: Dam remnant impoundment area     Reach B underwent dramatic habitat changes after the dam foundation was removed. The habitat score in the impoundment went from fair (69) before removal to good (106) after the dam remnant was removed and rated excellent (112) one year later.  Stream substrate in the reach went from predominantly sand to a diverse mixture of gravel, cobble, boulders, and logs. Cobbles, boulders, gravel, and logs that had been buried by sand were exposed to greater than 50%. The reach went from an impoundment to a series of riffles, runs, and pools of various depths and velocities. The reach went from a soft sand/silt bottom to a hard bottom with only soft bottoms present in the deeper pools. The stream Banks became fairly exposed after dam remnant removal, but quickly grassed over and stability should improve as shrubs and trees begin to fill in.              REACH            C: Reach downstream of dam remnant, located in Hemlock Park     Reach C underwent slight habitat degradation after the dam remnant was removed, but habitat scores remain good. Habitat scored good (88) before removal; good (84) after the dam remnant was removed; and rated good (79) one year later.  The most noticeable habitat change after the dam remnant removal was an increase in siltation and embeddedness. Gravel, cobbles, boulders, and logs that use to be only 25% covered with sand and silt became up to 70% embedded. Some of the deeper pools were filled in with sand. The reach still has a good mix of riffles, runs, and pools. Stream banks are sloped and moderately unstable. Bank vegetation is predominantly grasses.             REACH            D: Reach downstream of Hemlock Park, located at USGS gaging station     Reach D underwent slight habitat degradation after the dam remnant was removed, but habitat scores remain good to excellent. Habitat scored excellent (108) before removal; excellent (107) after the dam remnant was removed; and rated good (102) one year later.   The most noticeable habitat change after the dam remnant removal was a slight increase in siltation and embeddedness. Reach D is a high gradient stretch of river with increased velocities. Gravel, cobbles, boulders, and logs that use to be 25% covered with sand and silt may now be up to 50% embedded, however, in most places velocities of 3-4 feet per second are capable of transporting suspended sediments down stream. The reach has an excellent mix of riffles, runs, and shallow pools. The banks are moderately stable and well vegetated with trees.             REACH            E: Reach downstream of USGS gaging station, located in High Banks Park    Reach E is in backwater from Rogers Pond dam. Stream habitat was substantially altered in 1966 by the transport and deposition of an unknown volume of sediment when the upper 13 feet of the dam was removed. Removal of the lower dam remnant continued to move sediment into this reach. The habitat score in the reach rated fair (68) before removal; fair (68) after the dam foundation was removed; and rated fair (54) one year later.  The most noticeable habitat change after the dam remnant removal was a substantial increase in siltation and embeddedness. Cobbles, boulders, and logs that use to be only 70% covered with sand and silt became up to 90-100% embedded. Some of the deeper pools were completely filled in with sand. The reach that use to have some riffles and pools, basically became one long run. The stream banks are sloped and moderately unstable. Bank vegetation is predominantly grasses.

Search ALL of USGS   Feedback                                   Assessment Study    To document the effects of the dam removal project, the USGS study is using a multi-discipline approach that includes the collection of water-quality and sediment samples, monitoring of streamflow and physical properties, measurements of river profiles, and habitat assessments of selected river reaches. The study began in December 1999 with the establishment of a streamflow gaging station and will continue through September 2002.              The  study reach  extends from  Whites            Bridge  in White Pine Trail State Park downstream to where the Muskegon            River intersects the dividing line between sections 23 and 24 of Big            Rapids Township (T15N R10W). This section dividing line coincides with            the upstream limit of Rogers Dam Pond as designated by the Federal Energy            Regulatory Commission. The  streamflow gaging station             is located at the Big Rapids sewage treatment plant. Data from this            station is used to calculate sediment loads. Also located at the station            are a continuous water-quality monitor and two automatic suspended-sediment            samplers. The continuous water-quality monitor records hourly readings            of water temperature, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygen concentrations.            One automatic suspended-sediment  sampler  collects            a daily sample, whereas the other sampler is set to trigger during storm            events to collect additional samples.             Water-quality,  suspended-sediment , and  bed-load            samples  are collected from Whites Bridge and the M-20 Bridge above            the sewage treatment plant. The Whites Bridge samples are used to establish            a water-quality base line and to estimate the sediment load entering            the study reach. The M-20 bridge samples are used to assess changes            in water-quality and sediment load within the reach containing the dam            remnant. The M-20 sediment samples are also used to calibrate the continuous            suspended-sediment monitors.             Thirty-nine river transect stations have been established within the            study reach to track changes in stream bottom and gradient. Data from            these stations will also be used to calibrate and verify the model,            which is a one-dimensional mixed-size sediment transport model (Bennett,            2001).  Seventeen of the transect stations            are located within the five habitat assessment reaches.  Habitat            assessments consist of both the habitat assessment portion of the MDNR            Great Lakes and Environmental Assessment Section (GLEAS 51) (Michigan            Department of Natural Resources, 1991) and the USGS National Water Quality            Assessment (NAWQA) transect procedure (modified) (Meador, 1993).              Preliminary Results            From an analysis of the  water-quality samples             collected at White's Bridge and the M-20 Bridge prior to the dam remnant            removal, the dam remnant appeared to have no discernable effect upon            water-quality in the river. The reservoir behind the dam remnant was            run-of-the-river with a small storage capacity and short residence time.                        Preliminary examination of the habitat assessments finds that  Reach            B  upstream of the dam remnant has had a dramatic improvement in            habitat quality since the dam remnant removal, whereas downstream  Reaches            C ,  D , and  E             have shown slight habitat degradation.  Reach            B  habitat score improved from a fair rating of 69 to an excellent            rating of 112. The score for  Reach C  remained            in the good range but dropped from 88 to 79; the score for  Reach            D  dropped from an excellent rating of 108 to a good rating of 102;            and the score for  Reach E  dropped from a            fair rating of 68 to a fair rating of 54.             River bottom transects were made prior to the dam remnant removal            (prior), a few months after the removal (short-term), and one year later            (one-year). This last set was made after the removal of the rock cofferdam.            Two areas upstream of the dam remnant show erosion of sediments. The            upstream area near  transect 8  shows the            annual deposition and erosion of sediments near the upstream end of            the backwater from the dam remnant and that some erosion has occurred            in this area since the dam remnant was removed. Immediately downstream            at  transect 9 , no erosional effects have            been observed. The area upstream of the dam remnant has undergone significant            removal of sediment. Some of this sediment was dredged during the dam            remnant removal, the remainder was remobilized to be captured by the            sediment traps or to be transported down river.  Transect            14  demonstrates this removal of sediment.             Downstream of the dam remnant, aggradation or sediment deposition            varies with the reach.  Transect 19  is the            first transect downstream of the cofferdam. When the prior and short-term            profiles are compared, there is little difference in river bottom levels.            The one-year profile, however, shows substantial aggradation in the            deep channel. Downstream at  transect 28 ,            there is little evidence of deposition from the profiles. This transect            is the downstream end of habitat assessment  reach            D  and, as noted in the habitat assessment, it is a high gradient            reach with increased velocities.  Transect 36             is the middle transect of habitat assessment  reach            E . The one-year profile show aggradation over the entire channel            with the deeper sections completely filled in.

GX043-45-9004290	"One hundred ten years ago this month, arguably the worst natural disaster to strike the U.S. occurred. What was it?        Those natural disasters causing the most lost of life in the U.S. occurred earlier this century or late in the last century. Of course, it's not that storms are less severe now than in previous times or that earthquakes are less powerful. Actually, there's some evidence that if global temperatures continue to rise, storms may become more intense. We're just better prepared now than in the past. In general, our warning systems are much more sophisticated, are structures are safer and people are more aware of potential danger and what to do to avoid it. This being said, we're still building homes on fault lines, on beaches and in floodplains.     In other parts of the world where either warning systems are deficient or where the inhabitants simply have nowhere to go to escape, people continue to be buried or swept away by flood waters, tsunamis and tidal surges associated with hurricanes. For example, this past week, hundreds of people drowned when a cyclone (the name for a hurricane in the Indian Ocean) slammed into Pakistan.     Most large countries, if they encompass diverse geographical regions, have to deal with natural phenomena which sometimes prove deadly. Parts of the U.S. are susceptible to tornadoes, earthquakes, avalanches, mudslides, hurricanes, flooding, lightning, fires, heat waves, cold spells, and volcanoes, all of which have taken their share of lives. Our deadliest disasters have resulted from earthquakes, hurricanes and floods. In 1906, the great San Francisco earthquake was responsible for the loss of over 500 lives. A few years earlier (1900), a hurricane in Galveston, Texas, claimed perhaps 6,000 lives! But the number one cause of weather-related deaths in the U.S. is flash flooding. In 1889, a flash flood in Johnstown, Pennsylvania killed at least 2,100 people (Galveston was more than 3 times as big as Johnstown at the turn of the century).     The Johnstown flood happened 110 years ago on May 30 and May 31, 1989. Johnstown was then a manufacturing city of about 30,000 people, located in the Allegheny Mountains of southwestern Pennsylvania. A slow-moving, but not a powerful storm system, approaching from Ohio pulled warm moist air from the south and east towards the storm center and into the mountains. Clouds piled up against the mountain ridges, as if brought in on conveyor belts. The rain started in the afternoon of the 30th. By evening it was raining hard and didn't let up overnight. The next morning the water in the Conemaugh River, which runs through Johnstown, was already almost 20 feet above flood stage and higher than ever had been observed. As much as ten inches of rain was estimated to have fallen in areas around Johnstown and likely more fell at higher elevations. The official rain gauge for Johnstown was washed away in the flood, as was the official recorder.     Probably every year a deluge like this occurs somewhere in the U.S. In 1995, for instance, a slow-moving storm with easterly winds ushered in clouds against the Blue Ridge Mountains in north-central Virginia, pouring-down more than a foot of rain on the east-facing flanks. The resulting floods were devastating. The loss of life was minimized, though, largely because the area hardest hit was sparsely populated.     Even though the rainfall may have been unprecedented in Johnstown in 1889, what was largely responsible for the high death toll was the failure of an dam upstream on the South Fork River. Dams are built primarily to protect people from flood waters as well as for hydropower, but when they fail, vast amounts of water in the reservoirs behind them can be unleashed in a few short minutes. The dam on the South Fork River was built in 1852 to hold water for the Pennsylvania Canal, which was abandoned in the 1870s after the railroad went through.     The reservoir contained a body of water that was about two miles long, and at its widest, about one mile wide - it was about 70 feet deep in the middle. In the late nineteenth century, dams were, for the most part, constructed of earth and rock rather than concrete. The dam on the South Fork River was an earthen dam which stood about 72 feet above the river bed and stretched across the river for approximately 900 feet. This dam was 450 feet higher than the elevation of Johnstown.     In the early 1880s, the height of the dam was lowered two feet so it could be used as a roadway. This proved to be a fatal mistake. The water level by noon on the 31st was beginning to breach the dam, and by mid afternoon, the pressure of the added volume of water being exerted against the face of the earthen material was too great ( see the science question from this past September about flooding and dikes ). Much of the dam soon gave-away or dissolved, and the entire reservoir emptied in a matter of only about 3/4 of an hour! The unsuspecting residents below never had a chance. The wall of water was said to look like a black cloud or bank of smoke, and the sound was described as a terrifying roar. Within minutes Johnstown was destroyed. Every tree, telegraph pole, and locomotive in the path of the surge was either flattened or quickly carried away. Much of the debris, including humans desperately clinging to life on anything they could grasp, ended up jammed about a bridge spanning the Conemaugh River. The volatile mixture of materials in the jam soon caught fire and burned for five days, and sadly, hundreds of people died in the flames before they could be rescued.     As mentioned earlier, these kind of tragedies aren't something that only happened in ""olden times."" Each year, lives are lost in floods. Some areas, because of their geographic setting, are more prone to intense rains and, consequently, to flash flooding than are other areas. Twenty two years ago this July, a thunderstorm opened up over the Conemaugh River valley, and 8.5 to 12 inches of rain cascaded down its hills and ridges, again flooding Johnstown. Flood prevention measures had been taken over the years, and the volume of flow on the Conemaugh River and its tributaries was constantly monitored, nevertheless, more than 75 people were killed in the ensuing flooding.     For more about the Johnstown Flood, see the April 1989 issue of Weatherwise or The American Weather Book by David Ludlum - published by Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston, MA.          BACK  to Science Question of the Week       24 May 1999"

The relatively level site was selected because it has a clay soil of sufficient depth to provide material for dike construction and a low percolation rate.    Several hundred soil borings were made to map the size and thickness of the clay layer. Heavy earth moving equipment performed the necessary cut and fill to create the dikes and islands which form the physical features of the marsh.    A pipeline was installed to carry the reclaimed water which is pumped up hill from the treatment plant to the marsh. Outlets allow for water to be pumped directly into 5 of the 7 ponds. Interpond concrete structures allow water to flow from one pond into another. These structures are equipped with water boards to maintain predetermined water levels in each pond. This flexibility of managing water levels is a key factor in operating the marsh.    The ""V"" shaped nesting islands were designed to retard wave erosion. The points of the islands face the prevailing wind and the back sides provide back water areas for resting waterfowl. The purpose of the islands is to provide nesting sites which are safe from predators such as skunks and coyotes. The perimeter of the area was fenced to keep out domestic livestock.

The benefits of this removal include returning the Kalamazoo River to its pre-dam flow, increasing recreational use and safety on the river, and improving aquatic habitat. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated this reach of the Kalamazoo River as a Federal Superfund site because of the historical discharge of papermill waste containing polychlorinated biphenyls. Much of this waste material remains concentrated in organic sediment and kaolinite clay deposited upstream from the three dam foundations. Sediment containing up to 150 milligrams per kilogram polychlorinated biphenyls could move if dam foundations are removed; therefore, it is necessary to estimate the characteristic and configuration of the sediment before work begins.    Data collected from augered sections and sediment cores show that impoundment sediments were deposited in two distinctly different sedimentary environments. Interbedded lacustrine sediments that overlie the pre-dam channel surface consist of organic-rich silt and clay, fine to medium sand, and some gravel. These materials were deposited in a repetitive, cyclic fashion related to former stream velocities when the impoundment water levels were 5-10 feet higher. Lowering of these water levels and demolition of the superstructures of these dams resulted in erosion of much of these instream lacustrine sediments and subsequent deposition of coarse-grained alluvium in the impounded channel behind the remaining dam foundations.    The composite thicknesses of the lacustrine deposits and overlying alluvium was determined from sediment cores collected from each impoundment. The volume of instream sediment contained in each impoundment is estimated to be about 77,600 cubic yards at the Plainwell impoundment; 268,900 cubic yards at the Otsego impoundment; and 1,192,600 cubic yards at the Trowbridge impoundment. Estimates do not include bank or flood-plain deposits.     INTRODUCTION     A series of hydroelectric dams was constructed from 1899 to 1904 on the Kalamazoo      River between the cities of Plainwell and Allegan, Michigan ( fig.      1 ). Three of these dams (Plainwell, Otsego, and Trowbridge) were decommissioned      as power generators in the mid-1960s. By 1970, ownership had been transferred      from Consumers Power Company to the Michigan Department of the Natural Resources      (MDNR). During this period, water levels behind these dams were lowered, exposing      previously inundated sediments (Camp Dresser & McKee, 1999a, 1999b, 2000).      The superstructures, consisting of powerhouses, gates, upper abutment walls,      and some of the spillway, were removed in 1985-86. Sediment containing polychlorinated      biphenyl (PCB) continued to be transported and deposited downstream from each      dam foundation as new channels cut through the previously impounded areas.      In 2001, Camp Dresser & McKee, Inc., stabilized the remaining spillway abutment      walls and aprons of the Plainwell, Otsego, and Trowbridge dam foundations      (Todd King, Camp Dresser & McKee, oral commun., 2001).       The MDNR is considering the option of removing dam foundations. Removal      of the structures will return part of the Kalamazoo River to run-of-river      flow, will increase recreational uses and safety on the river, and will improve      aquatic habitat in affected river sections. The removal of any dam, however,      may result in some problems. The two most common problems encountered are      the movement of sediment downstream and the upstream migration of invasive      species from the Great Lakes to the headwater areas. Because additional impoundments      downstream of the project area will remain in place, migration of invasive      species should not be a problem; however, movement of sediments is a concern.         Figure 1. Location of the Kalamazoo River watershed and study sites in Michigan.            The USEPA has designated the Kalamazoo River from the city of Kalamazoo to its outlet into Lake Michigan as a Federal Superfund site, owing to contamination with PCBs. According to Camp Dresser & McKee (1999c), the primary industrial activity associated with PCB releases to the Kalamazoo River was the recycling at various area papermills of carbonless copy paper containing PCBs as an ink solvent. Kalamazoo-area papermills that de-inked or re-pulped the PCB-containing carbonless copy paper from 1957 to 1971 incorporated PCBs in their waste discharge. The paper wastes also included kaolinite clays, which concentrate PCBs (as much as 150 milligrams per kilogram PCB in the impoundments; Blasland, Bouck, & Lee, 1994). Much of this waste clay remains impounded behind the three dam foundations. If the dam foundations are removed, transport and deposition of the impounded materials could alter the downstream characteristics of the stream channel and increase PCB exposure potential to stream biota.    In summer 2000, the USGS, in cooperation with MDEQ, studied the volume, character, and size distribution of instream sediments in three of the impoundments on the Kalamazoo River and determined the configuration of the present-day and pre-dam stream channels.    Purpose and scope     This report (1) describes the results of the USGS-MDEQ data-collection effort in the three Kalamazoo River impoundments, (2) relates this information to the depositional history of sediments deposited behind the dams, and (3) provides estimates of the volume of instream sediment upstream of three dam foundations. Maps of sediment location and thickness, as well as tables of lithology and particle-size distribution are provided.

HYDROLOGIC SETTING      The cities of Plainwell, Otsego, and Allegan lie in the Kalamazoo River Valley      in southwestern Michigan ( fig. 1 ). This      river valley was a large glacial meltwater channel, formed in the interlobate      zone between the Michigan and Saginaw glacial-ice lobes during the late Pleistocene      Epoch (Leverett and Taylor, 1915). Broken upland ridges (consisting of poorly      bedded cobbley sand and gravel) formed as the Michigan Ice Lobe retreated      to the west (Monaghan and Larson, 1984). These ridges mark the drainageways      or channels of a much larger river that flowed during this glacial epoch (Deutsch      and others, 1960). As ice blocks melted and outlets lowered, the Kalamazoo      River assumed its modern-day size and course (Martin, 1958).              Presently (2002), the main stem of the Kalamazoo River originates in Calhoun County at the confluence of the North and South Branches and flows northwestward for 123 mi to Lake Michigan near the city of Saugatuck. The river has meandering channels and point bars, and flows through a broad, well-defined floodplain. The Kalamazoo River has a drainage area of more than 2,000 mi 2  with more than 400 mi of tributaries, including Portage Creek, a known source of PCBs (Stratus Consulting, Inc., 2000). A USGS streamflow-gaging station has been operated on the Kalamazoo River at Comstock, Mich. in Kalamazoo County from 1931 to the present. The drainage area at Comstock is 1,010 mi 2 . The mean annual flow for the 69-year period of record is 893 ft 3 /s. A maximum daily mean flow of 6,830 ft 3 /s was recorded on April 8, 1947, and a minimum daily mean flow of 185 ft 3 /s was recorded on August 7, 1934 (Blumer and others, 2000). In general, the Kalamazoo River has a low gradient (less than 5 ft/mi). Where gradients are higher, the river  historically has been impounded for hydroelectrical and other industrial purposes (Blasland, Bouck & Lee, Inc., 1994).     METHODS OF INVESTIGATION    This study was conducted to determine the volume, character, and size distribution of sediments in the three impoundments and to delineate the configuration of the present-day and pre-dam stream channels. Hand augering along transect lines was done to determine sediment thickness. Cores of streambed sediments were collected and sieved to determine grain-size of the material.    Selection of transects and data points      Transect spacing was based on the river width at each of the respective      dam foundations (figs.  2A - 2B - 2C ).      Transect 1 in each impoundment was as close to the dam as safety would allow.      Transects 2, 3, and 4 were spaced upstream at intervals of one river width      apart. Transects 5, 6, and 7 were spaced at intervals of two river widths      apart. Transects 8 and higher were spaced at four river widths apart until      the end of backwater was reached for each impoundment. Backwater behind each      dam foundation extends upstream approximately 4,440 ft at the Plainwell impoundment,      6,670 ft at the Otsego impoundment, and 12,500 ft at the Trowbridge impoundment.      The end of backwater typically was indicated by increased river velocities,      riffles, and debris islands. From 10 to 14 transects were established in each      impoundment. This spacing was chosen in order to provide useful information      for planned development of a one-dimensional open channel mixed-size sediment      transport model (Bennett, 2001).         Reference points were established at each  transect by driving a steel fencepost into the right or left bank, close to the water’s edge. Altitudes of the top of the reference points were surveyed to 0.1 ft by Camp Dresser & McKee in fall 2000. Altitudes of bank height and water surface were measured down from reference points as transects were completed. An outside staff gage at each impoundment was used to account for daily water-surface fluctuations during water-depth measurements.         A 3/16-inch steel cable tagline, painted at 5-ft intervals, was stretched      across the river perpendicular to the channel at each transect. Global Positioning      System (GPS) coordinates were taken at both ends of the tagline. The channel      width was divided into 15 equal sections for the measurement of water depth,      velocity, and sediment thickness (appendix  A ,      tables  A1 - A2 - A3 ).      A GPS coordinate was taken at each measuring point. Water depth and velocity      were measured by standard USGS methods (Rantz and others, 1982) using a boat-cable      measuring device equipped with an A-reel, a 15- or 30-lb weight, and a Price      AA standard current meter.      Collection of data points and sediment cores        Data points (water depth, velocity, and sediment thickness) and a sediment      core were collected across each transect in the three impoundments (figs.       2A - 2B - 2C ).      Thickness of the post-dam sediment was obtained by boring with a 1-ft-long      by 11/2 in.-diameter auger bit with 4-ft extension pipes. The depth of the      post-dam sediment that overlay the pre-dam alluvium (altitude prior to dam      construction) was indicated when the auger no longer could be advanced and      a grinding sound could be heard from contact of the auger bit with cobbles      and stones. Transect core samples generally were collected where impoundment      sediments were thickest by driving a 10-ft length of 11/4 in.-diameter polyvinyl      chloride tube into the sediments until refusal. Changes in sediment texture      and color were observed in the field, and representative samples were collected      from the core where lithology changed. Lithologic descriptions of the cores      are summarized in tables  B1 - B2 - B3       ( appendix B ). A total of 82 samples from 36      cores were collected and sieved at the Michigan State University Soil Science      Laboratory using U.S. Standards Sieves ( appendix      C , tables  C1 - C2 - C3 ).         Estimation of sediment volume          Water depth and bottom of the post-dam sediment were hand contoured to 1-ft      intervals by use of auger-point and sediment-core data. These contours were      used to generate a GIS grid surface, which was compared to field measurements.      This comparison allowed for a root mean squared error of depth to be calculated      for each data point. Areas with error values greater than 1 ft were recontoured      and the grid was regenerated. Once all grid surfaces had error values less      than 1 ft, the thickness of the post-dam sediment was mapped by subtracting      the depth of water grid from the depth of the post-dam sediment grid.

Location of data-collection      points in the Otsego impoundment on the Kalamazoo River, Michigan.       Figure 2C. Location of data-collection      sites in the Trowbridge impoundment on the Kalamazoo River, Michigan             The total estimated volume of the impoundment sediment (in cubic yards) was calculated by taking the sum of the products of the area of each cell multiplied by its thickness. Areas between transects were digitized, and the number of square feet within each area was computed. These measured areas were used in conjunction with sediment thickness per digitized area to compute volume of sediments between transects.  SEDIMENT CHARACTERISTICS WITHIN THE IMPOUNDMENTS     Stratigraphic relations among the sediments within and flanking the channel vary as a function of distance upstream from each dam. The impoundment area for each dam can be divided into two distinctive zones: an upper zone and a lower zone.      Upper zones are areas flooded by the dams when their superstructures were intact and the dams were fully operational at design pool levels (5-10 ft higher than at present). As water levels behind the dams were lowered, previously inundated sediment was exposed. In areas near the dam foundations, lacustrine deposits (as much as 4 ft thick) can be seen along the banks, flood plains, and wetlands. In the upstream reaches of the historical impoundments, lacustrine deposits remain in the flood plain but have been eroded completely in the present-day river channel. At these locations, increased slopes and river velocities have exposed very coarse pre-dam alluvium, which in some places has been overlain by post-superstructure sand and gravel.      Lower zones are areas flooded by the remaining dam foundations and are the focus of this study. Three distinct stratigraphic units can be identified in the lower zone. These units are (1) outwash and alluvial cobble, gravel, and sand, deposited before dam construction, (2) interbedded lacustrine clay, silt, and sand, deposited during routine dam operation, and (3) sand and gravel deposited since the superstructure was dismantled.     Pre-dam outwash and alluvium         As glacial ice retreated from the study area, meltwaters flowed westward through continually lowering outlets. The glacial Kalamazoo River was much larger than the present river, eroding large volumes of sediment as it cut through outwash and lake plains to form the Kalamazoo River Valley. After the end of the Pleistocene epoch, the volume of water discharged through the Kalamazoo River diminished greatly, leaving the river to occupy only a small part of its outwash- and alluvium-filled ancestral river valley (Deutsch and others, 1960). For thousands of years, the Kalamazoo River meandered across the Kalamazoo River Valley, reworking the pre-dam outwash and alluvium. This pre-dam material is identified easily and consists of cobbles, coarse gravel, and lesser amounts of medium to coarse sand.     Dam lacustrine deposits         Construction of the three dams raised water levels approximately 5-10 ft higher than the present dam foundations. Lacustrine material deposited in the impoundments consisted of interbedded, organic-rich silt and clay, fine to medium sand, and some gravel. Coarse-grained layers were deposited cyclically in response to floods. Based on current streambank elevations, the thickness of these dam lacustrine deposits ranged from 0 to 12 ft at the Plainwell impoundment, from 0 to 12 ft at the Otsego impoundment, and from 0 to 16 ft at the Trowbridge impoundment.          After the dam superstructures were removed and water levels lowered, new      channels were cut through the dam lacustrine deposits. Auger data points and      sediment cores collected in the summer of 2000 showed that the thickness of      the eroded, instream lacustrine deposits now ranges from 0 to 9.7 ft at the      Plainwell impoundment ( table 1A ), from 0 to 8.5 ft      at the Otsego impoundment ( table 1B ), and from 0 to      13.1 ft at the Trowbridge impoundment ( table 1C ).      Post-superstructure alluvium        After the channels stabilized, sand and gravel began to aggrade within the      impoundments. These post-superstructure alluvial deposits lie directly over      the remaining post-dam lacustrine deposits. The thickness of the post-superstructure      alluvium ranges from 0 to 1.5 ft at the Plainwell impoundment ( table      1A ), from 1 to 5.5 ft at the Otsego impoundment ( table      1B ), and from 0 to 7.5 ft at the Trowbridge impoundment ( table      1C ).

Altitudes      for each layer were established by mean of stadia level and rod survey (appendix       A , tables  A1 - A2 - A3 ).      Water depths in the impoundments during low flows ranged from 0 to12 ft, average      depths being less than 5 ft (figs.  3A - 3B - 3C ).          As inferred from sediment-thickness data gathered near the dam foundations,      the bottom of the pre-dam river was at altitudes 4-7 ft lower than bottom      of the current impoundment (figs.  4A - 4B - 4C ).      Lower altitudes at the dam foundations would result in slopes of more than      2 percent, so the post-dam Kalamazoo River would be classified as a moderate-gradient      river with riffle-dominated channels and infrequently spaced pools (Rosgen,      1994). Particle sizes of core samples collected in the three impoundments      indicate that the pre-dam river consisted of a cobble-gravel bottom and very      stable cobble- and boulder-lined banks.       The extent and thickness of the sediment deposited behind the dams at higher      water levels (sediment now within the flood plain) were not mapped in this      study; however, while mapping the sediment thickness of the current river      channels, the study team saw distinctive pre-dam channels (figs.  4A - 4B - 4C ).      The maps of depth to pre-dam alluvium indicate that the pre-dam channel meandered      across the current lacustrine flood plain and that these maps could be used      as a starting point for mapping the course of pre-dam river channels.      Sediment thickness and volume in the impoundments      When water levels were lowered and superstructures were removed, dam lacustrine deposits were eroded, transported, and redistributed. New channels were formed, and increased river velocities began to transport and deposit coarser grained sands and gravel into the impoundments. These post-superstructure alluvium deposits are not PCB free because PCBs continue to be released into the channel from erosion of flood-plain deposits, slumping streambanks, and channel-bed scour (Camp Dresser & McKee, 1999c). Field notes from summer of 2000 describe the coarse-grained post-superstructure alluvium as “gray or dirty sands,” indicating that some silt/clay/organic material is present and that traces of PCBs are also likely present.         Post-superstructure alluvium and dam lacustrine deposits in the channel      are both capable of being transported downstream if the dam foundations are      removed (Westjohn, 1997). For this reason, the post-superstructure alluvium      and dam lacustrine deposits are considered as one unit and reported as cubic      yards of instream sediment for each impoundment (figs.  5A - 5B - 5C ).      The total volume of instream sediment in the three impoundments is greater      than (>) 1,500,000 yd 3 , most of the sediment (> 75 percent) being in the Trowbridge      impoundment. The estimated volumes of impoundment sediments and their corresponding      sediment-thickness errors are summarized in  table 2 .          Upstream from the Plainwell dam foundation, the total instream-sediment      volume is estimated to be 77,600 yd 3 . Sediment thickness ranges from 0 to      10.9 ft, and average thickness is 3.0 ft over the 701,000-ft 2  area (tables       3A - 3B - 3C ). Approximately 60 percent      of the sediment is between the dam and transect 6, in the lower one-third      of the impoundment (figs.  2A  and  5A ).          Upstream from the Otsego dam foundation, the total instream-sediment volume      is estimated to be 268,900 yd 3 . Sediment thickness ranges from 0 to 14.0 ft,      and average thickness is 5.7 ft over the 1,400,100-ft 2  area. Approximately      66 percent of the sediment is between transects 4 and 10, in the middle one-third      of the impoundment (figs.  2B  &  5B ).          Upstream from the Trowbridge dam foundation, the total instream-sediment      volume is estimated to be 1,192,600 yd 3 . Sediment thickness ranges from 0      to 16.5 ft, and average thickness is 4.9 ft over the 5,724,900-ft 2  area. Approximately      80 percent of the sediment is between transects 6 and 10, in the middle of      the impoundment (figs.  2C  and  5C ).         Figure 3A.

The superstructures, consisting of powerhouses, gates, upper abutment walls, and some of the spillway, were removed in 1985-86. The MDNR is considering the option of removing the remaining dam foundations. Removal of the structures will return part of the Kalamazoo River to run-of-river flow, increase recreational uses and safety on the river, and improve aquatic habitat in affected river sections. However, the USEPA has designated the Kalamazoo River from the city of Kalamazoo to its outlet into Lake Michigan as a Federal Superfund site, owing to PCB contamination in the sediment. Much of this contaminated sediment remains impounded behind the three dam foundations. If the dam foundations are removed, transport and deposition of the impounded materials could alter the downstream characteristics of the stream channel and increase PCB exposure potential to stream biota.       In summer 2000, the USGS, in cooperation with MDEQ, studied the volume, character, and size distribution of instream sediments in three of the impoundments on the Kalamazoo River and determined the configuration of the present-day and pre-dam stream channels. Sediment cores were collected at 36 sites from three dam impoundments on the Kalamazoo River, near Plainwell, Otsego, and Allegan, Michigan. Sediment-depth profiles and particle-size analysis of core samples formed the principal basis for an interpretation of the sedimentation history and lithology at each dam. Approximately 15 data points along transect lines were used to develop sediment-depth profiles of the pre- and post-dam streambeds.              The pre-dam streambed has been reasonably well defined upstream from each dam foundation. The pre-dam streambed is composed of very coarse outwash and alluvium material, is easily identifiable, and consists of cobbles, coarse gravel, and lesser amounts of medium to coarse sand. All of the sediment-depth data points for this study terminated in this coarse pre-dam outwash and alluvium.    Two distinct types of deposits are present upstream from the dam foundations: (1) lacustrine deposits that accumulated after dams were constructed and before superstructures were removed and (2) alluvial deposits that accumulated on the erosional surface cut into the lacustrine deposits after removal of the dam superstructures.    Dam lacustrine deposits consist of interbedded, organic-rich silt and clay, fine to medium sand, and some gravel. Based on current streambank elevations, the thickness of these post-dam lacustrine deposits ranged from 0 to 12 ft at the Plainwell impoundment, from 0 to 12 ft at the Otsego impoundment, and from 0 to 16 ft at the Trowbridge impoundment.    Post-superstructure alluvium deposits are mostly sand and gravel with traces of silt and clay. This coarse-grained surface is related to increases in gradient and velocity that took place after water levels were lowered and dam superstructures removed. These alluvium deposits lie directly upon remaining instream lacustrine deposits. Thickness of the post-superstructure alluvium ranges from 0 to 1.5 ft at the Plainwell impoundment, from 1 to 5.5 ft at the Otsego impoundment, and from 0 to  7.5 ft at the Trowbridge impoundment.    In the Plainwell impoundment, sediment volume (the combined volumes of post-dam lacustrine deposits and post-superstructure alluvium) is estimated to be 77,600 yd 3 . Sediment thickness ranges from 0 to 10.9 ft, and average thickness is 3.0 ft over an area of 701,000 ft 2 . Approximately 60 percent of the sediment is between the dam foundation and transect 6, in the lower third of the impoundment.    In the Otsego impoundment, sediment volume is estimated to be 268,900 yd 3 . Sediment thickness ranges from 0 to 14.0 ft, and average thickness is 5.7 ft over an area of 1,400,100 ft 2 . Approximately 66 percent of the sediment is between transects 4 and 10, in the middle third of the impoundment.    In the Trowbridge impoundment, sediment volume is estimated to be 1,192,600 yd 3 . Sediment thickness ranges from 0 to 16.5 ft, and average thickness is 4.9 ft over an area of 5,724,900 ft 2 . Approximately 80 percent of the sediment is between transects 6 and 10, in the middle of the impoundment.    Present-day stream gradients in the impoundments are low (less than 2 percent). Sediment-thickness data gathered in the impoundments indicate that pre-dam river-bottom depths near the dam foundations were at altitudes 4-7 ft lower than the present-day river bottom. Removal of dam foundations and corresponding sediment would increase the river slope to more than 2 percent, so the Kalamazoo River would be classified as a moderate-gradient system with riffle-dominated channels and infrequently spaced pools.

GX261-34-4472055	"A masonry gravity weir structure extends upstream from the dam on the right abutment to serve as the intake to the Coleman Canal. The weir structure has a crest width of 4 feet and a crest length of 44 feet, with an approximate crest elevation of 1002.3 feet (1 foot below the dam crest). The weir structure rises about 12 feet above the original streambed surface, with a near vertical downstream face and an upstream slope of about 0.33H:1.0V. A masonry gravity retaining wall extends approximately 200 feet downstream from the dam along the Coleman Canal, with a top width of 2 feet, a near vertical downstream face, and an upstream slope of 0.33H:1.0V from the foundation to about 3.5 feet below the top of the wall, where the face becomes vertical. Diversions to the Coleman Canal are controlled by a series of gate structures located downstream of the dam. The Coleman Canal extends nearly 10 miles to the Coleman Forebay and Powerhouse, and consists of 389 feet of rock tunnel sections 11-feet-wide by 9-feet-high; 83 feet of concrete bench flume, replacing a metal flume section; 46,240 feet of excavated channel sections (30,912 feet unlined and 15,328 feet lined) with a bottom width of 15 feet, a top width of 20 feet, and a flow depth of 9 feet; and 4,518 feet of 90-inch-diameter siphon pipe. The dam is not under the jurisdiction of the DWR Division of Safety of Dams, due to its small size (less than 25 feet in height, and less than 50 acre-feet of storage). FERC has classified the Coleman Diversion Dam as a low hazard structure. The diversion dam was inspected by FERC in July 1997, and was found to be in good condition, without signs of significant deterioration or structural distress [5]. The facility was visited by Reclamation personnel on June 26, 1998, at which time about 300 ft3/s was being released over the dam crest and about 300 ft3/s was being diverted to the canal over the upstream weir, which prevented a close inspection of the structures. D. Streamflow Diversion Requirements and Construction Sequence Total streamflow on Battle Creek has been recorded at the Coleman National Fish Hatchery near Cottonwood, California (USGS gauging station No. 11376550) since October 1, 1961. A graphical plot of average daily discharge values from 1961 to 1996 for the 357 mi2 total drainage area is shown on figure 1. Peak flows recorded on Battle Creek since 1961 have occurred during the months of October through May. Minimum total streamflow is shown to be approximately 250 ft3/s for the 35 years of record. Reliable, detailed streamflow data do not currently exist for either North Fork Battle Creek or South Fork Battle Creek. Streamflow gauges currently located on both creeks are used by PG&E to ensure that minimum streamflow requirements are met, and generally do not record higher flows. DWR estimated historic, average daily flows at Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam, having a drainage area of 186 mi2, by multiplying the recorded average daily flows at the Battle Creek stream gauge by the ratio of the drainage areas (186/357, or 52 percent). This was considered reasonable for higher flows, but was not believed to be accurate for lower flows [2]. The same approach was used by Resource Management International (RMI) to determine median monthly flows for each of the three damsites. Two permanent streamflow gauging stations have been proposed for installation downstream of the Coleman and Wildcat Diversion Dams to provide more reliable data for future studies. 7   A square root relationship has been found by Reclamation to be generally more accurate for estimating instantaneous peaks and for short duration volume frequency values (less than 60 days) of ungauged areas [6]. This relationship assumes the ratio of streamflows at two different locations is equal to the ratio of the square root of the drainage areas, rather than the simple ratio of the areas. The square root relationship results in 38 percent higher estimates of streamflow at the Wildcat and Eagle Canyon damsites, and 86 percent higher estimates of streamflow at the Coleman damsite. Median monthly streamflow data recorded at the Coleman National Fish Hatchery for three ""normal"" water years (1985, 1989, and 1993) are averaged and apportioned for each of the damsites, using the square root relationship, in table 2 below. These estimates can be used as an upper bound for determining streamflow diversion requirements under normal conditions. The Battle Creek Working Group has selected 1989 as a typical water year for analysis and modeling purposes [3]. Table 2. - Streamflow Estimates Using Square Root Relationship (Normal Years) - in ft3/s Calendar Months 1985 Streamflow 1989 Streamflow 1993 Streamflow Average of 3 years At Wildcat Dam At Eagle Canyon Dam At Coleman Dam Oct 357 205 134 232 169 167 124 Nov 521 259 204 328 239 237 175 Dec 471 265 237 324 236 234 173 Jan 391 341 701 478 348 345 256 Feb 376 298 640 438 319 316 234 Mar 401 1060 732 731 532 528 391 Apr 517 776 751 681 496 492 364 May 416 479 785 560 407 404 299 Jun 342 381 696 473 344 341 253 Jul 266 270 384 307 223 222 164 Aug 254 229 291 258 188 186 138 Sep 270 245 229 248 180 179 133  The determination of streamflow diversion requirements for dam removals on both the North Fork and South Fork will be based on a combination of the natural streamflow in each drainage area, and on the available diversion capacity upstream of each dam (see Battle Creek Project Schematic, Appendix A-3, and the 1980 Historic American Engineering Record, reference [7]). In order to minimize the streamflow diversion requirements at each damsite during removal activities, thereby minimizing removal costs, a proposed construction sequence and operating plan for removal of all three dams has been developed for this reconnaissance study as follows: 1. Schedule dam removals during historical low flow period for Battle Creek, in July through October, to facilitate construction activities. This will also serve to minimize power generation impacts [2] and potential impacts on spring-run and winter-run salmon. 2. Remove Wildcat Diversion Dam first, with full diversions from North Fork Battle Creek to South Fork Battle Creek of up to 180 ft3/s via the existing Cross8   Country Canal, with a capacity of 110 ft3/s (fed by diversions from the Al Smith, Keswick, and North Battle Creek Feeder Canals), and the existing Eagle Canyon Canal, with a capacity of 70 ft3/s. The upstream North Battle Creek Reservoir, with a total storage capacity of 1,012 acre-feet, and Macumber Reservoir, with a total storage capacity of 860 acre-feet, are kept full through the summer recreation season in accordance with the FERC operating license, and would not be available to provide short-term streamflow reduction. Assume a streamflow diversion requirement of 30 ft3/s for removal of Wildcat Diversion Dam, based on the minimum flow requirement below Eagle Canyon Dam. This assumption is reasonable for normal streamflow conditions in July through October. 3. Next, remove Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam, with full diversions from North Fork Battle Creek to South Fork Battle Creek of up to 110 ft3/s via the CrossCountry Canal. Some additional diversion capacity may be available using the Eagle Canyon Canal and the existing canal wasteway downstream of the dam, to further reduce the streamflow. Assume a streamflow diversion requirement of 70 ft3/s for removal of Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam, based on anticipated flow conditions without diversions to the canal. This assumption is reasonable for normal streamflow conditions in August through October. 4. Complete the direct pipe connection between the Inskip Powerhouse tailrace and the Coleman Canal. This would require no diversions from North Fork Battle Creek to the Eagle Canyon Canal, and minimum diversions from South Fork Battle Creek to both the Inskip Canal and the Coleman Canal (through a temporary bypass pipe), during final construction. This work would be scheduled to minimize potential impacts on all required work activities, and would be concurrent to some degree with the removal of Wildcat and Eagle Canyon Diversion Dams. DWR is preparing reconnaissance-level designs and cost estimates for this feature. (A construction schedule for this work is needed to fully assess the potential impacts.) 5. Remove Coleman Diversion Dam last, with no diversions from North Fork Battle Creek, and with full diversions from South Fork Battle Creek to the Inskip Canal of up to 200 ft3/s through the Inskip Powerhouse to the Coleman Canal through the completed direct pipe connection. If necessary (although unlikely), make additional diversions from South Fork Battle Creek into the Coleman Canal at the Inskip Powerhouse tailrace, via the direct pipe connection, requiring the installation of a temporary fish screen at the pipe inlet. Assume a streamflow diversion requirement of 30 ft3/s for removal of Coleman Diversion Dam, based on the minimum downstream flow requirement. This assumption is reasonable for normal streamflow conditions in July through December. Note that under normal streamflow conditions, the entire flow of South Fork Battle Creek could be diverted to the Inskip Canal at Inskip Diversion Dam, with a minimum of 30 ft3/s returning to the stream through the existing Coleman Canal wasteway downstream of Coleman Diversion Dam, allowing a complete unwatering of the Coleman damsite. Although this is not assumed for the current reconnaissance-level estimate, a determination should be made whether unwatering South Fork Battle Creek between Inskip and Coleman Diversion Dams is environmentally feasible. At a minimum, a greatly reduced streamflow may be found to be acceptable, such as the original FERC requirement of 5 ft3/s, to minimize the dam removal cost. 10"

In the summer of 2000, the  City          of Big Rapids  removed from the Muskegon River the remnant of a hydroelectric          dam located upstream of the Baldwin St. bridge. In the summer of 2001,          the City removed a rock-pile cofferdam located near the water-supply plant          located downstream of the bridge.                    The removal of outdated and dilapidated dams and other structures            from a river can be beneficial. The City of Big Rapids removed the  dam            remnant  and  rock-pile cofferdam  from            the Muskegon River to improve the riverine environment and to increase            safety for recreational users of the river. The removal of these structures            reconnects the upstream and downstream river habitats and reestablishes            the riffle, pool, and run sequence typical of lower-peninsula rivers            in this reach of the Muskegon River.              Dam removals, however, can also bring about unexpected consequences. Upstream and downstream habitats established during the existence of the dam will be disturbed. Revitalized erosion may attack riverbanks. Erosion of sediments deposited above the dam can remobilize any contaminants that may be contained in those sediments. The additional sediment load may be deposited downstream destroying habitats deemed environmentally and economically desirable.    The MDNR and the USGS, in cooperation with the City of Big Rapids, are determining the effects of the dam remnant and rock-pile cofferdam removal project. The MDNR is assessing the effects of the project on fish and macro invertebrate populations; the USGS is assessing the effects of the project on sediment transport, water quality, and stream habitat. The USGS will include the application of an existing sediment transport model to refine the model's ability to predict the transport and fate of the sediments for future dam removal projects in the upper Midwest similar to this Big Rapids project.

Unused for many years, the structure remains in place as a short dam and an open-lock passage that is used by boaters to bypass the dam when river levels are low. A recent proposal to remove the Granby Dam has raised concerns that removing the dam might decrease water levels within the lock, making navigation through that area difficult, especially during periods of low river flow. This study examines how removing the dam would affect water levels and depths within the lock passage and in the river 's main channel. Removing the Granby Dam from the Congaree River could cause water depths within the lock passage to decrease by as much as 4 feet. This decrease in water depth would result from a combination of lower water-surface elevation and increased sedimentation within the lock area. Removing the dam would impact water depths most significantly during periods of low flow, but even during higher flows the water depth within the lock would be less because of sedimentation. During low flows, most of the river water is diverted through the lock, and at high flows, when most of the river water spills over the dam, a significant amount of water still passes through the lock. Because there is always considerable flow in the narrow lock, water velocities stay high (greater than 4 feet per second), which keeps the lock free of deposited sediment. Without the dam, flow through the lock would be substantially reduced, and water velocities within the lock would seldom exceed 3 feet per second. As a result, the lock would begin to fill with sediment, effectively decreasing the water depth in this channel by as much as 2 feet. Removing the dam would also decrease water depths within the lock by lowering the elevation of the water surface. At the upstream end of the lock passage, water-surface elevations would be reduced 1 to 2 feet during low flows; at the downstream end of the lock, the reduction would be 1 foot or less. During higher flows, the decrease in water-surface elevation would be 0.5 foot or less. The impact of removing the dam was evaluated by comparing conditions in the river (water depths, water velocities, and flow distribution) as they are now, with conditions as they would be if the dam were removed. These conditions were determined by using a combination of surveyed water-surface and riverbed elevation data, flow rate data for the Congaree River, and computer model simulations.  1   PHYSICAL SETTING Granby Dam and Lock The Granby Dam is situated in a relatively narrow part of the Congaree River, approximately 9,200 feet downstream of the Gervais Street bridge and 4,000 feet upstream of the Barney Jordan boat landing located near the end of Rosewood Drive in Richland County (Fig. 1). The steel-andconcrete dam, which has a roughly southwest-northeast orientation, is about 3 feet high and extends for 375 feet from the eastern (Richland County) bank of the river to the upstream end of the concrete ""island"" that defines the lock passage (Fig. 2). The lock, bounded on its sides by two large concrete structures, has a uniform width of 55 feet and is located along the western (Lexington County) bank of the river. The concrete ""island"" that separates the lock from the dam is about 20 feet high, 15 feet wide, and 235 feet long. At the upstream end of this island is a wedge-shaped structure of timber and riprap that extends 110 feet upstream from the concrete island. It is at the tip of this extension that the river flow splits into two sections--the lock channel and the dam area--giving the lock channel an effective length of 345 feet. Congaree River The Congaree River is formed by the confluence of the Saluda and Broad Rivers 3 miles upstream of the Granby Dam, and in this study area the river has a natural slope of about 1 foot per 2,500 feet, or 0.0004 feet per foot. Average annual flow in the river near Columbia is 9,100 cfs (cubic feet per second), and the flow should exceed 3,000 cfs about 90 percent of the time. The lowest daily average flow recorded was 662 cfs in October 1954, during the drought of the 1950's, and the highest peak flow has been estimated at 364,000 cfs during the flood of August 1908. Daily flows in the river can be highly variable, as they are heavily influenced by releases from the Lake Murray Dam on the Saluda River. Flows tend to be highest during the winter and early spring, and lowest during the summer and early fall (Fig. 3). During low flows, the Granby Dam has a significant effect on the Congaree River, but during high flows, the dam's presence is almost negligible. Because the impact the dam has on the river--and, hence, the impact that removing the dam would have--is most significant during low flows, it is helpful to know how often low flows are likely to occur. Figure 4 illustrates the likelihood of various low flows occurring in the Congaree River during any given month.  2   VAIS GER  STREET  USGS GAGE BLOSSOM  STREET  GRANBY DAM AREA  N  BARNEY JORDAN BOAT LANDING 1000 0 1000 2000 FEET  SCALE 1:24000  Figure 1.

FIELD MEASUREMENTS AND ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES Field Surveys Most of the information presented in this report was derived from data collected during field surveys made by personnel of the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. Measurements were made of the dimensions of the lock-and-dam structures, water-surface elevations during different river flow rates, variations in the shape of the riverbed, the ""natural"" gradient of the water surface, and the height of water spilling over the dam during various river flows. Measurement of Water Depth in the Lock Attempts to measure the depth of water within the lock were marginally successful. Initial attempts involved measuring the water depth by lowering a rigid staff or a weighted rope to the bottom of the lock from a boat while holding the boat in a fixed position, but because of the high velocity of the water, these techniques proved unworkable, and only a few soundings were successful. 5  JUL Y AUGUST SEPTEMBER  OCT OBER NO VEMBER DECEMBER  JANU FEBR AR Y UA RY MARCH  MA Y JUNE   12,000 10,000 FLOW (CFS)  50% Exceedence 80% Exceedence  8,000 6,000 4,000 2,000  (a)  0 APRIL JUL AUGUST Y SEPTEMBER OCT NO OBER VEMBER DECEMBER JANU FEBR AR Y UA RY MARCH MA Y JUNE ANNU ANNU AL AL  6,000 5,000 FLOW (CFS)  90% Exceedence 95% Exceedence 99% Exceedence  4,000 3,000 2,000 1,000  (b)  0 APRIL JUL AUGUST Y SEPTEMBER OCT NO OBER VEMBER DECEMBER JANU FEBR AR Y UA RY MARCH MA Y JUNE  Figure 4. Exceedence graphs for the Congaree River near Columbia, showing the degree of likelihood that a certain flow will be exceeded. For example, in March, the flow can be expected to exceed 10,200 cfs 50 percent of the time; the flow can be expected to exceed 6,330 cfs 80 percent of the time; and the flow can be expected to exceed 3,240 cfs 99 percent of the time. In other words, on any given day in March, there is a 1-percent chance of the flow being less than 3,240 cfs. 6   A different technique--using a boat-mounted depth sensor to measure water depths as the boat moved through the lock--produced more results, but with less accuracy. Although the depth sensor provided depths with a precision of 0.1 foot, the results were not nearly that accurate. There were two main problems with this technique: (1) Choppy water within the lock caused the boat to move up and down a foot or more as it passed through the lock; and (2) the inability to accurately relate an instantaneous depth reading to the boat's precise location within the lock. The great variety of depth readings taken during the trial of this technique--values ranged from 3.3 to 9.0 feet-- combined with the imprecise position information limited the analytical usefulness of the depth data. In general, however, the water at the upstream end of the lock appeared to be about 2 feet deeper than at the downstream end. Computer Model In addition to using data from field surveys, a computer model was developed to help analyze such things as how the river 's flow is distributed between the lock and the dam, water velocities within the main river channel and within the lock, the height of water spilling over the dam at various flow rates, and the upstream extent of impoundment for different flow rates. Use of a computer model is also very helpful because, after calibrating the model to the existing river conditions, it is fairly easy to remove the dam from modeled river and see how the system changes. This one-dimensional, steady-flow model was developed from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers HEC-RAS (Hydraulic Engineering Center  River Analysis System) software, and was calibrated with data from the field surveys and river flow data from the USGS gage located near the Gervais Street bridge. The HEC-RAS model represents a simplistic version of the Congaree River near the Granby Dam, rather than an exact recreation of the system. The amount of topographic surveying, in-stream flow measurements, and water-surface elevation measurements required to very accurately calibrate and fine-tune a model of this section of the river is beyond the scope of this project and might be appropriate only if using a more sophisticated two- or three-dimensional model. Simplified as it is, however, the HEC-RAS model is still a useful tool for evaluating the impact that the dam has on local water levels. USGS Gage Data for the Congaree River The United States Geological Survey operates a water-stage recorder 8,200 feet upstream of the Granby Dam, or about 1,000 feet downstream of the Gervais Street bridge (see Fig. 1). This gage (Station 02169500) has been used to measure flows in the Congaree River since October 1939. Between this gage and the Granby Dam, there are no significant tributaries or other sources  7   of inflow into the Congaree, so the flow rates at the dam should be only slightly greater than at the gage. For the purposes of this study, the flow at the dam is assumed to be the same as the flow at the gage, and as such, the flow statistics determined for the Congaree at the gage site are assumed to apply to the Congaree River in the vicinity of the Granby Dam. Note on Water Depths While it would be convenient to relate the effects of the dam to the depth of water in the river, this is not practical because the highly irregular shape of the riverbed results in a wide range of depths for a given flow rate or water-surface elevation. For example, a steady flow with a uniform water-surface elevation that leaves some in-stream boulders and bedrock exposed several feet above the water can result in water depths ranging from 0 to 6 feet within a short horizontal distance because of variations in sediment thickness, the shape of the underlying bedrock, and localized flow patterns. Changes in water depths can be inferred, however, from changes in water-surface elevation. IMPOUNDMENT AND FLOW DIVERSION CAUSED BY THE DAM While the Granby Dam is no longer used to aid navigation up to Columbia, the structure, spanning 85 percent of the river 's width, still acts as a barrier to flow. The dam has two significant effects on the hydraulics of the Congaree River: (1) The impoundment of water, resulting in deeper, slower water upstream of the dam; and (2) the diversion of the river's flow into the relatively narrow but unobstructed lock. Because of the low height of the dam and the open-lock channel, the increase in water depth due to impoundment is limited but not insignificant during low flows when the river is very shallow in places. Increased Water Levels Behind the Dam and in the Lock To understand how the dam affects the river's water levels, it is helpful to view a section of the river along its length (Fig. 5). The ""impacted zone"" is the section of the river that is affected by the presence of the dam. Outside the impacted zone, on both the upstream and downstream sides, the river is in its ""natural"" condition, unaffected by the dam. At low flows, when the dam's effect is greatest, this impacted zone may extend for several thousand feet upstream from the dam, and several hundred feet downstream from the dam.  8   B  B  '  LOCK A  FLOW A'  DAM  (a) A IMPACTED ZONE  A' WATER  SEDIMENT BEDROCK  (b) B IMPACTED ZONE LOCK ""NATURAL"" WATER LEVEL  B' ""NATURAL"" WATER LEVEL  WATER  SEDIMENT BEDROCK  (c) Figure 5. Schematic illustration showing how the Granby Dam influences water levels along sections across the dam (b) and through the lock (c). In both sections, the length of the ""impacted zone"" is identical, and both have the same water-surface elevations upstream of the lock/dam split. 9   Dam area.--The dam blocks the river 's flow, causing water to pool up behind the dam and diverting much of the flow into the lock. By obstructing the flow, the dam, in effect, adds a wedge of water onto the ""natural"" water level upstream of the dam (Fig. 5b). The extra depth is greatest just upstream of the dam, and tapers off toward the upstream end of the impacted zone. The increase in water depth and the length of the impacted zone are functions of the river 's flow rate. While the flow is usually great enough that some water spills over the dam, a considerable amount of water is always diverted into the lock. Only during very low flows (less than about 1,200 cfs) will the water not overtop the dam; in these cases, all the river 's flow is diverted through the lock. Because the dam is fairly low--about 3 feet high--and because of the open-lock channel, the increase in water depth upstream of the dam will not exceed 2.0 feet (Fig. 6). The impounded water 's surface does not slope as much as that of the ""natural"" river; there is little change in the water-surface elevation along the entire impacted zone upstream of the dam. Downstream of the dam, the water-surface elevation also has a very small slope until the divided flows recombine below the lock. Along this profile (Fig. 5b), almost all of the change in watersurface elevation occurs as the water spills over the dam.  2.0 CHANGE IN WATER DEPTH (FEET)  1.5  1.0  0.5  0.0 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 TOTAL FLOW IN RIVER (CFS) 10,000  Figure 6. Graph showing how much the impoundment of water increases water depth just upstream of the Granby Dam. 10   Lock area. --Water enters the lock passage with the same elevation at which it enters the dam area; upstream of the lock/dam split, both profiles have identical water-surface elevations. Inside the lock, the water 's surface elevation decreases rapidly and uniformly over the length of the lock (Fig. 5c). As a result, the water in the lock is deepest at the upstream end of the lock. At the downstream end of the lock, the water-surface elevation is still slightly higher than ""natural."" Downstream of the lock, freed from the confines of the cement walls, the water spreads out, rejoins the main channel, and quickly returns to its ""natural"" level. Diversion of Water Keeps Lock Free of Sediment Water flowing down the Congaree River passes the Granby Dam in one of two ways: it either spills over the dam or it flows through the unobstructed lock. Without the dam to impede the river, only about 10 percent of the river's flow would pass through the lock. With the dam impeding flow through the main channel, however, a significant amount of water is always diverted into the lock (Figs. 7 and 8).

Distribution of total river flow between the lock and the dam, expressed in terms of (a) cubic feet per second, and (b) percentage of the total river flow. 12   dam remains below the top of the dam, so essentially all of the river 's water moves through the lock. At moderately low flows (1,200 to 4,600 cfs), some water spills over the dam, but most of the water still passes through the lock. Above 4,600 cfs, more water spills over the dam than passes through the lock. During high flows, when most of the water passes over the dam, 20 percent or more of the total flow still moves through the lock. The significance of this diversion is not so much the increased volume of the water moving through the lock but it is the increased velocity; the water flowing through the lock always maintains a relatively high velocity compared to the main channel (Fig. 9). Even during low flows, when the average velocity in the main river channel might be as low as 1 foot per second, the water velocity within the lock will exceed 4 feet per second. This fast-moving water has enough energy to keep the lock clean of the sediment that accumulates on the riverbed everywhere outside the lock, and since the flow in the lock is always faster than in the main channel, any sediment that is carried into the lock will be transported out of it. Because the lock channel remains sediment-free, water within the lock tends to be deeper than elsewhere in the river (see Fig. 5c). How much deeper is difficult to quantify, because of the irregular riverbed shape and the variable nature of the sediment thickness, but field measurements suggest that the extra depth is on the order of 2 feet. 7 6 Lock channel Main river channel  WATER VELOCITY (FT/SEC)  5 4 3 2 1 0 0 4,000 8,000 12,000 16,000 TOTAL FLOW IN RIVER (CFS) 20,000  Figure 9. Comparison of typical water velocities in the lock and in the main river channel (away from the dam). 13   The Dam's Impact Above and Below the Lock and Dam Area The Granby Dam influences water levels in the river far upstream of the dam and lock area. The dam's impact is greatest during low flows, both in terms of increased water depth and how far upstream the impoundment extends. For example, during a very low flow of 1,000 cfs, in which the water depth at the dam/lock split would be increased by about 2 feet, some deepening would be noticed as far as 6,000 feet upstream (up to the Blossom Street bridge). For a moderately low flow of 3,000 cfs, the water would be as much as 1 foot deeper behind the dam, and the impoundment would extend upstream for about 4,000 feet. At high flows, such as 10,000 cfs or more, most of the water passes over the dam, and the dam has little practical impact on water levels, depths, and velocities upstream of the dam and lock area. Between the dam and the downstream end of the lock, the flow in the main river channel is reduced by as much as 1,800 cfs because of the diversion through the lock (Fig. 7). Accordingly, this 200-foot section of the river tends to have slower, shallower water than elsewhere in the river. At the downstream end of the lock, the divided flows recombine, and the river quickly returns to its ""natural"" condition. At very low flows, the dam's impact becomes unnoticeable beyond about 500 feet from the end of the lock; at higher flows, the dam's impact extends less than that. IMPACT OF REMOVING THE GRANBY DAM The Granby Dam impacts the Congaree River in two significant ways: It impounds water upstream, and it diverts water from the main river channel into the lock passage. If the dam were removed, both of these impacts would be removed, and the river would return to more natural conditions. Within the lock passage the water would become much slower and shallower, and upstream from the dam the depth of the water would decrease slightly. Downstream of the lock and dam the conditions in the river will be almost unchanged, since the effects of the dam are not noticed much beyond the lock and dam structure. Reduced Water Volume and Velocity in the Lock The lock passage occupies the western edge of the river, covering about 1/7 of the river 's surface width at the point where the flow splits (see Fig. 2). Because water along the edge of the river flows more slowly than in midchannel, and because the river tends to be deeper in midchannel, only about 10 percent of the total river flow would pass through the lock if the dam were removed. With the dam, the lock carries no less than 20 percent of the total river flow. Figure 10 illustrates how removing the dam would decrease flow rates within the lock channel.  14   3,000  FLOW THROUGH LOCK (CFS)  2,500  2,000 Dam in place Dam removed  1,500  1,000  500  0 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 TOTAL FLOW IN RIVER (CFS) 10,000  Figure 10. Predicted flow through the lock with the dam removed, compared to flow through the lock with the dam in place.  Not only would the volume of water passing through the lock decrease if the dam was removed, but the velocity of that water would decrease also. Computer modeling suggests that, without the dam, the water entering into the lock passage would have a velocity approximately half that of the midstream flow. With the dam, lock-channel velocities range from 4 to 6 feet per second; without the dam, lock-channel velocities would rarely exceed 3 feet per second (Fig.11). Increased Sedimentation in the Lock With the dam in place, even during low flows, the water velocity within the lock is high enough to transport sand and pebbles, preventing sediment from accumulating within the lock passage. Elsewhere in the river, sediment covers the riverbed because the water does not usually move with enough energy to carry it. The lack of sediment keeps the water depths within the lock about two feet deeper than elsewhere in the river. Removing the dam would slow the water passing through the lock, allowing for sediment to accumulate within the lock. The extent to which sediment would accumulate within the lock if the dam were removed is difficult to quantify precisely. Surveys made of the riverbed elevation both above and below the  15   7 6 WATER VELOCITY (FT/SEC)  Dam in place Dam removed  5 4 3 2 1 0 0 4,000 8,000 12,000 16,000 TOTAL FLOW IN RIVER (CFS) 20,000  Figure 11. Velocity of water flowing through the lock, both with the dam in place and the dam removed.  dam indicate localized depth variations of several feet owing to variations in sediment thickness, and downstream of the dam, sandbars can be found that decrease the water depth by 2 or 3 feet. Considering the surveyed riverbed elevation data, the measured lock depths, and the observed sandbars, it is reasonable to conclude that sediment accumulation of as much as 2 feet is likely. The sediment thickness will vary with both time and location within the lock, but the general result will be a decrease in water depth on the order of 2 feet. Only during periods of high flow (greater than about 20,000 cfs) would the water move through the lock with sufficient energy to clean out sand-and-gravel deposits. These high flows are infrequent, however, and as soon as the flow decreases and the water slows down, sediment would begin to accumulate again. Lower Water-Surface Elevations in the Lock As described earlier, the water-surface elevation upstream of the dam is higher than ""natural"" owing to impoundment. Without the dam, water would not be impounded, so the water-surface elevation would once again be ""natural"" (Fig. 12). The resulting decrease in water-surface elevation  16   IMPACTED ZONE LOCK ""NATURAL"" WATER LEVEL  ""NATURAL"" WATER LEVEL  WATER  SEDIMENT BEDROCK  (a)  LOCK  ""NATURAL"" WATER LEVEL  WATER  SEDIMENT BEDROCK  (b)  Figure 12. Schematic comparison of water levels and depths along a profile through the lock, with (a) the dam in place, and (b) the dam removed. (Figure 12a is identical to Figure 5c.) Note that the depth of water within the lock is reduced because of both the lowering of the water surface and increased sedimentation within the lock.  17   would be greatest at the upstream end of the lock (as much as 2 feet lower) and least at the downstream end of the lock (less than 1 foot) (Fig. 13). With sediment deposition in the lock, the net effect of removing the dam would be to decrease water depths by 2.5 to 4.0 feet at the upstream end of the lock and by as much as 2.5 feet at the downstream end of the lock. Effect on the River Above and Below the Lock and Dam Area Without the dam, the water-surface elevation of the river upstream of the dam/lock area would return to ""natural"" levels. This means that, during very low flows, water depths would be lower by as much as 2 feet near the dam and lock and as much as 1 foot near the railroad bridges located 2,000 feet upstream of the dam. In this upstream section of the river, there are many boulders and rock outcrops already exposed during low flows; decreasing the water level by 1 foot would result in more rocks being exposed or coming very close to the water surface. Navigation through this section of the river may become more difficult or hazardous when the river is at a very low stage. Removing the dam would have very little impact on the water depths and velocities downstream of the lock channel, because the dam itself does not have much of an effect on that part of the river. Field measurements suggest that the effects of impoundment and diversion through the lock do not extend more than 500 feet downstream from the lock channel, even at very low flows. Since the dam has little effect on this segment of the river, removing the dam would result in little change.  18   CHANGE IN WATER SURFACE ELEVATION (FEET)  0.0  -0.5  -1.0  Downstream end of lock -1.5 Upstream end of lock  -2.0 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 TOTAL FLOW IN RIVER (CFS) 10,000  Figure 13.

GX269-47-14689395	"Fact Sheet Questions and Answers: Proposed 401 Certificate for PGE's Bull Run Hydroelectric Project What is a Section 401 Water Quality Certification? Section 401 of the federal Clean Water Act authorizes state water quality agencies to certify that federal permits or licenses will comply with state water quality standards. Since large hydroelectric projects are licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), a state 401 water quality certification is required for FERC to issue these licenses. The conditions on these certifications then automatically become conditions on the FERC license, which in the case of the Portland General Electric's (PGE) Bull Run Project, will expire November 16, 2017. PGE currently holds a FERC operating license for this facility that expires November 16, 2004. PGE has requested an amendment for that operating license to extend the license through November 16, 2017. PGE proposes to continue operating the project, generating electricity through June of 2008. In the summer of 2007, PGE will begin a three-year effort to dismantle project facilities, and decommission the project. Generation will cease in 2008, facilities will be dismantled and removed by 2009, but PGE will continue monitoring the river channels to ensure fish passage, and restoring affected lands until the FERC license expires in 2017. What effects can hydroelectric projects have on water quality? Impoundments and reductions of flow in the natural streambed cause water to warm Operation of powerhouses and spill from dams can increase total dissolved gases in water to levels that cause problems for fish Impoundments can increase the potential for nuisance algae blooms, and daily pH increases paired with dissolved oxygen increases and decreases that stress aquatic life Project roads and other facilities can increase the risk of erosion and consequent turbidity and sediment increases in project-affected water bodies High rates of change in flows to support power peaking can stress aquatic life and strand fish Diverted flow discharged to alternate streams may confuse migrating fish, delaying spawning. What effects can project decommissioning have on water quality? Remove ongoing water quality impacts that result from project operation Release sediment into downstream habitats, potentially inundating them, and potentially obstructing fish passage in the river Result in high turbidity concentrations with storm events as sediment is moved Release toxic material associated with sediments stored behind dams Is the DEQ sure that water quality standards will be met? The agency relies on a number of sources of information and certainty to reach ""reasonable assurance"" that water quality standards will be met. These sources include: extensive monitoring measurements and other studies on the project included in PGE's application for the 401 certification, water quality modeling, real time future monitoring, and removal strategies that minimize aquatic disturbance. Isn't the Sandy River going to have Total Maximum Daily Loads? The DEQ is scheduled to complete Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for temperature on the Sandy River this fall (2003). The development of this TMDL is accommodated in the 401 certification. The Marmot Dam diversion results in heated water below the dam. Dam removal will alleviate this heating, complying with the future TMDL. How will the project be removed? Four major project structures will be removed; Marmot Dam on the Sandy River, the diversion dam on the Little Sandy River, Roslyn Lake, and the Bull Run Powerhouse. Marmot Dam is the largest in-water structure, with 980,000 cubic yards of sediment stored behind the dam. This large amount of sediment may cause problems as it migrates downstream. Sediment within the existing reservoir reach may shift, and sediment moving downstream may create barriers to migrating fish.

Marmot Dam will be removed during the summer of 2007. A coffer dam will be constructed above and below the existing dam. This coffer dam will withhold up to 2500 cfs of Sandy River water. Normal summer time flow in the Sandy River is on the order of 600 cfs. The coffer dam is designed to withstand a high flow, so that it will breach during a fall rain event. Breaching the coffer dam at 2500 cfs will allow maximum migration of sediment out of the reservoir reach, and will most likely carve a channel through the reservoir reach, minimizing any fish passage barriers. This removal approach, supplemented with fish passage monitoring and maintenance approaches, was deemed the best removal approach for protecting the aquatic resources. The Little Sandy Dam will be removed in the summer following Marmot Dam removal. The two-year schedule will allow the project canals and flume to manage water diverted around Marmot Dam, helping to maximize the initial flow event that will breach the Marmot coffer dam.  Very little flow is present in the Little Sandy River during the summer, so no coffer dam will be required to divert flow at this site while the dam is removed. The small amount of material, stored behind the Little Sandy Dam, estimated between 4600 and 9400 cubic yards, is not expected to result in blockages or swamping fish habitat. In contrast to Marmot Dam removal, the sediment behind the Little Sandy Dam is considered to be a useful supplement for the sediment starved lower Bull Run River. Roslyn Lake is a manmade pond that was constructed as the Project forebay. It has become a popular recreation spot. However, efforts to save the lake have failed. The project water right is contingent upon hydroelectric generation. When power production stops, water will no longer be available to fill the lake. Once Roslyn Lake is drained, no further impact to water quality is likely to occur. This area will be graded and sold. Bull Run Power House is adjacent to the river. Removal of that structure will be completed to minimize aquatic impact.  03-NWR-011"
GX261-96-3509308	"1 ANALYSIS OF SAMPLES COLLECTED AT SPECIAL-STUDY SITES EFFECTS OF REMOVING GOOD HOPE MILL DAM PROJECT Good Hope Mill Dam was removed over a 3-day period beginning November 2, 2001 to eliminate safety concerns, provide for resident and migratory fish passage, and improve habitat for native fish. The deteriorated, obsolete, condition of the dam made removal a more cost effective option to mitigate safety and ecological concerns than rebuilding or retrofitting the structure to meet current safety and environmental regulations. The dam was located on the Conodoguinet Creek at the former Good Hope Mill, approximately 13.5 miles upstream of the confluence of Conodoguinet Creek and the Susquehanna River. It was a run of the river, 6-foot high, 220-foot wide concrete and log crib structure constructed on bedrock over 100 years ago to provide waterpower to the former mill. Drainage area at the dam site is 492 square miles and the mean annual flow is 619 cubic feet per second based on 72 years of daily streamflow recorded at Hogestown gage (USGS station number 01570000). Under normal flow conditions the dam impounded a 1-mile reach and held approximately 52 acre-feet of water, all of which was contained within the channel. The implications of small dam removal on channel characteristics, water quality, macroinvertebrates, and fish are not well understood because of the small number of dam removals that have been studied. Comprehensive studies that document the effects of dam removal are just beginning to be published and most past research has focused on larger dams or on the response of a single variable (such as macroinvertebrates). This limited knowledge base underscores the need for additional study to develop understanding of response to removal in order to better predict the outcome. To address this need the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has partnered with the Conodoguinet Creek Watershed Association (CCWA), The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission (PFBC), and The Pennsylvania State University to study the short-term effects of removing Good Hope Mill Dam on channel characteristics, water quality, macroinvertebrates, and fish. USGS collected data to characterize geomorphologic, water quality, and macroinvertebrate community conditions before, during, and shortly after removal. USGS also sampled bed sediment upstream of the dam prior to removal to address concerns over metals and other potentially harmful constituents sometimes associated with accumulated sediment. The Pennsylvania State University collected fish community data before and after removal. Data presented in this report include bed sediment, water quality, and macroinvertebrate data collected by USGS. Bed sediments behind the dam were minimal. As a result, isolated depositional features with fine sediment were selected for sampling (Figure 10). Coring tubes were inserted into the bed sediment to the point of refusal and composited at each site. Multiple cores were collected at each site to provide enough sediment to analyze for Metals, PCBs, Semi-Volatile Organic Compounds, and Pesticides. Only Metals, PCBs, and Pesticide data are included in this report due to extended holding times at the lab which likely compromised the quality of results for Semi-Volatile Organic Compounds. Water-quality constituents including specific conductance (S/cm), pH, turbidity (NTU), dissolved oxygen (mg/L), and temperature (C) were measured at Stations 01570064, 01570076, and 01570078 on a continuous basis (15-minute intervals). In addition to continuous monitoring, discrete samples for nutrients and suspended sediment were collected at Stations 01570064, 01570076, 01570078, and 01570150. Cross-sectional sampling of field parameters was conducted on various occasions. Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled at 01570064, 01570076, 01570078, and 01570150. Stations 01570064, 01570078, and 01570150 are at freeflowing natural riffles conducive to kick sampling before and after removal. Because Station 01570076 was impounded prior to dam removal, mid-channel locations were inaccessible by wading and there was insufficient sediment to warrant capture of benthic organisms via bed sediment. Instead habitat such as downed trees and rocks near the dam and periphery of the channel was selectively jab sampled. Following dam removal, Station 01570076 converted to a freeflowing riffle and was kick sampled in the same manner as the other free-flowing sites. Macroinvertebrates were identified to the lowest possible taxa at the USGS biology lab in New Cumberland, Pennsylvania.

These orders of insects are generally considered to be pollution sensitive; % Contribution of Dominant Taxa - total number of organisms is an indication of community balance at the lowest taxonomic level possible (usually genus or species). A community that proves dominated by relatively few taxa would include environmental stress. This metric can include the single most dominant taxa, three most dominant, or five most dominant taxa ""dominants in common"" (DIC). Other definitions can be found on pages 22-33.

These orders of insects are generally considered to be pollution sensitive; % Contribution of Dominant Taxa - total number of organisms is an indication of community balance at the lowest taxonomic level possible (usually genus or species). A community that proves dominated by relatively few taxa would include environmental stress. This metric can include the single most dominant taxa, three most dominant, or five most dominant taxa ""dominants in common"" (DIC). Other definitions can be found on pages 22-33.

-- Conodoguinet Cr 126 ft DS of Good Hope Dam at Good Hope, PA--Continued REMARKS.--Definition of terms used: Total Number - the total number of aquatic invertebrates collected at a site; Total EPT Taxa - total number of distinct taxa within the orders Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Plecoptera (stoneflies), and Trichoptera (caddisflies). These orders of insects are generally considered to be pollution sensitive; % Contribution of Dominant Taxa - total number of organisms is an indication of community balance at the lowest taxonomic level possible (usually genus or species). A community that proves dominated by relatively few taxa would include environmental stress. This metric can include the single most dominant taxa, three most dominant, or five most dominant taxa ""dominants in common"" (DIC). Other definitions can be found on pages 22-33.

These orders of insects are generally considered to be pollution sensitive; % Contribution of Dominant Taxa - total number of organisms is an indication of community balance at the lowest taxonomic level possible (usually genus or species). A community that proves dominated by relatively few taxa would include environmental stress. This metric can include the single most dominant taxa, three most dominant, or five most dominant taxa ""dominants in common"" (DIC). Other definitions can be found on pages 22-33.

GX262-23-15510593	Canyon Dam would probably have some resale value, as would the access footbridge at Coleman Dam. PG&E may wish to retain some of the control equipment for use at their other dams. The older gates, hoists, pipe handrails, CMP standpipes, and miscellaneous steel sections may only have scrap value. Short's Scrap Metal (phone 530-243-4780) or other area recycling firms may be willing to purchase these items. Cost estimates for this study do not include any salvage value for any items removed from the dams.  2. Hazardous Waste Hazardous materials anticipated to be encountered as a result of the dam removal work include minor amounts of lead-based paints, oil, and grease. A slight potential for PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) contamination may exist due to the presence of upstream powerplants. Site assessments should be performed to establish all potential environmental hazards existing at each damsite prior to final designs. A visual inspection and regulatory/literature search should first be performed to establish the possible presence of hazardous materials, followed by a more detailed evaluation to confirm the presence and extent of the hazardous materials and to plan appropriate actions for removal [8]. For the purpose of the current study, no hazardous waste is assumed to be present at any of the sites which would significantly impact costs for dam removal. G. Sediment Management 1. General Sediment has almost completely filled the reservoirs impounded by the three diversion dams proposed for removal on North Fork Battle Creek and South Fork Battle Creek. The Sedimentation and River Hydraulics Group (D-8540) was requested to assess the feasibility of allowing the river to naturally erode the sediment deposited behind these dams. Potential problems associated with allowing the river to naturally erode sediments behind a dam include [8]: Temporary increase of turbidity and associated environmental problems. Sediment deposition downstream, causing increased flood stage, localized blockage of facilities along the river, and damaged fish habitat. Movement of sediment wave downstream. Release of contaminated sediment. Using simple hydraulic and sediment transport analysis, this section addresses the likelihood that such problems will occur at this site.  18   2. River Reach Descriptions Wildcat Diversion Dam is located on North Fork Battle Creek, and Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam is located 2.7 miles upstream. Coleman Diversion Dam is located on South Fork Battle Creek. These two rivers join to form Battle Creek about 2.5 miles downstream of Coleman Dam and about 2.4 miles downstream of Wildcat Dam. Battle Creek continues for about 15 miles before entering the Sacramento River below the Coleman National Fish Hatchery. Battle Creek and its tributaries are characterized by steep slopes and deep canyons. The average slopes of various reaches were taken from USGS maps and indicate that the slopes are steepest along North Fork Battle Creek (0.020 to 0.037) and are slightly less steep throughout South Fork Battle Creek and Battle Creek (0.004 to 0.014), as shown in table 3. Photographs and videotape from the damsites indicate that the sediment sizes at Eagle Canyon and Wildcat Dams can be classified between cobbles to very large boulders, while the sediment sizes at Coleman Dam can be classified between gravel and cobbles. No formal sediment sampling or classification has been performed at these sites. The bathymetry (or surface contours) of the streams is largely unknown except that which can be inferred from the photographs. The small reservoirs behind the dams have been mostly filled in with sediment. At the time of construction, the crest of Eagle Canyon Dam was 11 feet above the river bed, while the crest heights at Wildcat and Coleman Dams were 8 feet and 13 feet, respectively. From visual observation, it is estimated that the river beds are now less than three feet below the dam crests, and may be even with the dam crest in some places. These dams, therefore, have almost no effective storage and essentially behave as run-of-the-river dams. Table 3. Slopes of Various Reaches Along Battle Creek and Sacramento River.

Analysis 19   The general procedure used to analyze the option of allowing the river to naturally erode the sediments deposited behind each dam is as follows: Estimate hydraulic conditions along the river reaches. Estimate sediment volume trapped behind dams. Estimate maximum size of sediment trapped. Estimate minimum size of sediment trapped. Determine the relative potential for sediment problems. a. Estimate hydraulic conditions along the river reaches. - To obtain an estimate of the sediment transport characteristics at each dam, it is first necessary to estimate the hydraulic conditions at the site. A high flow and a low flow condition was considered to get an estimate of the bounds of sediment that could be found at each dam. The high flow condition gives an estimate of the maximum size of sediment that could be transported by the rivers and therefore the maximum size of sediment that could be found behind the dams. The low flow condition gives an estimate of the minimum size that could be deposited behind the dams. Even though this smaller sediment could subsequently be washed out from behind the dams, it could also be deposited in sheltered areas, such as between larger sediment, so that it remains fixed behind the dams. The flow chosen to represent the high flow condition for each river reach corresponds to the average annual peak flow. The low flow condition corresponds to the minimum average monthly flow, which happens to occur in October. For all flows, river widths were assumed to be equal to the dam crest lengths. This was done to give a lower bound on the sediment diameters that would be deposited behind the dams. Given a particular flow rate and channel slope, a more narrow channel will generally have the ability to transport larger sediment than a wider one. Manning roughness coefficients were taken to be 0.050 for South Fork Battle Creek and 0.030 for North Fork Battle Creek and for Battle Creek. Table 4 gives the values used to compute the hydraulic conditions. The shear velocity is an important indication of the river's ability to transport sediment. Table 4.

Estimate sediment volume trapped behind dams. - Because no detailed data of the bed topography were available, a simple geometric analysis was performed. It is assumed that sediment has filled the dams to within two feet of the dam crest. The volume of sediment was then calculated assuming the filled sediment in the shape of a wedge behind the dam, as shown in figure 2 below.  Figure 2. Calculation of sediment volume. S = original bed slope. c. Estimate maximum size of sediment trapped. - The maximum size of sediment transported is based on the incipient motion criteria of Shields. The Shields parameter, , is defined as:  (  s - 1)gd  p  where u* is the shear velocity, s is the specific gravity of the sediment, g is the acceleration of gravity, and dp is the particle diameter. For fully turbulent flow over large sediment, it is commonly assumed that if   0.06, then motion of the sediment will occur [9]. Using this criteria, it is possible to solve for the maximum particle diameter that moves given a particular value of the shear velocity. It is assumed that the maximum particle size found behind the dam is equal to the particle diameter that is just moved by the high flow under consideration. d. Estimate minimum size of sediment trapped. - The minimum size of sediment trapped behind the dams is based on the assumption that deposition of the finest material occurs during the low flow period. Deposition is assumed to occur if wfall/u* 1.0, where wfall is the fall velocity of a particle. This can be related to a particle diameter to obtain the minimum particle size expected behind the dams. A summary of the results from items b-d above for each dam is At Coleman Dam, the minimum sediment size expected behind (classified as a very coarse sand) and the maximum diameter of approximately 4 inches. At Eagle Canyon Dam, the maximum sediment sizes are 1.8 feet and 6 mm, respectively. At Wildcat 21  found in table 5. the dam is 1 mm material is and minimum Dam, they are 1.4   feet and 5 mm, respectively. It is difficult to ascertain the percentages of the various size classes behind the dams because of the limited data. The total amount of sediment trapped behind the three dams is estimated to be approximately 69,000 yd3. Coleman Dam accounts for nearly 80 percent of this volume. Table 5. Sediment Volumes and Sizes Expected Behind Battle Creek Dams. Dam Eagle Canyon W ildcat Coleman River N. Fork Battle N. Fork Battle S. Fork Battle Sediment 3 Vol. (yd ) 9600 4900 54000 Max Size Min Size dp (ft) dp (mm) 1.8 1.4 0.34 6 5 1  e. Determine the relative potential for sediment problems. - Because there are no significant quantities of silts or fine sands expected to be present within the sediment, there should not be a large increase in turbidity of the water or any problems associated with the transport and deposition of fine material during natural erosion. In addition, the sediments should not present any contamination problems, since the streams pass through relatively undisturbed and uninhabited land. Sediment deposition is a potential concern downstream of Coleman Dam. The sediment behind Coleman Dam has the greatest potential to cause downstream problems because it has by far the largest volume and is relatively more fine than that found behind the other two dams. It is expected that most of the sediment behind Coleman Dam will eventually be transported downstream. There should not be any build up of a particular size class anywhere within Battle Creek because the sediment transport characteristics from Coleman Dam to the confluence with the Sacramento River do not change significantly. This is shown in table 4 by the relatively constant value of the shear velocity throughout the length of Battle Creek. If the shear velocity was to decrease significantly along the reach, one would expect deposition there. Based on experience with gravel bed streams, it is likely that the sediment behind the dam will quickly come to equilibrium with the stream after an initial slug of sediment is transported downstream [10]. This initial slug of sediment, if it remains as a coherent wave, would have the potential of causing problems downstream. Whether it remains as a slug or dissipates and distributes itself over the downstream reach is likely a function of particle sizes. It would be expected that, if there is a large range of particle sizes and no one size class dominates, the sediment wave will quickly dissipate. This is because each size class will move at its own rate. The possibility remains that a channel may form naturally at the Coleman damsite in a relatively short period of time, and that the initial slug of sediment will not remain as a coherent wave but rather quickly distribute itself along the downstream reach. If the entire volume of sediment trapped behind Coleman Dam was to become distributed evenly over the bed of Battle Creek for a distance of 13 miles to the Coleman National Fish Hatchery, it would increase the 22   streambed level by only a few inches. If a coherent sediment wave was allowed to occur, however, some damage may result at the existing county bridge located about -mile downstream from Coleman Diversion Dam. Sediment deposition at the bridge could raise the local river stage by 3 to 5 feet. To prevent the possibility of a slug of sediment moving downstream, it is suggested that before Coleman Dam is removed a channel be excavated upstream through the sediment. Mechanical channelization can help the stream return to its pre-dam condition more quickly and with less adverse environmental consequences than through natural erosion alone [11]. Creating such a channel within the deposited sediment would also benefit fish passage. Without such a channel, there could be a barrier to fish passage after the dam is removed. The excavated channel should extend about 500 feet upstream from the damsite, ranging in depth from 10 feet at the dam to daylight at the upstream end, for a channel bed slope of 0.02. The bottom width should be at least 30 feet, and the side slopes should be about 2.0H:1.0V, or equal to the angle of repose of the sediments. Much of the sediment can be distributed along the banks of the channel. For cost estimating purposes, an estimated 5,000 yd3 is assumed to be removed from the channel and hauled to a land disposal site within 1 mile. The excavated channel would be intended only to help start the erosion process, and would not be considered a stable channel. The river would be expected to further alter the channel geometry to suit itself. 4. Conclusions Erosion of the sediment behind the dams by natural river flows should produce satisfactory results. Significant quantities of fine materials are not present behind the dams and therefore the adverse environmental problems associated with such sediments will not occur. In addition, no problems with deposition downstream of the dam should exist since the hydraulic conditions do not change significantly and the volume of sediment trapped behind these dams is relatively small. It is recommended, however, that a channel through the sediment behind Coleman Dam be created artificially, by mechanical methods, if not quickly established naturally. This will provide easier fish passage and prevent the possibility of the formation of a sediment wave which could affect a county bridge downstream. H. Other Environmental Considerations Preliminary information on other potential environmental considerations associated with dam removal is provided below. Additional information on these topics will be developed by others in order to fully meet applicable federal, state, and local regulations. 1.

""This effort, led by the Western Canal Water District, is a triumph of           cooperation and common sense. It shows conclusively that we can restore           important rivers and fish runs while also providing for existing agricultural           needs,"" Babbitt said. ""I believe this work will prove to be a model for           the nation.""          Babbitt will visit Butte Creek, a major tributary of the Sacramento River           near Chico, CA, joining the Western Canal Water District, the California           Department of Fish and Game, California Urban Water Agencies and other           partners in inaugurating the removal of McPherrin Dam. With McPherrin           Dam (and one other dam due to be removed), approximately 20 miles of Butte           Creek will be restored to free, unimpeded flow for the first time since           the 1920's. Butte Creek is one of only four Sacramento River tributaries           with remaining populations of spring-run chinook salmon.          ""There are more than 75,000 dams in the nation, most built long ago,           many in the 19th Century,"" Babbitt said. ""Of course many dams are still           useful, but others are clearly obsolete. The role of many of these structures           needs to be reassessed.

GX262-49-6038420	streambed level by only a few inches. If a coherent sediment wave was allowed to occur, however, some damage may result at the existing county bridge located about -mile downstream from Coleman Diversion Dam. Sediment deposition at the bridge could raise the local river stage by 3 to 5 feet. To prevent the possibility of a slug of sediment moving downstream, it is suggested that before Coleman Dam is removed a channel be excavated upstream through the sediment. Mechanical channelization can help the stream return to its pre-dam condition more quickly and with less adverse environmental consequences than through natural erosion alone [11]. Creating such a channel within the deposited sediment would also benefit fish passage. Without such a channel, there could be a barrier to fish passage after the dam is removed. The excavated channel should extend about 500 feet upstream from the damsite, ranging in depth from 10 feet at the dam to daylight at the upstream end, for a channel bed slope of 0.02. The bottom width should be at least 30 feet, and the side slopes should be about 2.0H:1.0V, or equal to the angle of repose of the sediments. Much of the sediment can be distributed along the banks of the channel. For cost estimating purposes, an estimated 5,000 yd3 is assumed to be removed from the channel and hauled to a land disposal site within 1 mile. The excavated channel would be intended only to help start the erosion process, and would not be considered a stable channel. The river would be expected to further alter the channel geometry to suit itself. 4. Conclusions Erosion of the sediment behind the dams by natural river flows should produce satisfactory results. Significant quantities of fine materials are not present behind the dams and therefore the adverse environmental problems associated with such sediments will not occur. In addition, no problems with deposition downstream of the dam should exist since the hydraulic conditions do not change significantly and the volume of sediment trapped behind these dams is relatively small. It is recommended, however, that a channel through the sediment behind Coleman Dam be created artificially, by mechanical methods, if not quickly established naturally. This will provide easier fish passage and prevent the possibility of the formation of a sediment wave which could affect a county bridge downstream. H. Other Environmental Considerations Preliminary information on other potential environmental considerations associated with dam removal is provided below. Additional information on these topics will be developed by others in order to fully meet applicable federal, state, and local regulations. 1. Noise Abatement Noise would be produced by various dam removal activities including the operation of heavy construction equipment, including an excavator with hoe-ram and possibly a dozer; hauling equipment, including trucks and helicopters; drills and jackhammers; air compressors; and possibly occasional controlled blasting at the Coleman damsite. Noise levels may produce short-term, minor adverse impacts close to the damsites, and along the helicopter flight paths, but should not 23   be noticeable beyond about 1 mile. Natural attenuation of noise levels would be provided by trees and the existing terrain. No special noise abatement procedures should be necessary. 2. Air Quality Construction activities during dam removal would send minor amounts of trafficrelated pollutants and some particulates into the air in the immediate areas. Construction-related sources of particulates would include the use of unimproved haul roads, loading and dumping, hoe-ramming, and possibly blasting. Dust generated by construction traffic, and possibly by helicopter operations, may require some mitigation by occasionally spraying water for dust abatement. 3. Water Quality The dam removal process would be expected to increase stream turbidity levels to some degree for short periods of time due to any operations within the channels. Potential adverse impacts are expected to be minor. Significant quantities of finegrained (silt or clay) materials are not expected to be encountered in either the downstream channels or the upstream reservoirs, due to the relatively high flow velocities in the streams, and the relatively short detention times in the small reservoirs. Some investigations will be required to confirm this assessment for final design. No significant long-term impacts to water quality (such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, or turbidity) or flood control are expected, due to the very small storage capacity of the reservoirs. The total surface area of all three reservoirs is less than two acres. Necessary permit applications would be made to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for a Section 404 permit (dredge and fill), and to the California state certifying agency for a Section 401 (water quality) certificate for each construction site. Suitable precautions will be taken to prevent any hazardous material spills (diesel fuel, oil, gasoline) from construction equipment working in the stream channels. The cost estimates prepared for this study include no special mitigation for any potential water quality concerns. Construction is primarily assumed to occur during a time of year for which minimum impacts to anadromous fish would be expected (July and August), although some construction activities may be required through the late summer and fall. 4. Public Health and Safety Applicable construction safety standards will be enforced during all dam removal activities. Any structures remaining at the sites will be modified as required to ensure public safety, and appropriate warning signs will be posted. It is expected that the Coleman damsite will remain inaccessible to the public, due to its location on PG&E property. The Eagle Canyon damsite is located on private property, and the Wildcat damsite may be sold by PG&E to private interests if it becomes no longer necessary for the operation and maintenance of hydropower facilities. 5. Traffic Local construction traffic is expected to be minor, and generally limited to Manton Road, Battle Creek Bottom Road, and Wildcat Road. No special traffic 24   control measures should be required. Helicopter flights would probably originate from the local airport located in Redding. 6. Species of Special Concern The valley elderberry longhorn beetle was listed as a threatened species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in August 1980, providing the species with protection under the federal Endangered Species Act. The valley elderberry longhorn beetle completes its entire life cycle within or upon mature elderberry bushes, having at least one stem greater than one inch in diameter at ground level. One such elderberry bush (with four mature stems) is located within the project area at Eagle Canyon Dam, which will require the development and approval of an elderberry avoidance and mitigation plan prior to dam removal [2]. Some state and federally listed plants and other threatened or endangered species may occur in the project areas [2]. Further investigations will be required at all three damsites for final design. 7. Cultural Resources Removal of the diversion dams would mean the loss of historic structures eligible for listing on the national register. Mitigation would be provided by the preparation of an Historic American Engineering Record (HAER) for each damsite. Although cost estimates for full removal have been prepared, portions of each dam could remain to aid in interpretation of the historic sites, in addition to reducing dam removal costs. Potential candidates for retention include the canal intake structure at Wildcat Diversion Dam, the canal wall and gate winch block at Eagle Canyon Dam, and the concrete steppool fish ladder and masonry gravity weir structure at Coleman Diversion Dam. A cultural resources survey was prepared by Robert I. Orlins, DWR Associate State Archaeologist, for the Eagle Canyon damsite in January 1998, consisting of a record search and a field reconnaissance [2]. No historic sites have been recorded in the vicinity of Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam, and no cultural resources were identified during the survey within the project boundaries, other than the dam itself. Further investigations will be required for all three damsites for final design. 8. Socioeconomics Dam removal would result in the loss of hydroelectric power associated with reduced streamflow diversions. Current diversion capacities for hydropower generation are 70 ft3/s from Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam, about 80 ft3/s from Coleman Diversion Dam (without Inskip Powerhouse releases), and a potential for 18 ft3/s from Wildcat Diversion Dam. Cost estimates for foregone hydropower generation are being developed by Resources Management International (RMI). Minor economic impacts may result from dam removal, due to the employment of construction workers performing the demolition work in the short-term, and due to reduced maintenance requirements for PG&E over the long-term. A major 25   socioeconomic benefit would be the long-term restoration of anadromous fish in Battle Creek (the project purpose). I. Project Schedule and Estimated Costs 1. Development of Construction Logic and Durations A preliminary bar chart indicating principal construction activities, estimated durations, proposed sequence, and associated schedules for partial dam removal is provided in Appendix C. The schedules assume initial work in the stream channel begins on July 1 at Wildcat Dam, and proceeds through August at Eagle Canyon Dam, until completion at Coleman Dam in mid-September. Removal of all features at the dams would increase the estimated durations shown. Pipeline and flume removal activities are assumed to be essentially independent of the dam removal (stream channel) work, with the lone requirement that removal of the Eagle Canyon Canal flume cannot commence until after Wildcat Dam has been removed, due to streamflow diversion requirements. It is assumed that a single helicopter would perform both the Wildcat Canal pipeline and the Eagle Canyon Canal flume removal activities. A larger helicopter, or Skycrane, would be used for equipment mobilization to both canyon sites. Preconstruction activities include the collection of design data, the preparation of final designs and specifications, and issuance of the specifications package for the dam removal project, which is estimated to take approximately 9 months. The bidding process is assumed to take 4 to 6 weeks, at which time the bids would be opened. Concurrent environmental protection and permitting activities may require 2 to 3 months to get agreement and approvals on the action to take, 3 months to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) and receive the expected Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), and between 1 and 3 months to get the necessary 404 and 401 permits required for construction to begin. Administrative activities include an estimated 30 calendar days for contract award and notice to proceed following the bid opening. It is assumed that construction access and demolition plans will be required to be submitted, for approval, by the contractor, which may require 30 calendar days to prepare and 20 calendar days to approve. These activities need to be completed in time to permit site mobilization by about June 24. Dam removal activities at Wildcat Dam would begin with site mobilization and reservoir drawdown to approximately elevation 1073.2, or the lowest level possible, which requires the disconnection of the Wildcat pipeline at the dam, and operation of the canal intake and sluice gates full open to pass streamflow. A Cat 311 excavator, or equivalent, would be delivered to the canyon site using a large helicopter, or Skycrane, to facilitate streamflow diversion and begin demolition of the masonry dam. Demolition of the dam section using a hoe-ram attachment on the excavator, and final spreading of the masonry rubble using a bucket attachment, would require 7 to 10 working days, based on an average production rate of about 1 cubic yard per hour. Demolition of the fish ladder structure, and removal of the waste concrete and mechanical items from the site, would require an additional 3 to 5 working days. This translates to 3 weeks for river channel 26

Conclusions Removal of Wildcat, Eagle Canyon, and Coleman Diversion Dams is technically feasible, and would require durations between 4 and 6 months to accomplish in the field, for a total project cost between $4,360,000 and $6,830,000 (including contingencies and noncontract costs), depending upon the final removal requirements for the concrete footings along the canal pipeline and flume alignments for Wildcat and Eagle Canyon Dams, and the retention of any other features at the dams. Preliminary construction schedules for partial dam removal, and reconnaissance-level field cost estimates for both full and partial dam removal, are provided in Appendix C and Appendix D, respectively. Construction schedules for full dam removal may require a second construction season. Dam removal would provide unobstructed passage in both North Fork and South Fork Battle Creek for anadromous fish, without the need for special fish passage structures at each damsite. Minimal adverse environmental impacts would be expected. The masonry structures would be demolished in place, with the rubble spread across the downstream channel, or removed if necessary to prevent ponding. All associated waste concrete, reinforcing steel, mechanical items, and miscellaneous metalwork would be removed from the sites, including 3,385 lin ft of metal flume and 5,530 lin ft of steel pipeline. The reservoir sediments would be removed by natural stream erosion and by mechanical removal (at Coleman Dam), with associated turbidity expected to be within acceptable limits. Some mechanical removal of reservoir sediments may be required at all three sites to facilitate streamflow diversion and/or for removal of the dam structures to the original streambed elevations. Selected structural features could be retained at each damsite to permit interpretation of the historic sites, and to minimize dam removal costs. Conceptual photographs of each damsite, reflecting the anticipated appearance following partial dam removal, are provided in Appendix E. K. Additional Investigations for Future Studies The following items should be completed for any future dam removal studies for the project: 1. Prepare site topography for Wildcat and Coleman damsites (by DWR). 2. Develop detailed drawings of existing facilities, for use in estimating quantities and for inclusion in the HAER needed to document each damsite. Provide pertinent construction drawings, correspondence, and photographs, if available. 30   3. Evaluate existing masonry canal walls at the Eagle Canyon and Coleman damsites, if they are to be retained, for stability under proposed backfill loads, using the structural dimensions from item 2. Evaluate potential tieback or buttress systems as required. 4. Identify and perform additional studies related to cultural resources, species of special concern, and all other issues pertaining to compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). 5. Evaluate proposed design and construction schedule for the direct connection between the Inskip Powerhouse tailrace and the Coleman Canal. 6. Obtain streamflow data from new gauges below the Wildcat and Coleman damsites, when available, and compare with data at the existing downstream Battle Creek gauging station. 7. Determine the minimum acceptable flowrate for South Fork Battle Creek at the Coleman damsite during August and September, to facilitate removal activities. 8. Determine final limits of structure removal at all sites (features to be removed and features to be retained), based on economic, public safety, and other considerations. 9. Obtain channel cross-sections and gradations for further sediment analysis. References [1] [2] ""Battle Creek: A Time for Action,"" February 27, 1998.

Dam removal activities at Wildcat Dam would begin with site mobilization and reservoir drawdown to approximately elevation 1073.2, or the lowest level possible, which requires the disconnection of the Wildcat pipeline at the dam, and operation of the canal intake and sluice gates full open to pass streamflow. A Cat 311 excavator, or equivalent, would be delivered to the canyon site using a large helicopter, or Skycrane, to facilitate streamflow diversion and begin demolition of the masonry dam. Demolition of the dam section using a hoe-ram attachment on the excavator, and final spreading of the masonry rubble using a bucket attachment, would require 7 to 10 working days, based on an average production rate of about 1 cubic yard per hour. Demolition of the fish ladder structure, and removal of the waste concrete and mechanical items from the site, would require an additional 3 to 5 working days. This translates to 3 weeks for river channel 26   activities. Demobilization of the heavy equipment would occur around July 23, with an additional duration of from 2 to 5 days for site cleanup. (Removal of the canal intake structure under the full removal plan would add another week to this schedule.) Site mobilization at Eagle Canyon Dam would be concurrent with dam removal activities at Wildcat Dam, but would not be completed until the Cat 311 excavator could be airlifted from the Wildcat site to the Eagle Canyon site, around July 23 (or later, if full removal of Wildcat Dam is required). Reservoir drawdown to approximately elevation 1406.2, or the lowest level possible using the existing radial sluice gate, would expose large portions of the masonry dam and weir crest structure for demolition using the hoe-ram and jackhammers. Excavating a notch through the dam would permit further lowering of the reservoir level for demolition of remaining portions of the structure above the original streambed. Demolition of the dam and weir crest, and placement of the masonry rubble within the canal section and/or river channel at the site, would require about 20 working days, based on an average production rate of about 1 cubic yard per hour. Demolition of the fish ladder structure, and removal of the waste concrete and mechanical items from the site, would require an additional 3 to 5 working days. This translates to about one month for river channel activities. Demobilization of the heavy equipment would occur around August 23, with an additional duration of from 2 to 5 days for site cleanup. (Removal of the canal wall and gate winch block under the full removal plan would add another 2 weeks to this schedule.) Removal of 5,530 feet of pipeline from the Wildcat Canal would be accomplished by airlifting out 10- to 20-foot-long sections of pipe, depending upon equipment capacity, with an estimated weight of about 100 pounds per foot of length. Pipe supports spaced on approximate 20-foot-centers, and miscellaneous metalwork, are assumed to increase the total weight by about 30 percent. Concrete footings for pipe supports are assumed to average about 1 cubic yard for each support. For cost estimating purposes, the pipeline is assumed to be removed at a rate of 20 feet per hour, for a total duration of between 6 and 8 weeks. Concrete footing removal, required under the full removal plan, would likely follow right behind the pipeline removal activities and would use the same helicopter to haul out about 2 yd3 (8,000 pounds) of waste concrete every 4 hours, for a total duration of up to 15 weeks. Backfilling of the Wildcat Canal channel sections and removal of the county bridge would be performed concurrently with pipeline removal activities, using conventional earthmoving and paving equipment. Removal of 3,385 feet of metal flume from the Eagle Canyon Canal would be accomplished by airlifting out bundled materials, with two 20-foot spans removed about every 3 hours, for a total duration of between 6 and 8 weeks. The metal flume is assumed to weigh approximately 100 pounds per foot of length, with supports and miscellaneous metalwork assumed to increase the total weight by about 30 percent. Concrete footings for flume supports are assumed to average about 1 cubic yard for each support spaced on 20-foot centers. Concrete footing removal, required under the full removal plan, would likely follow right behind the flume removal activities and would use the same helicopter to haul out about 2 yd3 (8,000 pounds) of waste concrete every 4 hours, for a total duration of up to 12 weeks. It is assumed the flume would be removed after removal of the Wildcat  27   pipeline, which would be more than a month after removal of Wildcat Dam, when the flume would no longer be needed for streamflow diversion purposes. Dam removal activities at Coleman Dam are assumed to occur following completion of the Inskip Powerhouse tailrace direct connection pipe to the Coleman Canal, in order to permit streamflow diversion around the damsite. No construction schedule for the direct connection pipe was available for this study; however, an August 2 date has been assumed for contractor mobilization to the Coleman site for demolition. No diversions are assumed from North Fork Battle Creek. The reservoir would be drawn down to approximate elevation 996.2 (depending upon streamflow) using the existing radial sluice gate, exposing a significant portion of the masonry dam structure. Excavation of a notch through the dam to the original streambed grade would permit further lowering of the reservoir. Due to the good access to the site, larger equipment and a much better production rate for demolition of the masonry dam structure was assumed, or about 4 cubic yards per hour (compared to 1 cubic yard per hour at the canyon sites), using two or more excavators or dozers, for a duration of about 12 working days (or about 3 weeks). Contractor demobilization and site restoration activities are assumed to begin around September 10, with a duration from 2 to 5 days. (Removal of the masonry weir structure and concrete fish ladder under the full removal plan would add another week to this schedule. Full removal of the features at all three dams would add about 4 weeks to the overall schedule, resulting in a completion date of around mid-October.) If all stream channel activities at Coleman Dam are required to be completed by September 1, completion of the tailrace direct connection pipe would have to be planned for no later than mid-July for the partial removal plan, or Coleman Dam would have to be removed the following year. (Full removal of all features would probably delay the removal of Coleman Dam until the following year.) 2. Field Cost Estimates for Dam Removal Field cost estimates prepared for this study are summarized below. Detailed estimate worksheets are provided in Appendix D. a. Wildcat Diversion Dam. - The estimated field cost for removal of all features associated with Wildcat Dam, including a 25 percent allowance for contract contingencies, is $2,100,000. The estimated field cost for partial removal of Wildcat Dam, which would retain the canal intake structure, some mechanical items and miscellaneous metalwork, and concrete footings along the canal pipeline alignment, is $1,150,000. b. Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam. - The estimated field cost for removal of all features associated with Eagle Canyon Dam, including a 25 percent allowance for contract contingencies, is $2,000,000. (This estimate assumes portions of the Eagle Canyon canal channel would be retained for passage of spring flows.)  28   The estimated field cost for partial removal of Eagle Canyon Dam, which would retain the masonry canal wall, gate winch block, some miscellaneous metalwork, and concrete footings along the canal flume alignment, is $1,300,000. c. Coleman Diversion Dam. - The estimated field cost for removal of all features associated with Coleman Diversion Dam, including a 25 percent allowance for contract contingencies, is $650,000. (This estimate retains all canal features except for the intake weir structure, and includes excavation of an upstream channel through the existing sediments.) The estimated field cost for partial removal of Coleman Diversion Dam, which would retain the existing concrete steppool fish ladder on the left abutment, and the masonry intake weir structure on the right abutment, is $600,000. Costs for removal or modification of the existing masonry canal wall should be included in cost estimates for the Inskip Powerhouse tailrace direct connection pipe. 3. Design and Construction Management Costs For the reconnaissance-level estimates and for comparison purposes, non-contract costs are assumed to represent an additional allowance of 20 percent for engineering designs, 15 percent for construction management, 5 percent for contract administration, and 3 percent for environmental mitigation, or a total of 43 percent of the estimated total field cost (including contingencies). Total estimated costs for each dam are summarized in table 6 for full removal, and in table 7 for partial removal. Real estate costs are not included in these estimates.

Preliminary construction schedules for partial dam removal, and reconnaissance-level field cost estimates for both full and partial dam removal, are provided in Appendix C and Appendix D, respectively. Construction schedules for full dam removal may require a second construction season. Dam removal would provide unobstructed passage in both North Fork and South Fork Battle Creek for anadromous fish, without the need for special fish passage structures at each damsite. Minimal adverse environmental impacts would be expected. The masonry structures would be demolished in place, with the rubble spread across the downstream channel, or removed if necessary to prevent ponding. All associated waste concrete, reinforcing steel, mechanical items, and miscellaneous metalwork would be removed from the sites, including 3,385 lin ft of metal flume and 5,530 lin ft of steel pipeline. The reservoir sediments would be removed by natural stream erosion and by mechanical removal (at Coleman Dam), with associated turbidity expected to be within acceptable limits. Some mechanical removal of reservoir sediments may be required at all three sites to facilitate streamflow diversion and/or for removal of the dam structures to the original streambed elevations. Selected structural features could be retained at each damsite to permit interpretation of the historic sites, and to minimize dam removal costs. Conceptual photographs of each damsite, reflecting the anticipated appearance following partial dam removal, are provided in Appendix E. K. Additional Investigations for Future Studies The following items should be completed for any future dam removal studies for the project: 1. Prepare site topography for Wildcat and Coleman damsites (by DWR). 2. Develop detailed drawings of existing facilities, for use in estimating quantities and for inclusion in the HAER needed to document each damsite. Provide pertinent construction drawings, correspondence, and photographs, if available. 30

Deadline for comments is November 21, 2001. Description of the Proposal  PacifiCorp has requested the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (""FERC"") to approve a Settlement Agreement which would terminate operation of the Condit hydroelectric project in October 2006 and remove the Condit Dam between 2006 and 2007, which is located on the White Salmon River in Skamania and Klickitat Counties, Washington. This is referred to as the Condit Dam Removal Project (""Project""). For details on the continued operation of the dam until removal see attachment No. 1. In connection with that proceeding and the proposed dam removal (attachment No. 2), PacifiCorp has applied to the Department of Ecology (Ecology) for a section 401 certification under the Clean Water Act. Ecology has also determined that a stormwater NPDES permit under the Clean Water Act, which Ecology has state jurisdiction to issue, will likely be required for the Project. Ecology has determined that an environmental impact statement (""EIS"") will be required for the Project pursuant to Chapter 43.21C RCW. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission prepared an EIS in connection with its decision on relicensing the hydroelectric project. Ecology has determined that supplemental environmental review needs to be completed to address aspects of the dam removal project not covered by the 1996 EIS.

The dam is founded in a narrow steep canyon on sound basalt rock which has no significant structural discontinuities. The associated reservoir, Northwestern Lake, has a surface area of 92 acres.  ATTACHMENT NO. 1   Page 5 of 10  EXISTING PROJECT STRUCTURE: The dam is a concrete gravity structure 125 ft high and 471 ft long and includes:  a 250 ft long spillway including: - A 10 ft high 167 ft long Obermeyer gate for reservoir elevation control - five 10 ft by 10 ft radial gates - one 6 ft slide gate a gated intake structure located adjacent to the left abutment including five 9.5 foot square openings with individual timber slide gates a diversion tunnel two low level sluice gates a 90 ft concrete gravity section at the west end of the dam a concrete gravity section and a concrete wall at the east end of the dam, between the intake and the left abutment        Water Conveyance System Water is conveyed from the intake structure at the dam to the powerhouse through a woodstave flowline, concrete surge tank and two penstocks. Powerhouse The Condit Powerhouse is located on the east bank of the White Salmon River and is approximately 150 ft long and 75 ft wide. The powerhouse is served by an electrically powered 40 ton bridge crane. The powerhouse tailrace consists of a concrete lined outlet channel immediately downstream of the powerhouse, followed by a rectangular shaped open concrete channel which runs along the east bank of the river and ends in a large natural pool approximately 350 ft downstream of the powerhouse. Other project works located at the dam include:    A 20 kW propane fueled emergency power generator located on the dam's east non-overflow section; A concrete block gage house located at the east end of the intake structure; A floating dock located on the reservoir east of the intake structure supporting a 20 hp, 250 gallons per minute (gpm) vertical turbine pump. (The pump and supporting dock are owned by the Mt. Adams Orchard Company and are used to provide irrigation water for acreage east of the Condit Project. Although within the Condit project boundary, these facilities are not part of the Condit Hydroelectric Project); A log boom, attached at the left abutment adjacent to the intake racks, extending across the reservoir just upstream of the dam and attached at the west end of the dam; and A floating fish rearing net pen immediately upstream of the intake structure. This facility consists of a dock approximately 30 ft square which supports a 20 ft square by 13 ft deep net pen. (This net pen is used under a cooperative program between PacifiCorp, the Washington Department of Wildlife and the White Salmon Steelheaders to raise steelhead smolts for release into the lower White Salmon River. The net pen facility is owned by PacifiCorp, however, it is not part of the Condit Hydroelectric Project.).      Page 6 of 10  CURRENT PROJECT OPERATION The Condit Project operation is currently semiautomatic. PacifiCorp employs a resident operator and a maintenance man/relief operator to oversee daily operation and maintenance of the project. The generators are manually synchronized to the system by the operator. Once on line, operation control is accomplished remotely from the Hydro Control Center in Ariel, Washington, which is staffed 24 hours per day. The units are loaded to meet system demand consistent with the project environmental, recreational and other restraints. Hydro Control has the capability to remotely shutdown or vary the load on both units and can control two of the five spillway radial gates. These operations are the same during adverse, mean, and high water years. License Constraints: License Article 28 requires a minimum discharge of 15 cubic feet per second (cfs) from Condit Reservoir into the White Salmon River. This flow is normally provided by releases from the dam's easterly vertical slide gate. Article 29 of the Condit license requires ""between September 1 and October 15 of each year, the Licensee shall so regulate releases from the dam that fluctuations and river surface levels downstream from the powerhouse shall be no greater then 2.5 ft in any 24 hour period as measured by U.S. Geological Survey gaging station near Underwood, Washington"". This requirement is to facilitate the operation of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) fish facility located 0.3 miles downstream of the Condit Powerhouse. PacifiCorp's Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Condit Project directs the operators, in the event of a total plant trip, to open spillway gates No. 1 and No. 2 to maintain a sufficient discharge to minimize the river fluctuation. Non-License Constraints: The operation of the USFWS facility has been expanded to include some fish rearing activity on nearly a continuous basis. As a matter of cooperation, PacifiCorp has voluntarily extended the river level fluctuation restraints contained in Article 29 to essentially a constant mode of operation although, during periods of high runoff, the project cannot control the rate of river elevation rise or fall. The SOP directs the operators to check with the Spring Creek National Hatchery, which oversees the operation of the USFWS facility, whenever it is necessary to schedule flows downstream of the Condit Powerhouse at or below 250 cfs. Operation Mode: The Condit Project has, in recent years, been operated mostly as a run-of-river facility. During the 78 years of operation since the construction of the Condit Project, the reservoir has significantly ""silted in"" leaving approximately 665 acre-feet1 of usable storage. Historically, during periods when the available flow is at or above the level to efficiently load both units, the project has been operated at or near a full reservoir condition.  1  1 acre-foot equals 1 acre of surface area covered with 1 foot of water   Page 7 of 10  ATTACHMENT NO. 2 CONDIT HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT - REMOVAL Excerpted from: Condit Hydroelectric Project FERC No. 2342 Removal Plan Summary REMOVAL PLAN ELEMENTS Dam Removal. The removal of Condit Dam would be accomplished by excavating a drain tunnel through the concrete base of the dam to rapidly drain the reservoir and to allow the dam to be removed in quarried blocks of concrete using conventional construction techniques. The drain tunnel is to be 12 feet high by 18 feet wide and would be excavated using drilling and explosives at the base of the dam, at elevation 174. The tunnel size is capable of passing 10,000 cfs. Concrete excavated from the tunnel would be transported to a spoil area adjacent to the dam by trucks that are loaded by a rough-terrain crane. An access road would be constructed to the existing spillway apron deck. The last 15 feet of the tunnel would be drilled and blasted, allowing the reservoir and impounded sediments to be sluiced through the tunnel, lowering the reservoir to stream level in about 6 hours. Prior to this final tunnel blast, a barge mounted clamshell crane would be floated in front of the dam to excavate sediment and debris from the area in front of the projected tunnel hole-through. When the area has been sufficiently cleaned out, the crane and barge would be removed from the reservoir and the final tunnel blast would be detonated to drain the reservoir. Should the tunnel plug with woody reservoir debris, measures would be taken to clear the jam. To allow anadromous fish to pass the site during the dismantling of the dam, a series of protective fish pockets would be excavated in each of the walls of the tunnel to allow a place for fish to rest during their passage upstream. Concrete excavation of the dam would proceed in the dry and start at the East End of the dam. Using drilling and explosives, concrete blocks with dimensions of 10 feet high by 4 feet deep by 6 feet wide would be removed with a highline yarder-type system to trucks for transport to the spoil area. The block size was selected to minimize the cost of excavation and hoist capacity, which would require average lifts of about 33,600 lbs. Construction would proceed across the dam in a series of top slicing cuts at ten-foot vertical intervals. The very top cut and the front and back faces of the dam in each cut would be drilled and blasted into blocks and loaded into trucks with an excavator and hauled off the dam. As the top slice cuts progress downward and the dam widens, the center section would be drilled and   Page 8 of 10  blasted into rubble much like a highway rock cut excavation. The concrete rubble would be loaded into trucks with an excavator and hauled off the dam. This procedure would significantly decrease the cost of concrete demolition. As the top slice cuts across the top of the dam progress downwards below elevation 225, the existing river channel gets narrow and steep. At this point a crane would be set up on the spillway slab to hoist concrete from this lower area. As the excavation reaches the level of the drain tunnel, the center portion of the area adjacent to the tunnel would be excavated down to bedrock leaving sections of intact concrete along the edge of the tunnel and along the front and back faces of the dam to hold the water out. When the center section is completely excavated to bedrock, the edge sections are blasted into blocks and hoisted out of the river channel. This should put the river down to its original channel. Lastly, the area around the drain tunnel is excavated in a similar method. This work must be scheduled during low river flows in order to perform a good job of removing the concrete from the footprint of the dam in this lower section. An earlier proposal for Project removal called for a gate to be fitted to the dam drain tunnel to control releases. Based on subsequent studies of sediment removal and with the concurrence of involved parties, it was decided as reflected in the Condit Hydroelectric Project Removal Summary Report (May 1998) that a more rapid removal of the sediments was preferred. Appurtenant Facilities Removal In addition to removing the concrete gravity dam including its Obermeyer crest spillway gate and other spillway and intake gates, demolition of the Project facilities also would involve removal of the upstream cofferdams, wood stave pipeline, steel surge tank, and the wooden and steel penstocks. Upstream Cofferdams: Photographs and drawings show that the cofferdams used to divert and control water during the original construction of the dam were flooded when the reservoir was allowed to fill, and would require removal to return the site to preconstruction conditions. To remove these structures, it is envisioned that a road would be constructed from the top of the excavated concrete dam and would ramp down to area of the cofferdams. The cofferdams are expected to be at least partially exposed by the erosive flushing of the reservoir. Some blasting would probably be necessary to remove one of the cofferdams, since the photographs indicate that fill concrete was probably placed in one cofferdam in lieu of the puddled earthen materials shown on the original construction drawings. The concrete, stones and boulders, and timber members of the cofferdams would be excavated and trucked to the spoil area. The temporary construction road would also allow access to the upstream area where logs and other debris have sunk to the bottom of the reservoir. Some of these logs would be removed, as necessary, to promote reservoir sediment erosion.   Page 9 of 10  Surge Tank: The steel surge tank and its concrete foundations would be removed to eliminate a future public safety hazard. To allow demolition of the concrete foundation of the tank, drilling and blasting techniques would be used. The foundation and tank materials would be loaded into trucks and transported to the spoil area for burial. Wood Stave Pipeline and Steel & Wood Penstocks: The existing 13.5 foot diameter, 5100 foot long wood stave pipeline and the 650 foot long steel and wood penstocks, would be removed along with their concrete foundations. All of these materials would be transported to the spoil area and buried. At the time of construction it may be economically feasible to recycle some of these materials, and transport them to an off site recycling firm. For example, the scrap steel from the penstock, surge tank, and steel bands and fittings of the wood stave pipeline could have value at the time of removal. Site Preparations Because the dam is located in a steep area, room for construction-demolition adjacent to the dam is limited. It is proposed that a ten-acre area be purchased and used for a site setup and staging area, a borrow pit and a spoil area. Site setup facilities would include an office trailer, equipment parts vans, equipment fueling and maintenance station, an equipment parking area and an explosives magazine site. It is estimated that two to three thousand cubic yards of fill material may be required for the construction of access roads to various areas of the project. This material could be removed from this spoil area and later back filled as the construction site is reclaimed. A significant volume of waste materials would be generated from the demolition of the dam and associated facilities. Estimated quantities of some of these materials are listed as follows:     Concrete - over 45,000 cubic yards (broken volume) Wood Pipe Staves - over 6,000 cubic yards stacked Steel - over 400 tons Woody Reservoir Debris - from drained reservoir area (unknown quantity)  Certainly, some of this material could be hauled off and recycled dependant on the market economics of recycling at the time of construction. A fairly large area would be required to store, sort and transport this material for recycling. Access Road Construction. One of the first activities of the project would be construction of an access road to the spillway slab below the dam to permit excavation of the reservoir drain tunnel located at the base of the   Page 10 of 10  dam. Access roads into the drained reservoir area would be used during removal of the cofferdams immediately upstream. Other access roads would be required for the removal of the 5100-foot long wood stave flowline. REMOVAL PLAN SCHEDULE An aggressive schedule has been developed to complete the dam removal project within one year. Certain criteria have been used to develop the schedule and includes the following:    Work that affects water quality and quantity should be performed after October 1st. (US Fish & Wildlife Service, 21 January 1998 memo) The diversion dam used in the original construction of the dam should be removed prior to May 1st to allow fish passage. (US Fish & Wildlife Service, 21 January 1998 memo) Excavation of the 12 x 18 ft. drain tunnel at the base of the dam and the removal of low level concrete in the old river channel must be performed during low river flows (July through November)  The success of this schedule is dependent upon many factors that are difficult to predict such as actual river flows and weather conditions that would be encountered and the impact of buried wood debris in the reservoir. If significant wood debris is encountered, the speed of sediment erosion could be reduced and additional time may be required to handle the debris and to keep the drain tunnel through the dam open."

                   Statements of Residents         THE FOLLOWING copies of statements of persons not in the service of          the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, were obtained by Special Agent Houghton          under instructions given by John H. Hampton to E. S. Batchelor, Clerk          to Robert Pitcairn, Superintendent, and are deemed of so much importance          that they are added to the evidence already taken, as showing the extent          of the great rain-fall on the face of the mountain, east and west from          Gallitzin.                                                         Statement of John Lovett                I am 71 years of age and have lived here 24 years on what is called Coney        Island: my place is just one quarter of a mile from the head of the reservoir;        South Fork Creek is within two hundred feet of my house on one side and        Yellow Run on the other side is three hundred feet. I am engaged in the        lumber business and have a saw mill on my place: I have about 125 acres        of land: it commenced to rain here on Thursday night at 9 o'clock, May 30th,        1889, and it rained very hard up till Friday noon, May 31st, before it stopped:        it rained very hard on Thursday night; it was the heaviest rain I ever heard;        I could not see it, but I could hear it come down. This was the heaviest        flood I ever saw. All the streams that empty into the reservoir were overflowed;        large trees and logs of all kinds went into the reservoir; it took logs        away from the Island that had been here for forty years; it also took trees        out at the root. I can tell how much rain fell. I put a bucket out during        the evening, and when I used it again, it had six inches of water in; there        is a dam here called Sydney dam that had stood here for about fifty years.        It stood all other floods, but this one carried it away.                                 Statement of Christ Greiss        Adams Township, Cambria Co.                I am a farmer and have lived here in Adams Township all my life and have        never seen so much hard rain as it was on the night of May 30th, 1889; it        commen ced [sic] to rain soon after dark and it rained hard all night and        all the next day. It stopped raining about 9 o'clock on the night of May        31st. The rain washed my farm very badly. I live half a mile from South        Fork Creek and about three miles from the head of the reservoir. This was        the biggest flood we have ever had here on our farm; the little springs        turned into big creeks.                                 Statement of Andrew Mumman                I am a farmer and have lived here for 20 years; they call this the head        of the reservoir where the three streams flow into the dam; the streams        are called Yellow Creek, Mud Run, and South. Fork Creek: they are pretty        large streams: it commenced to rain on the night of May 30th, 1889, and        also on the next day; I never saw ir [sic] rain harder than it did on the        night of May 30th, the water in all the streams was very high; I never saw        them as high before.                                 Statement of William Hank        Adams Township                I am a farmer and have lived her in Adams Township all my life; I am 43        years of age. They call this the Summit, the head of the South Fork Creek;        it is not exactly the head, but my house is the last house up this way;        the creek is about a half a mile from my house and Yellow Run is about a        mile and a half from here. It commenced to rain here May 30th, 1889; it        rained very hard that night and next day; it was the biggest rain I ever        saw about the mountain; I went along the South Fork Creek since, and I noticed        it wash ed [sic] away a drift of old wood that had been there ever since        I know; my place is about three miles and a half from the head of the reservoir.                                 Statement of Samuel Peblin        Adams Township                I am a farmer and have lived here in Adams Township about 7 years. This        place is four miles from Somerset Co. and the same distance from Bedford        Co. They call this the head waters of South Fork. It commenced to rain here        May 30th, 1889, and rained hard during the night and next day. I have seen        it rain harder than that night, but not to continue and so steady like that        did. I have 175 acres of land; The water came in a stream by my house like        a creek; the water was so strong that it cut a rut in my field 3 feet deep;        the like ofi [sic] it never occurred here before. We are about three and        a half miles from or above the head of the reservoir and I am a mile from        South Fork Creek. There is no other house higher up to the head of the creek        than mine.                                 Statement of Sylvester Reynold         Adams Township                I am a farmer and have lived here in Adams Township for 42 years. I came        here when but two years old. I own about 160 acres of land, which is in        my wife's name. It commenced to rain here on Thursday afternoon, May 30th        1889, about five o'clock. It rained very hard during the night; it rained        tremendous. I never knew it to rain so hard and so long. There is a stream        called Otto Run which passes my house; the water init [sic] was four feet        high. It never was any higher than two inches at ordinary times. Otto Run        runs into Yellow Run which empties into the reservoir. The water was about        four feet deep in the cellar of my house. The head of South Fork Creek is        about five miles further up the mountain. No one lives up there. The South        Fork Creek was very high. I remember a lot of old logs and old brush which        were there for 20 years, which the water this time carried away. It also        washed out trees and carried them down to the reservoir. The rain came down        so fast in my field that it formed a little stream, a thing I never saw        her before. It also carried away a lot of small bridges; when I saw the        water was so high and the way it was rushing down the stream, I thought        of the reservoir, and from the amount of water going down, I knew it could        not hold it. The water was high here at 11 a. m. of the 31st, and began        to fall at 3 p. m.                                 Statement of Moses Crain        Adams Township                I am a farmer and have lived here in Adams Township for 56 years. It commenced        to rain Thursday, May 30th, 1889, and all during the night. I never saw        so much water up here during my time. It rained continuously all night and        next day and night it rained hard and continuously. The water was very high;        I never saw it as high. There is a small run below my house and the water        in it was very high; it looked like a small river. It would swim a horse.        I live about two miles and a half above the reservoir. The run is very small        in ordinary times, just merely a spring; it runs into Otto Run, which runs        into Yellow Run, and then into the big dam. I have 128 acres of my land        which runs along the Otto Run, which was flooded with water. When I awoke        in the morning, I was surprised to see so much water around here.                                 Statement of Joseph Reynolds                I am a farmer and live here in Adams Township, Cambria County, since 1846.        This place is three miles from the head of the lake. It commenced tor ain        [sic] here on the evening of May 30th, 1889. It rained very hard all night,        and it rained very heavy all night, and it rained very heavy all the next        day, May 31st. The runs here were very high --did [sic] not get out to see        them. They were high here before but this time was the worst. I never knew        them to wash out so much. There was a drift of old wood on the fork of the        South Fork creek ever since I can recollect, and part of it was washed away        and other stuff washed in its place. The part washed in came down the mountain.        It would take a large flow of water to move the drift. I have seen heavy        rains here before, but noen [sic] to last as long as this one did. This        place is about three miles above the reservoir.                                 Statement of Peter Sanders        Adams Township                I am a farmer and have lived here for five years or more. They call this        the head of Yellow Run. It commenced to rain here on May 30th. It rained        tremendous during the night and next day, the 31th. It rained tremendous        during the night and next day, the 31st, it was something of an unusual        rain. It looked like a cloud burst. I never noticed such heavy rain before.        I have 45 acres of land and one third of it was covered with water. It never        occurred to me before. The water was all along and around my house. The        rain came down very fast and it rushed down the mountain as fast. It looked        like a river going down. This place is the summit. The streams divide here;        one runs north and the other south. The north stream runs into South Fork        reservoir, and the South one into Stony Creek. The rain washed all of my        potatoes out of my field, and also dug deep cuts into the field. This place        is three miles and a half above the reservoir.                                 Statement of F. N. George        of Lilly                I have been a Justice of the Peace, and have lived here at Lilly for sixty        years. On Decoration Day about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, it commenced        to rain moderately, but during the night, it poured down hard. Bear Rock        Creek was very high. It was never so high for the last fifty years. It joins        Laurel Creek right below toward the mill of Simon. Conard, and they both        then form the Little Conemaugh River, which runs down the mountain. There        were four bridges carried away, and the Borough loss will be about two thousand        dollars. This rain was something unprecedented. It rained all day the 31st.        The water went rushing down the stream.                                 Statement of J. Conrad        of Lilly                I keep a general store, and live at Lilly. On May 30th, it commenced to        rain, and during the night it rained very hard. The next morning, the water        was very high in the Little Conemaugh; I don't know the exact height of        the water, but it was the highest I have ever sen here. I have been here        since 1879. Several bridges were washed away. I don't recollect of ever        seeing the river so high. This stream runs to South Fork and connects with        South Fork river.                                 Statement of Simon Conrad        of Lilly                I am a miller and live at Lilly. My mill is at the road crossing, and Little        Conemaugh river below Lilly station. On May 30th, 1889, about four o'clock        in the afternoon it rained for an hour. About nine or ten that night it        rained very hard. When I got up in the morning, the water was about eight        feet high in the river. Laurel Creek and Bear Rock Creek meet above here        toward Lilly station and form the Little Conemaugh, and this stream runs        right down to South Fork. I never saw the water as high. About 8 a. m. on        the 31st of May, itwas [sic] at its height, about eight or ten feet. It        rained all day and the water only went down four feet. It rained all day        and the water only went down four feet. The water carried away four bridges,        and did considerable damage to fences. The water rushed very fast down the        stream.                                 Statement of C. A. McGorigle        of Lilly                I keep a store and live at the fork of Bear Rock Creek, and have lived here        all my life. On May 30th, 1889, it commenced to drizzle rain in the afternoon.        After nightfall, it commenced to rain heavy, and came down in torrents.        The water was about ten feet high in the creek. I never saw it so high,        but I have heard them say it was very high in the year 1857 or 1860. It        did some damage that time. They call this up here the head of the Conemaugh.        I lost all my potatoes and corn. I guess it will be about $1000.00. Bear        Rock Creek and Laurel Creek run into each other below here, and they both        form the Conemaugh river, and run towards South Fork.                                 Statement of Edw. Sweeney        of Lilly                I am a coal miner and live here at Bear Rock Creek, Lilly. I have lived        here about four years. It commenced to drizzle rain here during the afternoon        of May 30th, and during the night it rained very hard. We were woke up by        the neighbors about six o'clock the next morning, and found all around our        house flooded with water. Our house then was about eighteen feet from the        creek. Now, you see where the water washed out and has made a different        course. We are now fifty feet away from it. I cannot tell how high the water        was, but I have never seen it as high since I have lived here. This creek        runs down and connects with Laurel Creek below Lilly station and they then        form the Conemaugh and run to South Fork. The water went rushing down the        creek.                                 Statement of Mrs. Mary Edwards        of Lilly                I live at what is called Bear Rock Creek. My husband is a coal miner. I        have lived here for over five years. On May 30th, it commenced to drizzle        in the afternoon, and during the night it rained very hard. It was a heavy        steady rain. This creek runs into Laurel Creek right below here, and they        both form the Little Conemaugh. The water was about six feet high over the        average. It washed the road bridge away and also the railroad bridge that        runs into the coal mine. On account of the rise of the water, I thought        of poor Johnstown. The water commenced to rise here on May 31st, about 4.30        a. m. I never saw the water so high as it was. They call this the head waters        of the Conemaugh.                                 Statement of Mrs. J. Leap        of Bens Creek                I keep a general merchandise store and have lived at Bens Creek for about        forty-two years. On May 30th, it commenced to rain during the afternoon,        and during the night it rained very hard. I never saw it rain so hard. The        next day the water was very high. It commenced to come down the side of        the railroad track at Lilly station. The cteek [sic] broke up the road,        and had the roadbed of the railroad gave way, the water would have washed        out all the places below; that is, Portage and Wilmore. The water on the        side of the roadbed was about forty feet deep. The stream here is called        the Little Conemaugh. Bens Creek runs into this stream right below. I never        knew it to rain so much in such a short time, and I never saw the water        as high before. This stream runs to South Fork, and connects with South        fork river at that place, and then they bo th [sic] run towards Johnstown.                                 Statement of Jacob S. Keel        of Portage                I am a farmer and have lived here at Portage about thirty years. On Thursday        May 30th, it commenced to rain during the afternoon, and during the night        it rained very hard. It was the heaviest rain that h as [sic] occurred here        for thirty years. The next day thewater [sic] was very high. I could not        tell the exact height, but it covered thirty-five acres of my land, and        destroyed all my potatoes and grass. This stream is cald [sic] the Little        Conemaugh, and flows into the Conemaugh and South Fork rivers, at South        Fork. The water was at its height about noon May 31st, and began to fall        about 3 p. m. The water went a rushing down the stream. There is a dam above        here called Hopper's dam, and the force of the rain broke the dam at the        saide, [sic] and the water ran through it. The water took all the bridges        away except one bridge; it was the iron bridge at the old Portage railroad.                                         Statement of J. G. Piper        of Portage                I am a laborer and have lived here at Portage along the river bank for ten        years. It commenced to rain May 30th, and during the night it poured dwn.        [sic] The next day the water was very high. It almost came up to my house,        which is about 250 yards from the stream. I never saw the water as high        since I lived here. The water was at its height about noon, and began to        fall about 2 o'clock on the 31st. It rained all that day. They call this        the Little Conemaugh River. It runs and connects with the Conemaugh and        South Fork rivers at South Fork. The water ran down the stream at a rapid        gait.                                 Statement of H. W. Plotner        of Wilmore                I am 69 years of age, and have lived here at Wilmore for 26 years. I keep        drug store. It commenced to rain during the afternoon of the 30th , 1889.        It kind of drizzled, but during the evening, it rained tremendous heavy.        I never knew anything like it before. The lower part of town was covered        with water--the [sic] part towards the railroad station. The water was about        four feet high on the bank part. There are two small streams that meet here.        They are both called the Conemaugh. One comes down the mountain from Portage        and the other from Ebensburg. Out bridge is a very high one and it was saved        by being tied. There were several mill dams washed away on the stream that        comes from Ebensburg. I never knew of so much rain to fall in such a short        time.                                 Statement of Wallace Sherbine        of Wilmore                I liver here at Wilmore and keep a general merchandise store. I have lived        here for three years, but I have been coming here for 16 years. It commenced        to rain here on the afternoon ofMay [sic] 30th, 1889, and during [sic] the        evening it rained very hard. I never saw it rain so hard or so long. I never        knew the water to be so high. There are two streams that connect here. They        are both called the Conemaugh. One comes down from Portage and the other        from Ebensburg. The lower part of the town was flooded and some families        had to mve [sic] their household goods. Settlemyer's mill dam on the stream        from Ebensburg broke. Had Hopper's dam on the stream from Portage b roke        it would have washed everything away from here. The water was at its height        about nine a% m. [sic] on the 31st, and about 12 noon, it began to fall        rapidly. The stream was running at a full gait. The river runs to South        Fork and there connects with the South Fork river.                                 Statement of J. D. Plummer        of Summerhill                I keep a general merchandise store, and have lived here since 1847. It commenced        to rain here on the afternoon of May 30th, 1889, and during the night it        rained very hard. I have seen the water high here in 1847, but there was        not as many houses along the river then. The waters never before washed        out anything, but this time it washed everything in reach. The mill dam        here was washed away, and some stables and quantities of fence. This rain        and high water was something unprecedented. They call this stream the Conemaugh.        It runs down to South Fork and meets the South Fork river there.                                 Statement of Daniel Sipe        of Summerhill                I am a miller and have a mill and liver here for 20 years. It commenced        to rain here the afternoon of May 30th, 1889. It only drizzled, but during        the night it rained very hard. On the next morning, May 31st, the place        was flooded. The water was the highest I ever saw. It was nine feet high        running over the dam. The water generally was only two to four inches high        on the dam before the flood came. At about 7 a. m. on the 31st, the water        commenced to rise and by 11 a. m. it was at the highest. The dam was washed        out by the water eating at the side of the dam. If the dam had no broke,        my mill would have been washed away. We never had such a flood here before.        The water covered the landportion [sic] about four feet. The dam here was        a good one, and solid. It was an extraordinary rain. If the dam had not        broke, the reservoir would not have broke. They call this the Conemaugh,        and it leads into the South Fork River at South Fork. I never seen the water        rush down the stream so. Well, when this dam could not stand, no other one        could.                                 Statement of Peter Brown        of Summerhill                I am a sh oemaker [sic] and I have resided here for 37 years. It commenced        to rain on the afternoon of May 30th, 1889. I did not hear it raining all        night because I slept very sound. When I awoke on the morn ing [sic] of        May 31st, I found the place flooded that it aroused the river. I have seen        high water here before, but that was on account of an ice gorge. I also        seen the water high when there would be a big shower, but the water would        soon run off. This is the highest that I ever seen the water at this place.        I seen one time, I think in 1857, it was very high; of course there was        not so many houses following or close to the stream then as there are now.        There is a dam right below here, and it broke. The water was at its height        at di nner [sic] time, and it was washing down the stream. Yes, it was shooting        along and there was two stables and an ice house washed away. When the dam        broke, it washed away the iron bridge leading from here to South Fork. I        never saw so much rain in so short a time and to last so long. I have seen        heavy shower but none like this. They call this the Conemaugh river. It        connects at South Fork with the South Fork river.                                 Statement of Geo. B. Stineman        of South Fork                I keep a general merchandise store and have lived here at South Fork all        my life, you might say. It commenced to rain on May 30th, 1889, about 4        o'clock in the afternoon, and during the night it rained very hard. I never        saw it rain so hard. It rained very steady all night. The water was running        very rapid in both streams. I never knew either of the streams to be so        high as they were on Friday, May 31st, and I never knew so much rain to        fall in so short a time as there was at this time. That stream coming down        here on the north is called the Conemaugh. It comes down from Summerhill        and that stream on the south is called the South Fork. It comes down from        the reservoir or dam. I have lived here 21 years and I never seen anything        like it. The water was the highest sometime in the afternoon--don't know        the exact time.                                 Statement of Wendall Coyle        of South Fork                I have lived here for 17 years. I am mining boss for Euclid Coal Co.. On        May 30th, 1889, it commenced to rain about 11 o'clock p. m. and it rained        all that night all that night and next day. I have seen it rain hard, but        never saw it rain so steady and so long. It was a continuous hard rain.        I never saw the water raise so fast in so short a time. When I came to work        on the morning of May 31st, the water was higher than ever I saw it on both        rivers. South Fork river banks were over flowing and land covered with water.        That I had never saw before. There was a house stood between the South Fork        and Conemaugh rivers surrounded by water in the morning before 7 o'clock.        I cannot say exactly how high the water was before the dam broke. The dam        broke about 3 o'clock p. m. May 31st.                                 Statement of D. W. Luke        of South Fork                I am in the coal business at South Fork. I have lived here 15 years. I never        saw the rivers to high here as they were on May s1st, [sic] 1889. The summer        had been very wet and there was a great deal of rain previous to the flood.        I have seen it rain a great deal harder but it did not last so long. There        werepeople [sic] who moved out of their houses here that water never reached        before. I cannot tell the depth of the water before the dam broke.                                 Statement of Dr. J C. Luke        of South Fork                I have lived in this vicinity for 20 years. I never saw the rivers here        so high as they wereon [sic] May 31st, 1889. It had been raining every day        for about 20 days previous, and on May 30th, 1889, it rained all night and        on the morning of the 31st, I went down to the South Fork river and I had        never saw it so high. The banks were overflowed. That was about 9 a. m.        on the 31st. About 12.30 p. m. the water was at its highest pitch. I think        it was 12 feet in the channel.                                 Statement of N. R. George        of South Fork                I am a merchant and have lived here for 30 years. On the night of May 30th,        1889, I awoke up and heard it rain very hard. In the morning when I got        up itwas [sic] still raining and it rained continually all forenoon. At        12 o'clock a. m. the 31st, the banks of both rivers were overflowing. I        cannot say what the height of the water was. I saw Little Conemaugh river        once before as high. It was either in 1853 or 1859. I never saw South Fork        stream so high before. I think the dam broke before 3 p. m. on May 31st,        1889.

Elevation of the Lower Elwha River and Water in Bosco Well 33    SUMMARY    This water quality appendix is one of a series of supporting documents prepared as part of efforts to restore the ecosystem and fisheries of the Elwha River, located on the Olympic Peninsula in northwest Washington State. In the early 1900’s, two dams were constructed on the river, blocking salmon and steelhead access to about 93 percent of the spawning and rearing habitat. Public Law 102-495, the Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act, passed in 1992, directs the Secretary of the Interior to study ways to restore the anadromous fisheries and the ecosystem of the Elwha River and to implement a plan to accomplish that. The Act states that the Secretary is to take actions as necessary to implement:  "" ¼  protection of the existing quality and availability of water from the Elwha River for municipal and industrial uses from possible adverse impacts of dam removal.""  In 1995, the National Park Service, the lead Federal agency in this restoration effort, published a programmatic Environmental Impact Statement on alternatives for restoration of the fishery. Removal of the two existing dams was selected as the preferred alternative and led to preparation of an implementation Environmental Impact Statement which evaluated two alternatives for sediment management. The proposed alternative is the River Erosion Alternative which would allow sediment accumulated in the reservoir areas of the two dams to be eroded and move downstream through natural fluvial processes. An alternative is the Dredge and Slurry alternative which would include dredging and transporting a portion of the accumulated fine sediment by pipeline to the Strait of Juan De Fuca.   At present, water quality of the Elwha River downstream from the two dams is generally excellent except for water temperature problems. However, there are intermittent periods of high flow, usually with durations of less than 3 days, when large amounts of sediment from the upper reaches are transported downstream. Although larger sized materials (bedload) and much of the finer materials are trapped in the two reservoirs, a portion of the fine suspended solids are transported downstream past the dams to the Strait of Juan De Fuca. Water in the two reservoirs tends to absorb heat in the summer months, resulting in downstream water temperatures that are higher than would occur in the absence of the two reservoirs.         WATER QUALITY CHANGES    Removal of the two dams would allow sediment loads from upstream to move downstream to the ocean. In the short-term (a period of up to 5 years during and after removal of the dams), the largest changes in water quality would be associated directly with dam removal activities. The amounts of fine suspended material in the water downstream would be highly variable, depending on flow levels and dam removal activities. Fine sediment concentrations would generally be much higher than currently experienced, and there would be intermittent periods of 1 to 3 days when large amounts of sediment would be eroded from the reservoir areas and carried downstream. The short-term period, also referred to as the construction (dam removal) period and project operation period, would last until all easily eroded sediment in the reservoir areas is carried downstream. Water quality parameters that could be adversely affected by a significant amount include suspended and dissolved solids, including total organic carbon; turbidity; dissolved oxygen content; and temperature.   Over the long term, natural processes would be restored and sediments would move downstream to the lower reaches, particularly during high flow events. The movement of all materials to the lower reaches of the river would be, on average, greater than now occurs. During low flows, the movement of materials would be no greater than now occurs. During high flow events, the movement would be greater than at present, but peak concentrations of fine suspended sediment would be much less than during the short-term period. Water quality parameters that over the long term could be adversely affected by a significant amount include suspended and dissolved solids, including total organic carbon and turbidity. Dissolved oxygen content would not be affected and water temperatures would improve. Tables A and B summarize anticipated surface water quality changes.   Removing the two dams would affect ground-water quantity and quality in some areas. Ground-water levels now supported by the two reservoirs will drop as the reservoirs are emptied. The water in wells hydraulically connected to the river may at times become more turbid and have higher concentrations of iron and manganese as the quality of the surface water changes. The more direct the hydraulic connection, the greater the effect will be. Movement of bedload materials downstream will raise the streambed which will increase the elevation of the normal water surface, increase flood elevations, and raise ground-water levels. In the lower valley, the rising ground water will affect some septic systems.                       Table A.

Some individual wells will go dry and other individual wells may observe higher levels of turbidity and concentrations of iron and manganese. Domestic water supplies for the Dry Creek Water Association, the city of Port Angeles, and possibly the Elwha Place Home Owners Association will be adversely affected, mostly over the short term. The city of Port Angeles industrial water supply (surface water) — utilized by two pulp mills, Daishowa America Co. Ltd., Inc. and Rayonier, Inc., and the Washington Department of Fish and Game (WDFW) fish rearing channel — will be adversely affected over both the short and long terms. Water supplies for the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe’s fish hatchery of will be affected over both the short and long terms. In the short term, the quality of the surface water supply will be unsuitable for operation of the WDFW fish rearing channel. Under the Elwha Fish Restoration Plan, this facility will be closed and rearing of Elwha stocks will be carried out in other facilities during the period of unacceptable water quality.   Subsequent to the preparation of this report, Rayonier’s Port Angeles mill was closed. Efforts are currently underway to attract industry to Port Angeles to replace the jobs lost with the mill closing. Future Rayonier water measurement and monitoring activities anticipated in this report will likely be accomplished instead by the city of Port Angeles, Daishowa America, or any entities which replace Rayonier as an industrial water user. Industrial water treatment measures proposed in this report assume that local entities will be successful in recruiting new industry to the area and that this industry will utilize the same quantities of water historically used by Rayonier.   At this stage of planning, general concepts have been identified, measures selected, and costs estimated. Evaluations to date are sufficient to provide a cost ceiling, but specific measures will be reviewed and refined during the design and value engineering phases. This process, along with negotiations with affected entities, will likely result in some changes. In addition, some baseline data are still being collected and the results could affect the design of mitigation measures. Table C summarizes the entities that would be affected by water quality changes due to removal of the two dams and the measures identified for implementation to mitigate the adverse effects. A water quality monitoring program during dam removal will provide information to help make decisions on the rate of removal.                       Table C.

The total construction cost includes indirect costs associated with design of facilities and construction management. The total construction cost of the measures selected to mitigate water quality changes is estimated at $31,015,000 for the River Erosion alternative and $27,895,000 for the Dredge and Slurry alternative.   Although the cost of the water quality monitoring program is shown in the table, the cost is not included in the total construction cost for water quality mitigation. The water quality monitoring program will provide information to adjust the rate of dam removal. Construction costs are summarized in Table D.         OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, AND POWER COSTS    Operation, maintenance, and power costs include all costs of operating project facilities during the short term (5-year period of dam removal and major erosion of sediments from the reservoir areas). Although some facilities would remain in place and continue to be operated beyond the short term, operation after the short term is not considered part of mitigation for dam removal. Because of the short operating period, replacement was not considered and no replacement costs are included. Power costs are based on current rates to users in the Port Angeles area.   The total cost for operation, maintenance, and power during the project operation period is estimated at $3,400,000 for the River Erosion alternative and $1,204,000 for the Dredge and Slurry alternative.

CHAPTER I.  INTRODUCTION          BACKGROUND OF STUDY    In the early 1900's, two hydroelectric dams were constructed on the Elwha River on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State. Construction of Elwha Dam at river mile (RM) 4.9 began in 1910. Construction of Glines Canyon Dam at RM 13.4 began in 1926. Both dams were constructed without fish passage facilities and block the passage of anadromous fish that historically used the river for spawning.   In 1968, the owner and operator of the dams (Crown Zellerbach Corporation) submitted an application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to license Elwha Dam and, in 1973, applied to relicense Glines Canyon Dam. FERC proceeded with licensing activities and processed the two licenses together. Licensing the two dams became controversial for a number of reasons including a challenge in the 1980’s that FERC did not have jurisdiction to relicense Glines Canyon Dam because the dam is located within Olympic National Park.   Somewhat complicating the licensing procedures was purchase of the assets of Crown Zellerbach Corporation by James River Corporation. These assets included Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams and a pulp and paper mill located in the city of Port Angeles. The mill was subsequently sold to Daishowa America Co., Ltd. (Daishowa). At present, James River Corporation owns the two dams; however, Daishowa operates the two dams and powerplants and receives the power under contract with James River Corporation. The generation supplies a portion of the power needed to operate the Daishowa mill.   To resolve issues related to the two dams, Congress passed legislation in 1992 — Public Law 102–495, the Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act (Act). The Act directs the Secretary of the Interior to study ways to fully restore the Elwha River ecosystem and native anadromous fisheries, including purchase and removal of the dams, and to submit a report to Congress. The Secretary’s report,  The Elwha Report  (Interior, et al., 1994), determined that removing the dams was feasible and necessary to fully restore the fisheries and ecosystem. Environmental impacts of a full range of alternatives were discussed in the  Elwha River Ecosystem Restoration — Final Environmental Impact Statement  (National Park Service, 1995). This document is referred to as the programmatic environmental impact statement (EIS).   A final implementation environmental impact statement (National Park Service, 1996b) was prepared to give the Secretary a range of options to implement removal of both dams. Those options focus on management of sediment that has accumulated in Lake Aldwell and Lake Mills (impounded by Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams, respectively). Three alternatives are presented in the implementation EIS — the No Action alternative (the dams remain in place), the proposed action (River Erosion alternative), and a second action option (Dredge and Slurry alternative). The No Action alternative forms the basis for identifying baseline conditions used to measure the impacts of the two action alternatives. With the River Erosion alternative, most trapped sediments would be eroded by the river and carried to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. With the Dredge and Slurry alternative, most fine (silt- and clay-sized) sediments would be dredged from the lake beds and transported by slurry pipeline to the Strait; the remainder of the fine sediment and the coarser sediment would be eroded by the river and carried downstream.   Protection of existing quality and availability of water for municipal and industrial use is required by the Act.         REPORT FOCUS AND PROBLEM ADDRESSED    This technical report is a supporting document to the implementation EIS which addresses removal of Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams. Information about issues less central to this report is provided only to the extent necessary for reader understanding. Additional information can be found in the programmatic and implementation EIS’s and associated technical supporting documents.   This document summarizes findings concerning the large amounts of sediment that have accumulated within the impoundments formed by Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams. When the dams are removed, a portion of the accumulated sediment will erode through natural processes and be transported downstream to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The amount of material and the type of sediment that would be transported downstream differs with the two action alternatives. With the River Erosion alternative, sediments would be eroded by natural processes and carried downstream at varying concentrations as the natural flow of the river changes. With the Dredge and Slurry alternative, most finer sediments would be transported by slurry pipeline, leaving some fine and all coarser materials to be eroded by natural processes.   With either alternative, the concentration of fine suspended materials in the Elwha River will increase, at times, by several hundred or a thousand fold. There is some evidence that the concentration of some dissolved minerals may increase. Although increased concentrations of suspended and dissolved solids concentrations will not present health hazards, suspended solids will present mechanical and chemical problems for industrial uses, and possibly for municipal and domestic uses. Measures are needed to reduce the concentrations to acceptable levels for each use. In addition, the transport and deposition of sediment downstream through natural processes will raise the riverbed (returning it to the predam level) and change flooding patterns and the elevation of ground water near the river. This could affect water quality, especially with respect to the flooding of wells and septic systems in those areas where the ground water is already close to the surface.   Studies were conducted to identify baseline conditions including water quality, amount of water available and used, and water users in the study area. Measures to protect water quality and the availability of water to users were identified, evaluated, and selected for implementation.   STUDY AREA AND SETTING    The Elwha River basin is the major drainage on the northern side of the Olympic Mountains, draining an area of approximately 321 square miles, 83 percent of which is located within Olympic National Park. The U-shaped glaciated valley trends north to northwest from the central Olympic Mountains to Freshwater Bay in the Strait of Juan de Fuca.   The lower river basin consists of sloping bedrock formations which are locally covered by glacial and non-glacial deposits. The Elwha River has incised these deposits, with recently-deposited alluvium partially filling the valley floor. The alluvium within the Elwha River valley consists primarily of sand and gravel and serves as the water supply aquifer for most community water systems in the area. Water levels in the aquifer and the river are generally consistent with one another, indicating that the two systems are probably hydraulically connected. The alluvial aquifer is of excellent chemical quality according to monitoring conducted by community water supply systems in the valley.   The surface-water quality of the Elwha River is rated by the Washington Department of Ecology (WDOE) as ""class AA"" (of exceptional quality) but is also on the water quality limited list because of elevated water temperatures. Levels of major cations, anions, metals, pesticides, volatile organic compounds, and radionuclides are below the maximums allowed, and the pH is 6.7 to 10. Most of the watershed is within the national park and is in pristine condition. The two reservoirs capture much of the sediment from upstream erosion, but store heat during late summer and early fall and cause an increase in water temperatures in the middle and lower river reaches.   The study area for this report is generally the Elwha River basin downstream from the upper end of Lake Mills at RM 16.2. However, most effects of dam removal would be downstream from the border of the Olympic National Park at RM 9.7. Ground-water studies were generally limited to the area from RM 9.7 to the mouth of the river and from the city limits of Port Angeles on the east to the edge of the drainage basin on the west. This general area encompasses the following townships, ranges, and sections:   §  T31N, R7W, Sections 26, 27, 32–36;   §  T30N, R7W, Sections 1–5, 8–17, 21, 22, 27–29, 32, 33;   §  T29N, R7W, Sections 4, 5, 8, 9, 16, 17.   All of the population and water uses that would be affected by removal of Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams are located in the lower part of the river basin. Most of the population is located within the city of Port Angeles and on the Lower Elwha Klallam Reservation.   Table 1 shows the general location along the Elwha River of many of the facilities and features discussed in this report.           Table 1.

The major laws are summarized below.      §   Safe Drinking Water Act  — controls requirements and standards for public drinking water supplies.   §   Washington Department of Ecology  and  Washington Department of Health  — drinking water regulations apply to water supplies.   §   Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act  — protection of existing quality and availability of water from the Elwha River for municipal and industrial uses from possible adverse impacts of dam removal.   §   Clean Water Act  — controls discharge to navigable waterways and discharge permits   §   Washington Department of Ecology 173–201A WAC  (Washington Administrative Code) — establishes water quality standards for surface waters consistent with public health and enjoyment thereof, and the propagation and protection of fish, shellfish and wildlife including anti-degradation policy             COORDINATION    The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) met early in the planning process with representatives of the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe (Tribe), Elwha Place Homeowners Association (EPHA), Dry Creek Water Association (DCWA), Daishowa, Rayonier Inc., and the city of Port Angeles. To the extent possible, individual well owners along the Elwha River were contacted. The meetings and contacts were held to share information being developed and collected by Reclamation, to determine local concerns regarding potential water quality degradation, and to obtain local input for possible water quality mitigation measures. Individual points of contact within various Federal, State, and local agencies were established to assist communications.   Subsequent to the preparation of this report, Rayonier’s Port Angeles mill was closed. Efforts are currently underway to attract industry to Port Angeles to replace the jobs lost with the mill closing. Future Rayonier water measurement and monitoring activities anticipated in this report will likely be accomplished instead by the city of Port Angeles, Daishowa, or any entities which replace Rayonier as an industrial water user. Industrial water treatment measures proposed in this report assume that local entities will be successful in recruiting new industry to the area and that this industry will utilize the same quantities of water historically used by Rayonier.   Reclamation provided presentations and technical expertise at the public workshops on the draft programmatic EIS held in Port Angeles and Seattle in December 1994. Reclamation also participated in the 1995 public workshops on the draft implementation EIS.         NOTE ON ELEVATIONS AND OTHER SURVEY DATA    Survey data on maps and drawings prepared by various agencies for the existing facilities and other features in the area of Port Angeles show sharp discrepancies. Those discrepancies are caused by various agencies using different horizontal and vertical starting points called datums. The city of Port Angeles, until recently, used local datums, and Federal agencies use a variety of other datums.   Unless otherwise noted, all elevations provided in this report are based on the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD ’88). Old city datums are about 2 feet higher than the current standards. Horizontal coordinates are based on the Washington Coordinate System, North Zone, Datum of 1983, with the 1991 adjustments.     CHAPTER II.  CURRENT CONDITIONS          GEOLOGIC SETTING    The lower Elwha River basin consists of sloping bedrock formations which are locally mantled by younger unconsolidated deposits. The bedrock formations impede the flow of ground water and define the base and the boundaries of the unconsolidated hydrogeologic system, which is the primary zone for ground water. Wells completed within the bedrock formations are typically dependent upon localized fracture zones to supply usable quantities of water, and bedrock is not generally a significant source of water supply in this area.   Bedrock exposures dominate the Elwha River basin from upper portions of the drainage to the Lake Aldwell area. Unconsolidated deposits are exposed at the surface and mantle the bedrock in most areas downstream from Lake Aldwell. Projections derived from well drilling records suggest that the bedrock is covered by about 300 feet of unconsolidated material near the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Bedrock formations include the Eocene Crescent, Aldwell, Lyre, and Twin River units.   The Crescent Formation is primarily marine basalt, occurring as massive flows with pillows, breccia, and minor sandstone. The Crescent Formation is found mainly along the middle reach of the river between Lake Mills and Lake Aldwell, but it also forms the foundation for Glines Canyon Dam. In addition, there is a small outcrop of Crescent Formation at RM 2.8 which, to some extent, controls the river channel and aquifers in the lower river.   The Aldwell Formation, primarily siltstone with minor sandstone and conglomerate, is found along the southeast side of Lake Aldwell in a small exposure. The Lyre Formation conglomerate is exposed at the bend in Lake Aldwell, at RM 6.0.   The lower member of the Twin River Formation forms the foundation for the abutments and powerhouse of Elwha Dam. The thin-bedded sandstone with minor siltstone and pebble conglomerate is exposed in the riverbed from RM 5.0 to RM 4.1 and also at RM 3.2, where a one-lane bridge crosses the river.   Bedrock formations in the lower Elwha basin were folded and faulted during the uplift events which formed the Olympic Mountains. The Hurricane Ridge fault, a major regional structure, separates the Olympic ""core rocks"" from the ""peripheral rocks"" and crosses the valley of the Elwha River at RM 14, ½ mile upstream from Glines Canyon Dam. Other smaller faults have been mapped (USGS, 1978a) across the lower Elwha drainage. Folding of the peripheral rocks created a syncline (a U-shaped fold) with an axis perpendicular to the river valley near RM 4. On the south leg of the fold, near Elwha Dam, the conglomerate beds strike approximately N 50 °  W and dip 15 °  to 20 °  N. On the north leg of the fold, near the one-lane bridge, the beds have a similar strike but dip about 35 °  S. This structure may create a thickened alluvial aquifer between RM 3.1 and 4.0. This observation agrees with the findings outlined in Harza (1992), which describes the lower Elwha ground-water system as a series of three sub-basins separated by sills.   BASIN HYDROGEOLOGY    Unconsolidated units collectively comprise the hydrogeologic system of the lower Elwha River basin. This system generally extends from the Indian Creek Valley area upstream from Lake Aldwell to the mouth of the Elwha River. The unconsolidated deposits of the lower basin include the primary ground-water supply and the materials deposited adjacent to the river.   Primary Hydrogeologic Units    A sequence of Holocene age, glacial, and non-glacial deposits comprise the unconsolidated hydrogeologic system. The older glacial and non-glacial units were deposited first, covering the bedrock surface which slopes downward toward the north. The Elwha River valley is incised into these deposits, with recently deposited alluvium partially filling the valley floor. The present topography of the lower Elwha basin reflects this geologic sequence, with glaciated uplands bounding the deeply cut channel of the Elwha River. The following descriptions include the abbreviated unit name (in parentheses) for reference to information in appendix A. Appendix A includes drawings with information on the topography, geology, hydrogeology, and well locations. Appendix B summarizes Clallam County well logs.   Recent Alluvium (Qal)    The alluvium within the Elwha River floodplain consists primarily of sand and gravel with silty zones and serves as the primary aquifer in this area. Most community supply systems — the city of Port Angeles Ranney Method Western Corporation (Ranney) collector and the wells for DCWA, EPHA, and the Tribe — draw from the alluvial aquifer. The topographic contours and geologic information presented in appendix A show that the Elwha River flows through a series of alluvium-filled sub-basins, which are separated by bedrock exposures or constrictions in the surrounding glacial deposits. The subbasins consist of:      §  The Lake Aldwell subbasin near the confluence of Indian Creek, Little River, and the Elwha River;   §  The upper subbasin between RM 4.0 and 3.1, which is about 60 acres and includes the DCWA wells;   §  The middle subbasin between RM 3.1 and 2.8, which is about 70 acres and includes the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) fish rearing channel, the industrial supply diversion, and the Port Angeles Ranney collector;   §  The lower subbasin between RM 2.8 and the mouth at the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which is about 1,100 acres and includes the Tribal and EPHA wells.      The lateral extent of the river-deposited alluvium is restricted to the incised river valley bounded by the relatively steep bedrock and glacial-deposit bluffs. Drilling records indicate that the alluvium is about 55 feet thick in the middle basin and about 100 feet thick near the river mouth. Limited drilling records and inferences drawn from the bedrock structure (folding and faulting) suggest that alluvium in the upper basin is at least 70 feet thick.   Recessional Glacial Outwash (Qg 1 )    Recessional glacial outwash consists of sand and gravel exposed at the surface on top of the bluffs near the mouth of the Elwha River. The deposits are relatively thin (less than 20 feet) and unsaturated in these areas. The unit does not serve as a water supply source but is used as a borrow source for several local gravel mining operations.   Glacial Till (Qg 2 )    Glacial till is exposed at the ground surface over most of the upland area bounding the valley of the Elwha River. The till is composed of compacted, non-stratified sand, gravel, and cobbles in a fine-grained matrix. The unit was encountered in virtually all upland wells with typical thicknesses of 50–150 feet. An excellent exposure of this deposit exists on the west side of the Elwha River, approximately 0.5 mile from the mouth. The bluff is over 100 feet high and is nearly vertical.   Relatively few wells are completed within the till, which is not generally considered a productive aquifer. Wells that are completed in the till (at depths of 150 feet or less) yield small quantities of water when localized pockets of clean sand and gravel are encountered. Reported well yields are typically less than 20 gallons per minute (gpm) and service individual users. The available information does not identify an interval within the till capable of supporting larger water system demands.   Non-Glacial Deposits (Qn 1 )    In most areas of the lower basin, drilling records identified a clayey deposit 20 to 50 feet thick. The fine-grained, gray material is likely non-glacial, perhaps originating as a marine deposit during an interglacial period. This unit does not yield appreciable quantities of ground water for supply purposes.   Older Glacial Deposits (Qg 3 )    The deepest glacial unit identified from drilling records for the lower basin is an outwash sequence overlying the bedrock surface. The outwash consists primarily of sand with lesser amounts of silt and gravel. The unit was most frequently encountered in the lower portions of the basin, where maximum thicknesses of 100 to 150 feet were identified. The unit apparently becomes thinner toward the south, in the vicinity of the middle basin. Drilling records from upland-area wells in this area either went from till directly into bedrock or penetrated less than 50 feet of the older glacial material.   A number of wells are completed in these glacial deposits or in the upper portion of bedrock, which is probably hydraulically connected with the glacial deposits. The wells service individual users and generally report yields of less than 20 gpm.   Hydraulic Properties    Variability in composition and origin of the primary hydrogeologic units identified in the lower basin affects the ability of each unit to transmit ground water. In general, the alluvium and the older glacial deposits are aquifers which are relatively coarse grained, exhibit greater permeability than other aquifers, and can supply usable quantities of water. In contrast, the glacial till and the non-glacial deposits are predominantly fine-grained confining layers which do not readily transmit ground water and produce usable quantities of water only where localized sandy zones are encountered. Available information describing the hydraulic properties of these units is presented in this section; most information describes conditions within the alluvium where testing data were collected from public water supply systems.   Specific Capacity    The specific capacity of a well is its yield per unit of drawdown during pumping and is generally expressed in gallons per minute per foot of drawdown (gpm/foot). The average specific capacity of wells completed in the alluvium is much higher than reported values for wells completed in the upland areas that flank the valley. The specific capacity records for wells completed in the alluvium are typically greater than 10 gpm/foot and range to more than 100 gpm/foot. In contrast, wells completed in the upland areas generally report specific capacities of 5 gpm/foot or less.   Well Yields    Sustainable pumping rates for wells completed in the upland areas are generally less than 20 gpm. Wells completed in the alluvium have highly variable yields, but larger diameter completions have yields ranging from 100 to 1,000 gpm.   Aquifer Transmissivity    Transmissivity is the rate at which water is transmitted through an aquifer, or more specifically for well users, the amount of water that can be pumped from a well with a specific drop in water level. Pumping tests completed at several well sites within the alluvium indicate that the aquifer transmissivity, which is measured in gallons per day per foot of drawdown (gpd/foot), is high. Equivalent information has not been identified for wells completed in the uplands areas bounding the Elwha River. Sources of aquifer testing information include several ground-water studies of the potential for development of water supplies for the Tribal fish hatchery (Dames and Moore, 1989a), the WDFW rearing channel (Harza, 1992; Robinson and Knoble, 1995), and city of Port Angeles Ranney collector (Ranney, 1977 and 1994). Pumping test data were also obtained from a DCWA well-installation report.   Aquifer testing indicates that the transmissivity of the alluvium generally increases down-river. A transmissivity of 75,000 gpd/foot was estimated from DCWA data in the upper basin, whereas a higher value of 100,000 gpd/foot was calculated from data collected in the middle basin at the WDFW fish rearing channel. Studies completed at the Tribal hatchery in the lower basin estimate transmissivity of about 400,000 gpd/foot. Storativity, a technical measure of the storage capability of an aquifer, was estimated at 1.7 x 10 -3  (a low capability) from the lower basin testing data (Dames and Moore, 1989a).   FLOW OF GROUND WATER    The flow of ground water in the lower Elwha River basin is from the higher elevations in the south toward the north and ultimately into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Flow through the underlying bedrock is restricted to fractures and joints which are typically limited in extent. Therefore, the primary route of flow is through the unconsolidated hydrogeologic system. Water level information from well-drilling logs enables a qualitative assessment of flow patterns through the unconsolidated deposits.   Inferred Flow Direction    Water levels reported by drillers indicate a distinct difference in ground-water occurrence between upland areas and wells completed in the alluvium. These data are included on the cross sections shown in appendix A. Water levels measured in the upland areas are typically 100 to 200 feet higher than the hydraulic head of the alluvial aquifer (see cross sections B-B ¢  and C-C ¢  on drawings 3 and 4 of appendix A. The separation in water levels between these two areas appears to decrease toward the north, as shown in cross section A-A ¢  (drawing 2) which is drawn near the Strait of Juan de Fuca shoreline. These observed water-level patterns indicate that a portion of the ground water flowing through the glacial deposits in the uplands discharges to the valley of the Elwha River, with the remainder of the flow moving toward the north to discharge to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The difference in water-level elevation between the alluvium and the upland areas indicates that gradient reversals could not occur. Therefore, water flowing through the alluvium is not a source of recharge for the upland areas. Fluctuations in river level should not affect the ground-water level beyond the limits of the alluvium.   Within the alluvium, the general direction of flow is toward the north, paralleling the river course. Water levels in the aquifer and the river are generally consistent with each other, indicating that the two systems are in hydraulic connection. Surveyed monitoring points were established to compare hydraulic head measurements in the ground-water system with the river stage. Pumping test data indicates that the Port Angeles Ranney collector and other high-yielding community wells create localized head depressions, drawing ground-water levels below the elevation of the river, and inducing flow toward the wells.   Alluvial Aquifer Discharge    A comparison of the flow of ground water through the alluvium with the current levels of use of ground water indicates that long-term pumping is sustained by recharge from the Elwha River. Based on the aquifer properties estimated from pumping test data, ground water discharges from the middle basin to the lower basin at a rate of approximately 1 to 2 cubic feet per second (cfs). The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that the discharge from the alluvium aquifer to the Strait of Juan de Fuca is about 6 cfs (USGS, 1979). The city of Port Angeles Ranney collector (located in the middle basin) has a reported operating capacity of about 11 cfs (Ranney, 1977), a quantity roughly 10 times greater than the natural flow of ground water through the middle basin.   WATER USERS    For this discussion, the valley of the Elwha River is considered in two parts, the upper and lower valleys. The upper valley extends from the park boundary at RM 9.7 downstream to RM 4.0, where the river emerges from a narrow bedrock canyon below Elwha Dam and where the alluvial floodplain widens and thickens. The lower valley begins at RM 4.0 and extends to the mouth, at the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The lower valley is considered to be composed of three subbasins, an upper subbasin (RM 4.0–3.1), a middle subbasin (RM 3.1–2.8), and a lower subbasin (RM 2.8–0.0).   Upper Elwha River Valley (RM 9.7–4.0)    There has been relatively little ground-water development in the upper valley. Most new housing construction and water wells are to the west of the river valley on a remnant glacial outwash terrace above elevations of 400 feet. The wells average less than 200 feet deep, drawing water from elevations above the level of the Elwha River and Lake Aldwell. A few homes and the Indian Creek Campground are located near the confluence of Indian Creek and the Elwha River at the upstream end of Lake Aldwell. The water levels in these wells are probably influenced by the lake level since they appear to be completed in the permeable alluvium.   Several homes are located on the east side of the Elwha River, south of the Little River tributary (at RM 7.8). The wells for these homes are shallow and the water levels reflect the fluctuating river level. These wells are not expected to be influenced by the level of Lake Aldwell since the bottom elevations of the wells are above the lake elevation. Some wellheads are apparently flooded during high river levels (personal communications with well owners).   Several domestic wells are located near the southeast side of Lake Aldwell. They appear to be completed at a higher elevation than the lake level and draw water from a perched aquifer above the bedrock.   Lower Elwha River Valley (RM 4.0 to Mouth)    Most water use in the Elwha River basin is in the lower valley, below RM 4.0. Several community water systems, industrial supplies, and fish production facilities use the Elwha River directly or use ground water for their sources of water. In addition to the water systems, discussed below, there are individual users in each subbasin. Most private wells are located in the lower subbasin on and near the Lower Elwha Klallam Reservation. Total water use by all individual users is estimated at less than 0.2 cfs.   The city of Port Angeles obtains its municipal water from a Ranney collector located adjacent to the river near RM 2.8. The lateral collecting pipes are nearly 60 feet beneath the river channel in coarse-grained alluvium. Data indicate that the collector is hydraulically connected to the river. The State of Washington generally classifies this relationship as ""ground water under the influence of surface water"" but has not formally made a determination for this Ranney collector.   Dry Creek Water Association    The DCWA was formed and incorporated in 1964 to serve the water needs of residents to the south and west of the city of Port Angeles. As of 1994, the Association included 392 members, of which 349 were residential connections and 43 were commercial connections. There were also 41 inactive residential connections. DCWA serves a population of about 950.   Four wells are located on the east bank of the Elwha River near RM 3.7 (in the SE ¼ of Sec. 10, T30N, R7W). Wells number 1 and 2, constructed in 1964 and 1980, respectively, are large diameter (3 to 4 feet) and about 20 feet deep. Wells number 3 and 4, drilled in 1990 to depths of 42 and 48 feet, respectively, are 12-inch-diameter wells. Well number 4 has been tested but never been put into production. Wells number 1, 2, and 3 are active and the water is chlorinated.   Current pumpage from the DCWA wells averages about 150 gpm. DCWA’s original water right (for well No. 1) was obtained in 1964 for 100 gpm. Additional water rights were obtained in 1980 for a total of 280 gpm (about 0.6 cfs). In 1992, DCWA’s existing water rights were amended to add additional points of withdrawal including pumpage from No. 3. A water right for well number 4 was applied for and is still pending.   The DCWA wells are located 180 to 250 feet from the left bank of the Elwha River. Due to the close proximity of the wells to the river and the shallow well depths, it is likely that at least a portion of the water comes from induced recharge from the river, rather than ground water. The average turbidity of the pumped water is in the range of 0.06 to 0.08 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU). When the river is high and turbid, turbidity in the well water is reported to increase, another indication of river water infiltration.   These structures are subject to flooding under present river conditions. The wells are located at elevation 83 feet. River flood-stage elevations for this reach are in the range of 81 to 83 feet for the 10-year frequency flood and 84 to 87 feet for the 100-year flood. The east bank of the river is being eroded and the bank edge is several feet closer to the wells now than in years past (personal communication from C. Kelly, manager of DCWA).   City of Port Angeles Industrial Supply    The city has a water right to divert 150 cfs of river flow for industrial use and owns an industrial water delivery system. Currently, this system supplies untreated water by gravity to the Daishowa and Rayonier pulp mills and to the WDFW fish rearing channel described in the next section. A rockfill diversion dam (at RM 3.3) directs flow to a diversion tunnel. At the tunnel outlet, the flow is divided to supply a maximum of 50 cfs to the WDFW fish rearing channel and a maximum of 100 cfs to an open channel that leads to a weir and screenhouse which control flow into an industrial pipeline. Excess flow is returned to the river through a wasteway to the river (about RM 2.8).   Under a contract with the city, Rayonier operates and maintains the diversion structure and distribution facilities. Although their contracts are for slightly more than 100 cfs, average usage for the two plants is about 70 cfs. Peak flows are estimated at 55 million gallons per day (mgd) (about 85 cfs) for Rayonier and 12 mgd (about 19 cfs) for Daishowa. Stripchart records of flow, maintained by Rayonier, are measured in the screen house at the downstream end of the existing open conveyance channel. Flow measurements have historically been kept at stations along the pipeline.   Some suspended material settles in the open conveyance channel. Each company treats the water at its mill site, primarily to reduce sediment and turbidity, using chemical addition, flocculation, and filtration. Since the water is diverted directly from the river, any change in surface water quality of the Elwha River affects the mills.   Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Fish Rearing Channel    The rearing channel was constructed in 1975 pursuant to an agreement between the State of Washington Department of Fisheries and Crown Zellerbach Corporation. The facility is located on the east bank of the river from about RM 2.8 to 3.2 (SE ¼ of Sec. 3, T30N, R7W). There are two parallel channels with a total width of about 80 feet and length of 1,400 feet; the total volume is 415,500 cubic feet.   Although the WDFW contract with the city of Port Angeles is for 50 cfs, the average flow to the channel is about 35 cfs. Outflow returns to the river by an open channel at RM 2.8 and is used to attract returning anadromous fish. The facility has upgrade plans to become self-supporting and independent of other WDFW hatcheries for incubation and early-rearing support. WDFW does not expect to require more water in the future than supplied under current arrangements. A ground-water study was conducted in 1992 to provide drought relief measures and provide cooler flow to the rearing channel (Harza, 1992). Two wells were drilled, one was pump-tested, and a plan for additional wells was developed. The plan, which calls for up to 12 wells spaced approximately 100 feet apart and with a discharge rate of 250 gpm each, has not been fully implemented. Three additional wells were drilled and tested in the area of the rearing channel in 1995 and are now being used. The purpose of these wells is to provide cooler, pathogen-free water for the rearing channel. Robinson and Noble (1995) described the drilling and testing project.   The elevation at the WDFW facility is just above 50 feet. A flood study of the Elwha River (FEMA, 1980) indicates that the 100-year flood level is currently about 2.4 feet below the top of the existing rearing facility.   City of Port Angeles Municipal Supply    The primary water source for the city is a Ranney collector located near RM 2.8 on the east bank of the Elwha River in the SE ¼ of Sec. 3, T30N, R7W. The city holds a water right permit for 50 cfs (about 32 mgd) for municipal purposes. In 1992, the average daily demand was 3.8 mgd and the maximum daily demand was 8.4 mgd. As of April 1994, a population of 18,030 was served within the city; 6,225 residential and 993 commercial connections. The city sells an average of 0.14 mgd to the Clallam County Public Utility District, which in 1994 served an additional 2,907 people at 1,163 residential connections. The maximum contract delivery to the Utility District is about 0.4 mgd, but not more than 8 percent of the city supply during conditions of shortage (Clallam County Planning Division, 1994).   The Ranney collector was constructed in 1977 and consists of a large diameter vertical caisson with seven 10¾-inch outside-diameter, horizontal screen laterals projected at elevation of 9.9 feet. The 7 laterals total 528 feet in length and range from 39 to 115 feet long. Pumping facilities in the collector consist of two 600-horsepower pumps rated at 3,700 gpm each (at 530 feet total dynamic head), though the actual pump discharge is slightly greater. A nearby chlorination station treats the water before delivery to city customers.   In 1974, before construction of the collector, a thorough hydrogeological investigation of the site was completed. From the results of test pumping, the yield of one Ranney collector was estimated to be 14.4 mgd under average conditions of river stage and water temperature, decreasing to 11.7 mgd under minimum flow conditions. The results of the 1977 initial performance test of the completed Ranney collector calculated an average yield of 15.7 mgd and a minimum yield of 12.8 mgd with a pumping level elevation of 20 feet (city datum). The performance test report concluded that the collector could readily produce the required water supply of 11.0 mgd (Ranney, 1977).   In 1985, the city observed a decline in collector capacity. The water level would continue to decline with both pumps running until the low-level alarm was reached and one pump would automatically shut-off. Ranney reviewed the city data and concluded that the capacity in 1985 had declined to about 11.0 mgd compared to the initial capacity of 15.7 mgd (Ranney, 1985). The decline appeared to be due to migration of the river channel away from the collector and not due to clogging of the laterals. Ranney suggested that the city take measures to divert more river water into the side channel near the collector to increase recharge to the aquifer in that area. Although there was no evidence of clogging of the horizontal screen laterals, Ranney also suggested that a pumping test be performed to further evaluate possible clogging of the laterals.   In April 1994, the city authorized Ranney to conduct a controlled pumping test to determine the cause of continued capacity decline. An 8-inch-diameter observation well was constructed adjacent to the collector and was used to measure the water level in the aquifer during pumping of the collector. The test measured an operating efficiency of the Ranney collector of 94.9–96.0 percent, which indicates that the screen laterals were not clogged. The test further computed the effective distance to the line of infiltration and found that a significant change in the recharge conditions had occurred since the initial testing in 1977. The report to the city (Ranney, 1994) attributed the changed condition to the loss of river flow in the side channel near the collector and the increased distance to the main channel of the river. The present-day yield of the collector was calculated at 10.7 mgd (with river flow at 1,100 cfs and a temperature of 48  ° F).   Elwha Place Homeowners Association    The EPHA supplies water to about 45 people (19 connections) from 2 wells located on the west side of the Elwha River near RM 1.5 (in the SW ¼ of Sec. 34, T31N, R7W). The wells are located about 750 feet from the river near an old channel. Well number 1, drilled in 1978, is completed in the alluvium and encountered bedrock at a depth of 65 feet. A 4-hour pump test revealed a specific capacity of about 67 gpm/foot. Well No. 2, drilled in 1983, was completed at the same depth as nearby No. 1. The specific capacity of this well was measured at 31.4 gpm/foot. The combined capacity of the two wells is about 186 gpm (0.4 cfs). The water is pumped to a storage tank located on the terrace above the river, at an elevation of about 175 feet, and is not treated before delivery.   The two wells are located at an elevation of 36 feet. River flood-stage elevations in this reach are approximately 31 feet for the 10-year frequency flood, 32 feet for the 200-year flood, and 33.5 feet for the 500-year flood (Corps, 1987; FEMA, 1980). The wells are above currently projected flood stage elevations.   Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe    An increasing number of households within the reservation are switching from private domestic wells to a municipal water supply. Two wells (in the NW ¼ of Sec. 35, T31N, R7W) supply water to about 200 residents. Although drilled in 1976, the wells were not put into production until early 1994. Each well is about 50 feet in depth and completed in alluvium. The well logs record a test yield of about 100 gpm from each well. In a 24-hour pumping test conducted later, each well was pumped at a rate of 55 gpm producing a drawdown of 1.4 feet (a specific capacity of about 39 gpm/foot).   Homes on the reservation in the lower delta area are served by private septic systems. Water-level readings in August 1994 measured the water table at 4 to 17 feet below ground level. Any significant rise in the river stage due to riverbed aggradation could also raise the water table slightly and cause septic system flooding.   Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe Fish Hatchery    The Tribe operates a fish hatchery on Tribal land near the mouth of the Elwha River (NE ¼ of Sec. 34, T31N, R7W). Current water demand for the hatchery is about 11.5 cfs. Expansion plans call for increasing the water use to more than 20 cfs.   An infiltration gallery, located about ½ mile upstream from the hatchery and upgraded in 1989, delivers 7 to 8 cfs of untreated river water to the hatchery by gravity flow. The infiltration gallery consists of 18-inch-inside-diameter, perforated, polyvinyl chloride pipe buried about 10 feet in the riverbed. Increased sedimentation could cause increased river migration from the perforated pipe and adversely affect the capacity of the infiltration gallery.   River water is mixed with approximately 4.5 cfs of ground water supplied by two wells. The east production well, completed in 1977, was initially tested at 2,000 gpm with 28 feet of drawdown; a specific capacity of 71.4 gpm/foot. A performance test conducted in 1989 measured a specific capacity of 58 gpm/foot (Dames and Moore, 1989a). Mineral encrustation of the well screen was thought to have lowered well capacity. The west production well, drilled in 1989, was tested at 1,000 gpm with 17.3 feet of drawdown; a specific capacity of 57.8 gpm/foot. A third well drilled in 1976 (tested in 1989 at a specific capacity of 34 gpm/foot) supplies water to the egg incubation and office facilities. Aquifer testing indicates that a steady-state yield of 8.0 cfs from a well field in this area is possible without risk of salt water intrusion (Dames and Moore, 1989a).   More detailed information may be found in  Report of Hydrogeological Services, Water Supply Feasibility Study, Lower Elwha S’Klallam Tribal Fish Culture Facility  (GeoEngineers, 1994), an appendix to FishPro (1994).   Minimum Instream Flows    The instream flow necessary for fish and wildlife and recreational use has not been quantified. Instream flows and recharge from the river to the underlying aquifer are necessary to maintain a level of ground water that prevents salt water from intruding into wells located near the shoreline.   Summary of Water Users and Water Use    Figure 1 shows the maximum, average, and minimum flows of the Elwha River as recorded at the McDonald Bridge gauging station. The average flow is 1,500 cfs. Prior to operation of the dams as run-of-the-river facilities, storage control of Lake Mills affected daily flow but had little effect on peak flood flows. Extremely low flows, including a minimum discharge of 10 cfs, reflect flow control at Glines Canyon Dam in the 1930’s and 1940’s and no longer occur. The minimum flow recorded at the McDonald Bridge gauging station between 1974 and 1986 was 372 cfs.         Table 2 provides information as reported in the WDOE water rights data base and the available well log records on water permits. Also included are estimated usage of individual users who are exempt from the permitting process. It was assumed that individual homes average less than 3.5 gpm, the upper threshold for exemption from further permitting.   Based on these assumptions, the estimated water use in the lower Elwha River valley is about 125 cfs although there are permits for 210 cfs. The lowest average flow for any 7 consecutive days has a 50 percent probability of being less than 377 cfs (USGS, 1979).                 Table 2.

The surface water has excellent quality; the concentrations of many chemicals are below detection limits and all are less than the maximums allowed by the Washington State Drinking Water regulations. Water testing conducted in 1977 as part of the USGS (1979) study of water resources of the Tribal reservation indicated the ground water to be of excellent chemical quality. The watershed is protected by National Park status in the upper reaches. Most of the remaining basin is rural in character and there are no landfills or industrial discharges. Non-point sources of pollution, such as agricultural and urban run-off, have a very minor influence due to the small number of farm operations and limited development within the river basin.   Available information on the quality of ground water is limited to monitoring conducted by community water systems in the basin. ""Group A"" public water systems (those with more than 15 connections or more than 25 people) are regulated by the Washington State Department of Health (WDH).   State testing requirements for Group A water systems vary according to the water source and the size of the system. All must test for coliform bacteria at least once per month. Ground-water systems must have a complete inorganic chemical analysis performed every three years; surface-water systems analyze for inorganic chemicals each year. Group A surface-water systems are required to monitor turbidity every day. Testing requirements for trihalomethane (THM), volatile organic compounds, and pesticides vary according to many criteria, including water source, population served, and level of chlorine treatment.   Three Group A systems are located in the basin: city of Port Angeles, DCWA, and EPHA. Data indicates that the Port Angeles Ranney collector is a ground-water source under the influence of surface water. While it has not been officially designated as such, the city follows the testing regulations required for surface-water users.   Although not regulated by the State, approximately 200 people use a community water source in the lower valley on the reservation. Two community wells have replaced several private domestic wells. The wells have been sampled for inorganic, synthetic, and volatile organic chemicals.   Appendix C includes the water quality analyses of the four major community water systems. The samples were collected at the source before any treatment. No volatile organic compounds have been detected during the sampling and testing of any community water system.   All homes in the lower basin rely on private septic systems for on-site sewage disposal. At high ground-water levels and tidal conditions, the buried perforated drain lines of some systems at the lower end of the valley may be in contact with the water table. The coarse-grained alluvium does not provide much filtration of the waste water that enters the aquifer, and a failed system could be a source of ground-water contamination.   To assess potential salt water intrusion, 12 water samples were tested in August 1994 to determine chloride levels in wells located near the river mouth. Eight samples were taken from wells on or near the reservation; the remaining four samples were from wells on lower Place Road, west of the Elwha River along Freshwater Bay. The maximum chloride concentration tested at 8 milligrams per liter (mg/L), the minimum was less than 1 mg/L, and the mean was about 2 mg/L. These low levels of chloride concentration indicate that, to date, there has been no salt water intrusion into the shallow alluvium aquifer near the shoreline.   Data Sources and Findings    Data sources and the information collected by specific entities are summarized in this section. The levels of major surface-water quality factors are also summarized in tables in chapter III.   United States Geological Survey    Data on water quality collected by the USGS for the period of 1974–86 at the McDonald Bridge station (USGS Gauge No. 12045500) are stored in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) STORET database and are summarized in appendix D. This station is located at RM 8.6 and the STORET information is considered final and not subject to revision. Subsequent data are considered provisional (subject to revision).   The data presented in appendix D indicate that the surface-water quality upstream is excellent. The only exception is a maximum recorded temperature of 14.4 degrees Celsius ( ° C), which could be stressful to anadromous fish.   The USGS collected water and sediment samples during a test to evaluate the effects of drawdown of Lake Mills on water quality. Water samples were collected on three dates in April 1994 at each of four locations. In addition to standard water quality parameters (temperature, pH, hardness, etc.), the concentration of metals, pesticides, volatile organic compounds, and radionuclides were measured. These data are summarized in appendix E.   Based on the data, the water quality is excellent at the monitoring station at RM 16.2. Toxic or hazardous chemicals, if present, are generally below detectable limits, and in no instance were present above the limits established by regulation. The data from the delta site indicates the presence of notable amounts of iron and manganese minerals, apparently re-suspended during drawdown induced erosion. Iron and manganese are generally only nuisance constituents affecting aesthetic water quality.   Two sediment samples taken from the bottom of Lake Mills during the drawdown were analyzed for metals, pesticides, and radionuclides. No hazardous materials were detected. Iron and manganese concentration in the sediment were higher than found in the upstream water samples.   The USGS No. 12044900 gauging station (RM 16.2) established in 1994 provides information on flow, temperature, and turbidity of the Elwha River upstream from the two existing reservoirs. Flow and temperature data collected during 3 months of 1994 are summarized in appendix F. Data collected to date indicate that the natural temperature profile at this station peaks in late July or early August.   Industry    Daishowa and Rayonier collect daily data on flow and turbidity. Measuring the turbidity of incoming water is a step in adjusting the water treatment at each mill to achieve a target water quality for the industrial processes. Appendix G summarizes Daishowa data for the period of 1983–93. The daily average turbidity over this period was 8.4 NTU.   City of Port Angeles    Since April 1994, the city has collected daily data on temperature, pH, and turbidity of water from its Ranney collector located at RM 2.8 and water from the Elwha River adjacent to the collector. Data collected from April 1994 through September 1995 are summarized in appendix H.   These data show that the turbidity and the pH of collector water remains within fairly narrow limits except during periods when river water turbidity increases by a large amount. Large increases in turbidity accompany large increases in flow. Turbidity of the Elwha River and collector water increased during mid-April 1994, in response to the April 1994 drawdown of Lake Mills. The temperature of the collector water tends to increase and decrease in an annual pattern with the river water temperature, but lags behind reflecting the specific heat capacity of the alluvium above the collector.   Turbidity in water from the Ranney collector has infrequently exceeded the maximum allowable level of 1.0 NTU. These higher levels may be the result of increased amounts of colloidal-size particles suspended in the river water under high flow conditions or may represent flow of river water vertically around the caisson during high flows. A comparison of river flow at high levels with turbidity in the Ranney collector does not show a clear correlation (figure 2).   Ranney has collected and studied turbidity data from other Ranney collector sites in the Pacific Northwest and found no correlation between river turbidity and collector turbidity at any site with river turbidity levels that range from 0.9 to 34 NTU (Ranney, 1991). Turbidity levels as high as 2,800 Jackson Turbidity Units (JTU) and suspended sediment levels as high as 4,500 mg/L have not adversely affected the Ranney collectors located on the Russian River north of Santa Rosa, California. These collectors supply water to all of Sonoma County and part of Marin County (Ranney, 1995). These data suggest that limited increases in river turbidity should not adversely affect a Ranney collector’s natural filtering capability or increase the turbidity levels of water in the Ranney collector.   Turbidity data from the USGS gauging station upstream of Lake Aldwell (RM 16.2) is compared with city of Port Angeles data on turbidity of the Elwha River near the city’s Ranney collector (RM 2.8) in appendix I. This comparison shows that peaks of turbidity that occur at RM 16.2 are considerably attenuated by RM 2.8.   Elwha Place Homeowners Association    There appears to be no connection between turbidity levels observed in the river and in the EPHA wells (personal communication with EPHA manager). The maximum turbidity measured in the delivered water is approximately 0.4 NTU.   Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe    The Tribe collected water flow and water and air temperature data for 3 years (1987–89) at the Tribal fish hatchery and collected water temperature data at three sites on the Elwha River from August 1992 to June 1994. These sites included an upper site at Idaho Creek (about RM 22); a middle site at McDonald Bridge (RM 8.6); and a lower site below the bluffs about RM 1, near the fish hatchery. Summaries of data collected by the Tribe are in appendix J.   Water temperatures in the lower river regularly exceed 18.5  ° C during summer months. These high temperatures have been associated with major fish kills in the lower river and probably limit the diversity and population of aquatic invertebrates. Water temperatures higher than 14–15  ° C (57–59  ° F) tend to exacerbate skin diseases and increase mortality of cold-water fish (including the native anadromous fish).   Lake Mills Sediment    The results of chemical and geotechnical testing of fine sediment collected from Lake Mills in March 1995 are shown in appendix K. Iron and manganese are the major metals found in the sediment.   Ground Water and Geology    Interpretation of hydrogeologic conditions in the lower Elwha River basin was developed from published reports, State agency file information, and a limited field reconnaissance. The primary sources of information consisted of:      §   Geologic Map of the Olympic Peninsula (Map I-994)  (USGS, 1978a), including unpublished refinements presented in the report  Port Angeles Regional Watershed  (Clallam County, 1994);   §  A total of 236 water well logs on file with the WDOE for the study area;   §  Responses to a ""Water Use Inventory"" developed for this project and mailed in June 1994 to all landowners in the study area within 2 miles of the river, including those on Lower Elwha Klallam Tribal lands;   §  A 3-day field reconnaissance which included water level monitoring in 32 wells and the measurement of chloride levels in 12 wells located near the mouth of the river.      As discussed in chapter II, ""Basin Hydrogeology"" section, Appendix A includes a series of drawings developed from the USGS and Clallam County reports to aid understanding of the hydrogeological conditions in the Elwha River basin. These drawings include a map showing the surficial distribution of geologic units and generalized cross sections showing the vertical distribution of these units. The surficial map also shows locations of wells identified in the WDOE files and the water use inventory. Two cross sections run parallel to the river (one on either side) and four sections intersect the river at RM 0.3, RM 3, RM 5, and RM 8.8. Each cross section is 5 to 6 miles in length.   Appendix B summarizes the well-log data in the WDOE files and data gathered from the water use inventory.     CHAPTER III.  FUTURE CONDITIONS          METHODOLOGIES FOR ANALYZING IMPACTS    The potential effects of water quality changes on water users were determined through identification of critical impact indicators, or water quality parameters, that must remain within certain limits to avoid adverse effects on aquatic life and water users. The most critical of these are total dissolved solids (TDS) and TSS.   A study of the hydrogeology of the Elwha River watershed identified the area of potential impact as being restricted to the alluvial river valley. All available well logs were reviewed for location, well completion details, and wellhead elevations. Current elevations were compared to the 100-year flood level projected after removal of the dams to determine if facilities would be subject to increased flooding (Corps, 1995).   Wells on the Lower Elwha Klallam Reservation in the lower river valley were monitored for 1 year to evaluate river influence on the level of ground water and to determine the gradient. Several wells were monitored monthly and one was monitored with a continuous recorder. The estimated changes in ground-water levels that would follow removal of the dams were based on projected levels of riverbed aggradation and present river stage to ground-water level relationships.   Sedimentation analysis (Reclamation, 1996) provides the major information for predicting impacts of dam removal on water quality. For this analysis the effects of dam removal were separated into short-term effects and long-term effects. Short term effects are those associated with the period when sediments accumulated in Lake Mills and Lake Aldwell are redistributed downstream. Computer modeling assumes that this period of sediment redistribution would occur over a period of 3 years and 4 months. However, the actual length of this period could be shorter or longer depending on rainfall, rate of runoff, and other factors. For this water quality analysis, the period of short-term effects was assumed to begin during dam removal and to continue for up to 5 years after dam removal. Long-term effects are those associated with the period that would follow redistribution of lakebed sediment. For this analysis the period of long-term effects is assumed to be 50 years.   Information on current conditions collected by operators of various systems was compared with information on predicted conditions to identify potential impacts.   OVERVIEW    No Action    Future water quality conditions with the No Action alternative are dependent on processes that have been ongoing for many years and would be expected to continue.   The two dams form pools of water that (1) slow water flow over the streambed and allow suspended solids to settle and some dissolved solids to be trapped (decreases turbidity during peak flows), (2) elevate the ground-water level for some well users; and (3) decrease the ground-water level in the lower valley.   At present, the downstream TDS and TSS are low, in part because the two reservoirs trap all of the coarse sediment and a percentage of the fine sediment entering the reservoirs. This trapping eliminates sediment recruitment (transport) to the middle and lower reaches of the lower valley. However, natural processes downstream from Elwha Dam continue to move deposited sands and fine sediments from the river to the sea, resulting in the lowering of the elevation of the river bottom. Therefore, the water surface was lowered, the rate of channel migration was decreased, flood levels were decreased, and the riverbed was left armored with coarse cobbles and gravel. Loss of sands and fine sediments has increased the hydraulic connection between the river and the underlying aquifer and slightly increased the yield of some wells.   Yield from the Port Angeles Ranney collector is diminishing and will continue to diminish further as long as the river continues to migrate toward the west bank and away from the collector laterals. The Ranney collector and other high-yield wells depend on induced recharge from the river to maintain high yields.   The quality of water from the DCWA wells, which have a very close hydraulic connection to the river, is often reduced during periods of high river turbidity. This would continue to occur.   The dams would continue to trap sediments and maintain current conditions with regard to river migration, erosion, and flooding.   Action Alternatives (Dam Removal)    Removal of the dams would allow the Elwha River to erode a portion of the sediment deposited behind the dams and transport that sediment downstream. In addition, the natural sediment loading from above Lake Mills would be transported downstream. Downstream TDS and TSS would increase and bedload would move downstream raising the elevation of the river bottom. The impact, compared to the No Action alternative, is the sum of the natural load entering Lake Mills plus the additional load due to erosion of lakebed sediment minus the load historically passing the reservoirs. The impact can be measured both in terms of quantity and quality of the additional loading of dissolved and solid materials.   Potential effects over the short term (during the period of greatest erosion of sediment from the two reservoir areas) include higher turbidity, higher water temperatures, and lower dissolved oxygen concentration, resulting in increased mortality of aquatic life, fouling of existing water treatment systems and plumbing, and water becoming generally unfit for the current beneficial uses. Increased quantities of suspended and dissolved solids in the short term would increase the costs of water treatment to remove the additional solids. Over the long term (after the greatest period of erosion of sediments from the reservoir areas), water temperature should be lower during part of the year, dissolved oxygen concentration higher, and average TDS and TSS higher than with the No Action alternative.   Changes in surface-water quality would affect instream uses and water users that use river water or ground water with a close hydraulic connection to the river. These users include Rayonier, Daishowa, and the WDFW fish rearing channel (divert water directly from the river), the Tribal fish hatchery (uses an infiltration gallery), and individuals with wells in direct contact with surface water.   With either action alternative to manage the sediment, there would be major physical changes in the river system. Some of those changes would be most intense during and immediately after dam removal and would be similar for both alternatives but would be more intense for the River Erosion alternative. Over the long term (50 years), the impacts of both action alternatives would be nearly identical. Table 3 summarizes long-term and short-term physical changes.                 Table 3. Categories of Physical Change With Dam Removal              Physical Change        Time Period †          Possible increased iron and manganese concentrations    Short term — immediate        Increased river turbidity, suspended solids    Short term — immediate     Long term — slight increase        Lowered water table in areas now supported by reservoir operations (Indian Creek delta)    Long term — immediate        Increased river aggradation (riverbed is raised) in lower valley leading to:     · Raised water table     · Increased flood levels in areas where aggradation occurs      · Increased channel migration     Long term — build up to equilibrium        †  Short-term is up to 5 years during and immediately following dam removal      The impact of increased TSS and TDS will depend on the method and timing of sediment releases during dam removal. Levels of suspended sediment are projected to exceed 50,000 mg/L for short periods during dam removal (Reclamation 1996). This could possibly reduce yield and degrade the water quality in the city’s Ranney collector and the DCWA wells.   Fine sediments, especially during high flows and during dam removal may infiltrate the well screens of near-river wells. The increase of sediments carried downstream would promote the natural process of channel movement which may also impact near-river wells.   In the Indian Creek valley, the water table in the alluvial aquifer would be lowered when Lake Aldwell is drained. The major effect for water users will be water levels that decline below the pump settings in some wells or even below the well completion depth.   River aggradation would lead to increased flooding potential which is a water quality concern because of possible contamination of wells or other water systems and contamination of the ground water from failed septic systems. In the upper valley, from Glines Canyon Dam downstream to Highway 101, there would be increased potential for flooding and overtopping of wells located near the river. Downstream from Elwha Dam, there would be increased potential for flooding of some wellheads. In the lower delta area, the level of ground water is expected to rise due to a higher river stage as sediments are deposited raising the riverbed (aggradation) and this would increase flooding potential of individual wells. Wellhead elevations of several wells located on the flood plain are below the current 100-year flood level. Ground-water levels are already high in some areas and an increase may adversely affect septic systems and lead to contamination of the ground water.   Impacts of riverbed aggradation and flooding are generally covered in  Sediment Analysis and Modeling of the River Erosion Alternative  (Reclamation, 1996d) and  Elwha River Restoration Study: Flooding Impacts Associated with Removal of the Elwha and Glines Canyons Dams  (Corps, 1995). Discussion of these effects in this report are limited to the effect on septic systems and contamination of the ground water. Water quality effects on fish and other aquatic life are addressed in the Elwha Fish Restoration Plan and not further addressed in this report.         PHYSICAL CHANGES    Surface Water Quality    Critical impact indicators for surface water quality have been identified. Current values for these indicators have been measured and are projected to remain unchanged with the No Action alternative. However, some values of some indicators, especially those related to fine suspended solids (TSS, turbidity, total iron, and total manganese), do not remain at a constant value and vary markedly with riverflows. Concentrations tend to be low for long periods and very high for short periods of high riverflow. This condition of high peak concentrations in response to riverflow, generally with a duration of 1–3 days, will continue into the future with, or without, dam removal. Peak concentrations will increase markedly for both action alternatives but will be greater for the River Erosion alternative. Under the No Action Alternative, fine sediment concentrations are typically less than 50 mg/L, but can exceed 1,000 mg/L during floodflows.   Table 4 lists the critical impact factors and summarizes the range of values that are expected with the No Action alternative and the two action alternatives for the short term (during and immediately after dam removal). A range of peak values for some factors is shown and those peaks could be expected to last for 1–3 days. The values between peaks would be much higher than with the No Action alternative. For example, fine suspended sediments, could be greater than 200 mg/L much of the time and more than 1,000 mg/L for many days in a row depending on the stage of dam removal. Table 5 summarizes the values of critical impact factors expected with the No Action alternative and the two action alternatives for the long term (after most sediments in Lake Mills and Lake Aldwell have eroded).           Table 4.

TSS concentrations downstream will be affected by the size of the notches cut in Glines Canyon Dam, the timing of releases through the notches with respect to seasonal hydrology or natural discharge, and the erodability of the sediments. Mineralogy, grain size, and chemical content are characteristics of the sediments that will determine the overall impact to quality of the surface water. A study of lakebed sediments has provided information on the chemical composition and state of these materials (see appendix K).   There are an estimated 9.2 million cubic yards of fine sediments contained in the two reservoirs including 2.4 million cubic yards in the deltas of the reservoirs. Under the Dredge and Slurry alternative, up to 5 million cubic yards of fine lakebed sediment would be dredged from the two reservoirs and transported to the Strait through a slurry pipeline. Due to old logs and tree stumps on the reservoir bottoms and other factors, only 50–80 percent of the lakebed sediment could be dredged and none of the sediment in the deltas of the reservoirs would be dredged. Although the magnitude of impacts with the Dredge and Slurry alternative would be much less than with the River Erosion alternative, the impact would be large. Any coincident combination of weather, hydrology, and the rate of dam removal could produce brief peak turbidities of up to 51,000 mg/L with the River Erosion alternative and up to 25,000 mg/L with the Dredge and Slurry alternative. Table 6 summarizes fine sediment concentrations over the short term.                 Table 6. Short Term Sediment Concentrations (Dam Removal) (mg/L)               Dam Removal Phase        River Erosion Alternative        Dredge and Slurry Alternative          Begin removal      6,700–43,000      >10,000 ( 0–26 days)        1,700–11,000       >5,000 (0–2 days)          Stop (during winter floods)      < 200 (20–85 days)        <200 (20–120 days)          Continue removal      5,600–11,000      >5,000 (13–33 days)        1,400–2,700      >1,000 (21–38 days)          Stop (during spring runoff)      <200 (80–100 days)        <200 (100 days)          Finish removal      15,000–51,000       >10,000 (4–25 days)        3,900–13,000      >5,000 (0–9 days)          Winter floods after removal      21,000–38,000      >10,000 (3 days)        5,300–9,400      >5,000 (1 day)        There is some evidence that the concentrations of dissolved iron and manganese could increase with the two action alternatives. Pore water in samples of fine sediments from Lake Mills was found to contain high concentrations of iron (an average of 27.5 mg/L for three samples) and manganese (an average of 4.67 mg/L for three samples). It is possible that the iron and manganese concentrations could remain elevated with additional leaching from the sediment during transport and deposition and could cause iron fouling of water delivery systems and mineral staining of fixtures and clothing.   A more likely possibility is that the iron and manganese have dissolved in the pore water as result of an oxygen poor or reducing environment. Released downstream, the dissolved iron and manganese are likely to form insoluble compounds in an oxygen environment and precipitate, adding to the TSS. Many variables, including the oxygen content of the water and the distribution and reactivity of organic matter, would control the amount of oxidation.   Ground-Water Quality    The primary impact to wells would be due to increased turbidity of the river in the short-term and the long-term. Fine sediment may settle out in the interstices of the coarse riverbed material and decrease the rate of infiltration from the river to the alluvial aquifer. This could decrease the yield of the city’s Ranney collector and wells near the river. Some of the finest-sized sediment (rock flour) could be carried into the collector. Under current conditions, water samples from the Ranney collector have infrequently exceeded the 1.0 NTU maximum contaminant level (MCL), although this may be due to turbid water traveling down the outside of the collector caisson during high flow events.   During dam removal or at other times of high turbidity, the DCWA wells would probably exceed regulated turbidity levels with either action alternative.   Some domestic wells located south of Highway 101 along Olympic Hot Springs Road may be subject to degraded water quality due to their close proximity to the river and shallow depths. Responses in the water-use inventory indicated that the water from these wells does not get ""cloudy"" during periods of high river turbidity. With the high concentration of TSS projected for the two action alternatives during dam removal, it is possible that water in these wells would begin to show some turbidity in response to river turbidity.   Upstream Ground-Water Elevation Decrease    Lake Aldwell supports an artificial constant head (ground-water elevation) at the east end of Indian Creek valley, near the mouth of Indian Creek. If Elwha Dam is removed and Lake Aldwell is drained, the head gradient in the valley aquifer would steepen and ground-water elevations will decline.   Downstream Riverbed Aggradation    With either action alternative, redistribution and deposition of sediment now trapped in the two reservoirs would cause the riverbed to aggrade (rise) in areas of slower streamflow. The water elevation in the lower valley would rise by 1 to 5 feet (average of 2.5 feet) over the next 50 years. Since the lower Elwha River reach loses water to the aquifer, the ground-water table would be expected to also rise. Figure 3 shows the general contour of ground water in the lower river reach at present. The elevation of ground water varies with river stage at a ratio of about 1:0.3. A 1-foot rise in river stage causes a 0.3-foot rise in the water table at the ""Bosco"" well, located about 1,500 feet from the river (see figure 4). A higher river stage would cause an increase in water table elevation which would affect septic systems along the lower reach.   Based on an average river stage increase of 2.5 feet, the water table would be expected to rise about 1-foot higher in the lower delta area during floods than occurs as present. As shown in figure 3, the water table is currently less than 4 feet below the ground surface in some areas. All residences in the lower delta area use on-site septic systems for sewage disposal. Clallam County requires at least a 3-foot separation between the septic system drain line and the water table. During seasonal high water levels and high tidal conditions, some conventional septic systems are probably in contact with the water table and do not meet the county separation requirement.         IMPACTS TO SPECIFIC SITES AND USERS    The impacts described in this section are those that would occur without any mitigation measures. With the mitigation measures described in the next chapter there would be no significant water quality impacts for water users.   The No Action alternative would have no impacts. Water quality, quantity, and flooding potential would remain unchanged from current conditions.   Impacts under the two action alternatives would be identical over the long term. For the short term (during and immediately after dam removal), impacts would be more intense under the River Erosion alternative.   Upper Valley Well Users    Some wells located near the river between Glines Canyon Dam and Highway 101 may experience unacceptable levels of suspended solids. Several wells near the river could be overtopped and contaminated during flood events as the riverbed rises. This includes at least 10 private domestic wells and a well at the Elwha Campground (near RM 11).   In the Indian Creek valley, some wells may experience lower water levels. At least two wells located in this area could be affected and would need to be replaced.   Dry Creek Water Association    During periods of increased turbidity, water from the DCWA wells could be expected to exceed the MCL for suspended solids. It is also possible that the yield would decrease.   City of Port Angeles Industrial Diversion    In the short term, this direct diversion from the Elwha River will undergo the large increase in TSS and total iron and manganese anticipated for the Elwha River as shown in table 4. Over the long term, the TSS would vary widely but average higher than with the No Action alternative.   The amount of suspended solids needed to be removed to meet the required water quality for the industrial processes would be so large under the River Erosion alternative as to be not achievable with current facilities. The amount of removed solids (sediments) that may be discharged from the mill treatment plants into the environment would exceed the individual discharge permits by a large amount.   WDFW Fish Rearing Channel    The quality of surface water during and immediately after dam removal, with either action alternative, would be unacceptable for the intended use. Under the Elwha Fish Restoration Plan, the rearing channel would be closed during the period of unacceptable water quality (1–5 years with either action alternative). Other fish rearing facilities would be used for Elwha stocks during this period. The fish restoration plan assumes reactivating the channel after the river water quality returns to acceptable conditions.   City of Port Angeles (Ranney Collector)    Water quality may exceed the MCL for TSS and TDS. The action alternatives would be expected to increase deposition of sediment in the lower Elwha River and could increase the rate of channel migration near the Ranney collector.   Elwha Place Homeowners Association    If the river begins to migrate more frequently and further, the river could eventually move closer to these wells and affect the water quality.   Lower Valley and Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe    The lower valley and the Tribe will be affected by a higher ground-water table which could inundate septic systems in the lowest delta area and septic systems for a few homes on the west side of the river.   Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe Fish Hatchery Ground-Water Supply    An increase in suspended sediments in the river along with aggradation of the riverbed over the hatchery infiltration gallery is anticipated to decrease the capacity of the gallery and increase the turbidity of water delivered. The increased turbidity of the water delivered from the gallery would be unacceptable for fish hatchery requirements.         CUMULATIVE IMPACTS    There is a potential that natural erosion or landslide events upstream of Lake Mills or forest fires within the watershed could increase suspended solids and add to the effects of dam removal. These emergency situations could exceed the capability of mitigation measures.     CHAPTER IV.  MITIGATION          OVERVIEW    Mitigation measures for the two action alternatives were developed on the basis of anticipated changes in water quality and the requirements of various Federal, State, and local regulations. The Act requires protection of existing water quality and availability for municipal and industrial users and specifically mentions the city of Port Angeles, Dry Creek Water Association, and industrial users of the Elwha River. The goal of the mitigation measures is to eliminate the impacts of dam removal on water quality and availability for these and other water users.   Most impacts that result from river aggradation, such as the overtopping and contamination of wells during floods, and associated mitigation are included in a flood report (see Corps, 1995).   Expansion and renovation of the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe’s fish hatchery are described in FishPro, 1994. The water supply action and the associated costs are considered mitigation for water quality impacts.   The WDFW fish rearing channel as indicated in the previous chapter would be inactive during the greatest change in water quality. No method was identified for providing the required water quality for rearing fish at the facility during and immediately following dam removal. The use of other facilities for fish rearing is part of the Elwha River Fish Restoration Plan (National Park Service, 1996).   Potential mitigation measures were identified and evaluated. Final selection was based on cost, effectiveness, and acceptability. Measures that were not selected are briefly described in Chapter V. At this stage of planning, general concepts have been identified, measures selected, and costs estimated. Evaluations to date are sufficient to provide a cost ceiling, but specific measures will be reviewed and refined during the design and value engineering phases. This process, along with negotiations with affected entities, will likely result in some changes. In addition, some baseline data are still being collected and the results could affect the design of mitigation measures.   ACCOMPLISHMENT    The set of mitigation measures selected for implementation would meet the goal of the Act; that is, water quality and availability for users would not be diminished and could exceed current conditions. To achieve this, some mitigation measures would be permanent while others would be temporary until sediment has eroded from the reservoirs. Most measures for the two action alternatives are identical and would have identical capital costs; however, use of facilities and costs for operation, maintenance, and power (OM&P) would be less for the Dredge and Slurry alternative. Some measures, particularly those that address possible increased iron and manganese concentrations apply only to the River Erosion alternative. With the mitigation measures implemented, water users should suffer no project-related, adverse water-quality effects, and there would be no significant impact.   DESCRIPTION    Mitigation measures include a water quality monitoring program and actions to address potential adverse effects to individual wells, the DCWA supply, the city of Port Angeles industrial diversion and municipal supply, the EPHA supply, the Tribal fish hatchery supply, and rural sewage systems. Facilities associated with temporary mitigation measures are intended to mitigate short-term effects and then be declared surplus and removed for salvaged. However, served entities would be given first right to purchase and may wish to retain the facilities on a permanent basis. Mitigation measures are summarized in table 7.   Water Quality Monitoring    A water quality monitoring plan, administered by the National Park Service, would be established to measure water quality parameters for several years under either action alternative. Sampling sites would include a USGS station to be located at Goblin’s Gate (about RM 15.8) just downstream from the confluence of the Elwha River and Long Creek, the historic McDonald Bridge station (RM 8.6), and a new site to be located downstream from Elwha Dam and upstream of the new infiltration gallery for the industrial diversion. Sampling frequency and selection of parameters to measure would be determined by regulatory requirements and to insure adequate data coverage prior to, during, and after dam removal.   Comparisons would be made with historic data from the McDonald Bridge station to adjust monitoring activities and between monitoring stations to determine when natural conditions have been established and the monitoring program is no longer needed. The monitoring program with the Dredge and Slurry alternative would be less extensive because most fine sediments would be removed and transported to the Strait by slurry pipeline.   Individual Wells    Point-of-entry sediment filter units would be installed at 10 residential wells. A total of 15 replacement filters with a filter limit of 10 microns would be provided for each well. In addition, each residence would be provided with a water cooler and 30 gallons (six 5-gallon bottles) of bottled water per month for drinking and cooking, if needed.   The well and water use inventory conducted during the summer of 1994, had a response rate of about 40 percent, so there may be additional well users who would be affected by dam removal. One Elwha River water user did not draw water from a well but filled containers from the river for home use. In addition, several respondents noted plans to drill a well within 1–2 years. To account for possible additional impacts, a contingency fund is included to mitigate impacts that may be identified in the future.   New Wells    At least two new wells in the Indian Creek valley would be provided to replace wells that go dry as the level of the ground water drops in the area above Lake Aldwell. The new wells would be 6 inches in diameter, probably 200 feet deep, and include a submersible pump and the necessary piping, valves, and electrical equipment.             Table 7.

A pipeline and pumping system would be constructed from the temporary filtration plant to terminate near the existing DCWA well field. A mixed oxidant (MIOX) or comparable disinfection system for treatment of water would be provided and connected at the DCWA end of the supply pipe.   City of Port Angeles Municipal Supply System    A Ranney collector would be constructed on the west bank of the river, slightly upstream from the existing diversion dam. (The site is shown on drawing 1440-D-164 in appendix L.) The new collector would be constructed with the same capacity as the existing collector (10 mgd) and would be positioned so that possible future changes in the river course would not simultaneously impact both collectors. The discharge line from the new collector would be joined to the discharge line of the existing collector and lead to a new temporary filtration plant. Water for the city would be disinfected using the existing chlorination facility after it leaves the proposed filter plant.   A building would be constructed, and a package in-line filtration plant meeting the requirements of the State of Washington and EPA’s Surface Water Treatment Rule would be installed. The treatment plant would eliminate objectionable taste, appearance, and precipitation problems associated with possible sediment, iron, and manganese concentrations. Filtration would also meet EPA standards for the  cryptosporidium  and  giardia lamblia  in the public water supply. Used filters would be disposed of at a local landfill site.   DCWA and the city of Port Angeles would hold joint ownership, subject to negotiations, of the new Ranney collector. DCWA would transfer its existing water rights and the city would transfer a portion of its water rights to the new point of withdrawal.   City of Port Angeles Industrial Diversion    The most costly and extensive mitigation measures modify the existing industrial diversion to reduce suspended solids concentrations to current levels. These include a new infiltration gallery to replace the existing surface water diversion, and temporary facilities to precipitate suspended solids and move the accumulated sediments to the river (see the series of drawings in appendix L).   The infiltration gallery would be composed of a lateral pipe system, a concrete carrier pipe, a pumping plant, a concrete discharge pipe, and a vertical riser structure that connects to the existing supply tunnel. The treatment facilities would consist of a series of sequential chambers for rapid mix of chemicals, flocculation of the mixture, settling the coagulated particles, and collecting and flushing the accumulated sediment to the river. Accessory facilities would include a building for chemical storage and pumps, piping, and related equipment to measure flow and add chemicals.   Lateral Pipe Infiltration Gallery    The infiltration gallery design provides a capacity of 300 cfs (twice the diversion right) with pumping to provide a safety factor in the event that infiltration rates are reduced during operation due to clogging from sediment deposition. It would be located in the riverbed upstream from the existing diversion dam. The system includes eight ""L"" shaped laterals of solid pipe buried in the riverbed and connected to a concrete carrier pipe that parallels the river on the left bank. The long leg of each lateral, which would vary from 8 inches in diameter at the upstream end to 32 inches in diameter at the downstream end, would be parallel to river flow. Arrayed perpendicular to the lateral, 16 on each side, would be 32 collector pipes, each 35 feet long. The perforated pipes are designed for free, or near-free flow, to maximize the hydraulic head and minimize the length of perforated pipe required.   Risers (vertical pipes extending above the ground) with blind flanges would be provided for backflushing each lateral collection system. Each lateral would have a sediment trap for removal of heavier sediments that may enter during periods of high sediment concentration in the river. A butterfly valve with a manual actuator would be provided between the sediment trap and the vertical riser to isolate the lateral for backflushing. A butterfly valve downstream from the sediment trap would have a motorized actuator to control flow in the lateral. Sediment traps at the end of each lateral would provide operators with information on sand passage through each lateral. If final designs include a single large sediment trap instead of eight smaller ones, the opportunity to identify problems in specific laterals would be lost.   An option that could be added to the system is placement of saddle meters in each lateral pipe and a control system installed at the pumping plant that would read the meters and adjust the control valves in the laterals to maintain a uniform water surface in the pump sump. This option is not included in the cost estimates.   Concrete Carrier Pipe    A concrete carrier pipe to collect water from the eight infiltration gallery laterals would be buried along the left bank of the river from the upper lateral and terminate at the intake to the pumping plant. The size of the carrier pipe would increase from 36 inches in diameter at the upper end to 72 inches in diameter near the end of the lateral collection system.   Pumping Plant    A pumping plant with four 30-cfs pumps and two 15-cfs pumps (total capacity of 150 cfs) would be constructed at the downstream end of the infiltration gallery carrier pipe. An additional pump for backup and maintenance periods would not be included as the full 150 cfs is seldom diverted and there are sufficient periods when pump maintenance can be performed without interruption of service. Failure of any single pump would not be expected to interrupt service while awaiting repairs or replacement.   The discharge line from each pump would be equipped with a check valve to eliminate backflow when the unit shuts down, and each discharge line would be equipped with a guard valve to isolate its pump. The current design locates the motors within the pumping plant on a slab at elevation 60 feet because the desirable location of the pump discharge valves and manifolding is below the required water surface elevation at the tunnel inlet. Placing the pump motors in this position, rather than on the top slab of the structure at elevation 80 feet, is more aesthetically pleasing and should decrease vandalism at this remote location. Equipment would be protected from 100-year flood events.   The 30-cfs pumps would have 75 horsepower motors and the 15-cfs pumps would have 40 horsepower motors operating on 460 volts. Electrical service would be provided by the 12.5 kilovolt power line which crosses the Elwha River near the pumping plant site. A switchyard and transformer for the pumping plant would be located near the connection to the power line and would also service the proposed Ranney collector pumps. An engine generator with a capacity of about 450 kilowatts, placed in the switch yard, could supply power to the pumping plant and the Ranney collector pumps during power outages.   An option described in chapter V under ""Infiltration Gallery Design"" is to provide a by-pass to the pumping plant and increase the size of the discharge pipe. With this option, gravity flow would be sufficient to meet the water supply needs of the two mills after the water treatment facilities are removed. The cost of this option is not included in the project cost estimates.   Concrete Discharge Pipe    A 54-inch-diameter concrete discharge pipeline that passes under the Elwha River would convey water from the pumping plant to a vertical riser structure on the opposite side of the river. The top of the pipeline would be a minimum of 5 feet below the surface of the riverbed.   Vertical Riser Structure    A vertical riser structure would be constructed at the downstream end of the concrete discharge pipe to connect to the existing tunnel entrance.   Access Road    An access road would be constructed from the existing road, between the one-lane bridge and a house near the river, to the pumping plant and the sediment traps. About 1,000 feet of the new road, leading from the existing road to the pumping plant, would be elevated to provide access during floods; construction would include culverts to pass flows through existing flood channels. The remaining 1,500 feet of new road, leading to the sediment traps and backflushing system, would be constructed at the existing ground surface level. About 1,000 feet of the existing connector road would be improved.   Temporary Pump Stations    Two temporary pump stations would be required to maintain deliveries to the mills during construction of the treatment facility and the infiltration gallery. The first site would be used for 13 months during construction of the treatment facility, and the second site would be used for eight months during subsequent construction of the infiltration gallery. The temporary pump station would consist of a lined sump excavated in the river, a platform, three 30-cfs pumps and one 15-cfs pump (all would eventually be installed in the permanent pumping plant). A screening system would be placed on all sides of the platform to keep fish out of the pumps and to protect the pumps from trash. About 600 feet of corrugated metal pipe (30-inch diameter for the larger pumps and 21-inch diameter for the small pump) would be used as discharge lines between the pump station and the mill diversion. Temporary power lines would be constructed from the newly constructed switchyard adjacent to the new infiltration gallery.   Treatment Facilities (General)    The treatment facilities would be constructed in the general location of the existing 1,900-foot-long open channel between the upwell structure and the industrial pipeline inlet and would consist of parallel chambers to provide 100 percent redundancy. As soon as one side is constructed and tested, it could be placed in operation. The design provides a maximum flow of about 100 cfs (65 mgd) and unattended operation. Redundant treatment units would provide sufficient capacity to allow regular maintenance and emergency repair without jeopardizing the water quality or quantity delivered to the mills. Grated walkways and handrails for equipment access and safety would be provided along the water basins.   Storage Building    A building for chemical storage and feed equipment would be constructed near the existing residences at the WDFW fish rearing channel and provide on-site storage of at least a 30-day supply of chemicals. Piping for injection of chemicals would be buried and lead from this building to the rapid-mix unit This building may also include space to house offices, a laboratory, and data collection/process control.   Rapid-mix Units    An ultrasonic flow meter would be located at the existing upwell structure to measure the flow rate using a constant-head orifice system.   Two rapid-mix units (one active and one spare) would be constructed next to and connected to the existing upwell structure. Each unit would be square with reinforced concrete sides 35 feet long and a total volume about 6,000 cubic feet to provide a water detention time of at least 1 minute.   Flocculation Units    Two flocculation basins sharing a common wall would be constructed just downstream from the rapid mix units. Each basin would be about 5 feet high, 45 feet wide, and 535 feet long with a total capacity of 120,000 cubic feet. The basins would provide a minimum water retention time of 20 minutes and have a flow-through velocity of less than 1 foot per minute.   Sedimentation Basins    Two parallel sedimentation basins, with a 20-foot-wide access road between the two basins, would be constructed just downstream from the flocculation basins. Each sedimentation basin would be 5 feet high and about 1,330 feet long and lined with high-density polyethylene on compacted soil. Each channel would have a trapezoidal cross section with side slopes of 3:1, a bottom width of 10 feet, and a water-surface width of about 52 feet. The water detention time would be about 35 minutes. Tube settlers would direct sediment deposition to the center of each channel, and a pumping system would move the accumulated sediment to the river. At the end of each sedimentation channel, a concrete trough would route the treated water to the existing channel upstream of the screenhouse.   An option is to replace the synthetic liner with a layer of clay, if an abundant source is available locally and provides an acceptable seepage rate. Another option is to construct the sediment basins of concrete and use vertical walls.   Flow of Water    From the existing upwell structure, water would enter a rapid-mix basin through an 8- by 5-foot gate. Flow would leave the basin by passing over a 35-foot-long weir. Water velocity into the rapid-mix units would be 2.5 feet per second.   After passing over the weir, the water would flow through an 8- by 5-foot concrete trough 15 feet long and leading to an 8- by 5-foot flocculation basin entrance gate. The trough would also contain an 8- by 5-foot slide gate to direct flow to either flocculation basin. Inside, the flocculation basin flow would slow to 0.5–1.5 feet per second. Water flow out of the flocculation basin would be controlled by a 14- by 5-foot gate, set to control the outlet velocity at 1.5 feet per second.   From the flocculation basin, water would flow through a 10-foot-wide, 7-foot-high, 55-foot-long trough under the road and through the entrance gate (10 feet wide by 7 feet high) for the sedimentation basin. Flow through the sedimentation tank would slow to 0.5 feet per second. At the end of the sedimentation basin, water would be skimmed from the surface into sixteen 100-foot-long troughs. Each trough would be two sided and contain V-notched weirs for a total of about 3,200 feet of overflow weir. The plastic effluent troughs would discharge into the existing channel which would be widened to receive flow from the sedimentation basins.   EPHA Wells    The wellheads and pump house would be modified and a temporary in-line filter system for sediment and iron and manganese would be installed.   Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe Septic Systems    Ten conventional septic systems were identified that would fail to meet county requirements for separation between septic drain lines and the water table as the result of a water table rise associated with dam removal. Each of these 10 conventional septic systems would be replaced with a mounded disposal system and lift station.   Lower Klallam Tribe Fish Hatchery    The fish hatchery would be modified and expanded as generally discussed by FishPro (1994). Water supply facilities include upgrading the two existing hatchery wells, providing two new wells, and upgrading and extending the existing infiltration gallery. Water aeration facilities would be included, and meters, valves, and pipelines would be replaced as needed. Each existing well would be video inspected and re-developed to restore the original specific capacity. Pumps would be tested to determine wear and the need for replacement. The two new wells would be located west of the levee in the river flood plain between RM 0.5 and 1.0.   During dam removal, the wells would supply dilution water (when needed) and cool, pathogen-free water to the incubation ponds and intermediate rearing units of the expanded hatchery. At times, the water supply could consist of 10 parts ground water to 1 part of surface water to provide a concentration of fines of less than 500 mg/L, an acceptable level for fish for short periods of time.   The maximum rate of water use for the expanded plant is a flow of 3,775 gpm from ground water and a flow of 8,000 gpm from surface water, a total of nearly 12,000 gpm. Currently, about 2,000 gpm are pumped from ground water and 4,000 gpm are supplied from the existing infiltration gallery, a total of 6,000 gpm.   There are concerns that the expanded use of ground water could lead to over pumping of the aquifer and intrusion of salt water. Several ground-water investigation reports describe the local aquifer conditions and limitations (USGS, 1977; Dames and Moore, 1989; GeoEngineers, 1994). To prevent saltwater intrusion and ensure a sustainable supply, Dames and Moore concluded that 3,600 gpm can be safely pumped or up to 4,500 gpm can be pumped for short periods (durations of 60 days or less, once a year) from the entire lower valley. This compares with the proposed rate of 5,835 gpm for all uses including individual homes, two community wells, and the new fish hatchery usage and exceeds the safe yield from the aquifer. However, the Dames and Moore flow rates do not take into account additional recharge from the river. Hydraulic continuity with the river and induced recharge to the aquifer by pumping from near-river wells would help to prevent saltwater intrusion and interference with existing wells in the area.   GeoEngineers proposed to locate the new production wells near the river and to complete them within a deep (more than 75 to 100 feet) ""semi-confined"" unit to limit continuity with the river. They suggest that continuity with the river be limited so that the pumped ground water remains at the optimum temperature and pathogen-free for use in the incubation ponds.   The confining layer described by Dames and Moore and referred to by GeoEngineers does not appear to be laterally continuous throughout the area. A test well drilled at the hatchery in 1976, during the USGS study, is ""unconfined"" and is located within a few hundred feet of a ""semi-confined"" well. The lower river valley is composed of sediment of deltaic origin. Delta deposits usually vary in composition and character due to the variable energy levels of the depositional environment. Many wells in the lower river valley report thin layers of clay interspersed throughout the alluvial sand and gravel. Locally, the clay layers can create semi-confining conditions where they inhibit the vertical movement of water. However, the confining beds do not appear to be laterally continuous or extensive throughout the lower valley. The new production wells may not encounter a confining bed to prevent hydraulic connection to the river.   GeoEngineers recommended that an 8-inch test well and one or two small-diameter observation wells be drilled initially on the flood plain. The wells would be tested to determine the percentage of the pumping rate that is contributed by the river and the effect of the pumping on nearby wells. A ground-water sample would be taken after several hours of pumping and analyzed to determine if the desired temperature and water quality parameters would be maintained.   CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES    Facilities for individual wells and mounded septic systems would be completed in less than 1 year. The municipal, industrial, and fish hatchery facilities would be completed over a 3-year period and be in operation prior to dam removal.   City of Port Angeles Industrial Facilities    The first activity would be construction of a temporary pumping plant to ensure a continuous water supply.   Construction of the treatment facilities would begin at the downstream end of the facilities, by the sedimentation basin. This would allow installation of the effluent troughs, weirs, and tube settlers while the rapid-mix and flocculation basins with associated troughs and gates are also being constructed. As soon as one side is fully tested, the temporary pumps and corrugated metal pipe can be relocated and the second pretreatment side can be constructed.   Construction of the gallery piping would require installing a sheet-pile cofferdam and dewatering system around the entire eight-lateral piping system. Because of the short time frame of low river flow (4 to 4½ months), the entire construction area would be dewatered to maximize the efficiency of construction activities. As soon as the area is dewatered, construction activities would include removing and stockpiling the coarse armored layer of the riverbed, excavating for the infiltration gallery piping; installing the graded gravel, piping, valves, and sediment traps; backfilling; replacing the armored layer; and removing the dewatering system and the sheet pile cofferdam. Special care would be needed to avoid disturbing the riffle area downstream from the gallery during construction.   Construction of the pumping plant would require dewatering, as would construction of the discharge line and vertical riser structure. The discharge line would need to be constructed in two phases, as the entire river cannot be blocked. Because of the short construction period, the portion of the discharge line that passes under the river and the vertical riser structure must be constructed concurrently with the infiltration gallery pipe.   The temporary pump station at site 1 would be in place and operational before the tunnel diversion is shut down for construction of the treatment facility (see drawing 1440-D-164 in appendix L).   The treatment facilities would be operational before the temporary pump station at site 2 (see drawing 1440-D-164) is put into operation to allow removal of the existing rock diversion dam and construction of the lower end of the discharge line and the vertical riser structure. When all construction is complete and the infiltration gallery is ready to go into service, water can be supplied to the mills from both the temporary pumping station and the permanent pumping plant. This would be accomplished by moving the pumps in sequence from the temporary pumping station to the permanent pumping plant.   The sump and the H-pile supports for the platform of the permanent pumping plant would be constructed during the low flow period.   All facilities would be constructed under one contract. The rationale is that one contractor would be responsible for all equipment, for coordination between the various segments, and for the overall schedule.   City of Port Angeles Municipal Diversion and DCWA Facilities    The new Ranney collector and the temporary filter plant could be constructed at any time of the year. The Ranney collector discharge line would be constructed concurrently with the industrial supply infiltration gallery discharge line to minimize in-river construction. It is possible that the construction of the Ranney collector, filter plant, pumps, and supply line for DCWA could be included in a single contract.   Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe Fish Hatchery    Water supply facilities for the fish hatchery would be completed as described by FishPro (1994).         OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, AND POWER    Some facilities would immediately become the property of the owners while other facilities would be maintained and operated as project facilities during the period when TSS and TDS due to dam removal are high — 1 to 5 years for both action alternatives. Operation as project facilities means that OM&P costs (with some exceptions) would be absorbed by the Federal Government as mitigation during the period when TSS and TDS are high due to dam removal.   New Wells and Septic Systems    New wells and the new mounded sewage treatment systems would become the property of the landowners who would be responsible for operation and maintenance.   Well Filters and Bottled Water    Filters for individual wells and the EPHA wells and bottled water for individual well owners would be provided only with the River Erosion alternative. These could be maintained by individual owners or by a contractor. Bottled water deliveries would be provided by a contractor. These mitigation measures would be continued during the 1- to 5-year period of need caused by higher levels of TDS and TSS. At the conclusion of this period, expendable supplies would no longer be provided and arrangements would be made to return systems to their original conditions or possibly leave the filters in place if desired by the individual well owners.   DCWA    The MIOX disinfection system, the water supply pipeline, and the DCWA interest in the Ranney collector would be maintained and operated as a project facility. It is anticipated that training would be supplied to DCWA personnel who would operate the MIOX system as a project facility. Power for operation of the booster pumps for the water supply line would be a project cost, but costs to operate the new Ranney collector would be a responsibility of DCWA and the city (see city municipal diversion below for operation of other facilities). At the conclusion of the project operation period, the MIOX disinfection system would be considered surplus. DCWA would have first right to purchase.   City of Port Angeles Industrial Diversion    The infiltration gallery and water treatment facilities would be operated and maintained by a contractor as a project facility. At the end of the operating period, the title to the infiltration gallery would be transferred to the city of Port Angeles and the water treatment facilities would be declared surplus and removed.   City of Port Angeles Municipal Diversion    The new Ranney collector and the temporary filtration plant would be operated as project facilities, and project power would be supplied to operate the temporary filtration plant. Actual operation of the new Ranney collector would be contracted to the city. Operation of the temporary filter plant and the DCWA booster pumps would be by contract; possibly with the city. The filter plant is not included in the Dredge and Slurry alternative. Additional negotiation will be required to determine relationships and rights of the city and DCWA.   Fish Hatchery    The new water supply facilities for the fish hatchery would be operated by the Tribe.         COSTS    Construction Costs    Construction cost estimates in this report are based on an April 1995 price level and include contingencies and indirect costs. Also included in the total construction cost are design of facilities and construction management.   The total construction cost of the measures selected to mitigate water quality is estimated at $31,015,000 for the River Erosion alternative and $27,895,000 for the Dredge and Slurry alternative. Not included in this total is the cost for water quality monitoring. The amount of the monitoring program that can be attributed to water quality is $1,000,000 for the River Erosion alternative and $650,000 for the Dredge and Slurry alternative.

Application of value engineering procedures have the potential to further reduce costs. It is unlikely that costs would increase due to some unforseen element.       OM&P Costs    OM&P costs include all costs to operate project facilities during the project operation period of 1 to 5 years for either action alternative. Because of the short operating period, replacement was not considered and no replacement costs were included. Power costs are based on current rates to users. The total cost for OM&P during the project operation period is estimated at $3,400,000 for the River Erosion alternative and $1,204,000 for the Dredge and Slurry alternative.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS    Implementation of the following mitigation measures would have environmental impacts ranging from below detectable levels to minor. These are the water quality monitoring program, well filters and bottled water for individual well owners, and temporary in-line treatment system for the EPHA. The major impact would be a slight increase in road traffic due to installation and maintenance of facilities. Environmental impacts for drilling new wells would be slight and limited to the construction period.   Environmental effects of the new Ranney collector and associated facilities to connect to the Port Angeles municipal supply and the DCWA would be slight and limited primarily to the construction period. If constructed at the same time as new facilities for the industrial water supply, the incremental construction impacts would be minor.   Impacts for construction of a new water supply for the Tribal fish hatchery would be minor and limited to the construction period but would require instream work and careful timing to limit potential construction impacts to aquatic organisms. Noise and increased traffic at the site would be of limited duration.   The major impacts of mitigation measures is associated with construction and operation of facilities for the industrial water supply to the Daishowa and Rayonier mills.   Impacts on the main roads approaching the site would be significant. The increased construction traffic, both in terms of type and volume, would necessitate working with County and local planning entities to ensure roads and highways are safe and maintained in good condition throughout the construction period. The paved road leading to the WDFW fish rearing channel and the river would require improvements for safety during construction and for permanent use after the project.   Noise and visual impacts would be limited primarily to construction traffic and the construction site during the construction period. After the construction is completed there would be negligible impacts.   The sediment model indicates that there would be about 825 days of clear water (historic levels of TSS) and 394 days of elevated levels of TSS in the 3 year and 4 month-period modeled for the action alternatives. Treatment of the water would involve adding polymer suspensions that include petroleum distillates. Sediments that are generated would include those chemicals along with the natural fine sediments suspended in the water. For the River Erosion alternative, treatment of 65 mgd at the industrial diversion would generate an estimated 550,000 cubic yards of sediments with 20-percent solids (see appendix R). This assumes that the infiltration gallery would reduce water turbidity by 77 percent. The weight of fines and added water-treatment chemicals in the sediments would be about 102,000 tons dry and would occupy about 551,000 cubic yards (at 20 percent solids and a specific gravity of the solids of 1.1). This amounts to about 450 cubic yards per day over a 3.3-year period at a pumping rate of 20 gpm. The Dredge and Slurry alternative would result in about 20 percent of the sediments produced with the River Erosion alternative.   In actual operation, the rate of sediment accumulation would vary with the concentration of suspended solids in the river water which would be expected to increase with flow rate. As a result, the rate of sediment removal would also increase with river flow and the amount of suspended solids carried by the river. The sediments would be pumped from the bottom of the sedimentation basins to a holding area and then pumped about 300 feet to a point near the middle of the river cross section.   River flow in the reach where the sediments would be added is estimated to be a minimum of 500 cfs (224,400 gpm). At a sediment flow of about 20 gpm, the dilution rate would be so great that addition of sediments would not significantly change the water quality of the river and, in most cases, would not be measurable. As river flows increase and suspended sediment concentration increases, the rate of pumping of accumulated sediment could increase with no measurable affect on water quality. At the dilutions envisioned, it is anticipated that the chemicals added in the treatment process would have little if any significant or measurable affect on water quality or aquatic organisms.     CHAPTER V.  MITIGATION CONSIDERATIONS          FORMULATION STEPS    The first step in identifying potential mitigation measures is to identify the specific water quality factors that would be affected. Major changes with either action alternative in the short term were identified as increased concentrations of suspended and dissolved solids including inorganic and organic compounds. There would also be some change in the pH, temperature, and concentration of dissolved oxygen. Physical and chemical analyses of sediments from Lake Mills (see appendix K) indicate that a large percentage of the sediments are clay- and silt-sized and that dissolved iron and manganese exist in high concentrations in the pore water of lakebed sediment.   Although extensive modeling has been accomplished, it is difficult to predict the exact pattern of sediment release as it would be directly related to the timing of dam-removal activities, precipitation/river flow, and erodability of lakebed sediment. Sediment release during dam removal would be monitored and demolition activities could be adjusted to limit riverbed aggradation and possibly TSS levels.   Suspended solids are expected to be the primary problem for industrial water users. The smaller particles would be colloidal rock flour and a portion could be expected to enter infiltration galleries. These particles could also enter some wells located near the river, but probably at a much lower rate than at infiltration galleries.   Iron and manganese may adversely affect some downstream water users. Adverse effects include bad taste, colored water, stains from iron and/or manganese, and accumulation of minerals in water supply facilities. High concentrations could interfere with some chemical reactions in industrial processes. Actual concentrations of iron and manganese in waters released during dam removal would be a function of flows and other factors.   The rise in the water table that will accompany aggradation of the lower river reaches may also have an effect on water quality.   The second step in identifying potential mitigation is to determine the level of water quality to be met. The goal of the Act is that the quality of the delivered water remain unchanged from that with the dams operating. Since the historic levels of TSS and TDS have varied widely and operations are expected to be costly, some type of accounting system is needed.   The third step is to identify and evaluate measures that would meet the goal in an effective and acceptable manner and at the least cost. Identifying and evaluating measures for individual well owners and septic systems in the lower valley was generally straightforward. Potential flooding effects related to river aggradation have been generally addressed in other technical documents. In addition, the Elwha Fish Restoration Plan (National Park Service, 1996) addresses expansion and renovation of the Tribal fish hatchery, rearing fish at other facilities, and closure of the WDFW fish rearing channel for the short term. As a result, most of the identification and evaluation phase focused on the city of Port Angeles industrial water supply and the municipal supplies for the city and the DCWA.   Identification and selection of mitigation methods were based on project research, experience, engineering judgement, laboratory tests, and comparisons of cost effectiveness. Best case to worst case estimates of effects were developed and various increments and combinations of measures were developed to provide a range of options.   Mitigation measures not selected for implementation were dropped for one or more of the following reasons: (1) another option was equally effective and less costly; (2) the option was considered infeasible for some physical reason, (3) the option was found not to be needed; or (4) the option was likely unacceptable because of local concerns.         TREATED WATER OBJECTIVE    Prior to the design of water treatment facilities, the baseline conditions and desired level of treatment were established. These standards are vital to minimizing treatment costs and to avoiding possible claims of degraded water quality. The general decision for formulation purposes was that treated water during the short term should be of the same quality as in the past. For domestic use this poses little problem as the quality of water obtained from most wells has remained fairly constant.   For the industrial diversion, the major difficulty is that the concentration of suspended solids varies widely over time. Both Rayonier and Daishowa have filter plants which use chemical addition (alum and polymer), flocculation, and filtration to remove undesirable sediment and turbidity. These existing facilities provide a low level of TSS (less than 5 mg/L) for the pulping process. The level of treatment is adjusted as necessary to achieve the required water quality.   Achieving water quality mitigation with a zero balance — no adverse effect and no benefit to the user compared with the historic water quality — is difficult, but two methods were identified. The method selected requires an accounting system to deliver the historic average water quality to the mills. The second method requires estimating natural turbidity levels based on streamflow to deliver the water quality that would have resulted in the absence of dam removal.   Historic Average Turbidity    The selected approach consists of accounting yearly turbidity values using a baseline of 11 years. The objective with this approach is to provide water to the mills with a turbidity statistically equivalent to the prior 11-year average. If this method is implemented, concurrence from the WDOE, the city of Port Angeles, and the two mills would be obtained prior to dam removal.   Turbidity readings from the new gauge at RM 16.2 (time delayed for travel) would be used to set the target turbidity level to be reached by treatment for daily and hourly operation. Real-time gauging station measurements, telemetry, and landline data communication to the automated controls at the pre-treatment site would be employed, and the data communications and process control responses would be remotely monitored. The actual target turbidity for treated water would be turbidity measured at the upstream gauge minus the historic reductions attributable to operation of Lake Mills and Lake Aldwell. The historic reduction is calculated by comparing the measurements from the gauge with equivalent mill and city river turbidity measurements for the period of record prior to initiation of dam removal. A turbidimeter would record the turbidity of the effluent from the treatment plant and would be used as a check on the measured mill turbidities.   The operating goal would be to deliver treated water that has an average turbidity between the highest annual average and the lowest annual average of a 10-year baseline. Average turbidity of delivered water over semi-annual periods would be calculated. If this calculation indicates that the treated water is outside the goal, the level of treatment during the next period would be adjusted to move the average turbidity back toward the center. After the second semi-annual period, a running average would be maintained.   Turbidity-Flow Equations    An alternate approach is to define the mathematical relationship between turbidity and riverflow and use that relationship for treatment of water. This approach is not recommended at present because the relationship cannot be fully described. If this approach were to be selected, additional research would be needed to develop equations for high flow events that follow in close sequence, to account for other factors such as precipitation, wildfire, and landslides, and to develop algorithms for water treatment.   Scatter graphs of flow and turbidity at the mill diversion were prepared and are included as appendix N. Values above 50 NTU and 10,000 cfs, although valid, were omitted from the graphs to use a scale that better shows relationships.   This analysis indicates that there is a fairly predictable relationship between flow and turbidity when flows are 2,000 cfs or less. At higher flows, turbidity tends to increase with flows but fluctuates widely. Three of many discrete high-flow events were graphed for analysis and are included as appendix O. During these high-flow events, flow increases but turbidity lags, flow peaks and begins to decline but turbidity continues to increase, and, as flow continues to decrease, turbidity decreases. In these events, the flow peaks rapidly but subsides at a much lower rate.   When the river flow is neither rapidly rising nor falling, much of the data can be reasonably accommodated by the following equation:  T  = 0.7 – (5.31 x 10 -5 Q)  + (2.19 x 10 -6 Q 2 )  where:     T is turbidity in NTU  Q is river flow in cfs.  During changing flows, a two-part equation defining the relationship between Elwha River flow and turbidity was found. During a rising flow event the equation is:  T  = 0.7 – (5.09 x 10 -5  Q) + (4.13 x 10 -7 Q 2 )  and during a falling flow, immediately preceded by a fairly steady flow, the equation is:  T  = 0.7 – (1.48 x 10 -7  Q) + (5.49 x 10 -6 Q 2 )   INFILTRATION GALLERY DESIGN    An infiltration gallery for the industrial diversion was selected on the basis that this measure would eliminate fish passage problems at the existing diversion dam and would greatly decrease sediment concentrations in the diverted water. In the short term, this decrease would reduce the cost for chemical treatment during the project operation period and in the long term would eliminate the need for chemical treatment to achieve current levels of suspended sediment.   The Elwha River sub-base material basically consists of clean sands and gravel below the present armored layer, so it is possible to replace the existing diversion structure with an infiltration gallery. The infiltration gallery must deliver a diversion of at least 100 cfs during the dam removal period and 150 cfs afterwards, with sufficient head to meet the required water surface elevation of 62.0 feet at the existing intake to the 72-inch-diameter industrial supply pipeline. A critical element in the design of the infiltration gallery is the head loss anticipated with treatment facilities. This head loss was estimated at 3.7 feet for treating a water delivery of 100 cfs to the industrial mills.   Preliminary Design    A preliminary design used three perforated pipes, each about 1,800 feet long, buried in the river bed with a spacing of 25 feet and parallel to the river centerline. Cleaning accumulated sediments from the long pipelines would be difficult and possibly impractical. Failure of a pipeline would result in a loss of one-third of the capacity. This design was dropped in favor of the design discussed in chapter IV which includes eight laterals and provisions to isolate and clean each lateral in case of blockage.   Gravity Flow Potential    The infiltration gallery design selected for implementation provides a 100 percent safety factor (delivery capacity twice that of maximum demand) based on pumping to meet the required flow of 100 cfs with temporary treatment facilities in place and 150 cfs after the temporary treatment facilities are removed. A pumping design, which does not allow for gravity flow, was selected because gravity flow operation with the treatment facilities in place appeared unlikely based on the physical constraints of the site.   After removal of the treatment facilities, operation with gravity flow is possible. Modification of the current design to allow gravity flow at that time may be desirable to eliminate OM&P costs associated with the pumping plant. Construction of a bypass around the pumps would allow a maximum discharge by gravity flow of about 79 cfs when using all 8 laterals; not enough to meet the demand.   An option would be to replace the 54-inch-diameter discharge pipeline with a 72-inch-diameter pipeline and construct a 72-inch-diameter pipeline to bypass the pumping plant. The bypass pipeline would include two 72-inch-diameter butterfly valves with motor operators. This option could provide a flow of 164 cfs when using all 8 laterals. This would provide virtually no safety factor for the total diversion requirement of 150 cfs with the WDFW fish rearing channel in operation and abandonment of the pumping plant at that time would be unacceptable from a design viewpoint. However, if operation of the WDFW fish rearing channel is discontinued in the future, the safety factor would be 64 percent for a demand of 100 cfs. This safety factor with gravity flow is less than the current pumping design of 100 percent but may be acceptable.

The effectiveness of various chemicals was evaluated by jar tests in a laboratory. These tests used a 30,000 parts per million (ppm) suspension of sediment obtained from Lake Mills and various flocculants. A target turbidity for treated water was set at 11 NTU.   The tests found that alum or lime treatment alone would be ineffective and that treatment with a polymer at a concentration of 15 to 20 ppm, or at a lower concentration with alum or lime, is effective. Flocculated material settled relatively rapidly (3 to 30 minutes) as would be required for use in an industrial water diversion. A polymer alone would be effective in reducing the water turbidity anticipated during and immediately following dam removal to historic levels. Results of specific jar tests are included in appendix P.   The flocculant used in the jar testing equipment, Cytec Magnifloc® 1906N (CAS 064742-47-8) is a nonionic polyacrylamide in water-in-oil emulsion using a petroleum distillate of hydrotreated light kerosene. If alum (CAS 10043-01-3) is utilized in the water treatment system, even under low river flow conditions, the small amounts of alum or polymer in the sediments is not expected to impact the river water quality to a harmful degree. River water quality downstream from the sediments outfall would be monitored for dissolved oxygen, nitrates, nitrites, sulfates, total and dissolved aluminum, alkalinity, pH, and bacteria to verify these predictions.   Alternate coagulants that have been considered to date are Nalco Nalclear® 8181, and Betz Polymer 2651 and Polymer 2189. Additional information on these is included in appendix Q.   Appendix R includes information on anticipated sediment concentrations and approximate dosages of alum and polymer. Suspended sediment concentrations are based on conditions found during June 1989 to September 1992, a period of high sediment concentration. Reclamation staff estimate average dosages of 5 mg/L of alum and 7 mg/L of polymer (a total of 12 mg/L of chemicals) would be needed to meet the water quality requirements of the mills. The amounts of chemical needed and costs in appendix R are based on the River Erosion alternative. The total amount of chemical used with the Dredge and Slurry alternative would be about 20 percent of that used for the River Erosion alternative.   Design and Operation of Facilities    Where applicable, all treatment units are designed to meet the rules and regulations of the WDH. Facilities have been designed to minimize impacts to the surrounding area.   Complete (100 percent) redundancy of all units is provided. Standard water treatment criteria adopted by most states were used in the designs for velocity control, and baffle plates were included in the rapid-mix and flocculation tanks to assure flow distribution across the cross-sectional area.   Ultrasonic flow meters were chosen because they do not require long lengths of pipe to achieve accurate results as do some propeller-type meters, and magnetic meters do not perform well at the anticipated high concentrations of colloids.   It was assumed that Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams would be removed in a manner which minimizes significant and sudden increases in turbidity and that the rate at which sediment leaves each reservoir area would be a function of streamflow, erodability, and the pace and timing of dam lowering. A sedimentation model was used to predict potential levels of sediment in the river. This model assumed a period of 3 years and 4 months (1,219 days) and used river flows for the water years 1989–92.   Disposal of sediments by pumping to the river was selected because there is no land available for disposal near the treatment site, and off-site disposal would be costly and have an adverse impact on the community. Flocculated colloidal material would be removed from the sedimentation basins and returned to the Elwha River on a continuous basis over a period of 3 to 4 years following removal of the dams. The rate of discharge of sediments to the river would vary directly with river flow and the concentration of suspended sediments in the diverted water.   Treatment Facility Hydraulic Losses    Determining hydraulic losses of the treatment facility is necessary to assure that the water supply facilities have sufficient design capacity. The total head loss estimated for the treatment facility is 3.7 feet for a flow of 100 cfs. Incremental head losses of the treatment facility are discussed below.   Three existing slide gates, just downstream of the tunnel outlet, can be used in conjunction with the rapid-mix basin entrance gate, to form a constant head orifice measuring system. For design purposes it is assumed that the constant head orifice would be set for a head loss of 0.3 feet.   Water would pass into one of the two rapid-mix basins through an 8-foot by 5-foot slide gate (with a 0.2-foot head loss). The water then would move through the basin, flow over an adjustable weir (with a 0.9-foot head loss), and pass through an 8-foot-wide trough (with a 0.1-foot head loss) to one of the flocculation basins. The adjustable weir may be designed to be lowered to reduce head loss when the pretreatment facilities are not in use. Total head loss for the rapid-mix basin is estimated at 1.2 feet.   Water would enter the flocculation basin through an 8-foot by 5-foot gate, with a 0.2-foot head loss. At an average velocity of 0.5 feet per second, there would be no friction loss through the flocculation basins. The water would leave the flocculation basin through a 14-foot by 5-foot gate, with a 0.07-foot head loss, into a 14-foot wide trough, with a 0.03-foot head loss, which would move the water to one of two sedimentation basins. Total head loss for the flocculation basin is estimated at 0.3 feet.   Flow through the sedimentation basins would be so slow that there would be no friction loss. Water would enter the basins through a 10-foot by 7-foot gate, with a 0.07-foot head loss. At the end of the sedimentation basins, water would be skimmed from the surface into sixteen, 100-foot-long troughs. At the end of the troughs, the water would free-fall into the pool immediately upstream of the industrial diversion screen house, with a 1.8-foot head loss. Total head loss for the sedimentation basins is approximately 1.9 feet.   OPTIONS NOT SELECTED    Individual Wells    An option to providing filters at some wells and bottled water to well owners is to more extensively modify some wells to avoid the infiltration of fine solids and water with potentially high manganese and iron concentration. This measure was dropped as being too costly.   DCWA Water Supply    An alternative to connecting the DCWA system to the city of Port Angeles Ranney system is to abandon the two shallowest wells (No. 1 and No. 2); drill a new well further from the river;   equip the new well and Well No. 4 with pumps and ancillary equipment; and construct a new chlorine station and filtration treatment system.   This option was eliminated as land easements and physical space for the new well and treatment system are problems that would be difficult to address and the option is not cost effective.   Industrial Water Supply    Temporary Settling Basin    This measure was identified as a possible add-on to the measures selected for implementation. The WDFW fish rearing channel would be lined with an impermeable geotextile and modified to create a large settling basin. Treated water would be diverted into a stilling well at one end, with clarified water pumped from the other end back to the open channel at the existing screen house. The additional holding time would allow chemically flocculated sediment to settle out. Settled solids would be removed and discharged along with material collected from the open channel treatment facilities.   This measure was dropped from consideration on the basis that the selected treatment measures would be effective. If additional treatment of water is needed, this measure could be implemented at an added cost.   Temporary Sand Filters    This measure is an add-on that would be an alternative to the Temporary Settling Basin. The WDFW fish rearing channel would be lined with an impermeable membrane and filled with sand and gravel. Chemically treated water from the open channel would be diverted to the modified rearing channel for treated water to percolate through the filter materials, physically removing solid particles from the water. The clarified water would be returned to the open-channel system and filtered sediment would be slurried with the open-channel material back to the river along with some of the filter sand and gravels. Periodic cleaning (backflushing) and replacement of filter materials would be required.   This option was dropped as unnecessary.   Three-day Storage    This measure would provide clear water for 3 days of operation (126 million gallons) for use during high turbidity periods as an alternative to treating water with a very high TSS concentration. A steel storage tank would be constructed to store clarified river water from the open-channel, pre-industrial treatment system. During periods of large increases in turbidity, stored water could be diverted into the delivery pipeline or blended with processed water to achieve an acceptable level of suspended solids. Water to fill the storage tank would be supplied by the excess capacity of the open-channel, pre-industrial treatment system during periods of lower TSS concentration.   This option was dropped from further consideration as ineffective. The sediment management investigation team estimated that the periods of high sediment concentration could last for weeks or months.   Permanent Treatment Plant    This measure is an alternative to the open channel, pre-industrial treatment measure selected for implementation. It includes dual-media gravity filters for rapid filtration and a clear well with low-head pumps. The dual media rapid filtration cells would be constructed downstream from the gravity settling basin. Water partially clarified in the settling basin would flow through the dual-media filters for mechanical removal of additional solids, and then move to a clear well for pumping into the industrial delivery pipeline. The gravity filters would be automatically backwashed as they become loaded with sediment. Backwash water would be returned with the settled solids to the Elwha River downstream from the existing Ranney collector. This filtration system would be remotely monitored and controlled through telemetry to minimize on-site operations. The plant would be sized for anticipated peak loads during the dam removal period. Afterwards, it would be underutilized. A permanent, all-weather access road would be needed.   This option was eliminated as too costly.   Pipeline from Upstream of Lake Mills    A pipeline would be constructed to convey water from upstream of Lake Mills to the industrial diversion. Although the water would contain much lower TSS and TDS than river water downstream, treatment facilities and treatment would still be required to meet current water quality levels.   This measure was eliminated from further consideration on the basis of high costs for installation and later removal, unacceptability of intrusion into the National Park, and potential operation and maintenance problems.   New Diversion Structure With Fish Passage    This measure is an optional diversion facility for the industrial diversion. A permanent diversion structure with fish passage and protection facilities would be constructed to continue to allow diversion of water and up and downstream movement of anadromous fish. The diversion structure could be constructed of concrete or other materials and include a movable crest to create the necessary water surface elevation to meet industrial diversion flow requirements during low flow periods. Current criteria for fish passage and protective facilities would be used.   This measure was eliminated from further consideration as the water treatment costs would be much higher than for the selected alternative.   Well Field    A well field was considered as an alternative to the infiltration gallery. With this measure, a series of closely spaced wells would be developed along the right riverbank in the same river reach as selected for the infiltration gallery. These wells would be shallow and completed in the river alluvium to ensure a direct hydraulic connection to riverflow. The well field would include several backup wells for emergency operations and well maintenance. Water would be pumped into a common header for distribution similar to the infiltration gallery approach. Other features such as access roads, turbidity control, electrical supply, piping, and emergency generation would be similar to the infiltration gallery approach. This alternative was rejected because the costs for operation, maintenance, and power for pumping appeared greater than the selected alternative.         City of Port Angeles Municipal Water Supply    Three-Day Storage    This option would provide 21 million gallons of clear water (enough water for at least 3 days) for use during very high turbidity periods. This is an alternative to treating water with a very high concentration of TSS.   A steel tank for water storage would be constructed and used to store water. During periods of high turbidity, the stored water would be diverted to the delivery pipeline at a blending rate suitable to reach an acceptable level of turbidity.   This option was dropped from further consideration as ineffective when the sediment management investigation team estimated that periods of high sediment concentration could last for weeks or months.   Permanent Treatment Plant    This measure is an option to the iron treatment-bacteria filtration measure selected for implementation. It was formulated to address concern that fine sediments and iron and manganese would plug the zone of infiltration for Ranney collectors.   The conventional water treatment plant with a design life of 25 to 35 years would be constructed to process surface water to provide acceptable water quality for residential use. It is likely the plant would be needed for only 1 to 5 years, when the city could resume the use of the existing municipal water supply system. During operation of the water treatment plant the Ranney collector would remain idle.   This option was dropped from further consideration because plugging of the infiltration area for the Ranney collector is unlikely, the measure is not cost effective, and a site for the plant is not readily available.   Elwha Place Homeowners Association    Connection of the EPHA system to the new Ranney collector proposed for the city of Port Angeles and DCWA was considered. This option was dropped because it is more expensive than the selected alternative.   Tribal Fish Hatchery    Providing a water supply using sand filters was briefly identified as a potential. Additional treatment would still be needed to reduce suspended solids to meet hatchery requirements. The only means of treating the large amounts of water required is with chemical flocculants. However, the fish may not be able to tolerate the treated water. As a result these measures were found to be unacceptable.

Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams block anadromous fish passage to more than 70 miles of the Elwha River and its tributaries, limiting anadromous fish to the lower 4.9 river miles. Lake Aldwell, formed behind Elwha Dam in 1913, stores an estimated 4 million cubic yards (myd 3 ) of sediment. Further upstream, Lake Mills was created in 1927 with the closure of Glines Canyon Dam and contains an estimated 14 myd 3  of sediment.   Removal of these dams requires development and analysis of alternative plans to manage the reservoir sediment and analysis of the effects of re-establishing the natural sediment supply to the Elwha River downstream of the dams. Removing the dams in controlled increments and allowing reservoir sediment to erode and be transported downstream through natural processes is the alternative evaluated in this report. The impacts of this alternative on the river’s sediment concentration, riverbed aggradation, and corresponding increases in flood stage were predicted from results of reservoir drawdown testing at Lake Mills and a series of computer models.   Model results predicted that 15–35 percent of the coarse sediment (sand, gravel, and cobbles) and about half of the fine sediment (silt- and clay-size particles) would be eroded from the two reservoirs because of dam removal. The remaining sediment would be left behind along the reservoir margins as a series of terraces. Fine sediment concentrations released from the reservoirs would be high during periods of dam removal, typically 200–1,000 ppm but occasionally as high as 30,000–50,000 ppm. Release concentrations would be relatively low — less than 200 ppm — during periods of high lake inflow when dam removal activities and lake drawdown would stop. After the dams are removed, fine sediment concentrations would be low and near natural conditions during periods of low flow. Concentrations would be high during progressively higher floodflows as erosion channels widen in the reservoir areas. Within 2 to 5 years, concentrations would return to natural levels.   Coarse sediment would aggrade in river pools in the relatively steep reach between the two lakes and would increase 100-year-flood stages up to 0.5 feet. In the more mild slope reach below Elwha Dam, general riverbed aggradation would occur which would likely cause the river to migrate laterally, especially near the mouth. Over the short term (up to five years), this could potentially increase river stages during the 100-year flood 0–3 feet, depending on location, with an average increase of less than 1 foot. Over the long term (50 years), aggradation could continue and increase existing river stages during the 100-year flood 0–5 feet (depending on location) with an average increase of 2.5 feet. Coarse sediment would enlarge the delta at the river’s mouth to a size and character similar to that of predam conditions.   With monitoring and mitigation, the ""river erosion alternative"" constitutes a viable sediment management plan for the removal of Glines Canyon and Elwha Dams. Extensive monitoring and control of the dam removal rate are needed to manage or avoid problems with riverbed aggradation, flooding, and water quality.     CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION       The U.S. Department of the Interior (Interior) is considering plans to purchase and remove two privately owned hydroelectric dams for the purpose of restoring the ecosystem and native anadromous fisheries. The dams are located on the Elwha River in and adjacent to Olympic National Park (Park), Washington. The construction of Elwha and Glines Canyon dams has blocked anadromous fish passage to more than 70 miles of the Elwha River and its tributaries, limiting anadromous fish habitat to the lower 4.9 river miles.   Congress passed the Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act (the Act), which became Public Law 102–495 when signed by the President in October 1992. The goal of the Act is the "" ¼ full restoration of the Elwha River ecosystem and native anadromous fisheries."" The Act directed the Secretary of the Interior to study ways to restore the anadromous fisheries and the ecosystem of the Elwha River. The resultant study, named  The Elwha Report, Restoration of the Elwha River Ecosystem & Native Anadromous Fisheries  (Interior et al., 1994) determined that removing Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams was feasible and necessary to restore the fisheries and ecosystem. Removal of these dams requires the development and analysis of alternative plans to manage the reservoir sediment and analysis of the effects of re-establishing the natural sediment supply to the Elwha River downstream of the dams.   The ""river erosion alternative"" is removing the dams in controlled increments and allowing riverflows to erode the reservoir sediment and transport them downstream. Riverflow and sediment conditions of the reservoirs and river would be extensively monitored during and after dam removal. The rate of sediment release from the reservoirs would be controlled by controlling the rate of dam removal. The impacts of this alternative on the sediment concentration, riverbed aggradation (and any corresponding increases in flood stage), and the reservoir topography and landscape are evaluated in this report.         A. STUDY PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE    The purpose of this study is to provide supporting information for the Olympic National Park’s environmental impact statement on the implementation of Elwha River Ecosystem Restoration Project. The objective of this study is to evaluate and describe the sediment-related impacts of the river erosion alternative.         B. REPORT ORGANIZATION    This report is organized into four parts.

Part 4 presents the overall report conclusions and is intended for those readers who have a general interest in the Elwha River Restoration Project.         C. EXISTING CONDITIONS    1. Basin hydrology and river channel characteristics  — The Elwha River is a coarse-bed stream located on the Olympic Peninsula of northwestern Washington state. The river flows northward 45 miles from the base of Mount Olympus to the Strait of Juan de Fuca (Strait) near Port Angeles, Washington (location map). The river is steep (with an average slope of 1.9 percent) and falls about 4,500 feet in elevation. It is the fourth largest river on the Olympic Peninsula and its watershed includes more than 100 miles of stream channel. The watershed has a drainage area of 321 square miles — 83 percent of that in the Park (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [FERC], 1993; Interior et al., 1994). The watershed upstream from Lake Mills is entirely within a federally designated wilderness area and also inside the Park.   The maritime climate of the area is characterized by mild, wet winters and relatively cool, dry summers. Annual precipitation in the watershed ranges from 220 inches in its upper reaches to 56 inches near the river’s mouth. The average daily discharge is about 1,500 cubic feet per second (cfs) (U.S. Geological Survey [USGS], 1993). Minimum flows typically occur during summer and range from about 300 to 500 cfs. High flows are typical from November through February and from May through June. The 2-year flood is 13,000 cfs and the 100-year flood is 42,800 cfs (Reclamation, March 1995).   Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams were constructed on the Elwha River to provide hydroelectric power for development of the Olympic Peninsula in the early 1900's. The dams are operated as run-of-the-river facilities and provide 38 percent of the power used by the Daishowa America Co., Ltd. Port Angeles paper mill (FERC, 1993).   Elwha Dam, at river mile †  (RM) 5, was constructed 1910–13. This 105-foot-high concrete gravity dam forms Lake Aldwell, which has a capacity of 8,000 acre-feet. Glines Canyon Dam, at RM 13.5, was constructed 1925–27. This 210-foot-high, concrete arch dam forms Lake Mills, which has a capacity of 40,500 acre-feet (FERC, 1993). Both lakes are maintained at or near full capacity and are not operated for flood control purposes.   As of 1994, it was estimated that 13.8 million cubic yards (myd 3 ) of sediment were trapped in Lake Mills — the upstream reservoir — and 3.9 myd 3  of sediment was trapped in Lake Aldwell — the downstream reservoir (Reclamation, August 1995). Of the total 17.7 myd 3  of sediment, about half (52 percent) is fine (clay- and silt-sized) and the other half (48 percent) is coarse (sand, gravel, and cobbles sediment). The division between fine and coarse sediment used in this report is 0.075 mm, which is the same standard used in  Alluvium Distribution in Lake Mills, Glines Canyon Project and Lake Aldwell, Elwha Project, Washington  (Reclamation, August 1995).   The Elwha River’s slope is greatest at the headwaters (about 16 percent above RM 43) and is less steep downstream (Hosey, 1988). The river flows through several steep, narrow, bedrock canyons between wide alluvial reaches of more mild slope. The reach near the mouth has the widest floodplain and mildest slope.   The alluvial reaches of the Elwha River upstream from Lake Mills are dynamic. Bank erosion and channel migration create gravel and cobbles bars that erode and later re-form (Hosey, 1988). Downstream from the dams, which trap the coarse sediment, sands and gravels have been eroded and this once dynamic reach is now relatively stable.   Upstream from Lake Mills, riverbed material consists of sand, gravel, cobbles, boulders, and bedrock outcrops. The river bed has likely eroded sand, gravel, and small cobbles from the riverbed downstream from both dams, following dam closure, and now consists primarily of large cobbles, boulders, and bedrock. Because of riverbed armoring and the lack of gravel-sized sediment, current fish spawning habitat is limited to a few side channels near the mouth and riffles up to RM 3 (B. Winter, Olympic National Park, WA, oral communication, 1995).   Between Glines Canyon Dam (RM 13.5) and RM 4.0 (below Elwha Dam), bedrock controls the river gradient. Post-dam river flows have produced extensive armoring and stabilization of the active channel (Reclamation, March 1996). In this reach, almost 40 percent of the armor layer consists of boulders (300 mm or larger), about 50 percent is cobbles (75 to 300 mm), and about 10 percent is composed of gravel with traces of sand (less than 75 mm).   In the reach between the two lakes, the present river slope does not appreciably differ from the 1926 river slope, indicating that significant channel incision below Glines Canyon Dam has not occurred. Comparisons of channel configurations from present aerial photographs and pre-project river survey maps show that excessive channel migration has not occurred and the channel configuration has indeed been fixed by the canyon reaches (Reclamation, March 1996; Hosey, 1988).   The reach of the Elwha River between RM 4.0 and RM 2.5 was identified by Reclamation (March 1996) as a short transition reach between bedrock control of the upper reach and more alluvial reach downstream. Only about 10 percent of the armor layer consists of boulders, 75 percent is cobbles, and about 15 percent is gravel with traces of sand.   Between RM 2.5 and the mouth (RM 0.0), bedrock control of the river gradient is absent and post-dam river flows have produced moderate channel migration and channel down-cutting. The Elwha River channel widens and is entrenched in relatively easily eroded glacial deposits. Channel armoring is present in this reach, but is not as well-developed nor as coarse-grained as in the upper reach. No boulders were observed in the riverbed. About 55 percent of the bed is cobbles and about 45 percent is gravel with some sand.   There are four sets of fluvial terraces associated with the Elwha River (Reclamation, March 1996). Terrace deposits are generally exposed 3–18 feet above river level and adjacent to the river channel. These terraces predate the dams and represent predam sediment gradations along the floodplains of the Elwha River. The terraces contain few boulders, about 30 percent cobbles, about 35 percent gravel (5 to 75 mm), about 20 percent sand (0.075 to 5 mm), and about 10 percent silt- and clay-sized material (less than 0.075 mm). The elevations of these four terraces above river level are 3–4 feet, 5–7 feet, 10–12 feet, and 15–18 feet. The lower terraces may reflect erosion of the Elwha River bed following construction of the upstream dams.   Prior to dam construction, an extensive delta had formed at the mouth. For thousands of years, strong ocean currents in the Strait transported sediment from this delta eastward to form Ediz Hook — a spit of land that protects the natural harbor at Port Angeles. With completion of Elwha Dam in 1913, the amount of sediment reaching the river delta and Ediz Hook was significantly reduced and the delta and hook began to erode (Schwartz, 1994). Large boulders have been placed to protect the hook’s shoreline from erosion. However, this shoreline protection measure requires long-term maintenance.   2. Existing infrastructure  — All facilities and structures along the Elwha River are downstream from Glines Canyon Dam. These include:  · Roads and bridges (including county, State and Federal highways);   · Electrical transmission lines;   · Flood control levees;   · Private residences;   · A diversion dam and water intake for two Port Angeles mills;   · City of Port Angeles Ranney collector;   · Dry Creek Water Association well;   · Private wells;   · Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) Fish-rearing channel;   · Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe (the Tribe) lands, homes, tribal center, and fish hatchery; and   · Olympic National Park campgrounds, Elwha work station, ranger station, and park entrance.   3. Cultural resources  — The Elwha River valley is rich in cultural resources with human occupation dating from prehistoric times. These cultural resources include historic and prehistoric archeological sites and tribal traditional cultural properties (including natural landforms and traditional fishing sites). Both Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (National Park Service, 1994).        CHAPTER II. SEDIMENT MANAGEMENT ISSUES          Sediment management issues related to Elwha River restoration have been described by Randle and Lyons (1995). The amount and rate of reservoir sediment released downstream during and following dam removal influences both short- and long-term impacts. Over the short term, the release of fine lakebed sediment (silt- and clay-sized material) would affect water quality (suspended sediment concentration and turbidity). Release of coarse delta sediment would affect flood stage, channel migration, and the coastal shoreline including Ediz Hook (Schwartz, 1994). Gravels released from the reservoirs would help restore suitable fish habitat in downstream reaches. Over the long term, predam sediment regimes would be re-established. This would restore the river channel downstream from the dams to their predam character (i.e., a gravel-bed channel with more dynamic shifts in the bed and banks during floodflows).         A. WATER QUALITY AND GROUND WATER    Because of the pristine character of the watershed, water quality issues are primarily related to suspended sediment concentration and turbidity. This water quality issue is important to municipal, industrial, and private water users as well as to fish and the aquatic environment of the river and estuary. Water quality would primarily be affected by the erosion and release of silt and clay-sized sediment from the reservoirs and by re-establishment of the natural (predam) sediment loads downstream.   Landslides and short-duration floods result in episodic sediment loads in the Elwha Basin. Native anadromous fish evolved under these conditions and are expected to do well in a restored ecosystem. However, long-term water treatment for existing water users may be required because the present water supply infrastructure was developed since the dams were built and the reservoirs began trapping sediment. The Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act requires the "" ¼ protection of the existing quality and availability of water from the Elwha River for municipal and industrial uses from possible adverse impacts of dam removal.""   Mitigation would be required to protect water quality for downstream water users, including the surface water diversions of two Port Angeles mills and the WDFW fish-rearing channel. Mitigation may also be necessary for wells adjacent to the river. Water quality and the proposed mitigation measures are addressed in  Water Quality Analyses and Mitigation Alternatives, Elwha River Dam Removal  (Reclamation, October 1996).         B. RIVERBED AGGRADATION, HABITAT, AND INCREASED FLOODING    Downstream from the dams, the riverbed primarily consists of boulders, cobbles, and bedrock. However, gravels are needed to provide suitable fish habitat. Gravels trapped in Lake Mills and Lake Aldwell are considered resources needed for restoration of fish habitat in downstream reaches and on floodplains which have been stripped of their sandy surface soils.   Because the Elwha River is a steep channel characterized by pools and riffles, pools may aggrade following dam removal but velocities in the riffles may be too high for significant aggradation. Pool aggradation alone would not substantially increase flood stage downstream of the dams.   An increase in bed-material load would be expected to result in a wider and more dynamic channel in the alluvial reaches. Other reaches are confined within bedrock canyons and the river channel cannot widen. In alluvial reaches, channel migration would erode river banks as a result of increased supply of bed material from upstream. Some historic homestead sites established in the early 1900's may be eroded if channel widening or lateral migration occurred. Mitigation might include documentation of the historic properties, relocation of certain artifacts or structures, and flood and streambank protection.   The rate of sediment release from the reservoirs can be controlled, to a certain extent, by controlling the rate of dam removal. A slow rate of dam removal would reduce short-term effects of riverbed aggradation but prolong the duration of impacts. A relatively fast rate of dam removal would shorten the duration of short-term impacts but might increase the amount of riverbed aggradation and the magnitude of suspended sediment concentrations. There is a concern that fish restoration efforts might be delayed if the duration of unnaturally high sediment loads is too long. For example, egg mortality could occur by disturbance or burial from unnaturally high sediment loads.         C. RESTORATION OF THE RESERVOIR AREA    During dam removal and draining of the lakes, the unvegetated reservoir bottoms would be exposed. Both lakebeds are expected to have large woody debris and other organic material. A revegetation program is anticipated to control dust, surface runoff, erosion, and to accelerate restoration of wildlife habitat and aesthetic land values.           CHAPTER III. RIVER EROSION ALTERNATIVE       Three basic sediment management alternatives for Elwha River restoration have been described by Randle and Lyons (1995). These sediment management alternatives include:  · River erosion and transport of sediment downstream to the Strait;   · Mechanical removal of sediment through a slurry pipeline to the Strait or a land disposal site (""dredge and slurry alternative"");   · Relocation and stabilization of sediment within the existing area of each reservoir.  Only the river erosion alternative is evaluated in this report. Elements of this alternative include:  · Removing features of the dams necessary to restore fish passage and ensure safety;   · Reservoir drawdown in controlled increments with periods of constant lake elevation in between;   · Short- and long-term monitoring of sediment concentration, water quality, aquatic ecology, and reservoir and river channel topography;   · Short- and long-term protection of municipal and industrial water supplies (including construction of infiltration galleries, a water treatment facility, and new wells);   · Mitigation of short- and long-term flood impacts caused by riverbed aggradation;   · Short-term protection of native fish stock;   · Revegetation of the reservoir areas.         A. DAM REMOVAL PLANS    Both Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams would be removed in controlled increments (there are no plans to suddenly breach either dam). Because there is no low-level release capability from either dam, removal plans have focused on river diversion options. The details are described in  Plan for Removal of Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams, Elwha River, Washington  (Reclamation, May 1996b).   The plan to remove Glines Canyon Dam has focused on a ""notch down"" scheme. Riverflows would be diverted through notches cut into the dam allowing the part of the dam above the notches to be removed in the dry.   The removal of Elwha Dam is more complicated than the removal of Glines Canyon Dam. The alluvium under Elwha Dam eroded upon initial filling of Lake Aldwell. This resulted in the concrete gravity section being held in place by only the rock abutments of the canyon. The breach was repaired by filling the areas upstream and downstream of the dam with rock debris blasted from the canyon walls. Other fill material was subsequently placed upstream of the dam to control seepage including sand, a fir mattress, and a gunite cap. However, a large void still exists under the gravity section. This fill material is now considered part of the dam and its removal under full lake conditions could potentially cause another failure (water flowing under the dam). A sequence of cofferdams and a diversion channel is considered necessary to partially drain the reservoir and allow for the safe removal of Elwha Dam.   1. Glines Canyon Dam removal and lake drawdown  — Initial drawdown of Lake Mills would begin in November of a given year, using the existing spillway and penstock (the low-level outlet is considered inoperable). The purpose of the initial drawdown of Lake Mills is to help control the flows through Lake Aldwell while a diversion channel is excavated through the abutment of Elwha Dam. Due to the relatively high and variable flows that would be expected from November through January, there may be significant reservoir fluctuations in Lake Mills within the top 20–30 feet. These reservoir fluctuations would allow for the initial erosion and redistribution of delta sediment in the upstream portions of Lake Mills. High inflows from the spring snow melt are expected to refill the lake — at least to the spillway crest elevation. Final drawdown of Lake Mills would begin in July when riverflows returned to lower levels.   The top portion of the dam would be removed in the dry. Further dam removal and lake drawdown would be accomplished by cutting a sequence of notches (using drill and blast techniques) into the dam’s concrete arch section. Notch openings would alternate on the dam’s left and right sides. Each notch would be about 25 feet wide and 15 feet high. After each notch opening, the lake surface would drawdown as lake water drained through the notch. Lake drawdown would continue until outflow through the notch equaled lake inflow.   For an inflow of 1,400 cfs, water depth through the notch would be about 7.5 feet. This would expose a portion of the dam above the lake surface (about 7.5 feet) and allow removal under dry conditions. The next 15-foot-high notch would be on the dam’s other side and would lower the lake another 7.5 feet. Lake inflows would have to be 1,400 cfs or less for a two-week period in order to complete work necessary to open another notch. Notch openings in the dam and removal of the upper 7.5 feet would continue about every two weeks during periods of low lake inflow (1,400 cfs or less).   Lake drawdown and dam removal would continue through the summer and early fall of the first year until lake inflows increased during the winter high flows, typically November through January. During these high flow periods, dam removal could not continue (because of inundation) and the lake level would remain relatively constant. Following a return to low flows, dam removal would continue again until high flows from spring runoff occurred — once again preventing dam removal. After spring runoff, the dam would be completely removed during the summer and fall of the second year.   2. Elwha Dam removal and lake drawdown schedule —  Lake Aldwell would first be drawn down about 15 feet to an elevation of 182 feet †  using the south spillway and penstocks (there is no low-level outlet). A diversion channel would be excavated through the bedrock of the left abutment at the present location of the north spillway channel. This would enable lowering the lake about 40 feet in August of a given year to an elevation of about 140 feet. The lake would remain near this elevation for a year while the exposed portion of the dam and upstream fill material are removed. Lake drawdown would resume in August of the next year and continue until complete removal in October. Lake drawdown would progress in 5-foot increments, as portions of the dam and fill material are removed, until complete removal at an elevation of 90 feet.   B. SEDIMENT MANAGEMENT PLAN    The River Erosion Alternative would allow the sediment presently trapped in Lake Mills and Lake Aldwell to be eroded from the reservoirs (to the extent possible) and transported downstream to the Strait by natural processes. This sediment management alternative represents a minimum cost option. Except for controlling lake elevations during reservoir drawdown and the rate at which each dam is removed, the river would be allowed to erode reservoir sediment without mechanical intervention (such as hydraulic or mechanical dredging). However, some regrading of the remaining sediment to a stable slope may be desirable.   Each lake would be drawn down in stages in order to redistribute reservoir delta sediment within the remaining reservoir pool. Based on drawdown tests of Lake Mills in 1989 and 1994, a channel of some initial flow-dependent width would erode the deltas of each reservoir during drawdown. If the lake level is held constant for some period after a drawdown increment, the initial erosion width is expected to increase over time. Holding the lakes at a constant elevation after each drawdown increment would allow for some river channel meandering and migration, and induce lateral erosion of the delta to the extent practical for the riverflows at the time of drawdown. The rate of lateral erosion is expected to be greatest near the delta front and decrease upstream. The lakes would be drawn down in small increments so that the river would not deeply incise the deltas and leave large volumes of delta sediment behind with unstable banks.   For both lakes, fine-grained sediment would erode much faster than coarse-grained sediment. Boulders and cobbles present in the upstream portions of each delta may not erode at all. For a given peak riverflow during the initial erosion process, an armor layer of cobbles and boulders may develop that would prevent the erosion of finer sediment underneath. The potential armor layer and the underlying sediment would be eroded later by higher riverflows of sufficient duration. Because the volume of cobbles and boulders are relatively small, any armor layers that formed would be left to erode later by higher riverflows. If necessary, erosion of any armor layers could be initiated mechanically to allow upstream passage of fish.   Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams would be removed concurrently to minimize the duration of high sediment concentrations in the river. The rate at which sediment is released from the dam would depend on the rate of dam removal, lake inflow, and sediment particle size. High rates of sediment release would tend to reduce the duration of short-term impacts but increase their magnitude. Slow rates of sediment release would tend to reduce the magnitude of short-term effects but would increase the duration of those effects. However, even slow rates of sediment release may be lethal to fish or cause fish to avoid entering the river. Therefore, high-magnitude, short-duration impacts are preferred over low-magnitude, long-duration impacts.   River and estuary conditions (both physical and biological) and water intakes would be extensively monitored during the erosion of reservoir sediment. Monitoring information could be used to adjust the rate of dam removal and, therefore, the rate of sediment release. Sediment would be released as rapidly as possible to minimize the duration of impacts, but without exceeding the river’s sediment transport capacity or the capacity to treat municipal and industrial water.        CHAPTER IV. QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT    A. RESERVOIR SEDIMENT EROSION, REDISTRIBUTION, AND RELEASE DOWNSTREAM    The following qualitative assessment is based on results from the 1994 Lake Mills drawdown experiment (D. Childers, USGS, Cascades Volcano Observatory, Vancouver, WA, written communication, 1995; also see chapter V), analysis of suspended sediment concentration on the Toutle River after the eruption of Mt. Saint Helens (Smillie and Jackson, 1995), and published literature.   If the dams are removed, most of the sediment in these two reservoirs would remain in the area of the former reservoir and would be stable over the long term. Only a portion of the reservoir sediment would erode and be transported downstream because the reservoir widths (1,000 to 2,000 feet) are much larger than river widths upstream and downstream of the lakes (about 100 to 200 feet). Gregory Morris (1995) states:  "" ¼ Hydraulic scour will only excavate a narrow channel, leaving most of the reservoir filled with terraced sediments that will become increasing stable and difficult to remove over time due to dewatering, compaction, and growth of vegetation.  ¼  Hydraulic flushing can be highly effective in minimizing the rate of additional sediment accumulation in reservoirs of varied geometry but can effectively restore original capacity only in very narrow reservoirs.""  Presently, the coarse sediment (sand, gravel, and cobbles) of each reservoir is primarily stored within the lake deltas which are located at the upstream end of each reservoir (figure 1). The fine sediment (silt- and clay-sized material) is primarily stored along the existing lakebeds and closer to each dam. More energy is required of the river to transport the coarse sediment out of the existing reservoir areas and over greater distances than to transport the fine sediment. Fine sediment would be transported in suspension and coarse sediment would primarily be transported along the riverbed. Therefore, more fine sediment is expected to be transported out of the reservoir areas than coarse sediment.   The processes of reservoir sediment erosion, redistribution, and release downstream during dam removal are presented in four distinct phases (figure 2):  · Phase 1: Redistribution of delta sediment  — This is also the first phase of dam removal and reservoir drawdown. By the end of this phase, enough of the dam would be removed so that the lake no longer existed. During this phase, the river would incise channels through the delta, eroding and redistributing coarse delta sediment within the reservoir area. Only fine delta sediment would be transported through the lake and past the dam.   · Phase 2: First release of coarse delta sediment  — Dam removal would continue without a lake. The river would continue to incise channels through the reservoir sediment. As this occurred, a portion of the redistributed, coarse delta sediment and a portion of the fine lakebed sediment (exposed during previous delta erosion) would be eroded and transported past the dam.    Figure 1. Lake Mills Sediment Profile.    Figure 2. Lake Mills Sediment Profiles During Dam Removal.      · Phase 3: First release of fine sediment deposited near the dam  — The river would incise channels through the fine lakebed sediment. As this occurred, the river would erode fine lakebed sediment near the dam and some of the coarse sediment through channel widening and transport them past the dam.     · Phase 4: Post dam removal with sediment release during floodflows  — Through channel meandering and bank erosion, the river would erode and transport both coarse and fine sediment out of the reservoir area during progressively higher floodflows.                Figure 3. Photo of Delta Erosion Channel During the 1994 Lake Mills Drawdown Experiment.        Erosion channels incised through the reservoir delta leaving sediment terraces behind on both banks.       1. Redistribution of delta sediment (Phase 1)  — In this first phase, portions of the delta would be eroded and redistributed downstream toward the dam. Coarse sediment would not be released past the dam site but would be redeposited within the remaining reservoir. Terraces of coarse sediment would be left behind along the reservoir margins (figure 3).   Fine sediment in the eroded delta would be re-suspended and would either be redeposited further downstream in the lake or be released past the dam. During the first few increments of dam removal, the amount of fine sediment eroded and re-suspended from the delta would be small and would mix with a relatively large lake. Consequently, concentrations of fine sediment released downstream from the dams would be low. With each increment of dam removal and reservoir drawdown, water volumes in the lake would decrease due to the lower dam height and due to the redeposition of delta sediment into the remaining lake. As more fine sediment becomes accessible to erosion and is mixed with smaller water volumes in the lake, concentrations of fine sediment released downstream from the dams would increase. During periods of high lake inflow (greater than about 1,400 cfs), dam removal activities would stop. These high inflows would tend to flush the lake of high concentrations of suspended sediment, reducing the level of suspended sediment concentrations in the lake to that of the inflow.   During lake drawdown, delta sediments of both lakes would erode and redeposit downstream, forming a new delta which would temporarily cover the existing lakebed sediments. Deposition of delta sediment further downstream within the reservoir is expected to be uniform across the reservoir. The slope of the redeposited delta material would largely depend on the sediment particle size and river flow. Because there are no operable low-level outlets from either dam, coarse sediment would not be expected to be transported through the remaining lakes and past the dam sites.   As each lake is initially drawn down, the river would erode through a portion of the delta exposed above the receding lake. If the reservoir is held at a constant elevation for a long-enough period, then coarse delta sediment would redeposit all the way across the receded lake and extend the delta downstream. The coarse sediment would first redeposit where the erosion channels entered the receded lake; extending the delta downstream at that location. The redeposited delta sediment would induce rapid bank erosion of the newly exposed delta as the erosion channels moved laterally to reach deeper portions of the lake over the shortest possible distance. Erosion widths of the exposed delta would be almost equal to the lake width at the delta’s downstream end, but would rapidly decrease upstream — leaving a terrace of delta sediment behind.   The reservoir would continue to drawdown with each increment of dam removal. During each reservoir drawdown increment, another portion of the delta would erode, coarse sediment would redeposit downstream, and the delta would continue to advance downstream to a lower elevation. The remaining portion of the exposed delta would be left behind in a series of terraces. As the delta continued to advance, fine sediment of the downstream lakebed would be covered (although some mixing would occur). The finer lakebed sediment would erode once the channels are able to erode through the overlying delta sediment. This process would continue until the advancing delta front had reached the dam.   2. First release of coarse delta sediment (Phase 2)  — At the beginning of the second phase, coarse sediment from the delta would have reached the dam and covered the fine sediment of the lakebed. Once this occurred, the elevation of sediment would be about equal to the top of the remaining dam and the lake would no longer exist, but rather a stub dam with the remaining reservoir full of sediment. Coarse sediment would be released downstream with the next increments of dam removal and would no longer be redistributed within the lake (i.e., no new delta deposition).   The rate and amount of sediment release would depend on the increment or rate of dam removal, lake inflow, and sediment erosion slopes within the lakebed. Both fine and coarse sediment would be released downstream with each increment of dam removal. The rate at which sediment is transported past the dam would initially be high after a sudden increment of dam removal. This rate would decrease exponentially with time until the next dam removal increment. Erosion widths would be a function of lake inflow, except that channel erosion widths at the damsite would be limited by bedrock controls. During periods of high riverflow into the reservoir area, dam removal operations would be suspended and sediment erosion and release downstream would occur primarily from channel widening.   3. First release of fine lakebed sediment near the dam (Phase 3)  — The final stages of dam removal occur during the third phase. By now, dam removal would have progressed to a point where the river vertically eroded a channel through the layers of coarse, redeposited, delta sediment. The fine lakebed sediment near the dam would be exposed. The rate of fine sediment release past each dam initially would be high after a sudden increment of dam removal. This rate would decrease exponentially with time until the next dam removal increment.   The Elwha River would erode or incise through the reservoir sediment down to the predam river alluvium. The river would tend to seek the location of the predam channel. Tributaries such as Boulder Creek would also erode through reservoir sediment incising channels to their confluences with the Elwha River. Fine sediment along the reservoir rim is of minimal thickness (perhaps 1–4 feet). Some of this sediment would be transported further down into the reservoir during drawdown from tributary flow or surface runoff from rainfall. Woody vegetation, such as alder, would stabilize the remaining sediment within one to two years.   Heavy rains associated with high flows will cause surface erosion of exposed lakebed sediment and would result in increased turbidity levels downstream compared to predam background levels. However, turbidity levels of the Elwha River during heavy rains are somewhat naturally high and turbidity increases from surface runoff during these periods may not be much different when compared to predam background levels.   4. Post dam removal with sediment release during floodflows (Phase 4)  — At the beginning of the fourth phase, the dam would have been removed and the river would have eroded down to predam alluvium. Relatively little reservoir sediment would be released during low-flow periods and the amount of coarse and fine sediment released downstream would approximately equal the upstream sediment supply over the short term (3–5 years). Additional release of reservoir sediment would occur due to channel widening during floodflows. After the first floodflow, significant channel widening would only occur during subsequently higher floodflows.   Erosion and transport of reservoir sediment downstream from the damsite is highly dependent on the magnitude and sequence of floodflows. In general, the amount of reservoir sediment eroded during floodflows would be expected to decrease exponentially with time. Reservoir sediment erosion rates initially would be high with the first floodflow following dam removal. Subsequent floodflows of progressively greater magnitude would be expected to cause additional channel widening but the volume of sediment erosion would tend to decrease with each floodflow. This is because channel width increases with riverflow, but at an ever-decreasing rate.         B. FINE SEDIMENT CONCENTRATIONS IN THE DOWNSTREAM RIVER CHANNELS    The removal of Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams would cause a rapid release of coarse and fine sediment from the reservoirs. Fine sediment would be transported in suspension and travel at near the velocity of the riverflow. Coarse sediment would tend to be transported along the riverbed and at a much slower rate, causing river pools and other slow velocity areas to aggrade.   The concentration of fine sediment released from each dam essentially would be the same in the river channels downstream. Initially, the concentration of fine sediment eroded and released past each dam would be small. Concentrations would generally increase through phase 1 of dam removal and then tend to decrease in phases 2, 3, and 4. Peak concentrations would coincide with each new opening in the dam in phases 1, 2, and 3 and with floodflows in phase 4. During dam removal (phases 1, 2, and 3), concentrations would tend to be low during periods of high lake inflow when dam removal activities are temporarily halted. During post dam removal (phase 4), concentrations would generally be low except for short periods during floodflows.         C. RIVERBED AGGRADATION AND FLOODING    Since construction of Elwha Dam in 1913 and Glines Canyon Dam in 1926, the supply of coarse sediment has been cut off to the river reaches downstream. Consequently, sand, gravel, and small cobbles (75–125 mm) have been eroded from the riverbed in these reaches, leaving an armor layer of large cobbles (125–300 mm) and boulders that prevent erosion of the finer, underlying sediment. The riverbed is now lower in places and the channel is more stable than under predam conditions.   The removal of these two dams would also restore the natural sediment supply to the river downstream. The lower river (below RM 3) has characteristics of an alluvial fan or delta and may have been aggrading under predam conditions. Restoration of the natural sediment supply to this reach may result in continued aggradation over the long term.   The river channel will become more active as coarse sediment loads increase. During and after dam removal, the river would achieve a straighter course and steeper slope and the rate of lateral channel migration (bank erosion) would increase. River slopes in the lower river (below RM 3) are less steep than upstream and side channels exist in addition to the main river channel. With increased loads of coarse sediment, the main river channel in the lower river may shift course to one or more of the side channels.   Neither dam presently provides flood control so dam removal would not significantly affect peak discharge during floods or floodflow frequency. However, flood stage for a given riverflow would increase locally due to riverbed aggradation. This would also cause the elevation at a given location to be flooded more frequently. Increases in river stage would be less than the amount of riverbed aggradation. This is because river stage at a given location depends on river stage at the next riffle downstream. Riffles are high-velocity areas of the river and least likely to aggrade. As long as riverbed aggradation does not occur at the riffles, only small increases in river stage would occur during floodflows from previous aggradation of river pools.   This part of the report provides an overview of the basic data used in this report with references to other reports that provide more detail. This part is intended for those readers who have a basic understanding of hydrology or geomorphology.         CHAPTER V. DATA COLLECTION          The basic data needed for the analysis of the river erosion alternative include:     Geomorphology investigation to understand the dominant river system processes including the sediment sources and sinks.     Predam and current reservoir topography of both lakes. These data are needed to determine the reservoir sediment volumes and their spacial distribution within each reservoir. This, in turn, would help determine how much sediment has the potential to be eroded from the reservoir area and how much would remain in a stable condition.     The reservoir sediment characteristics of both lakes including particle-size distribution, bulk density, specific gravity, and any cohesion properties. These data are necessary for sediment transport computations and computer modeling. Computer modeling was used to predict erosion and redistribution of the reservoir sediment and downstream impacts to water quality and riverbed aggradation (part III of this report).     Reservoir sediment erosion rates and characteristics. These data are necessary for computer model development, calibration, and verification.     Cross section surveys of the river channel downstream from both dams to the Strait. These data are necessary to compute river hydraulics, sediment transport, and predict riverbed aggradation. The cross section data would also serve as the baseline from which to monitor and document changes during and after dam removal.     Aerial photography of the river corridor and lakes. These photographs are needed to help evaluate existing conditions, identify cross section survey locations, and supplement cross section survey data.     River discharge history and flow-frequency data. These data are necessary for computer model simulations.     A. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS    The Elwha Report  (Interior et al., 1994), the  Draft Staff Report  (FERC, 1993), and supporting documents contain a great deal of information, including topography and sediment size data for both reservoirs and the river channel.   Reservoir topography data includes a predam (1921) contour map of Lake Mills and 1989 contour maps for both Lake Aldwell and Lake Mills (Hosey, 1990). The volume of Lake Mills sediment was computed by taking the difference between the 1921 and 1989 contour maps (FERC, 1993; Summit Technology Consulting Engineers, Seattle, WA, written communication, June 28, 1994). No predam topography is available for Lake Aldwell. The volume of Lake Aldwell sediment was estimated from thickness probe and seismic refraction data (Hosey, 1990). Sediment size distribution data were available for both lakes from 2-inch (50 mm) core samples. However, data were unavailable for sizes greater than about 1.5 inches (38 mm).   In September 1989, Hosey (1990) conducted a drawdown test of Lake Mills to monitor sediment transport across the delta and document the delta’s erosion. The lake drawdown began on September 6 with the lake starting at an elevation of 590 feet. The lake was lowered over a 4-week period at a rate of approximately 0.5 foot per day to an elevation of 572.4 feet. The lake was held near an elevation of 572.4 feet, with slight variations during a period of higher inflow, until October 22, when five days of high inflows caused the lake to rise to an elevation of 587 feet. Lake inflows from September 15 to October 20 were 228–530 cfs.   Cross sections of the Lake Mills delta were surveyed on September 21 and 27, October 2, 11, and 18. Stereo aerial photos of the delta were taken on September 29 and October 15 to provide additional information on channel development and volumes of sediment being transported through the delta. Suspended sediment samples and bedload sediment samples were taken by Ebasco Environmental during the drawdown (Hosey, 1988). These samples were analyzed for sediment concentrations and grain size.   From September 23 to October 15, the upstream half of the delta experienced little change. However, large portions of the downstream half of the delta were eroded and transported into Lake Mills. Up to 10 vertical feet of sediment were eroded from the downstream edge of the delta, with vertical erosion depths decreasing upstream.   There was no further significant delta erosion until the high flows October 22–27, when much more erosion took place and the headcut moved upstream almost to the head of the delta (where the inflowing river splits into two channels). The flows, estimated at 2,863 cfs, were able to transport the gravel and cobbles sediment on the upstream half of the delta. The gravel and cobbles were not moved by previous flows of up to 649 cfs. During the high flows, the lake levels rose to an elevation of 587 feet, completely changing the base elevation to which the delta was adjusting, so the study was discontinued.   Cross sections for the reach of river from the mouth to Glines Canyon were available from a variety of sources: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) (J. Lencioni, Corps, Seattle District, Seattle, WA, oral communication, 1995); Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA, 1980); and Hosey (1990). However, these different data sets were not necessarily linked to common horizonal or vertical datums. Measurements of riverbed material (both armor and sub-armor layers) at various locations from the mouth to about RM 40 were made by Hosey (1988).   The USGS has operated a stream gauge on the Elwha River since 1918 at the McDonald Bridge site at RM 8.6, located between the two dams. In addition to discharge measurements, some water quality and sediment data are available for this gauge.   Additional data collection efforts necessary to address sediment management issues primarily focused on:     The establishment of a new stream gauge upstream from Lake Mills;     A second drawdown test of Lake Mills;     Additional reservoir surveys of Lake Aldwell and Lake Mills forebay;     A geologic investigation of Lake Aldwell sediment;     Aerial photography of the river corridor; and     Topographic surveys and geologic mapping of the river channel and reservoirs.     B. NEW STREAM GAUGE    A new stream gauge above Lake Mills (near the mouth of Rica Canyon) was established by the USGS under a cost-sharing agreement with the Tribe. The gauge is providing information on natural river discharge, sediment load, and water quality. Should the dams be removed, the stream gauge would have to re relocated above Rica Canyon (at Goblins Gate) to support the long-term monitoring program.         C. 1994 LAKE MILLS DRAWDOWN TEST    1. Objectives  — Another 18-foot drawdown experiment of Lake Mills was conducted in April 1994 to determine the erodibility characteristics of the delta (channel development, erosion of armor layers, etc.) and the size distribution of the sediment. This data was later used in the development, calibration, and verification of computer models (chapter VIII). Data were also collected to define ambient water quality and the effect of delta erosion on subsequent water quality. Procedures and results of this experiment are documented by Childers et al. (D. Childers, USGS, Cascades Volcano Observatory, Vancouver, WA, written communication, 1995). Compared to the 1989 drawdown test, data collection during this experiment was much more frequent and comprehensive and was conducted during a period of higher lake inflow.   2. Methods  — The lake’s water level was lowered 18 feet over a 1-week period (more than five times the proposed average rate of dam removal) and then held at a constant elevation for one week before refilling. Lake inflows during the drawdown test were below average for April, between 900 and 1,800 cfs.   Data collection was conducted jointly by Reclamation, USGS, NPS, and the Tribe. Data collection included daily stream gauging (streamflow, suspended sediment, bed material, and bedload), repeat cross-section surveying, geologic mapping of the delta surface, time-lapse photography, and aerial photography.   3. Summary of results  — The Lake Mills delta was found to consist mostly of sand and fine gravel (less than 19 mm). These sediments were likely derived from upstream shale beds and consisted of platelets and rod-shaped particles.   During lake drawdown the delta eroded both vertically and laterally. Eroded banks were almost vertical with no signs of seepage-based erosion. After the full 18-foot drawdown, the delta erosion became primarily lateral as the stream had adjusted to the new base level. The eroded sediment redeposited across the receded lake and extended the delta front about 300 feet downstream but at a lower elevation. As the coarse delta sediment eroded and redeposited in the receded lake, the erosion channels eroded laterally to reach deeper areas of the lake. The total eroded width at the initial delta front was equal to the reservoir width and decreased rapidly with distance upstream. Only a slight increase in suspended-sediment concentration (relative to pretest conditions) was found downstream from Glines Canyon Dam during the drawdown test.         D. BATHYMETRIC SURVEYS OF LAKE MILLS AND LAKE ALDWELL    1. 1989 bathymetric surveys  — Bathymetric and topographic maps for both Lake Mills and Lake Aldwell were prepared using similar procedures and equipment (Hosey, 1990). The bathymetric survey was conducted from a boat using a depth recorder and microwave positioning system.   2. 1994 bathymetric surveys  — Sediment deposits of both lakes were mapped in order to help determine the reservoir sediment volume and size distribution. Reservoir sediment sampling and drilling locations were surveyed and new bathymetric maps were made to support the reservoir sediment investigations (Reclamation, August 1995). Comparison of these new bathymetric maps with a predam map of Lake Mills and recent drill hole data from Lake Aldwell were used to determine the volume and spacial distribution of the reservoir sediments.   The Lake Aldwell survey revealed that a landslide had occurred about 700 feet upstream from Elwha Dam and now blocks the original river channel under the lake. The volume of the landslide was estimated by Reclamation (May 1996a) to be 15,000 yd 3 . This landslide occurred since dam construction but the year of occurrence is unknown. There is no indication of continuing slope movement in the upslope area. This landslide is a natural dam (now submerged) about half the height of Elwha Dam. Release of sediment from Elwha Dam would be impeded until the Elwha River had re-established its channel through the landslide mass. Mechanical excavation of the landslide may be required to ensure timely release of reservoir sediment and reduce impacts to downstream fish habitat and maintain project schedules (Reclamation, May 1996a).         E. RESERVOIR SEDIMENT VOLUME SUMMARY    Detailed information on the reservoir sediment volumes and size distributions for Lake Mills and Lake Aldwell can be found in  Alluvium Distribution in Lake Mills, Glines Canyon Project and Lake Aldwell, Elwha Project, Washington . (Reclamation, March 1996). Reservoir sediment volume, grain size gradations, and post-dam sediment distribution estimates for both lakes were made using geologic data collected in 1989 (Hosey, 1990) for project owner James River II, Inc. and data from 1994 explorations conducted by Reclamation.   Of the total 17.7 myd 3  of reservoir sediment, 78 percent (13.8 myd 3 ) are in Lake Mills and 22 percent (3.9 myd 3 ) are in Lake Aldwell. Of the sediment in Lake Mills, about half is considered fine grained (silt and clay) and about half is considered coarse grained (sand, gravel, and cobbles) (table 1 and figure 4). Most of the coarse sediment of Lake Mills (94 percent) is in the delta located at the upstream end of the reservoir. The Lake Mills delta, with a volume of 8.5 myd 3 , is mostly sand and gravel, with some silt and clay, and a small amount of cobbles. The lakebed sediments, with a volume of 5.3 myd 3 , are mostly silt- and clay-sized material (92 percent) with some fine sand.   Of the sediment in Lake Aldwell, about two-thirds is considered fine and about one-third is considered coarse (table 1 and figure 4). Most of the coarse sediment of Lake Aldwell (82 percent) is in the delta located at the upstream end of the reservoir. The Lake Aldwell delta, with a volume of 1.8 myd 3 , is mostly sand, with silt and clay, gravel, and a small amount of cobbles. The lakebed sediment, with a volume of 2.1 myd 3 , are mostly silt- and clay-sized material (89 percent) with some sand and a minor amount of gravel.  Table 1.

Reservoir Sediment Size Distribution for Lake Mills and Lake Aldwell         1. Lake Mills sediment  — Reservoir sediment volume estimates for Lake Mills were made using surface and subsurface data and a comparison of post-dam (1989 and 1994) topography and predam (1921) topography. Data collected by Hosey and Associates in 1989 included drill hole drive samples in the Lake Mills delta. In addition, they collected piston core samples and thickness probe tests in the reservoir. Investigations in 1994 included surface mapping, photography, hand-dug test pits, sediment sampling, contaminant sampling, and video recording.   Since construction of Glines Canyon Dam 69 years ago, the Elwha River has built a 3,000-foot-long delta at the head of Lake Mills, which has a maximum thickness of 70–80 feet. Sediment distribution in the Lake Mills delta ranges from predominantly gravel, cobbles, and boulders in the upstream reach, through cobbles, gravel, and sand in the central reach, to mostly sand and minor fine gravel in the lower reach. Post-dam sediment on the lakebed forms a long, gently sloping wedge of fine sand, silt, and clay that extends to Glines Canyon Dam. Based on average percentages of fines, sand, and coarser sediments, the Lake Mills reservoir basin was subdivided into 7 sedimentation areas (Reclamation, August 1995):  · Area 1. Rica Canyon   · Area 2. Cat Creek fan   · Area 3. Boulder Creek fan   · Area 4. Pro-delta sediments   · Area 5. Reservoir floor sediments   · Area 6. Lake Mills delta (upstream portion)   · Area 7. Lake Mills delta (downstream portion)  The total volume of post-dam fluvial sediment in the Lake Mills basin was determined to be 13.83 myd 3 . Approximately 51 percent (6.97 myd 3 ) of this total sediment volume is concentrated in the main delta, while about 38 percent (5.30 myd 3 ) mantles the reservoir floor and side slopes. The remaining 11 percent (1.56 myd 3 ) of the reservoir sediment is distributed within Rica Canyon and at the mouths of Cat Creek and Boulder Creek.   Of the total post-dam sedimentation volume, 48 percent (6.62 myd 3 ) is silt- and clay-sized particles and 52 percent (7.21 myd 3 ) is sand, gravel, and cobbles (coarse sediment). Of this coarse sediment, 72 percent is sand size, 26 percent is gravel size, and 3 percent is cobble size).   2. Lake Aldwell sediment  — A geologic investigation of Lake Aldwell was conducted by Reclamation (August 1995). Post-dam sediment volumes for Lake Aldwell were estimated using 1989 and 1994 topography data and limited subsurface data. Topography of Lake Aldwell was not obtained prior to the construction of Elwha Dam. Data collected by Hosey in 1989 included vibro-core sampling, piston core sampling, seismic refraction survey, ground-penetrating radar survey, and thickness probe tests on the delta and reservoir. Reclamation investigations in 1994 included surface mapping, photography, limited drill sampling, hand-dug test pits, and an underwater dive examination. Surface mapping and core drilling revealed that previous volume estimates of the delta were too large and that volume estimates of the lakebed sediments were too low. The previous volume estimates for the delta included predam channels and terraces consisting of cobbles and boulders. The previous volume estimates for the lakebed were found to underestimate the sediment thickness by 50 percent when compared with the 1994 drill-hole information. This difference may be due to the relatively small equipment used to measure sediment thickness in the previous volume estimates. These early thickness measurements, based on refusal of the equipment, probably represent minimum values. (Refusal of the equipment was likely the result of skin friction rather than encountering coarse predam alluvium.)   In the 83 years since construction of Elwha Dam, the Elwha River has formed a narrow, 2,500-foot-long, 18- to 24-foot-thick delta at the head of the Lake Aldwell reservoir basin. The post-dam delta is nested in older river terrace deposits that are locally up to 16 feet above normal reservoir level (elevation 197 feet). Sediment distribution in the Lake Aldwell delta ranges from gravel, cobbles, and some boulders at the delta head, to predominantly sand and silt near the delta front. Sediment on the reservoir floor forms a long, gently sloping wedge of fine sand, silt, and clay that extends to Elwha Dam. Based on average percentages of fines, sand, and coarser sediments, the Lake Aldwell reservoir basin was subdivided into 9 sedimentation areas (Reclamation, August 1995):  · Area 1. Lake Aldwell delta (upstream portion)   · Area 2. Lake Aldwell delta (downstream portion)   · Area 3. Indian Creek delta and similar sediments   · Area 4. Delta margin sediments   · Area 5. Pro-delta Sediments   · Area 6. Reservoir floor sediments (upstream portion)   · Area 7. Reservoir floor sediments (gooseneck portion)   · Area 8. Reservoir floor sediments (downstream portion)   · Area 9. Reservoir rim sediments  The total volume of post-dam fluvial sediment in the Lake Aldwell basin was determined to be about 3.88 myd 3 . Of this total sediment volume, 46 percent (1.78 myd 3 ) is concentrated in the delta area, while about 54 percent (2.1 myd 3 ) mantles the reservoir floor and side slopes. Approximately 67 percent of the total post-dam sedimentation volume consists of silt- and clay-size particles, and 33 percent consists of sand, gravel, and cobbles (coarse sediment). Of this coarse sediment, 84 percent is sand size, 12 percent is gravel, and 4 percent is cobbles.         F. AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS    Photographs of the river corridor were obtained under contract by the Tribe. Photographs from the river’s mouth to Glines Canyon Dam were taken in March 1994 and from Glines Canyon Dam to the base of Mount Olympus in April 1994.         G. RIVER CROSS SECTION SURVEYS AND GEOLOGIC MAPPING    New river cross sections from the river’s mouth to Glines Canyon Dam were surveyed (with consistent horizontal and vertical datums) to supplement existing information and document recent changes near the mouth. Geologic mapping of the riverbed and terraces was also performed at the same time (chapter I, section C–1; also Reclamation, March 1996).   Existing river cross section data were produced by combining (and adjusting) data from two surveys in 1994 and one in 1983. Cross section data from the river mouth (RM 0) to RM 3 were supplied by the Corps (J. Lencioni, Corps, Seattle District, Seattle WA, written communication, 1994). These cross section data were combined from surveys of the main river channel in the fall of 1994 and surveys of the floodplains and side channels in 1983. The channel lengths between cross sections, measured in 1983, were included with these data. Because of some changes in the river channel location and alignment since 1983, reach lengths for the lower reach (RM 0 to RM 3) were re-measured from the 1994 aerial photographs. Cross section data from RM 3 to RM 5 (Elwha Dam), including data for the computation of reach lengths, were measured by Reclamation’s Ephrata (WA) Field Office survey crew in September 1994.   In the upper portion of the lower reach (above RM 3), additional cross sections were interpolated to account for variations in river hydraulics through riffles and pools. The floodplain portion of the cross section at RM 0.8 was modified to straighten out a dog-leg in the original survey that was too far downstream.              CHAPTER VI. MODELING INTRODUCTION          To mitigate water quality degradation, fish loss, and reduced flood protection, knowledge is required of the suspended sediment concentration released from the two lakes (including magnitude, duration, and timing) and the amount of riverbed aggradation and channel widening that is expected to occur.   This part of the report provides a detailed discussion of the analyses and various numerical (computer) models that were used to predict the impacts of the river erosion alternative. It is intended for those readers who have a good understanding of geomorphology and computer modeling.   Combinations of three computer models were used to predict the amount of sediment eroded from each reservoir and the resulting effects on sediment concentration and riverbed aggradation in the river downstream. The three are:  · STARS model: Sediment Transport and River Simulation (Reclamation, 1987).   · HEC-6 model: Scour and Deposition in Rivers and Reservoirs, Version 4.1A (Corps, 1993).   · Elwha Reservoir model: a new reservoir sediment erosion model developed to predict the erosion, redistribution, and downstream release of sediment during concurrent removal of both dams and corresponding lake drawdown. This model is based in part on the concepts described by Smillie and Jackson (1995) and results from the 1994 Lake Mills drawdown test.  Both STARS and HEC-6 are one-dimensional, movable boundary, open-channel flow models designed to simulate and predict changes in river profiles resulting from scour and deposition. A special version of the STARS model was used to compute coarse-sediment transport capacity of the river channels downstream from both dams. The Elwha Reservoir model is empirically based and was developed specifically for this study. These three models each have certain advantages and disadvantages. All of the models were used and the results were combined to maximize the advantages of each. For example, the STARS model could be easily customized for simple applications, but was slow for long-term simulations. The HEC-6 model was very fast for long-term simulations, but neither the STARS nor HEC-6 models could predict channel erosion widths. The Elwha Reservoir model worked well for the two lakes but required input from the other two models. Separate (but almost identical) versions of the Elwha Reservoir model were created for Lake Mills and Lake Aldwell.   All three models were used to make predictions for Lake Mills. Some of the STARS model results were used in the HEC-6 model and some of the results from both models were used in the Elwha Reservoir model (figure 5). Results of the Elwha Reservoir model for Lake Mills provided input to the STARS model when it was applied to the river reach below Glines Canyon Dam and to the Elwha Reservoir model when it was applied to Lake Aldwell. Results of the Elwha Reservoir model from Lake Aldwell were used as input to the STARS and HEC-6 models when they were applied to the river below Elwha Dam.   During dam removal and the reservoir drawdown, various portions of the delta sediment were assumed to erode and redeposit farther downstream over the lakebed sediment of the remaining reservoir. Although the delta sediments are primarily sand and gravel, there is a small portion of silt- and clay-sized sediment. Some of this silt- and clay-sized sediment would be eroded from the delta, mix with the remaining lake, and be released downstream in reduced concentrations. This process would be expected to continue until eroded delta sediment had reached the dam and the remaining reservoir was full of sediment. At this time, additional dam removal would result in the downstream release of coarse delta sediment (in addition to the release of fine sediment).   For Lake Mills, the elevation of the redeposited delta sediment when it first reaches the dam was estimated from mass-balance calculations (chapter VII, section B). This elevation is important for the preparation of dam removal plans and for determining when coarse delta sediment would be first released downstream. The STARS model was used to determine the equilibrium slope of the redistributed delta sediment. The hydraulic properties table feature of the STARS model was also used to assist in the mass-balance calculations. The computed profile for the eroded and redeposited delta sediment upstream from Glines Canyon Dam was used as the initial conditions for the HEC-6 model. The general pattern of sediment release between successive increments of dam removal was predicted using HEC-6 (chapter VII, section C) and was used as input to the Elwha Reservoir model (chapter VIII). Using the equilibrium slope from the STARS model, the general pattern of sediment release from the HEC-6 model, and observations during the 1994 Lake Mills drawdown test, the Elwha Reservoir model predicted the erosion, redistribution, storage, and downstream release of both coarse and fine sediment.   Any silt- and clay-sized sediments released from the reservoir were assumed to be rapidly transported downstream to the river mouth and into the Strait. Although some silt- and clay-sized sediment may deposit along channel margins, the river channel is too steep for significant aggradation to occur from material this size. Therefore, the predicted sediment hydrographs for silt and clay released past the dam sites were applied downstream without modification for lag time or attenuation.   For the Elwha River reach below Glines Canyon Dam, the STARS model was used to compute sediment transport capacity for a range of sand- and gravel-size sediment (chapter IX). These transport capacities were then compared with the sediment release rates from Lake Mills (predicted by the Elwha Reservoir model) to estimate the potential riverbed aggradation. As a conservative assumption, the predicted sediment release rates from Lake Mills were used directly as input to the Elwha Reservoir model when it was applied to Lake Aldwell. The HEC-6 model was not applied to this very steep reach because the large number of required river cross sections were not available.   For the more mild reach below Elwha Dam, both the STARS and HEC-6 models were used to predict the amount of riverbed aggradation. The STARS model was used to compute sediment transport capacity for a range of sand- and gravel-size sediment (chapter IX). These transport capacities were then compared with the sediment release rates from Lake Aldwell (predicted by the Elwha Reservoir model) to estimate the potential riverbed aggradation. STARS model results were then used later to compare with results from the HEC-6 model. The HEC-6 model was used to simulate the transport and deposition of sand and gravel from Lake Aldwell for a 3.3-year period during and after dam removal and over the following 50 years (Chapter X).

INITIAL SEDIMENT ANALYSIS AND MODELING FOR LAKE MILLS          A. NATURAL COARSE SEDIMENT SUPPLY    The natural supply of coarse sediment (bed-material load) from the Elwha River and the development of a sediment-discharge rating curve are discussed in this section.   About 7.2 myd 3  of coarse sediment (sand, gravel, and cobbles) have been deposited upstream of Glines Canyon Dam in the Lake Mills Delta, which extends into Rica Canyon (Reclamation, August 1995). This delta has accumulated over the 67 years (1927–94) since Glines Canyon Dam was completed and began storing water. This coarse sediment volume of 7.2 myd 3  translates into an average annual sediment load of about 110,000 yd 3  per year — the natural supply of coarse sediment entering Lake Mills.   A sediment-discharge rating curve for the natural supply of coarse sediment was developed from the following data:  · The volume of coarse sediment accumulated in Lake Mills;   · A flow-duration analysis for the period of sediment accumulation (1927–89); and   · Provisional suspended and bedload measurements reported by Childers et al. (D. Childers, USGS, Cascades Volcano Observatory, Vancouver, WA, written communication, 1995) for the Elwha River gauge above Lake Mills (USGS No. 12044900).   1. Procedure  — An iterative procedure was used to develop a bed-material load (coarse sediment) rating curve such that when it was applied to the flow-duration analysis, the resulting sediment yield would agree with the volume of coarse sediment trapped within Lake Mills:  · Step 1:  Results from suspended sediment load measurements were combined with bedload measurements to compute the total bed-material load. The sand-size portion of the measured suspended load was added to the results of the bed load measurement made on the same day (table 2). Cobbles up to 128 mm in size were captured in the bed-load sampler. Only 1 percent of the sediment in the Lake Mills delta is larger than 125 mm. For the purposes of this report, total bed-material load will be referred to as coarse sediment load.   ·  Step 2:  River discharge (Q) and the corresponding coarse sediment load (Q s ) data were plotted on Log-Log paper (figure 6). A regression analysis of the logarithms was performed to determine the sediment-discharge rating curve (Q s  = a Q w b ) for flows less than 1,970 cfs.   ·  Step 3:  The sediment concentration was then calculated for the largest coarse sediment load of the measured data, which is 428 tons/day and corresponds to a discharge of 1,380 cfs. The concentration C is:  C = Q s /Q w  =  dry wt. of sediment  » dry wt. of sediment    wt. of water + dry wt of sediment wt. of water   C =  (428 tons/day)(2,000 lbs/ton)(1 day/24 hrs)(1 hr/3,600 sec.)    (1,380 cfs)(62.4 lbs/ft 3 )      C =  9.9074 lbs/s (coarse sediment)  = 0.000115 = 115 parts per million (ppm)  »  115 mg/L      86,112 lbs/s (water)  ·  Step 4:  For flows greater than 1,970 cfs, the sediment-discharge rating curve matched the lower curve at a discharge of 1,970 cfs. The slope of the curve above 1,970 cfs (Figure 6) was computed by trial and error. As an initial guess, the concentration of 115 ppm (calculated in step 3) was used to compute the coarse sediment load for a discharge of 19,000 cfs as 5,890 tons/day (figure 6). This was the highest mean daily discharge for the period of record (1927–94) and is only exceeded 0.01 percent of the days. The slope of the upper sediment-discharge rating curve was then computed to also pass through the point corresponding to the high discharge of 19,000 cfs.   ·  Step 5:  The equations defining the lower and upper sediment-discharge rating curves were used to calculate the coarse sediment load for Lake Mills by applying the flow-duration analysis results (Reclamation, 1951). A flow-duration analysis for mean daily flows of the Elwha River at McDonald Bridge was obtained from the USGS WATSTOR database for the period 1927–94 (table 3). The coarse sediment load (corresponding to a certain flow or discharge increment) was multiplied by the frequency of days in which that flow increment historically occurred. This product of coarse sediment load and flow frequency was totaled for a range of flows from 12 cfs to 19,000 cfs to compute the average annual coarse sediment yield. This annual yield was then multiplied by the number of years of reservoir operation to compute the total amount of coarse sediment entering Lake Mills.   The total sediment yield was then converted to a volume using an average density of 110 lbs/ft 3  and compared to the measured coarse sediment volume in Lake Mills.   ·  Step 6:  A new sediment concentration for a discharge of 19,000 cfs was assumed and steps 4 and 5 were repeated until the computed sediment volume matched the measured volume.   2. Results  — The computed sediment concentration for a discharge of 19,000 cfs was 1,900 mg/L and the equations defining the lower and upper sediment-discharge rating curves are:   · Lower curve (for flows less than 1,970 cfs):   Q s  = 1.915379 E-10 (Q w 3.734454 )   · Upper curve (for flows between 1,970 cfs and 19,000 cfs):   Q s  = 3.470206 E-06 (Q w 2.441953 )   where:        Q s  is the coarse sediment load, in tons per day, and   Q w  is the mean daily discharge or riverflow, in cfs.

The computed average annual coarse sediment supply rate is 164,000 tons (448.65 tons/day x 365 days) or 110,000 yd 3  assuming a density of 110 lbs/ft 3 .)                                Frequency range      (percent-days)            Interval      (percent-      days)            Frequency      midpoint      (percent-      days)            Mean daily      discharge      (cfs)        Coarse      sediment      transport      capacity      (tons/day)            Discharge-      frequency      product      (cfs)            Sediment-      frequency      product      (tons/day)            0.00      0.02      0.02        0.01        19,000        97,469.9        3.8        19.49            0.02      0.10      0.08        0.06        14,500        50,375.6        11.6        40.30            0.10      0.50      0.40        0.30        9,314        17,092.3        37.3        68.37            0.50      1.50      1.00        1.00        5,974        5,778.5        59.7        57.79            1.50      5.00      3.50        3.25        4,073        2,267.8        142.6        79.37            5.00      15.00      10.00        10.00        2,810        916.1        281.0        91.61            15.00      25.00      10.00        20.00        2,090        444.6        209.0        44.46            25.00      35.00      10.00        30.00        1,710        226.8        171.0        22.68            35.00      45.00      10.00        40.00        1,440        119.4        144.0        11.94            45.00      55.00      10.00        50.00        1,220        64.3        122.0        6.43            55.00      65.00      10.00        60.00        1,040        35.4        104.0        3.54            65.00      75.00      10.00        70.00        855        17.0        85.5        1.70            75.00      85.00      10.00        80.00        676        7.1        67.6        0.71            85.00      95.00      10.00        90.00        499        2.3        49.9        0.23            95.00      98.50      3.50        96.75        359        0.7        12.6        0.02            98.50      99.50      1.00        99.00        237        0.1        2.4        0.00            99.50      99.90      0.40        99.70        78        0.0        0.3        0.00            99.90      99.98      0.08        99.94        22        0.0        0.0        0.00            99.98      100.00      0.02        99.99        12        0.0        0.0        0.00            Totals                                            1,504.2        448.65                  B. MASS-BALANCE CALCULATIONS    Mass-balance computations were performed to solve for the surface elevation at which the eroding delta sediment would first reach the dam as the lake is being lowered during dam removal, the end of phase 1 (chapter IV, section A). This sediment elevation would also equal the top elevation of the partially removed dam. The predicted sediment surface at the damsite is a function of the reservoir and sediment topography, and the erosion and redeposition slopes. Time is not considered nor is the release of sediment downstream. Results from these computations were used as the initial conditions to the HEC-6 sediment transport model (chapter VII, section C).   In this analysis, the delta sediment is assumed to erode and redeposit downstream along a surface of constant longitudinal slope (figure 7). The elevations of this new sediment surface are determined such that the volumes of eroded and redeposited sediment are equal. All or a portion of the delta sediment above this new sediment surface are assumed to erode and then redeposit downstream over existing lakebed sediment that is below the longitudinal slope. Deposition is assumed to occur laterally across the entire reservoir and up to the new sediment surface.   The slopes of the sediment erosion and redeposition surfaces were both set equal to an equilibrium slope where the sediment transport capability matches the upstream rate of sediment supply. Actual erosion slopes would likely be greater so that the use of an equilibrium slope tends to be conservative in that it overestimates the sediment surface elevation at the damsite just prior to the release of coarse sediment. An equilibrium slope of 0.00052 was computed by trial and error such that the computed coarse sediment load would match the upstream supply. The techniques, data, and assumptions used to compute the equilibrium slope included:     STARS model (Reclamation, 1987);     The Yang sediment transport function for sand and gravel (Yang, 1973 and 1984);     Composite bed-material size gradation of the Lake Mills delta;     An assumed wide channel cross section of rectangular shape (generally 800 feet wide);     A constant lake water inflow of 1,500 cfs (the mean daily flow) and a corresponding coarse sediment inflow of 139 tons/day.    Reservoir cross sections were developed from predam and post-dam topographic maps of Lake Mills. The locations of these cross sections are shown in figure 8. Tables of cross-sectional area versus elevation were developed for each reservoir cross section using the hydraulic properties program HYDTAB, a part of the STARS model. The volume of sediment eroded was calculated by multiplying the erosion area of each cross section by a total of one-half the distance to the next upstream and next downstream cross sections. Erosion areas at each cross section were computed using the predam (1921) geometry and by taking the area difference between the current thalweg elevation (1989) and the new thalweg determined from the erosion slope. The sediment redeposition volume was calculated in a similar manner.   Because the river would probably not erode all of the delta sediment, four different portions of delta sediment were assumed to erode and redeposit within the reservoir downstream: all, two-thirds, one-half, and one-third (figures 7, 8, 10, and 11). It is also assumed the most conservative result is that all the delta sediment above the erosion surface would erode to the predam topography and redistribute across the lower lake, assuming that one-third of the delta sediment would erode was the lower limit evaluated. Table 4 summarizes the four cases considered.     Table 4.

Gathard, Summit Technology Consulting Engineers, Seattle, WA, written communication, 1995). Based on these computations, the maximum sediment surface elevation at the damsite would range from 55–43 percent of the dam’s height.        Figure 6.

HEC-6 MODELING OF LAKE MILLS SEDIMENT RELEASE    The river’s capacity to vertically incise a channel through the redistributed delta sediment of Lake Mills during removal of Glines Canyon Dam was numerically modeled with HEC-6 to determine sediment release rates over time during phases 2 and 3 of dam removal (chapter IV, section A). Simulations of various steady flows for several channel widths were used for initial predictions of the erosion channel geometry. Sensitivity testing of the rate of dam removal was combined with the steady flow simulations to bracket the amount and timing of sediment transport past Glines Canyon Dam expected during dam removal.   1. Model input data    ·  Cross-section data  — The reach modeled extended 2 miles upstream from Glines Canyon Dam to the mouth of Rica Canyon. The maximum spacing between cross sections was 300 feet. Results from the simple mass-balance calculations (chapter VII, section B) were used to define the initial sediment elevations at each cross section. In the early HEC-6 model simulations, the initial bed elevations were based on the case where all of the sediment above the erosion slope is eroded and redistributed downstream — the most conservative case. The results of the one-third redistribution case were judged to better represent what would actually occur and therefore used in subsequent simulations. Existing and predam cross-section data of the reservoir were obtained from the 1989 and 1921 topographic maps. Vertical channel erosion was limited to the elevation of the predam reservoir valley, based on the 1921 topographic map.   Within the wide areas of the reservoir, a narrower 5-foot-deep rectangular channel was assumed for the initial cross-section geometry to initiate reservoir sediment erosion during model simulations of dam removal. Cross sections in the bedrock canyon near the dam were already sufficiently narrow to produce velocities capable of transporting the delta sediment. Because the HEC-6 model does not predict width changes, a trial-and-error procedure was conducted for each flow simulated to determine the channel width that would result in progressive erosion from the downstream to the upstream end of the reach. Initially, a 787-foot-wide channel was assumed (based on a measurement from the 1994 Lake Mills drawdown experiment) but erosion at the downstream end did not progress more than one-third of the total distance upstream. Narrower widths were tried (which increased the channel velocity) until the erosion progressed to near the upstream end of the reach.   ·  Sediment data  — The Yang sediment transport equations were selected because of their applicability to both sand- and gravel-size sediment. Size gradations were developed based on data obtained from the existing delta and lakebed (Reclamation, August 1995). The size gradation of the redistributed sediment was assumed to be sorted longitudinally with the coarser sediment deposited upstream and the finer sediment deposited downstream. The percentage of silt and clay-sized sediment was added to the very fine sand size range for both the redistributed delta sediment and for the lakebed sediment. The value of 2.7 for the specific gravity of sand particles and a dry unit weight of 110 lbs/ft 3  were specified based on measurements from the 1994 drawdown experiment; otherwise, model default parameters were used. No adjustment was made for sediment particle shape factor.   ·  Hydrologic data  — Steady flows of 500, 1,500, and 5,000 cfs were assumed. The downstream boundary water surface elevation (at the damsite) was calculated assuming the notch opening in the dam acted as a weir (critical depth at the notch). Flows of 500 and 1,500 cfs were contained within the notch opening. However, flows of 5,000 cfs overtopped the remaining dam crest. Temperature was held at a constant 50  ° F. Either 1-hour or ½-hour time steps were used in these simulations.   2. Model results  — Sediment loads released through several successive notches for a given flow and channel width are presented in Table 5. As would be expected, the predicted amount of released sediment increased with discharge. The results also show that the rate of sediment release increases as more of the dam is removed. The predicted sediment loads released from each dam-removal increment were averaged over 15 days.  Table 5.

This percentage rose to 92 in the 5,000 cfs simulations. Therefore, 14-day dam-removal increments appear to allow sufficient time to erode the majority of the available delta sediment. Table 6 contains additional data from this testing.       Table 6. Percent of Total Erosion Versus Time for a Single Notch Opening.

Sediment loads peak at 15-day intervals and they exponentially decay after each sudden notch opening. The results from nine successive notches are depicted in the figure. Average and peak sediment loads increase with each notch. The large increase shown corresponding to the seventh notch (about 90 days) resulted from the channel accessing the finer-grained lakebed sediment. Shortly after the ninth and final notch opening, the dam has been effectively removed, all accessible delta and lakebed sediments have been eroded, and the natural sediment inflow is simply being transported downstream. Progressive thalweg profiles resulting from the same 1,500 cfs steady-flow simulations are shown on figure 13.                 Figure 12.

The shaded profiles represent the amount of sediment eroded from each dam removal increment.)          D. DISCUSSION    1. Natural coarse sediment supply  — The average annual coarse sediment yield of 110,000 yd 3  per year is based on actual measurements from Lake Mills and can be used to represent long-term (greater than 10 years) conditions. However, flow and sediment yields from the Elwha River are highly variable and are usually different from average values. For example, sediment loads immediately after a landslide in the upper watershed would be temporarily high. There are some oral accounts that a large portion of the Lake Mills delta formed after the occurrence of a single landslide in the upstream watershed (at the foot of the Grand Canyon of the Elwha) in the mid-1960's. The computed sediment yield may be overestimated if the recurrence of large landslides is much greater than 67 years.   The sediment rating curves approximate average loads for a given flow. The lower sediment-discharge rating curve is based on 24 sediment loads measured during April, May, and June of 1994 — a small data set with a short duration. The upper curve covers two log cycles and was computed by trial and error such that, when applied to the flow duration analysis, the resulting sediment yield equaled the volume measured from the reservoir. Until a long-term sediment record is established, these sediment rating curves represent the best available predictor of sediment yield. These rating curves can be verified and improved as more data from the new stream gauge above Lake Mills become available.   2. Mass-balance calculations  — The mass-balance technique is an easy way to determine the maximum possible range of sediment elevations at the dam. The computed sediment-surface elevations at Glines Canyon Dam are significant — from 55 to 43 percent of the dam’s height. These computed elevations likely are high because they are based on a very mild erosion-and-deposition slope. The computed sediment elevation at the damsite was sensitive to the assumed erosion-and-deposition slope but not to the assumed portion of the delta eroded above the erosion slope (i.e., all, two-thirds, one-half, or one-third).   3. HEC-6 modeling of Lake Mills sediment release  — HEC-6 model results provide information concerning how sediment release rates would vary between notch openings in the dam. However, channel erosion widths must be provided to the model. Therefore, development and application of a new mathematical model for the reservoir sediment is justified (chapter VIII).     CHAPTER VIII. ELWHA RESERVOIR SEDIMENT MODEL — RESERVOIR SEDIMENT EROSION, REDISTRIBUTION, AND RELEASE DOWNSTREAM       The HEC-6 model was used to predict how sediment release rates would vary between notch openings in Glines Canyon Dam. However, the HEC-6 model cannot predict the erosion width through the sediment nor does it predict sediment terrace development in the reservoir during the erosion process. Therefore, the Elwha Reservoir model was developed and used to simulate the erosion of coarse and fine sediment from both Lake Mills and Lake Aldwell.   The Elwha Reservoir model integrates empirical relationships for the erosion and redeposition of coarse sediment with a mixing cell model for fine sediment developed by G. Smillie and W. Jackson (1995). Not all of the reservoir sediment is expected to erode during dam removal. Some portion of the sediment would remain stable in the reservoir area over the long term because the reservoirs are much wider than the river. Therefore, predicting erosion widths during dam removal is critical to determining how much sediment could be eroded downstream. Observations from the 1994 Lake Mills drawdown test were used to develop an empirical relationship for the erosion and redistribution of coarse sediment within the delta.         A. MODEL INPUT AND OUTPUT    The following data are necessary to run the Elwha Reservoir model:  · Lake cross section data for existing and predam conditions including thalweg and tables of elevation and cross-section width;   · A current table of water volume versus lake elevation;   · The vertical distribution of coarse and fine sediment within the delta defined by a simple table of coarse- and fine-sediment percentages for various ranges of elevation;   · Exponent of the delta erosion width function (defined later in this section);   · Longitudinal erosion slopes for coarse and fine sediment;   · Coefficients to distribute sediment release over time within a reservoir drawdown increment;   · A water and sediment inflow hydrograph for the reservoir; and   · The amount and frequency or schedule of reservoir drawdown increments. For Lake Mills, a dam removal and lake drawdown increment is assumed to occur every two weeks when average lake inflow is less than or equal to 1,400 cfs. For Lake Aldwell, a schedule of drawdown increments was provided rather than a set frequency.  Model output includes:  · Longitudinal reservoir sediment profiles for each drawdown increment;   · Cross-section erosion widths for each drawdown increment;   · Mean daily release of water discharge, coarse sediment, and fine sediment from the dam site; and   · The total volume of coarse and fine sediment released.   B. MODEL ASSUMPTIONS AND PROCEDURE    The Elwha Reservoir model uses the following general assumptions:  · A single erosion channel can be used to simulate any multiple erosion channels that may actually occur;   · Vertical erosion would stop at the predam alluvium (reservoir bottom elevation);   · All reservoir sediment can be treated as two distinct sizes: coarse and fine;   · A daily time step is assumed to be adequate for model predictions; and   · Any tributary flow entering the reservoir can be ignored.  The Elwha Reservoir model simulates sediment erosion, redistribution, and release downstream in four phases of dam removal and lake drawdown described in chapter IV, section A.   1. Redistribution of delta sediment (Phase 1)  — This is also the first phase of dam removal and reservoir drawdown. By the end of this phase, enough of the dam would be removed so that the lake no longer existed. During this phase, the river would incise channels through the delta eroding and redistributing coarse delta sediment within the reservoir area. Only fine delta sediment would be transported through the lake and past the dam.   In the first phase, the model computes the erosion and redistribution of delta sediment. The Elwha Reservoir model assumes that for a given drawdown increment, only a portion of the exposed delta is eroded. Erosion widths are assumed to be of some minimum value at the upstream end and increase at a parabolic rate with distance downstream to a maximum value — equal to the reservoir width at the delta front (figure 14). Erosion widths are assumed to be symmetrical about the center of the reservoir. The delta erosion slope is assumed to be constant over time so that the erosion depth is equal to the lake drawdown increment.   The frequency and amount of the reservoir drawdown increments are defined by the user. The model assumes that the lake is held at a constant elevation and for a long enough duration so that erosion and redistribution of the computed erosion volume has occurred.   For a given lake drawdown increment, delta erosion widths are computed for each reservoir cross section using equation 1:   · Eq. 1 EW = 2[aX b  + EW min /2]    where:        EW is the erosion width at a distance X,  X is the erosion channel length (increasing in the downstream direction),  a is a coefficient calculated by the model such that EW is equal to the lake width at the delta front,  b is a user defined exponent, and  EW min  is the minimum erosion width.          Figure 14. Elwha Reservoir Model: Example plan and profile plots of the Lake Mills delta erosion and redistribution after three increments of lake drawdown.     (After the first drawdown increment, the river has eroded and redistributed a portion of the delta downstream. Erosion widths increase at a parabolic rate with distance downstream, leaving a sediment terrace behind on both sides of the lake (area 1 and profile 1). After the second drawdown increment, another portion of the delta is eroded leaving a narrow, lower-level terrace on each side (area 2 and profile 2). After the third drawdown increment, a third terrace is left on each side (area 3 and profile 3), the river has eroded down to profile 4 and the delta front has advanced downstream. Some terrace levels may be lost later due to channel widening during subsequently higher lake inflows.)   In equation 1, the erosion width (EW) is a minimum at the upstream end of the erosion channel (X = 0) and is a maximum at the delta front. The upstream end of the erosion channel is where the erosion slope intersects the predam reservoir bottom. In the case of Lake Mills, the upstream end is limited by the mouth of Rica Canyon and the erosion in Rica Canyon is computed separately.   The minimum erosion width is assumed to be a function of discharge and is computed using equation 2 — a regime equation:        · Eq. 2 EW min  = c Q w 0.41        where:      EW min  is the minimum erosion width (in feet),  c is a channel width coefficient and  Q w  is the river discharge (in cfs).      A regime equation is used to predict channel widths that would be achieved over a period of years or decades. In the case of the Elwha River forming a channel through the reservoir delta, use of the regime equation is expected to over predict actual erosion widths and volumes.   The exponent of 0.41 has been theoretically derived by Yang, Song, and Woldenberg (1981) and agrees well with rivers in the United States. The coefficient ""c"" was computed separately for a range of discharge values using measured width and discharge data from the Krause Bottom reach of the Elwha River (c = Q w 0.41 /EW min ). This is a natural alluvial reach upstream from Lake Mills and Rica Canyon. Krause Bottom was subjected to a large sediment supply from a natural landslide that occurred a short distance upstream in the mid-1960's. The river in this reach exhibits characteristics of a braided channel and the active channel widths are relatively wide. Data from this reach were chosen to estimate the erosion widths.   Active channel widths in this reach were measured from an aerial photograph taken April 16, 1994. The widest active width of 530 feet was associated with the 2-year flood of 13,100 cfs (Reclamation, March 1995). The widest wetted channel width of 200 feet was also measured from the photograph and associated with discharge of 930 cfs (measured at the Elwha River stream gauge above Lake Mills on the same day the photograph was taken).   From these data, equations 3 through 5 were developed for three discharge ranges.   For discharges (Q w ) less than or equal to 10,000 cfs:   · Eq. 3 EW min  = [200 ft / (930 cfs) 0.41 ] Q w 0.41  = 12.1 Q w 0.41    For discharges between 10,000 and 13,100 cfs:   · Eq. 4 EW min  = 530 ft    For discharges greater than or equal to 13,100 cfs:   · Eq. 5 EW min  = [530 ft) / (13,100 cfs) 0.41 ] Q w 0.41  = 10.9 Q w 0.41    These functions are shown graphically in figure 15. Erosion widths increase more slowly than corresponding increases in discharge. For example, a 20-percent increase in discharge from 15,000 to 18,000 cfs results in a 7.7-percent width increase from 562 to 605 feet. The channel width is constant (530 feet) for discharges between 10,000 and 13,100 cfs because almost-vertical river banks prevent wetted widths from increasing until the river stage has overtopped the bank.        Figure 15. Elwha Reservoir Model Input:    Width-discharge Relationship for Krause Bottom Reach.                  For each lake drawdown increment, the surface erosion area is computed using equation 6, which is the integral of equation 1:   · Eq. 6 EA = 2[{a/(b+1)}X (b+1)  + (EW min /2)X]    where:      EA is the surface erosion area.      Erosion volume is computed using equation 7, which is simply the erosion area times the erosion thickness:   · Eq. 7 EV = (EA)(TK)    where:      EV is the total erosion volume for a given drawdown increment and   TK is the erosion thickness and equal to the lake drawdown increment.      If the computed erosion width for any cross section (of a given drawdown increment) is greater than a previously computed erosion width for that cross section, then any overlying sediment is also eroded and the correspond volume is added to the total erosion volume.   The coarse and fine sediment erosion volumes are computed as percentages of the total erosion volume. The distribution of the erosion volumes over the days of the drawdown increment are computed from erosion distribution coefficients. These coefficients — one for each day of the drawdown increment — are defined by the user. The sum of these coefficients must total 1.   The coarse-sediment erosion volume is assumed to deposit immediately downstream of the delta front and up to the drawn-down lake elevation. The deposition volume is computed using equation 8 and is equal to the coarse-sediment-erosion volume plus the upstream supply of coarse sediment:        · Eq. 8 DV = (EV)(pc) + QSc up        where:      DV is the deposition volume of coarse sediment,   pc is the percentage of coarse sediment from the eroded delta, and  QSc up  is the upstream coarse-sediment supply for the drawdown increment.      The width of the redeposited coarse sediment is assumed to be equal to the lake width. The thickness and downstream length are computed from the reservoir geometry using an iterative procedure. The table of water volume versus lake elevation is updated to account for redeposition of the coarse delta sediment into the lower lake.   The fine-sediment erosion volume is assumed to be resuspended in the lake and remain suspended until transported past the dam. This assumption means that the fine sediment never settles out on the margins of the reservoir and consequently over-estimates the concentration of fine sediment released downstream.   The lake concentration is computed using equation 9:   · Eq. 9 L conc  = (VOL sed /VOL wat )(W f /W w )(1,000,000)    where:   L conc  is the fine sediment lake concentration (ppm by weight),        VOL sed  is the cumulative volume of fine sediment suspended in the lake,   VOL wat  is the volume of water and suspended sediment in the lake,        W f  is the unit dry weight of fine sediment, and   W w  is the unit weight of the water-sediment mixture (chapter VIII, section B–5).   The cumulative volume of fine sediment suspended in the lake (VOL sed ) tends to increase with dam removal as more material is eroded and resuspended into the lake. The volume of water in the lake (VOL wat ) decreases with dam removal and with deposition of coarse sediment transported from the upstream delta.   The volume of water released from the dam on a given day is computed using equation 10, a function of lake inflow, the lake drawdown volume (if any that day), and the lake volume displaced by the accumulation of coarse sediment from upstream.   · Eq. 10 QW out  = QW in  + DR + (DV)(C day )(1–n)    where:      QW out  is the daily lake outflow volume of water,  QW in  is the daily lake inflow volume of water,  DR is the daily lake drawdown volume,  DV is the coarse sediment deposition volume for the drawdown increment,  C day  is the coefficient or fraction of the coarse sediment volume deposited that day, and  n is the porosity of the coarse sediment (ratio of the volume of voids or pores to the total volume of sediment).      With each increment of dam removal, the lake is assumed to drawdown over a one-day period. Therefore, the drawdown volume (DR) only applies to the first day in which an increment of the dam is removed.   Lake water is released from the lake surface over the top of the dam. Because fine sediment concentration would be less near the surface than at depths, release concentrations were empirically reduced by the inverse of the residence time and computed using equation 11 (Smillie and Jackson, 1995):   · Eq. 11 R conc  = L conc (1/RT)    where:   R conc  is the fine sediment release concentration (ppm by weight),   L conc  is the fine sediment lake concentration, and        RT is the lake residence time, in days.        The lake residence time is the number of days for water to travel through the lake, not less than 1, and is computed using equation 12:   · Eq. 12 RT = VOL wat  / QW in    where:        QW in  is the mean lake inflow rate over the drawdown increment.        The volume of fine sediment released each day is computed using equation 13, which is the fine sediment release concentration multiplied by the released volume of water:   · Eq. 13 QSf out  = R conc QW out    where:        QSf out  is the volume of fine sediment released from the dam.               2. Release of coarse delta sediment (Phase 2)  — Dam removal would continue without a lake. The river would continue to incise channels through the reservoir sediment. As this occurred, a portion of the redistributed, coarse delta sediment and a portion of the fine lakebed sediment (exposed during previous delta erosion) would be eroded and transported past the dam.   At the beginning of the second phase, coarse sediment from the delta would have reached the dam and covered the fine sediment of the lakebed. Once this occurred, the elevation of sediment would be about equal to the top of the remaining dam and the lake would no longer exist, but rather a stub dam with the remaining reservoir full of sediment. Coarse sediment would be released downstream with the next increments of dam removal and would no longer be redistributed within the lake (i.e., no new delta deposition).   Because delta sediment has reached the dam in this phase, eroded sediment is now released downstream from the dam and no new delta deposits are created. Channel erosion widths at the damsite are limited by bedrock controls. Regime equations 3, 4, and 5 are used to compute erosion widths of the exposed sediment with each increment of dam removal. Erosion volumes for coarse and fine sediment are computed from equations 14 and 15, respectively:   · Eq. 14 EV c  = X c  (EW) TK    where:      X c  is the length of the erosion channel through coarse sediment (limited to the distance between the dam and where the channel intersects the predam riverbed);   EW is the erosion width computed from equations 3, 4, or 5; and   TK is the erosion thickness and equal to the lake drawdown increment.       · Eq. 15 EV f  = X f  (EW) TK    where:      X f  is the length of the erosion channel through fine sediment (limited to the distance between the dam and where the channel intersects the predam riverbed);      The total of X c  and X f  equals X which is the total length of the erosion channel between the dam and where the channel intersects the predam riverbed.   Erosion widths are computed to increase with discharge. For the case of a constant discharge, the model would compute a vertically incised channel of constant width. When the discharge increases, so to does the width of the erosion channel. Any overlying sediment is also eroded and added to the total erosion volume.   Coarse and fine sediment erosion volumes are distributed over the days of the drawdown increment using a user-supplied coefficient for each day. In this phase of dam removal, the fine sediment concentration released downstream is computed using equation 16:   · Eq. 16 R conc  = [(C day ) EV f  + Qsf up ] / (QW out )(W f /W w ) (1,000,000 )   where:      R conc  is the fine sediment release concentration (ppm by weight),  C day  is the coefficient or fraction of sediment released that day,      Ev f  is the erosion volume of fine sediment,      QSf up  is the fine sediment volume supplied from upstream, and  QW out  is the daily water discharge volume past the damsite — equal to the inflow of the former lake area.      The amount of coarse sediment released to the river downstream is computed using equation 17 which is the coarse sediment erosion volume plus the amount of coarse sediment supplied from upstream:   · Eq. 17 RV c  = (C day ) (EV c ) + QSc up    where:        RV c  is the daily release volume of coarse sediment,   QSc up  is the upstream sediment supply of coarse sediment volume.               3. Release of fine lakebed sediment near the dam (Phase 3)  — The final stages of dam removal occur during the third phase. At the beginning of the third phase, dam removal would have progressed to a point where the river has vertically eroded a channel through the layers of coarse, redeposited delta sediment. The fine lakebed sediment near the dam would be exposed. The rate of fine sediment release past each dam would be initially high after a sudden increment of dam removal. This rate would decrease exponentially with time until the next dam removal increment.   In phase 3, the model only computes vertical erosion through the fine lakebed sediment. The erosion volume of fine lakebed sediment is computed from equation 15. The erosion channel length, X f , is equal to X, the distance between the dam and where the channel intersects the predam riverbed, and X c  is equal to zero. The release concentration of fine sediment is computed from equation 16. The erosion and release of any overlying coarse sediment are only computed from channel widening and only when the previous maximum discharge has been exceeded.   4. Post dam removal with sediment release during floodflows (Phase 4)  — At the beginning of the fourth phase, the dam would have been removed and the river would have eroded down to predam alluvium. Through channel meandering and bank erosion, the river would erode and transport both coarse and fine sediment out of the reservoir area during progressively higher floodflows.   In phase 4, the model no longer computes vertical erosion through the reservoir sediment. Erosion of coarse and fine sediment only occurs through channel widening. Otherwise, the transport of coarse and fine sediment past the damsite are limited to the amount entering the reservoir area from upstream.   5. Unit weight of sediment  — No reliable data were available on either sediment porosity (ratio of void volume to total sediment volume) or dry unit weight for the fine sediment of Lake Mills. These data are difficult to obtain in reservoirs. In addition to logistical problems of sampling in deep water, the sediment was easily compacted during sampling.   The correction factor, W f /W w , was computed to convert sediment concentrations from ppm by volume to ppm by weight. However, the computed correction factor was almost equal to one (1.15  »  1). A correction factor of one (W f /W w  = 1) was actually used because of the basic uncertainty of the computed dry unit weight and of the general process being modeled and because the computed factor is close to one. The following discussion describes how the factor W f /W w  was computed.   The average dry unit weight of lakebed sediment in Lake Mills was calculated using the procedure described in  Reservoir Sedimentation  (Reclamation, 1982). This guideline provides initial dry units weights for clay, silt, and sand for various reservoir operating practices and also provides an equation to account for compaction over time.   The initial weights and compaction factors for Lake Mills were obtained from the guideline assuming that the sediment is almost always submerged (table 7). The percentages of sediment type in the lakebed were based on average-size gradation analyses of samples collected from Lake Mills (D. Gathard, Summit Technology Consulting Engineers, Seattle, WA, written communication, 1995).     Table 7. Reservoir Sediment Initial Weights and Compaction Factors.             Sediment type        Initial unit weight  (lbs/ft 3 )        Compaction factor  — K        Percentage in lakebed            clay        26        16        23            silt        70        5.7        77            sand        97        0.0        0        The equation for computing the average initial weight is:   · Eq. 18 W o  = Wcp c  + W m p m  + W s p s    where     W o  is the average initial dry unit weight;  W c , W m , W s  are the initial dry unit weights of clay, silt, and sand; and  p c , p m , p s  are the percentages of clay, silt, and sand.  Using equation 18, the initial dry unit weight for lakebed sediment of Lake Mills is:   W o  = 26 lbs/ft 3  (0.23) + 70 lbs/ft 3  (0.77) =  60 lbs/ft 3    However, the sediment would have compacted over time. Part of the sediment deposited during each year of operation and each year’s deposit would have a different compaction time. The average dry unit weight of all sediment deposited in ""T"" years of operation is:        · Eq. 19 W T  = W o  + 0.4343 K [{T/(T – 1)} ln(T) – 1]        where       W T  is the average dry unit weight after T years of operation and  K is a compaction factor based on the type of reservoir operation and sediment size.    The compaction factor K is computed from equation 20.        · Eq. 20 K = K c p c  + K m p m  + K s p s        where          K c , K m , K s  are correction factors for clay, silt, and sand based on the type of reservoir operation (table 7).          Using equation 20, the composite K-factor for Lake Mills, assuming normally submerged conditions, is:   K = (16)(.23) + (5.7)(.77) + (0)(0) =  8.1    Over the 68 years of reservoir operation from 1927–95, the average dry unit weight of fine lakebed sediment (using equation 19) is:   W f  = W T  = 60 lbs/ft 3  + (0.4343)(8.1)[{68/(68 – 1)} ln e (68) - 1] =  71.5 lbs/ft 3    Therefore, the computed correction factor to convert the concentrations to ppm by weight is:  W f  =  71.5 lbs/ft 3  = 1.15  »  1   W w  62.4 lbs/ft 3          C. LAKE MILLS SEDIMENT MODELING DURING REMOVAL OF GLINES CANYON DAM    The Elwha Reservoir model was used to simulate the sediment erosion, redistribution, and release downstream from Lake Mills during removal of Glines Canyon Dam. Concurrent removal of Glines Canyon and Elwha Dams was simulated by using model output from Lake Mills as model input for the simulation of Lake Aldwell.   1. Lake Mills model input  — The timing of dam-removal increments would depend on lake inflow and any seasonal restrictions to mitigate impacts on migrating fish. The Elwha Reservoir model assumes that drawdown of Lake Mills could begin as early as June 1st of a given year (chapter III, section A) if riverflows into the lake are low enough. Drawdown increments were assumed to occur every 14 days if the root-mean-squared inflow (equation 21) for each 14-day period was less than or equal to 1,400 cfs. Otherwise, the model assumes that dam removal operations would be suspended due to high flow conditions and the lake is assumed to remain at a constant elevation. Other than high flow periods, the model assumes that there are no other seasonal restrictions on dam removal.   · Eq. 21 Q RMS  = [{ S  (Q wi ) 2 }/n]0.5    where,     Q RMS  is the root-mean-squared lake inflow (discharge),  Q wi  is the mean daily discharge, and  n is the number of days over which the average is computed (n = 14).  The root-mean-squared discharge was computed, rather than a simple average, to give more weight to the high discharge values.   Lake drawdown increments of 15 feet were assumed between lake elevations of 590 to 530 feet. This corresponds to the period when the lake elevation can be drawn down by penstock releases. The drawdown increment was reduced to 7.5 feet between lake elevations of 530 to 425 feet — the period corresponding to dam removal by notching. The arch portion of the dam would be completely removed down to an elevation of 400 feet. However, the last 25 feet of dam removal are not simulated because there is negligible storage or water or sediment behind the dam at an elevation of 425 feet.   Reservoir sediment cross section data for Lake Mills were obtained from the 1921 (predam) and 1989 topographic maps. A total of 14 cross sections were established on the 1921 and 1989 maps from just upstream of the damsite to the mouth of Rica Canyon. The location of these cross sections are shown on figure 8. A table of predam (1921) and current (1989) thalwegs were constructed from the cross section data. In addition, the table includes cross-sectional area versus lake elevation for each cross section (table 8).   Original lake capacity data were digitized from a plot of elevation versus reservoir capacity (Thebo, Starr, and Anderson, 1926). Current lake capacity data were computed using the original lake capacity and sedimentation volume from Reclamation (August 1995). This sedimentation volume was distributed throughout the lake using a sediment distribution design curve from  Reservoir Sedimentation  (Reclamation, 1982) for the case where the sediment is almost always submerged. A current lake capacity curve could have also been digitized from the 1989 topographic map but the value added from this effort was judged not to be worth the additional work.        Table 8.

The delta was also known to contain some silt- and clay-sized sediment. Reclamation (August 1995) provided sediment volume and size data for the Lake Mills delta. From this data, a simple table of delta elevation range and fine-sediment percentage was developed (table 9).     Table 9. Lake Mills Delta Elevation Range Versus Average Percentage of Fine Sediment.             Delta elevation range  (feet)        Average percentage of fine sediment            > 552        5.15            552 to 527        13.87            < 527        47.53        During lake drawdown, the delta erosion width was assumed to increase at a parabolic rate with distance downstream (equation 1). An exponent of 2 agreed well with erosion widths observed during the 1994 Lake Mills drawdown experiment and was used in Elwha Reservoir model simulations.   The longitudinal erosion slopes for coarse and fine sediment were set equal to the computed equilibrium slope for the delta (0.00052; see chapter VII, section B). The fine sediment erosion slope was assumed to be controlled by coarse delta sediment and therefore equal to the coarse sediment erosion slope.   The erosion volume of coarse and fine sediment released downstream from the dam is computed for each drawdown increment. The daily-release coefficients used to distribute this erosion volume over the days of the drawdown increment are presented in figure 16.   In the first phase of dam removal, portions of the lake delta are eroded and redistributed downstream toward the dam. Based on the 1994 Lake Mills drawdown experiment, lake drawdown initiates vertical erosion of the delta followed by lateral erosion near the delta front. Delta sediment therefore erodes at a relatively uniform rate. The erosion rate of coarse and fine sediment was assumed to decrease linearly over time so that the erosion rate on the 14th day of the drawdown cycle was 30-percent less than the erosion rate on the first day (figure 16). In subsequent phases of dam removal and lake drawdown, sediment release rates were assumed to have an exponential decay with time. High sediment release rates would occur immediately after a notch opening in the dam. These high rates would rapidly decrease as head cut erosion progressed upstream followed by lateral erosion. An exponential decay curve was developed based on HEC-6 modeling of sudden notch openings in the dam (chapter VII, section C; also figure 12). The coefficients to distribute sediment release over time within a reservoir drawdown increment were taken from this exponential decay curve.  Figure 16. Elwha Reservoir Model Input: Daily Sediment Release Coefficients.    (Sediment is eroded at an almost constant rate when coarse delta sediments are redepositing across the lake [first phase of dam removal]. Sediment erosion rates decay exponentially after the coarse delta sediments have reached the dam [subsequent phase of dam removal].)                2. Lake Mills model results  — Model simulations were performed using both constant and variable lake inflow.   · Constant lake inflow —  A simulation was performed using a low constant lake inflow of 1,000 cfs. This simulation is helpful for understanding model procedure and capability. Simulation results of fine and coarse sediment released downstream are shown in figure 17.   During dam removal (phases 1, 2, and 3), the predicted fine-sediment-concentration pattern follows the pattern of notch openings in the dam and subsequent lake drawdown. After the delta front reaches the dam (phase 2), the predicted pattern of coarse sediment release also follows the pattern of notch openings in the dam and subsequent lake drawdown. Release rates of fine and coarse sediment tend to be highest immediately after each notch opening, then decrease with time until the next notch opening. During the entire dam removal process, fine sediment release concentrations are initially low, then tend to increase with time as more sediment is eroded and lake water volumes decrease. Sediment terraces within the lakebed and delta areas are predicted and shown in figure 18.  Figure 17.

Elwha Reservoir Model Results for a Constant Inflow of 1,000 cfs.    (Reservoir sediment terraces remaining in Lake Mills after removal of Glines Canyon Dam.)               ·  Variable lake inflow and hydrologic scenarios —  In the Elwha Reservoir model, sediment erosion widths and total erosion volumes increase with lake inflow. Therefore, model simulations were performed using historic flows as the lake inflow. Historic mean daily discharges for the Elwha River were obtained from USGS measurements at the McDonald Bridge gauging station. Four different hydrologic scenarios were simulated, each based on 3 years 4 months of historic flow:   · Hydrologic scenario 1. June 1, 1968 to September 30, 1971   · Hydrologic scenario 2. June 1, 1950 to September 30, 1953   · Hydrologic scenario 3. June 1, 1971 to September 30, 1974   · Hydrologic scenario 4. June 1, 1989 to September 30, 1992   Each of these historic periods were selected based on annual peak mean daily discharges (table 10 and appendix B). Hydrologic scenario 1 includes the lowest peak discharges for any three consecutive water years of record. Scenario 4 includes the highest peak discharges for any three consecutive years of record. Scenarios 2 and 3 were arbitrarily chosen to represent the range between the extremes of scenarios 1 and 4. Scenario 2 includes a year of relatively high annual-peak discharge followed by a year of relatively low and then moderate annual-peak discharge. Each year of scenario 3 has a progressively higher annual-peak discharge. A hydrograph plot of each scenario is presented in figure 19.        Table 10.

In each case, the model predicted that the sediment surface elevation would be 462.5 feet when the eroding delta front first reached the dam.

However, the model predicted slightly more sediment erosion from scenario 1 than from scenario 2. This is because larger lake inflows were occurring in scenario 1 during the spring snowmelt of the second water year (when compared with scenario 2). The higher spring snowmelt flows of scenario 1 were eroding more sediment terrace levels when compared with scenario 2. Although scenario 2 contained a higher peak flow for all water years, the largest peak occurred early in the second water year and eroded fewer sediment terraces than compared to the higher spring flow of scenario 1, which occurred later in the water year.   The predicted release of fine and coarse sediment from Lake Mills for each of the four hydrologic scenarios has many similarities to the previous simulation of constant lake inflow. Five distinct periods are evident for each of these four hydrologic scenarios (appendix C).   ·  Begin lake drawdown for dam removal (phase 1) —  This period would be from June through October of the first year. Fine sediment concentrations released downstream would be initially low and then increase as drawdown continues. Concentrations would be less than 500 ppm most days with maximum concentrations of 1,100–34,000 ppm (lasting 1–3 days), depending on lake inflows. Coarse sediment from the delta would erode and redeposit in the lower lake but no coarse sediment would be released downstream.   ·  Stop lake drawdown and dam removal during winter high flows (phase 1) —  This period likely would be from November through January of the second year. Exposed delta sediment would continue to erode but none would be released downstream. The remaining lake would be flushed by the high lake inflows and fine sediment concentrations released downstream would be low and close to natural conditions.   ·  Continue dam removal and lake drawdown after winter high flows (phase 1) —  This period would probably be from February through April of the second year. Fine sediment concentrations released downstream would be 1,000–10,000 ppm most days with maximum concentrations of 6,400–13,000 ppm (lasting 1–3 days). Coarse sediment from the delta would be approaching the dam but no coarse sediment would be released downstream.   ·  Stop dam removal and lake drawdown during spring high flows (phase 1) —  This period would likely be from May through June of the second year. Coarse delta sediment would almost reach the dam but none would yet be released downstream. The remaining lake would be small and flushed by the high lake inflows. Fine sediment concentrations released downstream would be similar to natural inflows.   · Finish dam removal after spring high flows (phases 2 and 3) —  This period would likely be from July through September or October of the second year. Coarse sediment from the delta would reach the dam and be released downstream. Coarse sediment release rates would initially be high but decrease rapidly with time. Fine sediment concentrations released downstream would be 1,000–5,000 ppm most days with maximum concentrations of between 6,400–27,000 ppm (lasting 1 to 3 days), depending on lake inflow.   · Reservoir sediment erosion and release following dam removal (phase 4) —  This period would begin during October of the second year and continue for about two more years (model simulations continued through September of the fourth year). The erosion and release of coarse and fine sediment would be low and close to natural conditions most of the time. However, floodflows of progressively higher magnitude would continue to widen erosion channels through the reservoir and produce high rates of both coarse and fine sediment release downstream. Peak concentrations of fine sediment would be 17,000–29,000 ppm. Peak concentrations would typically be of short duration (1–3 days) and the magnitudes of these events would tend to decrease with time.   During dam removal, maximum coarse sediment loads released downstream for each simulation ranged 80,000–160,000 tons per day with a duration of a few days. Maximum coarse sediment loads were greater after dam removal in all model simulations. This is because the model assumed that all of the sediment within the computed erosion width is released downstream over a one-day period. During actual dam removal, the sediment would likely erode over several days.   The Elwha Reservoir model simulations predict sediment terraces development within the lakebed and delta areas. The lower elevation terraces are subject to widening during floodflows. Computed channel erosion widths at the predam thalweg are listed in table 12 for each hydrologic scenario. Figures 24 through 27 show the final reservoir topography for cross sections K, F, and C (figure 8 for cross section locations) for each hydrologic scenario. In general, model results predict that lower elevations terraces would be lost to bank erosion during floodflows and channel bank heights would be greater.        Table 12.

LAKE ALDWELL SEDIMENT MODELING DURING REMOVAL OF ELWHA DAM    The predicted release of water and sediment from Lake Mills was used as input for the Elwha Reservoir model when applied to Lake Aldwell. Attenuation or storage of the released water and sediment within the river channel between the two lakes was ignored.   1. Lake Aldwell Model Input  — Current topography data for Lake Aldwell were obtained from the 1994 bathymetric survey. Because there is no record of a predam survey, predam topography was estimated by Reclamation (August 1995) using current topography and drill hole information. Fourteen cross sections were established on the 1994 topographic map from just upstream of the damsite to the Highway 101 bridge. The locations of these cross sections are shown on figure 28. A table of predam (1913) and current (1994) thalwegs was constructed from the current cross section data and drill hole information. Some 1994 thalweg elevations were adjusted because the model could not handle adverse slopes (e.g. upward slope of the riverbed in the downstream direction). In addition, the table includes cross-sectional area versus lake elevation for each cross section (table 13).   A current table of reservoir capacity versus lake elevation for Lake Aldwell was computed from the 1994 cross section data.   Reclamation (August 1995) provided sediment volume and size gradation data for the reservoir sediments of Lake Aldwell. However, data were not available to describe how size gradations varied with elevation. The reservoir sediments can be classified in two different ways: by size (coarse and fine) and by location (delta and lakebed). Of the 3.88 myd 3  of sediment, 1.29 myd 3  are coarse (sand, gravel, and cobbles) and 2.59 myd 3  are fine (silt- and clay-size). Classifying by location, 1.78 myd 3  are in the delta area and 2.10 myd 3  are in the lakebed and pro-delta areas.   The entire lakebed was assumed to consist of fine sediment. The entire delta was assumed to contain 72.7 percent coarse sediment (0.727 = 1.293 myd 3  coarse / 1.778 myd 3  delta) and 27.3 percent fine sediment.     Table 13.

GX267-43-7428988	"ATMOSPHERIC HAZARD  avalanche - a large mass of snow, ice, etc., detached from a mountain slope and sliding or falling suddenly downward. Also called snowslides. SNOW AVALANCHE It is estimated that 100,000 snow avalanches occur each year, yet only about 10,000 snow avalanches are reported. Avalanches need a steep slope, snow cover, a weak layer in the snow cover, and a trigger. In Wellington, Washington in 1910, an avalanche derailed two trains, killing 96 people. The greatest avalanche threats are in the mountainous areas of the Western United States, including Alaska. Over the past 30 years, on average each year, 144 persons have been trapped; resulting in 14 injured and 14 dead. The total number of deaths attributed to snow avalanches each year is exceeded only by floods, lightning, tornadoes and extreme heat. The estimated annual average damage to structures is $500,000. The estimated annual impacts and costs of all factors is greater than $5 million. If conditions are right, avalanche releases can reach maximum velocities of 157 mph. Avalanches may be triggered by natural causes or human actions. Human activities, such as snowmobiling, snowboarding, skiing, hiking, driving or setting off explosions may trigger an avalanche. Loss of life of backcountry skiers, snowboarders, backpackers, climbers, and snowmobilers due to suffocation is the principal danger. Natural causes include earthquakes, thermal changes, and blizzards. Ice slabs falling off cornices may trigger avalanches as well. In Vail, avalanche hazard zones are incorporated in the comprehensive plan and is one of the tools used in evaluating development proposals.

(Division of Water Resources, 1988) appurtenant structure - the outlet works and controls, spillways and controls, access structures, bridges, and related housings at a dam. (Division of Water Resources, 1988) FACTS  According to the 1993-4 National Inventory of Dams, there are 74,053 dams identified in the United States.      About 27,000 dams exist in Colorado. Dams are usually made of earth, rock, concrete, or mine tailings. Dam failures result in downstream flooding. A dam failure in 1889 in Johnstown, Pennsylvania resulted in 2,209 deaths. Classification of a dam is based upon an evaluation of the consequences of the failure of the dam absent flooding conditions, assuming the reservoir is at the high-water line. Colorado requires that owners of Class I (high hazard) and Class II (significant hazard) dams prepare an emergency preparedness plan (EPP). An EPP is prepared by the dam owner and includes a detailed plan to prevent or lessen the effects of a potential dam failure. Two presidential disaster declarations for Colorado came as a result of dam failures: the Lower Latham Dam (Weld County) failure in 1973 and the Lawn Lake (including the Cascade Dam) in Rocky Mountain National Park in 1982. Three lost lives and over $30 million in damages were attributed to the Lawn Lake dam failure in Colorado in 1982. Long periods of rainfall and flooding, inadequate spillway capacity, inadequate maintenance, erosion, improper design, failure of upstream dams, landslides, high winds, and earthquakes can cause dam failures.

The Colorado Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water Resources, Office of the State Engineer concentrates on the 1,833 that are ""jurisdictional"" dams and reservoirs as defined in Section 37-87-105, C.R.S. (1999 Supp.). These are greater than ten feet high at the spillway or twenty acres in surface area or 100 acre-feet in capacity at the high water line.

DROUGHT  Ironically, droughts are usually associated with ""unusually nice weather,"" for example, very long periods of warm, dry, sunny days.  High temperatures, prolonged high winds, and low relative humidity can aggravate drought conditions. Twenty Colorado counties declared drought disasters due to loss of winter wheat and hay for cattle in the 1989-1990 season. Losses to the agricultural community were estimated in the millions of dollars. Loss estimates for the 1976-1977 drought in the Great Plains, Upper Midwest, and Western States were up to $15 billion. Losses for the 1987-1989 drought in the Central and Eastern states were $39 billion. In 1998, over $2 billion in property loss was credited to drought in the United States. Significant impacts, which may affect Colorado during periods of drought, are those that rely heavily on high water usage. Activities affected include agriculture, tourism, wildfire protection, municipal water usage, commerce, recreation, wildlife preservation, electric power generation, and water quality deterioration. Droughts can lead to economic losses, such as unemployment, decreased land values, and business losses. In September 2000, there are seven open Small Business Administration disaster declarations. Six declarations include drought. These declarations allow small businesses in certain counties that meet the criteria to apply for low interest Economic Injury Disaster Loans.

Magnitude (M) is a measure of the total energy released. Each earthquake has one magnitude. Intensity (I) is used to describe the effects of the earthquake at a particular place. Intensity differs throughout the area. The Northridge Earthquake of 1994 caused $20 billion in damage. Many earthquakes in Colorado occur naturally; many are caused by human actions. Humans may trigger earthquakes through different types of activities including oil and gas extraction, reservoir impoundment, fluid injection, or mining. In the 1960s, earthquakes were triggered as a result of activities at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal. Recent earthquake activity has been triggered by human activities at Rangely Oilfield, Paradox Basin, and Ridgway Reservoir. Seismic events may lead to landslides, uneven ground settling, flooding, and damage to homes, dams, levees, buildings, power and telephone lines, roads, tunnels, and railways. Broken natural gas lines may cause fires. Scientists are constantly studying faults in Colorado to determine future earthquake potential. Faults are cracks in the earth's crust along which movement occurs. Thousands of faults have been mapped in Colorado, but scientists think only about 90 of these were active in the past 1.6 million years.

Source: FEMA 1997  DAMAGE COSTS ($MILLIONS) 311.0  Introduction - Colorado is comprised of areas with low to moderate potential for damaging earthquakes, based on research by geologists and geophysicists who specialize in seismology. Several 1000 faults have been mapped in Colorado.... Thus far, about 90 potentially active faults have been identified, with documented movement within the last 1.6 million years. Because the occurrence of earthquakes is relatively infrequent in Colorado and the historical earthquake record is short (only about 130 years), it is not possible to accurately estimate the timing or location of future dangerous earthquakes in Colorado. Nevertheless, the available seismic hazard information can provide a basis for a reasoned and prudent approach to seismic safety. Faulting - Sudden movement on faults is responsible for large earthquakes. By studying the geologic characteristics of faults, geoscientists can often determine when the fault last moved and estimate the magnitude of the earthquake that produced the last movement. In some cases, it is possible to evaluate how frequently large earthquakes occurred on a specific fault during the recent geological past. Geological studies in Colorado indicate that there are about 90 faults that moved during the Quaternary Period (the last 1.6 million years) and should be considered potentially active. The Sangre de Cristo Fault, which lies at the base of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains along the eastern edge of the San Luis Valley, and the Sawatch Fault, which runs along the eastern margin of the Sawatch Range, are two of the most prominent potentially active faults in Colorado. Not all of Colorado's potentially active faults are in the mountains and some cannot be seen at the earth's surface. For example, the Cheraw Fault, which is in the Great Plains in southeast Colorado, appears to have had movement during the recent geologic past. The Derby Fault near Commerce City lies thousands of feet below the earth's surface but has not been recognized at ground level. Several potentially active faults in Colorado are thought to be capable of causing earthquakes as large as magnitude 6 to 7. In comparison, California has hundreds of hazardous faults, some of which can cause earthquakes of magnitude 8 or larger. The time interval between large earthquakes on faults in Colorado is generally much longer than on faults in California. Past and Possible Future Earthquakes - More than 400 earthquake tremors of magnitude 2 or higher have been recorded in Colorado since 1867. More earthquakes of magnitude 2 to 3 probably occurred during that time, but were not recorded because of the sparse distribution of population and limited instrumental coverage in much of the state.

The largest known earthquake in Colorado occurred on November 7, 1882 and had an estimated magnitude of 6. The location of this earthquake, which has been the subject of much debate and controversy over the years, appears to be in the northern Front Range west of Fort Collins. The table below lists notable events in Colorado. Events are considered notable if the magnitude was greater than 5.0 on the Richter Scale or the intensity was greater than V on the Mercalli Scale.

Although these events cannot be classified as major earthquakes, they should not be discounted as insignificant. They occurred within Colorado's Front Range Urban Corridor, an area where nearly 75% of Colorado residents and many critical facilities are located. Since March 1971, well after the initial flurry of seismic activity, 15 earthquakes of approximate magnitude 2 or larger have occurred in the vicinity of the northern Denver suburbs. Relative to other western states, Colorado's earthquake hazard is higher than Kansas or Oklahoma, but lower than Utah, and certainly much lower than Nevada and California. Even though the seismic hazard in Colorado is low to moderate, it is likely that future damaging earthquakes will occur. It is prudent to expect future earthquakes as large as magnitude 6.5, the largest event of record. Calculations based on the historical earthquake record and geological evidence of recent fault activity suggest that an earthquake of magnitude 6 or greater may be expected somewhere in Colorado every several centuries. Summary and Conclusions - Based on the historical earthquake record and geologic studies in Colorado, an event of magnitude 6 to 7 could occur somewhere in the state. Scientists are unable to accurately predict when the next major earthquake will occur in Colorado, only that one will occur. The major factor preventing the precise identification of the time or location of the next damaging earthquake is the limited knowledge of potentially active faults. Given Colorado's continuing active economic growth and the accompanying expansion of population and infrastructure, it is prudent to continue the study and analysis of earthquake hazards. Existing knowledge should be used to incorporate appropriate levels of seismic safety in building codes and practices. The continued and expanded use of seismic safety provisions in critical and vulnerable structures and in emergency planning statewide is also recommended. Concurrently, we should expand earthquake monitoring, geological and geophysical research, and mitigation planning.

The most economically damaging earthquake in Colorado's history occurred on August 9, 1967 in the northeast Denver metropolitan area. This magnitude 5.3 earthquake, which was centered near Commerce City, caused more than a million dollars damage in Denver and the northern suburbs.

Maps are available from the CGS, the COEM, or the United States Geological Survey. Denver is the first area in Colorado to initiate a HAZUS study for earthquakes. The Colorado Office of Emergency Management provided technical assistance and the Earthquake Subcommittee (a subcommittee of the Geohazards Committee) served as advisors. All ""scenario events"" were run using the default data that is supplied with the HAZUS software. No user data was supplied. HAZUS runs for Denver were accomplished using HAZUS99-SR1 (service release 1), and ArcView 3.2. A comparison of two probabilistic scenarios with different return periods (500 and 2500 year) was made. The loss estimates by HAZUS are grouped into  4 categories: number of buildings damaged, casualties, shelter, and economic loss.

They are also commonly known as bentonite, expansive, or montmorillinitic soils."" (http://geosurvey.state.co.us/pubs/geohazards /docs/sp12.htm). SWELLING SOIL FACTS Soils that expand have a high proportion of water-absorbing clay particles. When wet, some expansive soils may expand more than ten percent. The resulting pressure can be more than 20,000 pounds per square foot on structures such as basement walls and floors. Pressure can be upward, horizontal, or both. Many times swelling soils present no problem in their natural state, however, exposure to water sources and drying cycles during or after development results in swelling and shrinking. Swelling and shrinking may occur any number of times for a single soil mass. Most damage occurs to highways, streets, and structures build on expansive soils. Losses can include damage to structures, driveways, roads, sidewalks, basement floors, gas pipelines, and sewer lines. Damage from expansive soils is estimated to be $2 billion per year. Despite knowledge of the problem and technical capability to address it, damages to public facilities in Colorado cost approximately $16 million annually. Methods for building in and on swelling soils are well developed and some are very sophisticated. Although there are more up front costs, there is usually no reason to avoid construction provided the appropriate mitigation measures are taken. EXPANSIVE SOIL/ROCK HAZARD IN COLORADO The following is reprinted from the Colorado Geological Survey website at http://geosurvey.state. co.us/pubs/geohazards/docs/sp12.htm. Swelling soils are soils or soft bedrock that increase in volume as they get wet and shrink as they dry out. They are also commonly known as bentonite, expansive, or montmorillinitic soils.  The ""roller-coaster road"" is the result of uneven swelling and heaving of steeply dipping bedrock layers. Photo by Dave Noe, Colorado Geological Survey  Characteristics Swelling soils contain a high percentage of certain kinds of clay particles that are capable of absorbing large quantities of water. Soil volume may expand 10 percent or more as the clay becomes wet. The powerful force of expansion is capable of exerting pressures of 20,000 psf or greater on foundations, slabs or other confining structures. Subsurface Colorado swelling soils tend to remain at a constant moisture content in their natural state and are usually relatively dry at the outset of disturbance for construction on them. Exposure to natural or mancaused water sources during or after development results in swelling. In many instances the soils do not regain their original dryness after construction, but remain somewhat moist and expanded due to the changed environment. Consequences Swelling soils are one of the nation's most prevalent causes of damage to buildings and construction. Annual losses are estimated in the range of $2 billion. The losses include severe structural damage, cracked driveways, sidewalks and basement floors, heaving of roads and highway structures, condemnation of buildings, and disruption of pipelines and sewer lines. The destructive forces may be upward, horizontal, or both.

Improper landscaping problems include inadequate management of surface drainage and planting vegetation next to the foundation so irrigation water enters the soil. Mitigation Methods for building in and on swelling soils are well developed and some of them are highly sophisticated. Although more costly initially, there is usually no reason to avoid construction provided the appropriate mitigation measures are taken.  Identifying soil problems  Testing of soils to determine their physical characteristics  Designing structures to withstand the ""worst possible"" changing soil conditions as indicated by testing.  Educating building owners/occupants about the soil situation and its potential significance, especially relative to the role of water. Land Use Swelling soils and rock can be a geologic factor that should be considered in the land use. As a soils engineering and foundation design challenge, swelling soils can be managed adequately so as to be secondary to other geologic/construction considerations. Despite this available knowledge and technical capability, selling soils damage in Colorado costs approximately $16 million annually in public facility damage alone. Case History Several structures on the Southern Colorado State University Campus northeast of Pueblo have been damaged because swelling soils were not recognized or compensated for adequately in design, construction and maintenance of buildings, sidewalks, driveways, and water lines. Water percolating into dry soils exposed by construction excavation caused the clays to expand, exerting tremendous upward pressures. Floors, walls, ceilings, sidewalks, water lines, driveways, and other improvements have sustained an estimated $1.5 million in damages. Case History In 1976 at the site of the new maximum security facility for the Colorado State Prison in Fremont County, swelling soils and bedrock were shown on geologic maps. Field investigations and soils tests resulted in a remedial plan by the geologic and soils engineers, architect, builder and others on foundation design, drainage and landscaping. Millions of dollars in potential damages were avoided.  A near-vertical bentonite layer in the Upper Cretaceous Pierre Shale in Jefferson County. Photo by Dave Noe, Colorado Geological Survey  Aggravating Circumstances Design and construction of structures while unaware of the existence and behavior of swelling soils can worsen a readily manageable situation. Where swelling soils are not recognized, improper building or structure design, faulty construction, inappropriate landscaping and long term maintenance practices unsuited to the specific soil conditions can become a continuing, costly problem. Design problems might include improper foundation loading, improper depth or diameter of drilled pier, insufficient reinforcing steel, and insufficient attention to surface and underground water. Miscalculating the severity of the problem for a particular clay soil can result in damage although some mitigating measures were taken. Construction problems related to swelling soils include lack of reinforcing steel, insufficient or improperly placed reinforcing steel, mushroom-topped drilled piers, and inadequate void space between soils and grade beams. Allowing clays to dry excessively before pouring concrete and permitting the ponding of water near a foundation during and after construction also are contributing factors in swelling-soil related construction problems. Building without allowance for basement or ground floor movement in known swelling soils areas is a very common source of  46   GEOLOGIC HAZARD TECHNOLOGICAL HAZARD Severity of problem Swelling soils are a nationwide problem, as shown by Jones and Holtz (1973): Each year, shrinking or swelling inflict at least $2.3 billion in damages to houses, buildings, roads, and pipelines  more than twice the damage from floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, and earthquakes...Over 250,000 new homes are built on expansive soils each year. 60 percent will experience only minor damage during their useful lives, but 10 percent will experience significant damage-some beyond repair...one person in 10 is affected by floods; but one in five by expansive soils. Swelling is generally caused by expansion due to wetting of certain clay minerals in dry soils. Therefore, arid or semi-arid areas such a Colorado with seasonal changes of soil moisture experience a much higher frequency of swelling problems than eastern states that have higher rainfall and more constant soil moisture. Rocks containing swelling clay are generally softer and less resistant to weathering and erosion than other rocks and therefore, more often occur along the sides of mountain valleys and on the plains than in the mountains. Because the population of Colorado is also concentrated in mountain valleys and on the plains, most of the homes, schools, public and commercial buildings, and roads in the state are located in areas of potentially swelling clay. Swelling clays are, therefore, one of the most significant, widespread, costly, and least publicized geologic hazards in Colorado. Criteria for Recognition Although several visual methods for identification of potentially swelling clays exist, only a competent, professional soil engineer and engineering geologist should be relied upon to identify this potential hazard. Some warning signs for swell might include: a) soft, puff, ""popcorn"" appearance of the surface soil when dry; b) surface soil that is very sticky when wet; c) open cracks (desiccation polygons) in dry surface soils; d) lack of vegetation due to heavy clay soils; e) soils that are very plastic and weak when wet but are ""rock-hard"" when dry. Engineering soil tests include index tests and design tests. Rapid, simple index tests are used to determine whether more complex design tests are necessary. Some index properties that may aid in the identification of probable areas of swelling clay include Atterberg limits, plasticity index, grain size determination, activity ratio, dry unit weight, and moisture content (Asphalt Institute, 1964). The primary design tests for swelling soils are the consolidation swell* test for buildings, and the California Bearing Ratio* swell test for roads (Asphalt Institute, 1964). Consequences of Improper Utilization Damage from swelling clays can affect, to some extent, virtually every type of structure in Colorado. Some structures, such as downtown Denver's skyscrapers, generally have well engineered foundations that are too heavily loaded for swelling damage to occur. At the opposite extreme are public schools and single family homes, which are generally constructed on a minimal budget and which may have under-designed lightly loaded foundations that are particularly subject to damage from soil movements. Homeowners and public agencies that assume they cannot afford more costly foundations and floor systems often incur the largest percentage of damage and costly repairs from swelling soil. In 1970, the state of Colorado spent nearly $1/2 million to repair cracked walls, floors, ceilings, and windows caused by swelling-clay damage at a state institution near Denver. In 1972, a state college library in southern Colorado required $170,000 to repair swelling-clay damage. A 6-yr-old, $2 million building on the same campus was closed pending repairs to structural components pulled apart by swelling clay. A college building in western Colorado and a National Guard armory near Denver are among the other state buildings severely damaged by swelling clays. These examples of damage to public buildings do not include the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent for repairs by local school districts. One school district near Denver is attempting to circumvent these expensive repairs by spending an additional $42,000 per school on structural floors. No figures are available for the total damage to homes in Colorado from swelling clays. However, several examples are known where the cost of repairs exceeded the value of the house. Cracked and heaved sidewalks, patios, driveways, and garage and basement floor slabs are very common indicators of swelling clay throughout Colorado. Highways in some areas of Colorado have required frequent and very expensive reconstruction or maintenance due to damage from swelling clay. As much as one foot of uplift from swelling clay forced the repair of two concrete lanes of interstate highway in eastern Colorado only six months after completion of paving. In the same area, additional right-of-way had to be purchased, and the highway design had to be revised to eliminate cuts and fills in order to prevent similar problems with the two remaining lanes. Mitigation Procedures Complete avoidance or non-conflicting use: In Colorado, swelling clays are so common in urban areas that complete avoidance is generally not feasible. However, all should recognize the widespread distribution of swelling soils, and precautions must be taken to require engineered  47   GEOLOGIC HAZARD TECHNOLOGICAL HAZARD foundation and floor systems designs and to provide detailed maintenance instructions to owners in affected areas that are to be developed. Engineered design for correction of adverse conditions: Combinations of four methods  engineered foundation design, well planned site drainage, landscaping to enhance drainage, and careful interior construction details, may minimize swelling clay damage. Foundation design. In areas of relatively low swell potential, spread footings are commonly used. For slightly high swell pressures, extended bearing walls or pads may be used. In areas containing moderate to highly swelling clay, drilled pier and grade beam foundations are used. The weight of the building is transmitted through bearing walls to horizontal grade beams. These beams rest on cylindrical, reinforced concrete piers that concentrate the weight on a very small area below the zone* of seasonal moisture change. The foundation is thereby founded upon soil that because its moisture content remains constant throughout the year, should not experience a volume change. With each of these special foundation designs, floating slabs are commonly used for all on-grade floors. These interior concrete floor slabs are completely isolated by joints or void spaces from all structural components. Complete isolation from bearing walls, columns, non-bearing interior partitions, stairs, and utilities allows the slab to move freely without damaging the structural integrity of the building. In the Denver area, swelling soil below the level of the proposed floor slab is sometimes excavated to a depth of several feet and replaced by various kinds of engineered backfill. Overexcavation where expansive soils and/or bedrock are removed below the foundation and replaced with compacted fill. The mixing of the soil, the addition of moisture to the fill materials and compaction of the fill material reduces the swell potential of the soils. The mixing of the soil also reduces the chances of differential swell within the fill. Drainage. The Federal Housing Administration recommends slopes of no less than 6 in. of vertical fall in 10 ft (12 in. in 10 ft is safer) around all buildings for drainage water into drainage swales, streets, or storm sewers. Water must not be allowed to stand near foundations in areas of swelling clay due to the potential for wetting foundation soils. All downspouts and splash blocks should be placed so that roof runoff will be carried at least 4 ft from the building. In areas of heavy lawn irrigation, peripheral drains have proven effective in preventing the formation of perched water tables and the resulting downward seepage of the surface water. The clay-tile or perforated plastic peripheral drains completely surround the building just below the level of the floor. The drain is and covered with washed gravel and a geotextile. The drain is normally connected to a main collection line located beneath the sanitary sewer, a sump or a daylight or gravity discharge point. Landscaping. Proper foundation design and construction will not solve all swelling-clay problems. The owner of a structure is responsible for maintaining proper drainage by careful landscaping. Backfill around foundations is often not properly compacted. Therefore, additional soil may be required on the slope around the structure in order to compensate or settlement of the backfill. This prevents ""ponding"" and percolation of water around the foundation. Grass, shrubs, and sprinkler systems should be kept a minimum of 5 ft from the foundation. Trees should be planted no nearer than 15 ft from a building. The most critical aspect of landscaping in swelling clay areas is not to flatten a properly designed slope. Interior finishing. One of the most costly mistakes a homeowner or careless contractor can make is to defeat the design purpose of a floating floor slab. A floating garage or basement floor slab is designed to move freely. Therefore, any furring, paneling, dry wall, or interior partitions added to a basement or garage must maintain this freedom of vertical movement. Any added walls or wall coverings should be suspended from the existing walls or ceiling, and should not be attached to the floor slab. A minimum void space of 3 in. should then be provided just above the floor slab. This void space may be covered with flexible molding, or inflexible molding attached to the floor rather than the wall. Although these recommendations provide for 3 in. of upward swell of the soil beneath the floor slab, more void space may be necessary in areas of highly swelling clay.

Again, in 1998, extreme heat was the #1 weather-related killer in the United States. The 10-year average (1989 to 1998) for heatrelated fatalities is 144 deaths per year. The highest recorded temperature in Colorado (through 1998) was 118F. The southeastern corner of Colorado has the highest average number of days with temperatures greater than or equal to 100F in the state. The average is 16 to 18 days per year. In the Denver metro area, the summer of 2000 had more than 60 days of over 90F temperatures. Heat stroke, heat exhaustion, heat syncope, and heat cramps are the major human risks from exposure to extreme heat. Livestock and crops are also at risk. Infrastructure such as roads, bridges and railroad tracks may suffer damage from extreme heat conditions. Extreme heat can affect water supplies and increase fire risks. Extreme heat may affect and even cause shortages in energy supplies. In general, energy use increases when people run air conditioners and fans throughout a heat spell.

Petty  U.S. Department of the Interior Minerals Management Service Gulf of Mexico OCS Region Office of Resource Evaluation New Orleans May 2000    GEORGES BANK PETROLEUM EXPLORATION ATLANTIC OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF Ten wells were drilled on Georges Bank, offshore from New England, from 1976 through 1982 (table 1, figure 1). The first two wells were Continental Offshore Stratigraphic Test (COST) wells, drilled during 1976 and 1977 by energy company consortiums to gain geologic information prior to offshore Federal petroleum exploration leasing. After leases were awarded, eight industry exploration wells were drilled in 1981 and 1982. None of these encountered significant concentrations of oil or natural gas, and drilling has not resumed since 1982. Records and data from the wells are maintained by the Minerals Management Service (MMS), Department of the Interior, at the Gulf of Mexico OCS Region office, 1201 Elmwood Park Boulevard, New Orleans, Louisiana 70123-2394, (504) 736-0557.

Sixty-three blocks were leased to companies for 1  bonus bids totaling $816,516,546. Subsequent sales (Numbers 52, 82, and 96) were canceled.

On June 12, 1998, President Clinton issued an executive order that prevents the leasing of any area currently under moratorium until June 30, 2012. All of the 1979 Georges Bank leases have now been relinquished or have expired. Since 1988, a leasing moratorium has also been in effect on the Canadian portion of Georges Bank, which is underlain by the East Georges Bank Basin, to the northeast of the Yarmouth Arch (figure 2). Texaco, BP-Amoco, and Chevron hold three large exploration concessions there. Exclusive exploration rights belonging to these companies remain intact but are suspended for the duration of the moratorium. This moratorium was reviewed in 1996 through 1999, and the review committee recommended that the suspension of exploration be extended to 2012, matching the adjoining U. S. moratorium. The Nova Scotian and Canadian governments accepted this recommendation. EXPLORATION HISTORY Seismic service companies acquired more than 100,000 line miles of seismic data by permit in the North Atlantic Planning area since 1966 (figure 3). Between 1966 and 1990 there were two accelerated periods of seismic data acquisition. More than 40,000 line miles were shot from 1974 through 1977 as companies evaluated the basin before Lease Sale 42. In 1981 and 1982, more than 33,000 line miles were shot in the years that the exploration wells were drilled.  The COST G-1 well was drilled 89 statute miles east-southeast of Nantucket Island in Block 79 of OCS protraction diagram NK 19-11 (Hydrographer Canyon). Drilling took place from April through July of 1976 to a measured depth of 16,071 feet. (All depths cited in this report are measured depths, i.e., relative to kelly bushing.) From January through August of the following year, the COST G-2 well was drilled 43 miles farther eastsoutheast in Block 141 of NK 19-12 (Lydonia Canyon) to a measured depth of 21,874 feet. Water depths were 157 and 272 feet, respectively. Both wells were intentionally drilled off-structure, that is, at locations where petroleum accumulations are unlikely, according to analysis of seismic data. The COST wells were intended to provide stratigraphic and other geologic and engineering data useful to companies and the Government in preparing for the North Atlantic lease sale. In addition, evaluation of subsequently drilled industry wells would be aided by comparison with COST well analytic results, and all the wells could be correlated by means of seismic data and wireline logs. The up-dip G-1 well (figure 4) penetrated Cenozoic and Mesozoic siliciclastic sedimentary rocks to a depth in excess of 9,000 feet (Upper Jurassic); interbedded Middle and Lower (?) Jurassic siliciclastics and limestone from about 9,000 to about 12,000 feet; and below that to total depth, Lower Jurassic (?) and Triassic (?) interbedded siliciclastics, dolomite, anhydrite, and minor limestone. 3   68  o  66  o  64  o  62  o  60  o  58 Newfoundland  o  56  o  46  o  UNITED STATES Maine  CANADA New Brunswick Fun dy  20 0  Miquelon and St. Pierre (FRANCE) 00 20  n an an an an an ia nt r r r r re ur La m  46  o  m  el n n n n nn an ha ha ha ha ha Ch  44  o  y of Ba  Nova Scotia  Halifax  Gulf of Maine 42  u th  o  ch Ar  20  0m  elf Sh m tian or co S n e av n La H ia ot Sc Pl at f B as i  44 Sable Island  o  Yarm  Georges Bank o 200  Explanation  m  Isobath Landward edge of Mesozoic basins Canada - Nova Scotia petroleum leases  42  o  Georges Bank Basin 40 68 o o  East Georges Bank Basin 0 66 o  50 62 o  100 Miles 60 o  64  o  58  o  56  o  Figure 2.

Limestone began at about 2,400 feet (Upper Cretaceous) and was interbedded with siliciclastics to about 10,000 feet. Below that, in Middle Jurassic (?) to Upper Triassic (?) strata, the proportion of siliciclastics was subordinate, and limestone dominated to about 13,500 feet, with dolomite and anhydrite, subordinate limestone, and minor siliciclastics below that to total depth. This well bottomed in Upper Triassic or Lower Jurassic halite and anhydrite at a depth of 21,874 feet. Federal regulations direct the Department of the Interior to release COST well geologic data to the public 60 days after a lease is granted within 50 nautical miles of well sites. Leases from OCS Sale 42 were granted in February of 1980, and the Conservation Division of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) released open file reports on the two wells (Amato and Bebout, 1980; Amato and Simonis, 1980). In 1982 the Geologic Division of USGS released Geological Survey Circular 861 (Scholle and Wenkam), which covered both wells. These publications are available from USGS Information Services, Box 25286, Denver Federal Center, Denver, CO 80225, Tel: 303-202-4700; Fax: 303-202-4693. Eight exploration wells were drilled on the 63 Georges Bank leases during 1981 and 1982. All wells (figure 1) were within 42 miles of one another in the main, unnamed 7  subbasin, where the sedimentary section is thickest. Water depths ranged from 209 to 453 feet, and measured well depths from 14,118 to 20,000 feet. The companies' exploration targets, stated in their Exploration Plans, were mostly identified as Middle or Upper Jurassic (one Lower Jurassic) oolite banks, reefal buildups, and carbonate drape structures over basement highs or salt swells. Some predrilling interpretations predicted enhanced porosity, caused by dolomitization. The seismic features, from which these targets were inferred, were all high-amplitude reflectors with apparent structural closure. Located between two and three seconds, two-way travel times, the crests of these features were expected to be between 9,000 and 16,000 feet. These depths are within the Jurassic carbonate section of the COST G-2 well and the interbedded Jurassic carbonate and siliciclastic section of the G-1 well. Hydrocarbons were not discovered on Georges Bank, and target-depth rocks in the exploration wells were similar to coeval COST well strata. Instead of reservoir-quality, porous carbonates, lowporosity micrites, wackestones, and packstones were the usual limestone types encountered. As in the COST wells, dolomite and anhydrite interbeds are common below about 12,000 feet (figure 4). At these depths, the Exxon Lydonia Canyon (LC) Block 133 No. 1 well encountered intrusive and extrusive volcanic rocks interbedded with limestone. The Exxon Corsair Canyon 975 No. 1 well penetrated halite and anhydrite interbedded with limestone below about 13,000 feet. In these two wells, seismic   velocity contrasts between volcanics and limestone and between anhydrite and halite would produce high-amplitude reflectors. For other Georges Bank exploration well sites, the companytargeted, high-amplitude reflectors appear to be associated with anhydrite-limestone or anhydrite-siliciclastic velocity differences, rather than being hydrocarbon-related ""bright spots."" Since petroleum exploration began in Canadian waters offshore from Nova Scotia in the 1950's, over 290,000 linemiles of 2D and 3D seismic data have been collected. One hundred and sixtyseven wells have been drilled (102 exploration, 26 delineation, 38 production, and 1 special relief), and 24 significant petroleum discoveries have been made, mostly natural gas. Most reservoirs are in Lower Cretaceous and Upper Jurassic deltaic sandstones at depths of 9,00016,000 feet, and many are overpressured (below about 13,500 feet). Traps are anticlinal and/or fault-related. Near Sable Island, the small Panuke multifield oil project is undergoing abandonment after recovering 44.4 million barrels of ""Scotian Light"" crude oil. Also near the island, a Mobil, Shell, and Exxon consortium, operating as Sable Offshore Energy Inc. (SOEI), is developing six gas fields. Three fields are producing gas, which is shipped to Country Harbor, N.S., by way of the 30-inch Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline. The most recent discovery, announced in February 2000 by PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd., is also near Sable Island. In well tests, gas flowed at rates up to 55 million cubic feet per day. 8  This discovery is the first in an Upper Jurassic reef play that goes from offshore Newfoundland to Florida. A third phase of petroleum exploration is beginning in most areas of the Nova Scotian offshore, including the Upper Paleozoic Sydney and Magdalena Basins and previously unexplored deepwater Tertiary and Cretaceous basins with salt structures analogous to those of the Gulf of Mexico. Further information can be obtained from the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board's Internet site, http://www.cnsopb.ns.ca. The Geological Survey of Canada's BASIN database, http://agcwww.bio.ns.ca/BASIN, contains offshore geological and geophysical information but requires subscription for access to specific and comprehensive data and interpretations. On the basis of data available through the end of 1983, the Geological Survey of Canada (Wade and others, 1989) estimated the total resource potential of the Scotian Basin to be 18.1 Tcf gas, 366.1 MMBbls condensate, and 707.6 MM Bbls oil. This estimate does not include the Lauentian Subbasin of the Scotian Basin, for which MacLean and Wade (1992) have more recently estimated 8 to 9 trillion cubic feet of gas and 600 to 700 million barrels of oil. The Canadian government has not assessed the petroleum resources of the East Georges Bank Basin, the Fundy Basin, or the Maritimes and Sydney Basins.   BIOSTRATIGRAPHY The paleontological staff of the Atlantic OCS Region examined well cuttings from five of the eight Georges Bank exploration wells. The staff used foraminifera, calcareous nannofossils, palynomorphs, and dinocysts to identify biostratigraphic ages. Cutting samples were supplemented by core examination, where possible. Biostratigraphic interpretation generally followed Canadian workers' adaptation of Tethyan practice (e.g., Bujak and Williams, 1977; Woollam and Riding, 1983; Riding, 1984, Davies, 1985). European stages, rather than formation names, were used for the Georges Bank biostratigraphic framework. In addition, the staff identified depositional paleoenvironments and, for some wells, unconformities and depositional hiatuses, on the basis of missing stages. The MMS Atlantic paleontologists faced several difficulties. The Mesozoic section is thoroughly oxidized and reworked, containing many disconformities. Older, eroded and recycled microfossils that were reincorporated into younger sediments had to be recognized in order to avoid dating an interval as older than it is. Uphole microfossils, caved from higher in the well, had to be recognized in order to avoid dating an interval as too young. Other difficulties include documentation of guide fossils. During the 1980's, the biostratigraphy of the Atlantic margin was not well established, compared with other more thoroughly studied basins. In Georges Bank wells, diagnostic fossils become sparse with increasing well depth; paleontologically barren sections extend 9  for hundreds and even thousands of feet. The sparseness is partly explained by the deltaic and shallow, marginal-marine character of the pre-Late Cretaceous Mesozoic section. In general, these are not good environments for the production and preservation of marine microfossils. Evaporite intervals also tend to be devoid of fossils. Altogether, the biostratigraphic portions of the well reports for the eight industry wells and the two COST wells should be regarded as subject to increasing error with greater well depth. Only four wells penetrated identified Lower Jurassic and older rocks. The depth of this section ranges from 11,190 feet (Mobil LC Block 312 No. 1) to 17,000 feet (Shell LC Block 410 No. 1R). Generally, stratigraphic units and their depths should be relatively consistent among closely spaced wells in a little-deformed basin. However, among Georges Bank wells, apparent inconsistencies between well biostratigraphic ""tops"" become greater with increasing well depth. The greatest disagreements are between analyses done by different groups of paleontologists. The COST G-1and G-2 and Conoco LC Block 145 No.1 wells were done by International Biostratigraphers, Inc., the Mobil LC Block 273 No.1 and Shell LC Block 357 No.1 by the operating oil companies, and the remaining five wells by the MMS Atlantic office paleontological staff. The paleontological staff of the Atlantic OCS Region office initially examined only well-cutting samples from the Exxon LC Block 133 No. 1 well in 1982. Based on   dinoflagellate cysts, they assigned Early Jurassic ages to strata in the deepest portion of the well. Subsequently, the operator submitted splits from a conventional drill core (12,258 to 12,326 feet). After a restudy, the staff concluded that the core samples are Middle Jurassic (Bajocian) in age and that all deeper cutting samples represent reworked sediments that incorporate geologically older, redeposited dinocysts. A further consequence of the inherent difficulties and the inconsistent biostratigraphic interpretation among the paleontologists from different organizations is that the eight burial history diagrams for the industry wells have dissimilar profiles. THERMAL MATURITY Within Georges Bank Basin, rocks are thermally mature for oil generation at about 8,000 feet, for wet gas at about 17,000 feet, and for dry gas at about 21,000 feet. However, rocks at all well depths are organically lean, and kerogens are mixed Type II and Type III, becoming more Type III rich with increasing depth. Geothermal gradients for the 10 Georges Bank wells, based on uncorrected bottomhole logging temperatures, range from 1.06 oF/100 ft (Conoco LC Block 145 No. 1) to 1.34 oF/100 ft (Cost G-2) and average 1.26 oF/100 ft. These results are about the same as for wells on the Canadian Scotian Shelf (~1.2 oF/100 ft), to the northeast, and in Baltimore Canyon Trough (~1.2 oF/100 ft), to the southwest, and are higher than for Southeast Georgia 10  Embayment (~0.9 oF/100 ft), farther southwest (Amato and Bebout, 1980). In the 1970's and 1980's the Atlantic OCS Region Resource Evaluation staff used the thermal alteration index (TAI) of Staplin (1969) to estimate sedimentary thermal maturity for petroleum generation. The index uses alteration colors of organic material in transmitted light as indicators of thermal maturity. In the TAI numerical index, a value of 2.6 (Jones and Edison, 1978) indicates borderline maturity for generating oil, and values of 3.1 to 3.5 indicate the range for production of condensate and wet gas. In seven of the eight Georges Bank exploratory wells for which TAI analyses are available, the depth to borderline thermal maturity ranges from 9,450 (Mobil LC Block 273 No.1 well) to 13,300 feet (Shell LC Block 410 No.1R) and averages 11,139 feet. Analyses for five of the wells indicate depths of 12,450 to 13,950 feet for fully mature TAI values of 2.9-3.1. The service companies that provided geochemical analyses for the COST G-2 well obtained conflicting results. GeoChem Laboratories, Inc. did the most extensive TAI analysis and did not find mature alteration colors in any well samples (TD 21,874 ft). Core Laboratories, Inc., reported TAI values sufficient for oil generation between 8,500 and 12,300 feet; they believed that deeper samples were contaminated. M.A. Smith (1980) states that alteration colors are mature (orange-brown) near TD of the well.   Vitrinite reflectance data are available for only 4 of the 10 wells, and they indicate threshold maturity at shallower depths than indicated by TAI. Vitrinite reflectance is based on the reflectivity (Ro) of polished sedimentary vitrinite grains. A value of 0.6 percent indicates borderline thermal maturity for oil generation, whereas 1.0 to 1.5 percent indicates the time-temperature range for production of condensate and wet gas. Vitrinite reflectance values in excess of 2 percent are in the dry gas generation range. Three of the four Georges Bank wells for which there are vitrinite reflectance data, COST G-1, Mobil LC Block 312 No.1, and Shell LC Block 410 No.1R, have threshold maturity values at depths of 6,500 to 9,000 feet. In the fourth well, the COST G-2, Ro increases from 0.5 to 1.04 percent (immature to fully mature) at 8,769 feet. Averaging the G-2 result with that of the other three wells produces a depth to the onset of thermal maturity of 8,167 feet. All four wells have peak-generation Ro values of about 1.0 percent at depths of 8,769 to 13,000 feet. The thermal color index (TCI), developed by Texaco, Inc. in the mid-1980's, is another method for quantifying thermal maturity. Its developers claim superior accuracy, compared with TAI, because TCI is based on spectral analysis of transmitted light from amorphous kerogens, rather than an operator's determinations of color from a variety of kerogen types (van Gijzel, 1990). TCI is also supposed to be superior to vitrinite reflectance analysis because amorphous kerogens are more widely distributed than vitrinite in sedimentary rocks. TCI has not 11  been widely accepted by most geochemical laboratories, which continue to use vitrinite reflectance. In an effort to resolve the contradictory COST G-2 thermal maturity data, Texaco applied the TCI technique to the well's kerogen slides. Stated in terms of vitrinite reflectance equivalence, the oil window (Ro=.65 percent) begins at 7,750 feet, wet gas (Ro=1.35 percent) begins at 17,000 feet, and dry gas (Ro=2.0 percent) begins at 21,000 feet (Smith and van Gijzel, 1990; van Gijzel, 1990). Petroleum geochemical techniques have evolved since the Georges Bank wells were drilled, and we believe that the TCI maturity data, supported by vitrinite reflectance, are more reliable than the TAI analyses done twenty years ago. Because the 10 wells are closely spaced in a littledeformed subbasin, we also believe that the COST G-2 TCI data best represent the thermal maturity of the subbasin. A burial history diagram for the COST G-2 well, generated using Plate River Associates' BasinMod  software, is shown in figure 5. In this diagram, the post-rift event is the uplift, erosion, and hiatus associated with the post-rift unconformity (Schlee and Klitgord, 1988). The magnitude of the uplift and duration of the event are strictly diagrammatic. The petroleum generation maturity windows are based on TCI data, expressed as vitrinite reflectance values, and the calculated present-day heat flow (57 mW/m2). The heat-flow value is based on corrected well-bore temperature data from the COST G-2 well (Amato and   0  T  J  K  P  E  O  MP  Fm  } 5000  Cenozoic Upper Cretaceous Albian Aptian Barremian Hauterivian-Valanginian Berriasian Tithonian-Kimmeridgian  Depth (feet)  10000  Oxfordian Callovian-Bathonian  15000  Bathonian-Pliensbachian  25000 250 20 0 150 100 50 0  Post-rift Event  20000  Triassic  Age (my)  Early Mature oil 0.6 to 0.75 %Ro Mid Mature oil 0.75 to 1.0 %Ro Late Mature oil 1.0 to 1.3 %Ro Main Gas Generation 1.3 to 2.6 %Ro  Figure 5.

Tops of Bathonian (?) and older units from U.S. Geological Survey Circular 861 are based on seismic stratigraphy. The Mesozoic time scale is after Gradstein and others, 1995, and the Cenozoic times scale is after Berggren and others, 1995. The post-rift event consists of the uplift, erosion, and hiatus associated with the post-rift unconformity. Magnitude of the uplift and duration of the event are strictly diagrammatic. Petroleum maturity windows are based on TCI kerogen analysis expressed as vitrinite reflectance (R o) values. 12   Simonis, 1980). According to this model, petroleum generation, given adequate source rock, began in about the Middle Jurassic Epoch at well depths of 12,000 feet in the COST G-2 well. Figure 6 is a BasinMod diagram showing corrected borehole temperatures, a temperature profile, measured vitrinite values, and a regression fit of thermal maturity to depth. In the well, early maturity for oil generation (Ro =0.6 percent) begins in Upper Jurassic rocks near 8,500 feet and main gas generation (Ro=1.35 percent) begins in Middle Jurassic rocks near 16,500 feet. These depths are within 750 and 500 feet, respectively, of agreement with Texaco's TCI data. ORGANIC RICHNESS Sedimentary units encountered by drilling in Georges Bank Basin are organically lean, according to total organic carbon (TOC) analyses from 7 of the 10 wells. Most samples have less than 1 percent TOC. Only one sample from the 7 wells has a value of more than 3 percent. Data from all but one well show organic richness decreasing with depth. The exception is the Tenneco LC Block 187 No. 1 well, which shows as much as 1.65 percent TOC in Upper Triassic units deep in the well. In general, most Cretaceous samples are between 0.25 and 1.5 percent; most Upper and Middle Jurassic samples are between 0.2 and 0.6 percent; most Lower Jurassic samples are between 0.1and 0.3 percent; and most Triassic samples are less than 0.2 percent. Carbonate and evaporite lithologies are 13  associated with low organic carbon abundance. In summary, the source rock potential in the currently drilled portion of Georges Bank Basin at sufficient depths for thermal maturity, 8,000 to nearly 22,000 feet (the deepest drilling), is poor. ORGANIC MATTER TYPES For petroleum exploration, the organically lean section encountered in Georges Bank Basin diminishes the relevance of organic matter type analysis. However, MMS and industry performed many kerogen analyses on well cuttings and cores in the 1980's. Kerogen is disseminated sedimentary organic matter that has not been converted to petroleum. In assessing source-rock potential, the Atlantic OCS Office staff classified kerogen as algal-amorphous, herbaceous, woody, or coaly, using a microscope and transmitted light. The staff examined samples from six of the eight industry wells and service companies examined the two COST wells. In the six wells, the highest abundance of algalamorphous kerogens is reported to be in the uppermost 5,000 to 8,000 feet, ranging to over 30 percent of total kerogens. Below about 10,000 feet, algal-amorphous abundances generally range from zero to 5 percent. Herbaceous kerogens are generally between 20 and 30 percent, and woody kerogens are generally between 20 and 40 percent at all well depths. Coaly matter generally ranges from 20 to 60 percent and increases with depth. These relationships are also evident in the COST G-1 visual kerogen data; however, the service company (GeoChem) analyst   Maturity (%Ro) 1 0 10 Fm  } 5000  Cenozoic Upper Cretaceous Albian Aptian Barremian Hauterivian-Valanginian Berriasian Tithonian-Kimmeridgian  Depth (feet)  10000  Oxfordian Callovian-Bathonian  15000  BathonianPliensbachian  20000  Triassic  25000 0 100  Temperature ( F)  200  o  300  400 Thermal Maturity %Ro Regression Subsurface Temperature Early Mature oil 0.6 to 0.75 %Ro Mid Mature oil 0.75 to 1.0 %Ro Late Mature oil 1.0 to 1.3 %Ro Main Gas Generation 1.3 to 2.6 %Ro %Ro Borehole Temperature  Figure 6.

Algalamorphous kerogens are mostly in the 20 to 40 percent range down to 6,000 feet and in the zero to 30 percent range from 6,000 feet to total depth (Smith and Shaw, 1980; Miller and others, 1982). In the COST G-2 well, the kerogen analyses furnished by two service companies are contradictory and not consistent with the other wells (Smith, 1980, Miller and others, 1982). GeoChem Laboratories reported that in the G-2 well, algalamorphous, herbaceous, woody, and coaly relative abundances are fairly consistent at all depths, with proportions of about 40, 15, 20, and 25 percent, respectively. Core Laboratories, Inc., reported that algalamorphous kerogens are nearly absent in the well but that inertinite (coaly) is the dominant kerogen type throughout, especially below 8,500 feet, accounting for as much as 90 percent of the organic matter. The lack of consistency among kerogen studies is likely caused by variation in analyst assumptions and techniques. Differences include deciding what material should be ignored because it is caved from higher in the drill hole, recycled, and redeposited from older strata, or introduced from the platform in drilling the well. M. A. Smith (1995) reports a more recent COST G-2 visual kerogen analysis done by Geo-Strat, Inc., to resolve these contradictions. In this restudy, the analyst used 18 organic matter types, rather than the 4 types previously employed. 15  However, most of the recognized kerogen was algae and amorphous algal debris, plant tissue, and amorphous herbaceous debris, vitrinite (wood), and inertinite (coal). That is, these organic matter types correlate well with the previously used four types, algal-amorphous, herbaceous, woody, and coaly. The practical difference is that, previously, algalamorphous was one category, and now a portion of that is classed as herbaceous matter. Consequently, the Geo-Strat study identifies only 4 to 8 percent of total kerogens as algal in all but two well samples. Total herbaceous matter (amorphous herbaceous plus plant tissue) amounts to about half of total kerogens down to 11,500 feet; 20 percent to 15,500 feet, 70 percent to 19,500 feet, and 35 to 60 percent to total depth. Woody kerogens are about 20 percent to 11,500 feet, 35 percent to 15,500 feet, and 10 to 20 percent to total depth. Coaly matter increases from about 5 percent at shallow depths to about 20 percent near total depth. Among the COST G-2 kerogen analyses done by different parties, Core Labs' analysis appears to be so different that it can be rejected. GeoChem's and GeoStrat's results are similar, allowing for different definitions of algal and herbaceous matter. However, Geo-Strat's relative abundances are more variable throughout the well. Thermal pyrolysis and molecular geochemical analysis data relevant to relative kerogen abundance are available for the COST G-1 and G-2 and the Exxon LC Block 133 No. 1 and the Tenneco LC Block 187 No. 1 wells. Kerogen relative   abundance is reflected in the hydrogen index (HI=S2/TOC) and the atomic hydrogen-to-carbon ratio (H/C). From higher to lower HI and H/C, the order of kerogen types is algal, amorphous, herbaceous, woody, and coaly. Hydrogen index values of less than 200 and hydrogen-to-carbon ratios less than 1.0 suggest that woody and coaly organic matter equals or exceeds herbaceous and algal-amorphous matter and that the primary expelled hydrocarbon will be gas. For Exxon LC Block 133 No. 1 well samples, the HI ranged from 0 to 143 and for Tenneco LC Block 187 No. 1 well samples, the H/C ranged from 0.11 to 0.76, suggesting mixed algal-herbaceous and woody-coaly kerogens, with the latter generally in greater abundance. The 50 HI values of the Exxon well are extremely variable throughout; however, in general, they decrease in magnitude with depth, indicating decreasing algal-amorphous and increasing woody and coaly abundances seen in the optical kerogen analysis. Only a descriptive summary of the H/C ratios of the Tenneco well is available, and there is no statement about whether the ratio changes with depth. We believe that the Geo-Strat kerogen studies on the COST G-2 well (Smith, 1995) are more reliable than the optical kerogen analyses of this well described in the 1980 U. S. Geological Survey OpenFile Report 80-269 and the 1982 U. S. Geological Survey Circular 861. Further, we believe that the Geo-Strat data represent the basin better than the eight industry well kerogen studies done in the early 1980's by the MMS Atlantic OCS 16  Region office and contained in the accompanying well reports. The final step of Geo-Strat's kerogen procedure is to combine the data for each sample interval and assign an organic matter index (OMI) number. The OMI values are then plotted against well depth to provide a profile of oil and gas proneness for the stratigraphic column. The index ranges from 1, strongly oil prone, to 8, strongly gas prone. The scale is also divided into Type I, Type II, Type II-Type III mix, and Type III organic matter fields. For the COST G-2 well (figure 7), most samples are between 4.35 and 5.25, which is within the Type II-Type III mixed field, indicating the probability of both oil and gas. However, index values increase with depth, indicating the higher likelihood of natural gas deep in the well. FUTURE EXPLORATION It is nearly 18 years since the last petroleum exploration well was drilled on Georges Bank, and the area is currently under a leasing moratorium. However, in recent years companies have made 24 gascondensate discoveries in the Canadian Scotian Basin, to the northeast, and six fields are being developed. A third cycle of exploration activity is underway along the eastern Canadian margin that includes previously unexplored areas and plays.   Organic Matter Index (OMI) Depth in Feet 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 7,000 8,000 9,000 10,000 11,000 12,000 13,000 14,000 15,000 16,000 17,000 18,000 19,000 20,000 21,000 22,000 Type-I Type-II Oil Prone Organics Type-II/III Mix 5.00 Gas Prone Organics Type-III 5.50 6.00 6.50  2.00 3.00 3.50 4.00 4.50  2.00 3.00 3.50 4.00 4.50  5.00  5.50  6.00  6.50  Figure 7.

Data from Schwab and others, 1990. 17   When petroleum exploration does resume in Georges Bank Basin, new, state-of-theart seismic data acquisition and processing will have high priority. The goal will be better resolution of deep structures (below three seconds, two-way travel time). Although seismic data from the 1970's and 1980's show deep features, they are difficult to interpret owing to poor resolution and spatial distortion and displacement. The Georges Bank stratigraphic section is thinner than that of Baltimore Canyon Trough or the Scotian Basin. Record lengths of six to seven seconds, two-way-time, will adequately image this Upper and Middle Jurassic part of the section, as well as the underlying Triassic-Early Jurassic rift basins. With modern seismic data, good resolution will be achievable for the entire sedimentary section. Well data suggest that identified organic source rock is the major component missing from the Georges Bank hydrocarbon system. Untested and poorly tested facies, including lacustrine shales and marls of Early Mesozoic rift basins, relict Upper Paleozoic basins, and the Cretaceous paleo-continental slope, may provide source rocks capable of charging the petroleum system. Deeper drilling may also be effective in Georges Bank Basin. Most of the gas discoveries near Sable Island in the Scotian Basin are associated with overpressure, generally at about 13,500 feet. Severely overpressured gas was encountered, but not tested, at 17,807 feet in the Texaco Hudson Canyon Block 642 No. 1 well in Baltimore Canyon  Trough (Amato and Bielak, 1990). Deeper drilling in Georges Bank Basin, likely below 20,000 feet, may also find overpressured gas. Gas-condensate or dry gas is the most likely hydrocarbon at these depths, with temperatures in excess of 300 oF. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank David E.

Rapidly moving flows of glowing hot ash  covered much of east-central California, and  airborne ash fell as far east as Nebraska.   The Earth's surface sank more than 1 mile into the space once occupied by the erupted magma, forming a large  volcanic depression that geologists call a caldera.      The massive Long Valley eruption  was followed by hundreds of  smaller eruptions over the next few hundred thousand years. These eruptions of lava flows, domes, and pyroclastic flows were concentrated in the central and western parts of the caldera. Volcanic activity then moved northward to the Mono Lake area about 35,000 years ago to build the Mono Craters. The most recent eruptions in the area occurred from the Mono and Inyo Craters about 600 years ago, and from Negit Island in Mono Lake about 250 years ago.                     Long Valley and Vicinity   [Map,35K,GIF]                     Excerpts from:  Hill, et.al., 1996, Living With a Restless Caldera -- Long Valley, California:  USGS Fact Sheet 196-96                                        Bishop Tuff              Bishop Tuff: 4    Fallout from the Long Valley eruption blanketed most of the western states with ash as far east as Nebraska, and covered the Mono Basin, Owens Valley,  and parts of the Sierras in 600-3,000 feet of 1300 degrees F. burning ash. This ash solidified into a  pinkish igneous rock  known as the Bishop Tuff, a layer of which covers 580 square miles of California and Nevada and is especially exposed along the  highways of the Mono Basin and Owens River Valley region.                       What are Igneous Rocks?                             Black Point            Black Point: 4    Black Point is the low, black, mesa-like hill that lies on  Mono Lake's northwestern shore. Black Point is a basaltic volcano that erupted approximately 13,000 years ago, in the middle of the last ice age.  At the time, glacially-inundated Mono Lake was 900 feet deeper than it is today, and completely submerged Black Point's eruption.  The weight of hundreds of feet of water is responsible for its flat top, and for the intriguing fissures on its southwestern face.  These fissures -- some as deep as 80 feet and as narrow as four or five across -- are presumed to be cooling fissures, although geologic debate  over their origins continues. Now exposed by Mono's receded lakeline, Black Point makes an excellent specimen of an exposed  underwater-volcano for scientific study.                        What is Basalt?                             Devil's Punchbowl             Devil's Punchbowl: 4    In the Mono Basin, a great example of a smaller explosion pit is the Devil's Punchbowl,  located at the south end of the Mono Craters.                    Inyo Craters and Domes            Mono-Inyo Craters Volcanic Chain: 1    The Long Valley Caldera is only one part of a large volcanic system  in eastern California that also includes the Mono-Inyo Craters volcanic chain. This chain extends from  Mammoth Mountain at the southwest rim of the caldera northward 25 miles to Mono Lake.  Eruptions along this chain began 400,000 years ago, and Mammoth Mountain itself was formed by a series of  eruptions ending 50,000 years ago. The volcanic system is still active. Scientists have determined that  eruptions occurred in both the Inyo Craters and Mono Craters parts of the volcanic chain as recently as 600 years ago  and that small eruptions occurred in Mono Lake sometime between the mid-1700's and mid-1800's.                 Long Valley Caldera             Long Valley Caldera: 2    Long Valley, from the headwaters of Owens River to Lake Crowley,  is a giant 10-mile-wide, 20-mile-long volcanic caldera.   Long Valley occupies the eastern half of this caldera.   Magma still underlies the caldera and heats underground water. The heated water feeds local  hot springs and natural steam vents and drives three geothermal power plants,  producing a combined 40 megawatts of electricity.                         What is a Caldera?                       Resurgent Dome: 2    The resurgent dome is a broad area of the central caldera floor that was pushed upward within 100,000 years or less of the caldera-forming eruption 730,000 years ago. This uplift was caused by upward pressure related to the intrusion of molten rock into the magma reservoir beneath the caldera. The resurgent dome is made of layers of lava flows, tephra, and pyroclastic flows that were erupted onto the caldera floor soon after the caldera formed. The uplift arched and faulted these volcanic rocks to form a central highland area about 10 kilometers in diameter and as  high as 500 meters above the surrounding caldera floor.                    Mammoth Mountain              Mammoth Mountain: 2,3     Mammoth Mountain - a massive volcanic dome -  has grown on the Long Valley caldera margin.  Mammoth Mountain was built by eruptions between about 200,000 and 50,000 years ago.    Mammoth Mountain was built by the eruption of at least 12 different steep domes and thick lava flows. These eruptions occurred between about 200,000 and 50,000 years ago. Volcanic activity then moved northward to the Mono Lake area about 35,000 years ago to build the Mono Craters, a collection of more than 30 overlapping lava flows, domes, cones, and craters. The most recent eruptions in the area occurred from the Mono Craters and Inyo Craters about 600 years ago, and from Negit Island in Mono Lake about 250 years ago.                      What is a Lava Dome?                            Mono Basin and Craters             Mono-Inyo Craters Volcanic Chain: 1    The Long Valley Caldera is only one part of a large volcanic system  in eastern California that also includes the Mono-Inyo Craters volcanic chain. This chain extends from  Mammoth Mountain at the southwest rim of the caldera northward 25 miles to Mono Lake.  Eruptions along this chain began 400,000 years ago, and Mammoth Mountain itself was formed by a series of  eruptions ending 50,000 years ago. The volcanic system is still active. Scientists have determined that  eruptions occurred in both the Inyo Craters and Mono Craters parts of the volcanic chain as recently as 600 years ago  and that small eruptions occurred in Mono Lake sometime between the mid-1700's and mid-1800's.       Mono Basin: 4    The Mono Basin lies in one of the most geologically active areas on the planet.  Its eventful history of volcanic activity is evident in both the extinct volcanic ranges of the Bodie and Anchorite Hills  to the north and east and the dormant Mono Craters to the south.  While the rolling Bodie and Anchorite hills were last active over hundreds of millions of years ago,  the Mono Craters are the youngest mountain range in North America--the oldest of its 9,000' peaks is only 40,000 years old.  Panum Crater, the northernmost and youngest of the Craters, erupted only 640 years ago. Panum, a textbook example of a rhyolitic plug-dome volcano,  is easily reached from Hwy. 120, three miles east of Hwy. 395.        Mono Craters: 2    The Mono Craters is a 17-kilometer-long chain of rhyolite domes and flows that were erupted from                    35,000 to about 600 years ago. All but four of the 24 exposed domes and flows of the Mono                    Craters are less than 10,000 years old. The most recent eruptive episode occurred between A.D.                    1325 and 1365, during which time there were several explosive eruptions and five separate lava                    flows that oozed onto the surface, including Panun Dome and North Coulee flow.                       What is a Lava Dome?                            Negit Island             Negit Island: 4    In addition to the volcanoes surrounding Mono Lake,  the two islands that rise above Mono's surface are also volcanic.  Negit, a classic black cinder cone poking out of the water, first erupted some 1,600 years ago and  most recently flowed 270 years ago.  Paoha Island, the large white island in the center, is less than 300 years old.                      What is a Cinder Cone?                            Obsidian Dome              Obsidian Dome: 4    Obsidian Dome, of the nearby Inyo Craters, is an example of a dome that has completely overrun its debris ring.                       What is Obsidian?       What is a Lava Dome?                             Panum Crater             Panum Crater: 4    The twenty-one volcanic cones to the south of Mono Lake form the youngest  mountain range in North America, the Mono Craters. While the earliest eruptions occurred about 35,000 years ago,  the most recent activity dates back merely 600 years. The most accessible cone is Panum Crater, located three miles east of Highway 395 on Highway 120.  This 600 year-old volcano exhibits all of the characteristics of the textbook rhyolitic, plug-dome volcano.                      How Did Panum Crater Form?                            Paoha Island            Paoha Island: 4    The youngest member of the Mono Basin volcanic family is Paoha,  the white island in the middle of the lake, which formed only 300 years ago. An unusual volcanic formation, Paoha looks very different  from the classic cinder cone of Negit Island. White and rolling, it resembles more the sediment that covers that bottom of Mono Lake.  And with good reason! Paoha is, indeed, exposed lake-bottom sediment, pushed up over the surface of the lake in a volcanic upheaval  that lacked the momentum to fully erupt. Although there have been a few small lava flows on the north end of the island,  Paoha has yet to let go in a full-scale eruption.  Still, steam vents and fumaroles on the island indicate its potential for future activity!                 Red Cones              Red Cones: 2    Several small cinder cones are located on the floor and rim of Long Valley caldera.  The youngest cones in the area include Red Cones 5 kilometers south of  Mammoth Mountain and Black Point on the north shore of Mono Lake. Geologists estimate that  Red Cones may have erupted as recently as about 5,000 years ago and Black Point about 13,000 years ago.  The other cones on the caldera floor and along the rim range in age from 228,000 to 64,000 years.                     What is a Cinder Cone?

GX122-90-14170602	History of New York State Oil Fields    VAN TYNE, ARTHUR M., Consulting Geologist, Wellsville, NY    The New York oil fields are located in Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, and Steuben Counties in the far southwestern part of the State. The first commercial oil production in New York was found in 1865. More than 40,000 wells have been drilled for oil production and water injection for secondary recovery of oil. Production occurs from generally low porosity, low permeability sandstones of Late Devonian age. Total oil production, not taking into account any possible tertiary recovery, will approximate 250 million barrels. Current production is about 300,000 barrels annually.    Some references indicate that the first recorded observation of oil in North America was made in 1627 in Allegany County, New York. Father Joseph de la Roche Daillon, a Franciscan priest, is said to have visited the Seneca oil spring there in the company of a group of Indians.    The first wildcat test well in New York was drilled in Allegany County in 1860. It reached a depth of 600 feet and was later deepened to 900 feet but, although shows of oil and gas were encountered, it was non-commercial. The first commercial oil well completed in 1865 was drilled by Job Moses, an early entrepreneur-promoter. The well was drilled to a  total depth of 1,155 feet and made 7 barrels of oil per day. This well produced from the Bradford Third sandstone and is actually the discovery well of the great Bradford oil field in Pennsylvania and New York.    The first commercial oil well in the Allegany field was drilled in 1878 by O. P. Taylor but he abandoned the well as too small. Later, in 1879, he completed another well about 3 miles north of the first well for a higher flow of oil and has become the so-called discovery well of the field.    It is not clear why these early wells were drilled at the locations selected. Certainly, the main stimulus for drilling at all was the Drake discovery near Titusville, Pennsylvania in 1859. In one or two cases there may have been oil seeps nearby but other locations were probably based on little but hunches.    Current studies indicate that the main oil sands consist of a series of westward prograding stillstands. The shoreling trend is in a northeast-southwest direction. The sandstone zones and intervening shales represent regressive-transgressive cycles in a fluvial-deltaic environment. The initial sand deposition has been reworked by waves and littoral currents. Barrier bars are common.        [  Back  ]     Last update August 13, 1998

Its majestic mountains were shaped by glaciers during the ice ages as well as by wind and rain.  The scenic coastline of California is continually shaped by the pounding waves of the Pacific Ocean.  California has a wealth of mineral resources, including the rich soil of the Central Valley, the gold of the Sierra,  and oil off the coast and in various locations across the state.    California can be divided up into 11  Geomorphic Provinces,  many which include volcanic features.  The Provinces are: The Sierra Nevadas, Cascade Range, Coast Ranges, Transverse Ranges, Peninsular Ranges, Klamath Mountains, Great Valley, Basin and Range, Modoc Plateau, Mojave Desert, and Colorado Desert.                 Excerpts from:  California Environmental Resources Evaluation System (CERES) Website, 2003,  California Resources Agency, from the California Coastal Commission's  California Coastal Resource Guide, and California State Geological Survey Website, 2002, ""California Geomorphic Provinces Note 36.""                                           California's Geomorphic Provinces            California's Geomorphic Provinces: 17    California can be divided up into 11  Geomorphic Provinces,  many which include volcanic features.  The Provinces are:        Basin and Range    The Basin and Range is the westernmost part of the Great Basin. The province is characterized by interior drainage with lakes and playas, and the typical horst and graben structure (subparallel, fault-bounded ranges separated by downdropped basins). Death Valley, the lowest area in the United States (280 feet below sea level at Badwater), is one of these grabens. Another graben, Owens Valley, lies between the bold eastern fault scarp of the Sierra Nevada and Inyo Mountains.                      MORE about the Basin and Range Region                    Cascade Range    The Cascade Range, a chain of volcanic cones, extends through Washington and Oregon into California. It is dominated by Mt. Shasta, a glacier-mantled volcanic cone, rising 14,162 feet above sea level. The southern termination is Lassen Peak, which last erupted in the early 1920s. The Cascade Range is transected by deep canyons of the Pit River. The river flows through the range between these two major volcanic cones, after winding across interior Modoc Plateau on its way to the Sacramento River.                      MORE about the Pacific Mountain System       MORE America's Volcanic Past - Cascade Range                     Coast Ranges    The Coast Ranges are mountain ranges (2,000 to 4,000, occasionally 6,000 feet elevation above sea level) and valleys. The ranges and valleys trend north-west, subparallel to the San Andreas Fault. The province terminates on the east where strata dip beneath alluvium of the Great Valley; on the west by the Pacific Ocean with mountains rising sharply from uplifted and terraced, wave-cut coast; on the north by South Fork Mountain, which has the characteristic trend of the Coast Ranges, and on the south by the Transverse Ranges. The Coast Ranges are composed of thick late Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary strata. The northern and southern ranges are separated by a depression containing the San Francisco Bay. Offshore, the continental shelf is transected by submarine canyons. The Monterey submarine canyon, 10,000 feet deep, is apparently a submerged river canyon. The Northern Coast Ranges are dominated by irregular, knobby, landslide-topography of the Franciscan formation. The eastern border is characterized by strike-ridges and valleys in Upper Mesozoic strata. In several areas, Franciscan rocks are overlain by volcanic cones and flows of the Quien Sabe, Sonoma, and Clear Lake volcanic fields. The Coast Ranges are subparallel to the rift Valley of the active San Andreas Fault. The San Andreas is more than 600 miles long, extending from Pt. Arena to the Gulf of California. The Salinian block to the west of the San Andreas Fault. The San Andreas is more than 600 miles long, extending from Pt. Arena to the Gulf of California. The Salinian block to the west of the San Andreas has a granitic core, extending from the southern extremity of the Coast Ranges to the north of the Farallon Islands.                       MORE about the Pacific Mountain System                   Colorado Desert    A low-lying barren desert basin, about 245 feet below sea level in part, is dominated by the Salton Sea. The province is a depressed block between active branches of alluvium-covered San Andreas Fault with the southern extension of the Mojave Desert on the east. It is characterized by the ancient beach lines and silt deposits of extinct Lake Cahuilla.        Great Valley    The Great Valley is an alluvial plain, about 50 miles wide and 400 miles long, between the Coast Ranges and Sierra Nevada. The Great Valley is drained by the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, which join and enter San Francisco Bay. The eastern border is the west-sloping Sierran bedrock surface, which continues westward beneath alluvium and older sediments. The western border is underlain by east-dipping Cretaceous and Cenozoic strata that form a deeply buried synclinal trough, lying beneath the Great Valley along its western side. The southern part of the Great Valley is the San Joaquin Valley. Its great oil fields follow anticlinal uplifts that mark the southwestern border of San Joaquin Valley and its southern basin. To the north, the Sacramento Valley plain is interrupted by the Marysville Buttes, an isolated Pliocene volcanic plug about 2,000 feet high.        Klamath Mountains    The Klamath Mountains have rugged topography with prominent peaks and ridges reaching 6,000-8,000 feet above sea level. In the western Klamath, an irregular drainage is incised into an uplifted plateau called the Klamath peneplain. The Klamath River follows a circuitous course through the mountain. The uplift has left successive benches with gold-bearing gravels on the sides of the canyons. The province is considered to be a northern extension of the Sierra Nevada. Rocks include pre-Cretaceous metamorphic, abundant serpentinite, and granitic. Volcanic rocks of the Cascade Range lie to the east, Cretaceous sediments lie to the southeast, and Franciscan and younger Coast Range formations lie to the west.        Modoc Plateau    The Modoc Plateau is volcanic table land (elevation 4,000-6,000 feet above sea level) consisting of a thick accumulation of lava flows and tuff beds with many small volcanic cones. Occasional lakes, marshes, and sluggishly flowing streams meander across the plateau. The plateau is cut by many north-south faults. The province is bound indefinitely by the Cascade Range on the west and the Basin-Range on the east and south.         Mojave Desert    The Mojave is a broad interior region of isolated mountain ranges separated by expanses of desert plains. It has an interior enclosed drainage and many playas. There are two important fault trends that control topography a prominent NW-SE trend and a secondary east-west trend (apparent alignment with Transverse Ranges is significant). The Mojave province is wedged in a sharp angle between the Garlock Fault (southern boundary Sierra Nevada) and the San Andreas Fault, where it bends east from its northwest trend. The northern boundary of the Mojave is separated from the prominent Basin and Range by the eastern extension of the Garlock Fault.          Peninsular Ranges    A series of ranges is separated by longitudinal valleys, trending NW-SE, subparallel to faults branching from the San Andreas Fault. The trend of topography is similar to the Coast Ranges, but the geology is more like the Sierra Nevada, with granitic rock intruding the older metamorphic rocks. The Peninsular Ranges extend into lower California and are bound on the east by the Colorado Desert. The Los Angeles Basin, and the island group (Santa Catalina, Santa Barbara, and the distinctly terraced San Clemente and San Nicolas islands), together with the surrounding continental shelf (cut by deep submarine fault troughs) are included in this province.           Sierra Nevadas    The Sierra is a tilted fault block nearly 400 miles long. Its east face is a high, rugged multiple scarp, contrasting with the gentle western slope (about 2) that disappears under sediments of the Great Valley. Deep river canyons are cut into the western slope. Their upper courses, especially in massive granites of the higher Sierra, are modified by glacial sculpturing, forming such scenic features as Yosemite Valley. The high crest culminates in Mt. Whitney with an elevation of 14,495 feet above sea level near the eastern scarp. The metamorphic bedrock (still partly capped by Tertiary volcanics), contains gold-bearing veins; a north-south structural trend is predominant in the western flank and northern end of the Sierra. The northern Sierra boundary is marked where bedrock disappears under the Cenozoic volcanic cover of the Cascade Range.                      MORE about the Pacific Mountain System        MORE America's Volcanic Past - Sierra Nevadas                    Transverse Ranges    The Transverse Ranges are a complex series of mountain ranges and valleys distinguished by an anomalous dominant east-west trend, contrasting to the NW-SE direction of the Coast Ranges and Peninsular Ranges. Structural trends (NW-SE and NE-SW) subordinate to a major east-west direction, significant in the formation of important oil field structures. The Cenozoic sedimentary section is one of the thickest in the world. The western limit of the province is the island group of San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and Santa Cruz. The eastern limit, within the Mojave Desert, includes the San Bernardino Mountains on the east side of the San Andreas Fault.                                             California's Volcanic Rocks             Tertiary and Quaternary Volcanic Rocks: 17    Lava flows erupted from volcanoes.  These rocks make up much of the Cascade Range and the Modoc Plateau, and are widespread in eastern California.  They also occur in coastal regions.                     What are Volcanic Rocks?                Mesozoic Granitic Rocks: 17    A wide variety of coarse-grained igneous rocks formed when magma that intruded the earth's crust cooled and was later exposed by erosion.  Granitic rocks occur throughout the state, but are most common in the mountainous areas such as the Klamath Mountains, the Sierra Nevada, and the Peninsular Ranges.  Some granitic rocks are Cenozoic, Paleozoic, and Precambrian.                      What is Granite?                               California's State Rock             Serpentine - California's State Rock: 17    Serpentine rock is apple-green to black and is often mottled  with light and dark colored areas. Its surfaces often have a shiny or wax-like appearance and a slightly soapy feel.  Serpentine is usually fine-grained and compact  but may be granular, platy, or fibrous in appearance. The term ""serpentine""  is commonly used by the general public to  refer to the rock type that geologists call ""serpentinite.""  Serpentine occurs in central and northern California --  in the Coast Ranges, the Klamath Mountains, and in the Sierra                Nevada foothills.    Serpentine is considered by geoscientists to be the metamorphosed  remains of magnesium-rich igneous rocks ,   most commonly the rock peridotite, from the earth's mantle.                       What is Serpentine?                              Amboy Crater           Amboy Volcanic Field: 25    The Amboy lava field covers approximately 70 square miles and consists primarily of vesicular pahoehoe.  The field is in an alluvial-filled valley between the Bullion Mountains to the southwest and the Bristol Mountains to the northeast.  Within the valley, it lies between Bagdad Dry Lake to the west and Bristol Dry Lake to the east; both are playa lakes typical of the Mojave Desert. Most of the Amboy lava field is composed of undifferentiated flow units of relatively dense, ""degassed"" pahoehoe lavas that form a hummocky terrain.  The surface relief on this unit ranges from 2 to 5 meters.  The flow is characterized by abundant tumuli and pressure ridges and, as is typical for this type of flow, a fractured surface.  Lava tubes are not present in any of the flows, nor are blisters or shelly-type pahoehoe; only a few lava channels are present.                       What is a Volcanic Field?                 Amboy Crater: 25    Amboy Crater is a prominent, undissected cinder cone in the northeaster quadrant of the lava field.  The volcano erupted along the northern border of Bristol Dry Lake and poured lava onto its surface, dividing it into the two present playas.  The cone rises 75 meters above the surrounding lava flows and is approximately 460 meters in basal diameter.  It is composed of a loose accumulation of volcanic ejecta with secondary amounts of agglutinated ejecta and flows.  Amboy Crater is not a single cone but is composed of at least four nearly coaxial nested cones.  The outer slopes of the main cone are gullied by erosion.  Within the main outer cone, there is a remnant of a second cone on the west side; both cones are breached on the west.  In addition to the two main cones, there are two relatively undisturbed cone walls within the main crater.  These innermost cones are composed almost entirely of angular scoriaceous cinders.

Anderson Reservoir Dam and Anderson County Park              Anderson Reservoir Dam and Anderson County Park: 27    Pass the bridge over Coyote Creek (on Highway 101). Anderson Reservoir Dam can be seen blocking a former gorge through the Yerba Buena Ridge (several miles to the left). This long ridge preserves evidence of the complex geologic history related to the ongoing development of the Calaveras-Hayward fault system and the uplift of the Diablo Range. The hilltops above the dam preserve evidence of a late Tertiary volcanic lava flow that formed early in the development of the San Andreas fault system and the opening of the Santa Clara Valley. These volcanic rocks unconformably overlie highly-deformed Franciscan assemblage rocks, mostly ancient basalt, greenstone [altered basaltic volcanic rocks], serpentinite, chert, shale, and graywacke sandstone.  (Graywacke is a fancy name for a dark, poorly sorted, typically fine-grained, dirty rock.)  Some of the rocks are well-exposed near the reservoir spillway and the boat-ramp areas in Anderson County Park.

Elevations range from 2,080 to 3,941 feet at the summit of Black Mountain. Golden eagles and prairie falcons have been seen foraging in this area, which is also known for its occasional display of spring flowers.

Bristol Mountains             Bristol Mountains: 23    A portion of the rolling Bristol Mountains and  a tilted volcanic plain form the Bristol Mountains Wilderness. The lack of any springs and extreme distances make travel in this wilderness a challenge for the most experienced desert hiker. The wilderness is contiguous with the Granite Mountains Wilderness, which is part of the Mojave National Preserve              on its eastern boundary at Budweiser Wash. Location: San Bernardino County; 40 miles              southeast of Baker, California.                  Cascade Range Volcanoes            California's Cascade Range: 17    The Cascade Range, a chain of volcanic cones,  extends through Washington and Oregon into California. It                                  is dominated by Mount Shasta,  a glacier-mantled volcanic cone, rising 14,162 feet above sea level. The                                  southern termination is Lassen Peak  which last erupted in the early 1920s. The Cascade Range is transected                                  by deep canyons of the Pit River.  The river flows through the range between these two major volcanic                                  cones, after winding across the  interior Modoc Plateau on its way to the Sacramento River.

Over 2,000 species of plants and animals can be found within the park.  The park consists of 249,354 acres, half of which are under the ocean, and include the islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, Anacapa, and Santa Barbara. Even though the islands seem tantalizingly close to the densely populated, southern California coast, their isolation has left them relatively undeveloped, making them an exciting place for visitors to explore.         Channel Islands: 24    The Channel Islands were created  as a result of geologic activity millions of years ago.  The four northern Channel Islands are actually the western terminus of the Santa Monica Mountains,  separated from the mainland by the waters of the  Santa Barbara Channel. Twenty thousand years ago, when worldwide sea  level was 300 feet lower than at present, the four islands formed one large island. The four southern Channel Islands are  thought to have once been connected to the mountains of the Peninsular Ranges, but faulting in the San Pedro Channel  30 million years ago cut them off from the mainland.      Anacapa Island: 20    Anacapa Island is located 14 miles off the  coast from Ventura. It is the only Channel Island to retain its American Indian name, derived from the  Chumash word, ""Eneepah"", meaning island of deception or mirage. Ocean waves have eroded the  perimeter of the island,  creating steep sea cliffs towering hundreds of feet in height and exposing  the    volcanic origins of air pockets,  lava tubes, and sea caves . At the east end of Anacapa a natural bridge has formed  in the ocean. Forty-foot high  Arch Rock is a trademark of Anacapa and Channel Islands National Park.        Santa Barbara Island: 20    Santa Barbara Island (639 acres), 38 miles west of San Pedro,  is the smallest of the California Channel Islands.     Formed by underwater volcanic activity ,  Santa Barbara is roughly triangular in outline and emerges from the ocean as a giant twin-peaked mesa with steep cliffs.  Even though small in size, Santa Barbara Island boasts diversity in its habitats,  with a few narrow rocky beaches,  six canyons, and badlands area. It is much like Anacapa Island  in its being a haven for sea birds.  The steep cliffs and isolation from mainland predators provide safe breeding sites  for thousands of sea birds.      Santa Cruz Island: 20    Santa Cruz is the largest island off the  coast of California.  Located between Anacapa and Santa Rosa Islands, it lies from 19-25 miles off  the adjacent mainland coast between  Ventura and Santa Barbara.  The scenic beauty of Santa Cruz is  reflected in its many landforms -- two rugged mountain ranges, the highest peaks on the Channel Islands,  deep canyons, a central valley,  year-round springs and streams, plus 77 miles of craggy coastline cliffs,  giant sea caves, pristine tidepools and  expansive beaches. Lying directly on the boundary between cold  northern and warm southern waters, this island hosts unique plant, animal, and marine communities representing  nearly 1,000 miles of coastline.   In its vastness and variety of flora,  fauna and geology, Santa Cruz Island resembles a miniature California. Geologists believe that the island  never has been attached to the mainland.    All three major rock types -- igneous, sedimentary and  metamorphic --  are found throughout this rugged, mountainous island . Nestled between two mountain ranges  that rise above 2,000 feet,  is a pastoral Central Valley that was, and still is, being created by a major earthquake fault.

Chemehuevi Mountains            Chemehuevi Mountains: 23    The Chemehuevi Mountains are a horse-shoe shaped range a few miles from the Colorado River.  These mountains transform gradually from almost white granite to dark red and gray volcanic spires. Within the arms of the horseshoe is a large central valley,  its rolling hills covered by dense stands of cholla and other cactus.  Desert tortoise, bighorn sheep, wild burros and desert mule  deer are among the wildlife making their homes here. A popular trail is the  12-mile Trampas Wash, which bisects the wilderness and ends at the Colorado River.  Springs within the wilderness are seasonal and should be depended upon for water.

Chesbro Reservoir              Chesbro Reservoir: 27    Chesbro Reservoir boat dock - examine serpentinite exposed around the reservoir  Boulders of many of the different Franciscan assemblage rocks are conveniently on display around the boat dock parking area. Boulders around the margin of the boat-dock parking area include examples of graywacke sandstone, metasandstone, greenstone (metabasalt), serpentinite, red chert, and chert breccia. These rocks occur in scattered pod-like masses (a classic mlange) exposed along the shoreline of Chesbro Reservoir.  A short walk to the dam (0.2 miles) provides opportunity to view exceptional exposures of serpentinite in road cuts and in excavations along dam path. Dont stand along the road because of the hazard of speeding cars. Instead, the safer place to examine the serpentinite is along the dam path. Some of the serpentinite displays  slickensides , a linear fracture pattern caused by fault shearing motion between rock surfaces.   From the opposite end of the dam you can see the back of El Toro, the peak overlooking Morgan Hill. Downstream from the reservoir, Llagas Creek flows through Paradise Valley and enters the Santa Clara Valley a couple of miles south of Morgan Hill. On the north side of the spillway is a landslide formed in the weathered serpentinite. Note the bluish-green to black color of the residual soil; the soil is rich in the clay mineral, montmorillonite.                       What is Greenstone?

Coast Ranges             Coast Ranges: 17    The Coast Ranges are mountain ranges  (2,000-4,000, occasionally 6,000 feet elevation above sea level) and valleys.  The ranges and valleys trend northwest,  subparallel to the San Andreas Fault.  The province terminates on the east where  strata dip beneath alluvium of the Great Valley;  on the west by the Pacific Ocean with mountains rising  sharply from uplifted and terraced,  wave-cut coast; on the north by South Fork Mountain, which has the  characteristic trend of the Coast Ranges,  and on the south by the Transverse Ranges. The Coast Ranges are  composed of thick late Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary strata.  The northern and southern ranges  are separated by a depression containing the San Francisco Bay.  Offshore, the continental shelf is  transected by submarine canyons.  The Monterey submarine canyon, 10,000 feet deep, is apparently a submerged river canyon.  The northern Coast Ranges are dominated by irregular, knobby, landslide topography  of the Franciscan Formation. The eastern border is characterized by strike-ridges and valleys  in Upper Mesozoic strata.  In several areas, Franciscan rocks are overlain by volcanic cones and flows of the  Quien Sabe, Sonoma, and Clear Lake volcanic fields. The Coast Ranges are subparallel to the rift  valley of the active San Andreas Fault.  The San Andreas is more than 600 miles long, extending from  Point Arena to the Gulf of California.  The Salinian block to the west of the San Andreas has a granitic core,  extending from the southern extremity of the  Coast Ranges to north of the Farallon Islands.

Coastal Bluffs and Headlands            Coastal Bluffs and Headlands: 24    Coastal bluffs are composed mainly of sedimentary rocks  such as sandstones and shales that are particularly prone to erosion. Grains of quartz, feldspar, and mica compressed  into layers of sandstone crumble easily; when wet, shales and siltstones disintegrate, and clays and mudstones,  soften and liquefy. Lying on top of the sedimentary deposits of many bluffs is alluvial soil, loosely consolidated sand and  gravel deposited by ancient rivers and streams. Examples of sedimentary coastal bluffs are the sandstone bluffs of Santa Cruz,  the alluvial cliffs at La Jolla, and the shale cliffs of Point Loma in San Diego County.     Rocky headlands are composed of igneous rocks -- granites and basalts --  that are resistant to wave erosion .   Granitic formations include the Point Reyes Headlands in Marin County.  Morro Rock in San Luis Obispo County, Point Dume in Los Angeles County, and Point Sur in Monterey County are outcroppings of basaltic lava.                       What are Igneous Rocks?

From high points within the wilderness, most notably Joshua Flat, one can obtain outstanding views of the Owens Valley and the eastern Sierra Nevadas. Creosote, low desert shrubs, annuals, cactus and large stands of Joshua trees are the primary vegetation in the area. Vermillion Canyon and Joshua Flat are two especially scenic areas within this wilderness. Cactus Flat and McCloud Flat are two areas of historic mining activity.

Coso Volcanic Field             Coso Volcanic Field: 17    The Coso volcanic field is located at the west edge of the Basin and Range province.  Initiation of volcanism at Coso preceded  the onset of Basin and Range crustal extension there, as expressed by normal faulting.   The earlier of the two principal periods of volcanism began with the emplacement of basalt flows  over a surface of little relief.  Then, during the ensuing period of about 1.5 million years,  eruptive activity included chemically more evolved rocks erupted upon a faulted terrain of  substantial relief.  Following a 1.5-million-year hiatus with few eruptions, a bimodal field of  basalt lava flows and rhyolite lava domes and flows developed on Basin and Range terrain of  essentially the same form as today's landscape.  Many of the young basalt flows are intracanyon,  occupying parts of the presentday drainage system.   The Coso volcanic field is best known  for its Pleistocene rhyolite.  Thirty-eight rhyolite domes and flows form an elongate  array atop a north-tending 8 by 20-kilometer horst of Mesozoic bedrock.  Nearly uneroded constructional  forms are exhibited by most domes.  Many are nested within tuff-ring craters, and a  few filled and overflowed their craters to feed flows a kilometer or two long.                         What is a Volcanic Field?

Until recently, it was thought to have been                          formed about one million years ago.  Current studies suggest that the Devils Postpile was formed less                          than 100,000 years ago when a cooling  lava flow cracked into multisided columns.

The field is obviously defined by late Pleistocene flows of olivine tholeiitic basalt covering 125 square kilometers within the Eagle Lake volcano-tectonic depression.  Fifteen cinder cone-and-flow vents less than 100 meters high, fed the flows during two eruptive periods, each very brief, probably between 50 and 100 thousand years ago.   Several low composite volcanoes and small shields of Pliocene age occur just outside the late Pleistocene field.       Roop Mountain volcano, 650 meters high, consists of andesite flows.   Antelope Mountain volcano, 600 meters high, consists of andesite flows with minor dacite flows and pyroclastic debris.   Logan Mountain shield, 400 meters high, is basaltic and mafic andesitic.   Heavy Mountain shield, 250 meters high, is also made of basalt and mafic andesite flows. Two-million-year old, multiple-vent structures are well preserved on Heavy Mountain.   Champs Flat - the only known silicic flows in the area include the deeply eroded flow domes of Champs Flat exposed in an area of 3 square kilometers.    The areas between these volcanoes are underlain by numerous coalescing and interfingering flows with local interbeds of tuff, mostly of Pliocene age.  They are derived from many small local vents.                        What is a Volcanic Field?        What is Olivine?         What is Andesite?         What is Dacite?

El Paso Mountains            El Paso Mountains: 23     Numerous reddish-colored buttes and dark, uplifted volcanic mesas dissected by narrow canyons              distinguish this wilderness.   Badlands topography surrounds Black Mountain, the central feature of this wilderness. The most spectacular attribute of this area is the abundance of cultural sites. The southern portion of the wilderness is included in the Last Chance Archaeological District and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Wildlife includes raptors, Mojave ground squirrel and the desert tortoise. Vegetation primarily consists of creosote bush scrub community with Joshua trees on the western side of the mountain. Location: Kern County; 6 miles southwest of              Ridgecrest, California.                      Farallon Islands             Farallon Islands: 24    More than half the California population of resident and migratory  seabirds nests on the Farallon Islands, a group of seven sparsely vegetated granite outcroppings located offshore of  the Golden Gate channel.   The Channel Islands and the Farallon Islands were created  as a result of geologic activity millions of years ago. The Farallons are composed of 89-million-year-old granite that emerged  as molten rock from below the sea floor; uplifting of the Pacific Plate during the mid-Pleistocene completed the island-making process.   The four northern Channel Islands are actually the western terminus of the Santa Monica Mountains,  separated from the mainland by the waters of the  Santa Barbara Channel. Twenty thousand years ago, when worldwide sea  level was 300 feet lower than at present, the four islands formed one large island. The four southern Channel Islands are  thought to have once been connected to the mountains of the Peninsular Ranges, but faulting in the San Pedro Channel  30 million years ago cut them off from the mainland.

The volcano is thought to be younger than approximately 1,000 years, and consists of calc-alkaline and tholeiitic lavas.  The most recent  eruption occurred around 1,000 years ago when rhyolite and dacite erupted at Glass Mountain and associated vents near the caldera's eastern rim.

Granite Mountains             Granite Mountains: 7    Some of the more striking rock  formations in the Mojave National Preserve  lie in the Granite Mountains.  These granitic rocks  have eroded into unusual rounded shapes that include spires,  perched boulders, and curved cliff faces.  Granitic rocks represent the roots of ancient continental-margin volcanic systems.   Most of the granitic rock in the Mojave Desert  is late Mesozoic in age (80 to 180 million years old).   The Mojave National Preserve lies within a belt of  late Mesozoic granites that parallels the western continental margin from Mexico to Canada.   The granites formed at depth  within a volcanically active mountain range comparable in geologic setting to the  Andes Mountains chain in South America.   The granitoids formed by the slow cooling and solidification of molten magma bodies that  developed above sinking slabs of  oceanic crust overridden by the edge of the continent. At least 55 or 60 million years  elapsed between the crystallization of the  last Mesozoic magma bodies and deposition of the youngest-preserved overlying strata.   The Mojave National Preserve probably  formed a highlands during much of this period and erosion gradually stripped off  Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks  overlying the granites.                         What is Granite?           America's Volcanic Past - Mojave National Preserve                                   Great Valley            Great Valley Geomorphic Province: 17    The Great Valley is an alluvial plain,  about 50 miles wide and 400 miles long,  between the Coast Ranges and Sierra Nevada.  The Great Valley is drained by the  Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, which join and enter San Francisco Bay.  The eastern border is the west-sloping  Sierran bedrock surface, which continues westward beneath alluvium and older sediments.  The western border is underlain by east-dipping Cretaceous and Cenozoic strata that form a  deeply buried synclinal trough,  lying beneath the Great Valley along its western side.  The southern part of the Great Valley  is the San Joaquin Valley. Its great oil fields follow anticlinal uplifts that  mark the southwestern border of  San Joaquin Valley and its southern basin.  To the north, the Sacramento Valley plain  is interrupted by the Marysville Buttes,  and isolated Pliocene volcanic plug about 2,000 feet high.                 Joshua Tree National Monument             Granite Monoliths: 9    The monument encompasses some of the most interesting geologic  displays found in California's deserts.  Rugged mountains of twisted rock and exposed granite monoliths testify to the  tremendous earth forces that shaped and formed this land.   Arroyos, playas, alluvial fans, bajadas,  pediments, desert varnish,  granites, aplite, and gneiss interact to form a giant desert mosaic of      immense beauty and complexity.                        What is a Granite?       What is Gneiss?                              Klamath Mountains             Klamath Mountains: 17    The Klamath Mountains have rugged  topography with prominent peaks and ridges reaching 6,000-8,000 feet above sea level. In the western Klamath,  an irregular drainage is incised into an uplifted plateau called the Klamath peneplain.  The Klamath River follows a circuitous course through the mountains. The uplift has left  successive benches with gold-bearing gravels  on the sides of the canyons. The province is considered to be a  northern extension of the Sierra Nevada.  Rocks include pre-Cretaceous metamorphic,  abundant serpentine, and granitic.  Volcanic rocks of the Cascade Range lie to the east,  Cretaceous sediments lie to the southeast,  and Franciscan and younger Coast Range formations lie to the west.                Lassen Peak -   Lassen Volcanic National Park             Lassen Peak: 12    Lassen Peak is the largest of a group of  more than 30 lava domes in the Lassen domefield.  Such domes are near-vent accumulations of highly viscous lava.  About 27,000 years ago, Lassen Peak formed over a short time,  probably no more than a few years. Its 2,000-foot height and  nearly 2-cubic kilometer volume make it one of the largest lava domes in the world.  When it formed, Lassen Peak looked much like the Chaos Crags domes do today --  covered with angular rock talus and with oversteepened flanks.  During the last ice age, 18,000 to 25,000 years ago, its shape was  significantly modified by glacial erosion. A tiny reminder of one of these  glaciers survives on Lassen's eastern flank. The depression on the northeastern  flank of Lassen Peak is a glacial cirque, where ice accumulated to form a glacier  10 kilometers long.                        What is a Lava Dome?                  Lassen Volcanic National Park: 10    The Lassen area was made a National Park  in 1916 because of its significance as an active volcanic landscape. The park is a compact laboratory of  volcanic phenomena and associated thermal features (except true geysers).  It is part of a vast geographic unit -  a great lava plateau with isolated volcanic peaks -  that also encompasses Lava Beds National Monument,  California, and Crater Lake National Park, Oregon.

The Lava Mountains stretch across the northwestern portion of the area, crowned by Dome Mountain at nearly  5,000 feet. This range is cut by several steep walled canyons that reveal bands of multi-colored sedimentary rocks. The Almond              Mountains, rising to an elevation of  4,500 feet, enclose the valley on the              southeast.  Location: San Bernardino County; 10 miles              southeast of Ridgecrest, California                     Lexington Reservoir            Lexington Reservoir Dam: 28    The geology around the dam site is quite complex.  Near the boat dock parking area are massive exposures of graywacke sandstone,  whereas a short distance down stream along Los Gatos Creek gorge the bedrock consists of deeply weathered  serpentinite that is prone to landsliding. Landsliding can be seen on both sides of the  valley where serpentinite crops out. On the north side of Highway 17 an  active landslide in the serpentinite continuously dumps material onto the highway.                     What is Serpentinite?                             Loma Prieta             Loma Prieta: 27    Loma Prieta (Spanish for black mountain) stands above the southern end of the Sierra Azul (Spanish for blue mountain). The Sierra Azul is actually a steep-sided ridge that runs along the crest of the Santa Cruz Mountains (including Loma Prieta and Mt. Umunhum, and two lower peaks to the north, Mt. Thayer and El Sombroso). The high ridge separates the Santa Clara Valley around San Jos from the San Andreas Rift valley to the southwest. Loma Prieta (3,806 feet) is the highest point in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Its summit consists of a serpentinite diapiric plug (Coast Range Ophiolite) surrounded on the east by middle Tertiary Temblor Sandstone on the east, and by Late Cretaceous sedimentary rocks (shale, mudstone, graywacke sandstone, and conglomerate - Great Valley Sequence equivalent rocks) on the west. The peak is host to a privately-owned radio tower operation.                     What is Ophiolite?       What is Serpentinite?                            Long Valley, Mammoth, Mono, Inyo             Long Valley and Vicinity: 4    About 760,000 years ago  a cataclysmic volcanic eruption in the Long Valley,  California area blew out 150 cubic miles of  magma (molten rock) from a depth of about 4 miles beneath the Earth's surface.  Rapidly moving flows of glowing hot ash  covered much of east-central California, and  airborne ash fell as far east as Nebraska.   The Earth's surface sank more than 1 mile into the space once occupied by the erupted magma, forming a large  volcanic depression that geologists call a caldera.   The massive Long Valley eruption  was followed by hundreds of  smaller eruptions over the next few hundred thousand years. These eruptions of lava flows, domes, and pyroclastic flows were concentrated in the central and western parts of the caldera. Volcanic activity then moved northward to the Mono Lake area about 35,000 years ago to build the Mono Craters. The most recent eruptions in the area occurred from the Mono and Inyo Craters about 600 years ago, and from Negit Island in Mono Lake about 250 years ago.                        America's Volcanic Past - Long Valley Vicinity                             Los Angeles Vicinity            Peninsular Ranges: 17     The Peninsular Ranges are a series of ranges  separated by longitudinal valleys,  trending NW-SE, subparallel to faults branching from the San Andreas Fault.  The trend of topography is similar to the  Coast Ranges, but   the geology is more like the Sierra Nevada, with granitic rock intruding the  older metamorphic rocks.  The Peninsular Ranges extend into lower California and are bound on the  east by the Colorado Desert. The Los Angeles Basin, and island group  (Santa Catalina, Santa Barbara, and the  distinctly terraced San Clemente and San Nicolas islands),  together with the surrounding continental  shelf (cut by deep submarine fault troughs) are included in this province.

Malpais Mesa             Malpais Mesa: 23     The landscape of the Malpais Mesa Wilderness takes on a variety of forms. Situated at the southern end of the Inyo Mountains, rugged valleys, deep canyons, sheer mountain sides and mesas can be found within a short distance of each other. To the east, gently sloping bajadas rise to meet  the rugged volcanic lava flow of Malpais Mesa.   Vegetation also takes on many forms: creosote, low desert shrubs and grasses on lower elevations; Joshua trees on the eastern slopes at mid elevations; and pinyon pines and juniper on the higher elevations. Wildlife within the wilderness includes mule deer and foraging and nesting habitat for golden eagles. Location: Inyo County; 15 miles northeast of              Olancha, California and 10 miles northwest of              Darwin, California.

Medicine Lake             Medicine Lake Shield Volcano: 3    Medicine Lake volcano is a Pleistocene and Holocene  shield volcano located in northeastern California  about 50 kilometers east of Mount Shasta, near the western margin of the Basin and Range tectonic province.  Lava Beds National Monument is located on the northern  flank of Medicine Lake volcano and encompasses mostly  basaltic and some andesitic lavas.   Higher on the volcano, basaltic lava is mostly absent, andesite dominates, and  rhyolite and small volumes of dacite  are present, the latter mainly near the 7 x 12 kilometer Medicine Lake  caldera.

Modoc Plateau            Modoc Plateau: 17    The Modoc Plateau is  volcanic table land (elevation 4,000-6,000 feet above sea level)  consisting of a thick accumulation of lava flows and tuff beds with many small volcanic cones. Occasional lakes, marshes, and sluggishly flowing streams meander across the plateau.  The plateau is cut by many north-south faults. The province is bound indefinitely by the Cascade Range on the  west and the Basin and Range on the east and south.                        What are Tuffs?                                  Mojave National Preserve            Mojave National Preserve: 12    The volcanic eruptions that rocked what is now Mojave National Preserve coincided with a period (about 20-5 million years ago) of intense plate tectonic activity.  During this episode, the Earth's crust was literally ripped apart, radically altering the landscape of the Southwest.   As the crust stretched, fractures formed along weak zones and mountain range-sized blocks jolted and slid against each other along faults. Some of these enormous blocks of crust rose up, forming rows of high, elongate mountains. Other blocks slid down, forming the low valleys. Together, the linear mountain ranges and intervening valleys define the Basin and Range Province.   The thinned, faulted crust made it easier for magma to rise up and follow weaknesses in the rock. Where magma reached the surface volcanoes grew and great globs of magma solidified to form plutons beneath them. In some places within the Preserve these geologically young plutons can be seen right at the surface. These plutons 'froze' at depth, then were almost immediately lifted up to the surface as mountains rose along new faults. This is truly a dynamic place!

One of        the few places in the region where geologic strata of Jurassic,        Cretaceous, and Tertiary age can be seen in an aggregate        thickness of 42,000 feet. The park also possesses a great        diversity of native plant species and associations. Owner:        State.         DESIGNATION DATE:         May 1982.                 Mount Shasta             Mount Shasta: 14    Mount Shasta is located in the Cascade Range in northern California  about 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of the Oregon-California border      and about midway between the Pacific Coast and the Nevada border.  One of the largest and highest of the Cascade volcanoes, snowclad          Mount Shasta is near the southern end of the range that terminates  near Lassen Peak.   Mount Shasta is a massive compound stratovolcano composed of overlapping cones centered at four or more main vents;  it was constructed during a period of more than 100,000 years.

Mt. Unumhum             Mt. Unumhum: 27    Umunhum is the Ohlone Indian word for hummingbird. The blockhouse that resides at the 3,486 foot summit of Mt. Umunhum is a relict of the Cold War missile complex and until recently was on land owned by the U.S. Air Force. In 2001, the land was acquired and added to the Sierra Azul Open Space Preserve. Until environmental restoration is complete, Mt. Umunhum will remains off-limits to the public. A large cliffy exposure on the northeast face of Mt. Umunhum is one of the best Bay Area exposures of the Coast Range Ophiolite. The Coast Range Ophiolite is a piece of Middle Jurassic oceanic crust and mantle that is also known to underlie the rocks of the Great Valley throughout central California. The original oceanic crust has largely been converted to serpentinite and with extensive faulting and diapiric injection upward, some of it is migrated to its current exposures on the Earths surface, including this exposure on the face of Mt. Umunhum and the extensive outcrop areas throughout the Santa Cruz Mountain foothills and elsewhere.                        What is Ophiolite?                 Mt. Umunhum: 28     Mt.

Newberry Mountains             Newberry Moutains: 23    The Newberry Mountains Wilderness is noted for its rugged volcanic mountains and deep, maze-like canyons.   Topography ranges from 2,200 feet in the north to 5,100 feet in the south.  The unique desert features are the result  of ancient volcanic activity.   Desert bighorn sheep have historically traveled  this area, and prairie falcons and golden eagles stop here to  forage and rest. Spring wildflower displays are likely along the west boundary.  Location: San Bernardino County; 15 miles              east of Barstow, California.                      Old Woman Mountains             Old Woman Mountains: 23   Taking its name from a granite rock monolith that resembles the figure              of an old woman,  the massive Old Woman Mountain range dominates the wilderness. Topography ranges from 800 at the lower              elevations and rises more than 5,300 to the summit of Old Woman              Peak. Creosote bush scrub covers the lower elevations, mixing with              desert scrub at the middle elevations, while at the highest elevations              grows a juniper-pinyon woodland. Bighorn sheep and desert tortoise              live here, and the rocky outcrops and rugged peaks of the range provide              homes for numerous raptors. The Old Woman Mountains have long              been used by man. Traces of prehistoric trails and historic mining routes              entice the experienced desert hiker. Be prepared for dry walks across              extensive bajadas and up long, sandy washes. Do not depend on              mapped springs for water, and remember to carry one gallon of water              per person per day.

What is Granite?        What are Metamorphic Rocks?                               Pinnacles National Monument            The Ancient Volcano: 8    The story begins more than 23 million years ago when  molten rock poured over the surface of the land through fissures that opened  as the two plates ground past one another.   As the eruptions grew in intensity the cone being built by the  volcanic activity grew until a high steep-sided volcano had been formed.  Geologists theorize that this  volcanic mountain once stood nearly a mile higher than North Chalone Peak, the highest point in the park today.   Yet even as this volcano was being formed, its own destruction was at hand, for the Pacific Plate  upon which it was located began moving off to the northwest. In time the portion of the  volcano whose eroded remnants we now know as the Pinnacles reached its present location, 195 miles  beyond its point of origin.  All the while, too, erosion, was at work carving and breaking  down the once mighty peak to about a third of its original height, sculpting the spires and  crags you see today. Nor is the geologic process at an end.  Millions of years from now what  little will be left of this ancient volcano will have moved off to the northwest.                       What is the Theory of Plate Tectonics?        What are Fissure Eruptions?                  Pinnacles: 8    These rocks are the remains of an ancient volcano.   Or rather they are part of the remains, for the rest of this volcano lies 195 miles to the southeast.   Sound intriguing? It is all part of the story of the San Andreas Rift Zone, which runs just east of the park,  and the geological forces that have shaped the face of the landscape in this part of California for millions of years.  The San Andreas Rift Zone, a series of faults,  lies just east of the park.   It was created when the Pacific Plate collided with and  wrenched off a portion of the North American Plate. Rift zones are likely places for volcanoes to occur,  for here the earth's crust is broken, allowing the magma from beneath the surface to well up.   The Pinnacles are the result of these two factors at work -  an ancient volcano and movement along a rift zone.                   Point Reyes               Point Reyes Peninsula: 19    The Point Reyes Peninsula has long  baffled geologists. Why should the granite bedrock of this craggy  coast match the bedrock in the southern Sierra Nevada range more  than 310 miles to the south? The answer lies in plate tectonics  and the continual movement of the earth's crust. Geologically,  Point Reyes is a land in motion. The Peninsula rides high on the  eastern edge of the Pacific plate, which creeps northwestward about  two inches a year. The slower moving North American plate travels  westward. In Olema Valley, near Bear Valley Visitor Center,  the North American and Pacific plates grind together along the  San Andreas Fault Zone. This fault zone contains many large and small  faults running parallel and at odd angles to one another. Because  neither plate can move freely, tremendous pressures build up. From  time to time this pressure becomes too great, and the surface  actually moves. This is what happened in the earthquake of 1906  when the Peninsula leaped 20 feet northwestward. As though to accent  the geological separation along the San Andreas Fault, the weather  may vary quite markedly on either side of Inverness Ridge.  A succession of summer days on the east side may well be warm and  sunny while on the ocean side a chilling fog may hide the sun.                      What is Granite?       What is the Theory of Plate Tectonics?                   Inverness Ridge: 18    Granodiorite and granite are exposed along Inverness Ridge,  where dikes and masses  of aplite and alaskite  are locally abundant.                         What is Granite?                  Point Reyes Geology: 18    The Point Reyes Peninsula is a roughly  triangular projection of the Marin County coast with an apex at Point Reyes  and a base along Tomales Bay and the rift valley of the  San Andreas fault zone.   This fault zone forms the active tectonic boundary between the Pacific  and North American lithospheric plates and here  separates Upper Cretaceous granitic and  older metamorphic  rocks of the Salinian block to the west from  Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous graywacke sandstone and melange of the  Franciscan complex to the east.  Resting nonconformably upon the crystalline  basement of the Point  Reyes Peninsula is a composite section of as  much as 14,340 feet of moderately deformed Tertiary  marine sedimentary rocks that comprise three sequences, separated by unconformities.    The oldest sequence consists of as much as 700 feet of the Point Reyes  Conglomerate of Galloway (1977) of early Eocene age that rests  depositionally upon the porphyritic granodiorite of Point Reyes.  A middle and upper Miocene sedimentary  sequence is as much as 5,300 feet thick  and consists of a basal sandstone unit,  the Laird Sandstone, and an overlying porcelanite unit,  the Monterey Formation.  This Neogene sequence crops out on the southwest  slope of Inverness Ridge, where it rests nonconformably upon the  granodiorite and granite of Inverness Ridge.                          What is Granite?                Tomales Point: 18     Hornblende-biotite tonalite that contains dark diorite inclusions forms the  basement of Tomales Point.  This rock is lithologically similar to the tonalite  that crops out at Bodega Head about  10 kilometers to the north, and both are probably  part of the same granitic mass.                      What is Diorite?       What is Granite?                                    Rodman Mountains             Rodman Mountains: 23    A series of ridges and valleys climbing from 2,000 feet to almost 5,000 feet are the result of faults which cross this wilderness. A lava flow slices this area in two              from northwest to southeast, forming a sloping              mesa.  Colorful escarpments, calico-colored mountains, maze-like canyons and broad, majestic bajadas come together here. Steep canyons and cliff-like walls form dry falls along deep drainage channels, creating cascades during heavy rain storms. More than a half dozen natural water ""tanks"" sit within the lava flow. Two of the tanks, Hidden Tank and Deep Tank, hold thousands of gallons of water. One of only seven core raptor breeding areas in the desert is within this wilderness, where prairie falcons and golden eagles are known to survive. The mountains themselves are part of the historic range of the desert bighorn sheep. While sheep have not been spotted here, this wildlife species has been seen in the nearby Newberry Mountains.

Salton Buttes            Salton Buttes: 15    The Salton Buttes comprise five small rhyolite domes  extruded onto Quaternary sediments of the Colorado River delta. Rock Hill and Mullet Island are simple domes;  Mullet Island is notable for its symmetrical  ""onion-skin"" pattern of foliation,  attributed to endogenous growth. Obsidian Butte consists of a central dome  surrounded on all sides by a single flow. Red Island is made up of      two domes, each mantled by subaqueous pyroclastic deposits.   All the domes exhibit      wave-cut benches carved during various stands of pre-historic  Lake Cahuilla, and have been partly buried by lacustrine and aeolian      deposits.                       What is a Volcanic Dome?                            San Gabriel Mountains              San Gabriel Mountains: 30    The San Gabriel Mountains, with elevations of nearly 7,000 feet, are composed of a complex assemblage of Precambrian through Cretaceous igneous and metamorphic rocks that have been thrust to the south over the adjacent basins.                        What is the Precambrian?        What is the Cretaceous?        What are Igneous Rocks?        What are Metamorphic Rocks?                                  Santa Cruz Mountains in Santa Clara County              Anderson Reservoir Dam and Anderson County Park: 27    Pass the bridge over Coyote Creek (on Highway 101). Anderson Reservoir Dam can be seen blocking a former gorge through the Yerba Buena Ridge (several miles to the left). This long ridge preserves evidence of the complex geologic history related to the ongoing development of the Calaveras-Hayward fault system and the uplift of the Diablo Range. The hilltops above the dam preserve evidence of a late Tertiary volcanic lava flow that formed early in the development of the San Andreas fault system and the opening of the Santa Clara Valley. These volcanic rocks unconformably overlie highly-deformed Franciscan assemblage rocks, mostly ancient basalt, greenstone [altered basaltic volcanic rocks], serpentinite, chert, shale, and graywacke sandstone. (Graywacke is a fancy name for a dark, poorly sorted, typically fine-grained, dirty rock.) Some of the rocks are well-exposed near the reservoir spillway and the boat-ramp areas in Anderson County Park.     Chesbro Reservoir: 27    Chesbro Reservoir boat dock - examine serpentinite exposed around the reservoir  Boulders of many of the different Franciscan assemblage rocks are conveniently on display around the boat dock parking area. Boulders around the margin of the boat-dock parking area include examples of graywacke sandstone, metasandstone, greenstone (metabasalt), serpentinite, red chert, and chert breccia. These rocks occur in scattered pod-like masses (a classic mlange) exposed along the shoreline of Chesbro Reservoir.  A short walk to the dam (0.2 miles) provides opportunity to view exceptional exposures of serpentinite in road cuts and in excavations along dam path. Dont stand along the road because of the hazard of speeding cars. Instead, the safer place to examine the serpentinite is along the dam path. Some of the serpentinite displays  slickensides , a linear fracture pattern caused by fault shearing motion between rock surfaces.   From the opposite end of the dam you can see the back of El Toro, the peak overlooking Morgan Hill. Downstream from the reservoir, Llagas Creek flows through Paradise Valley and enters the Santa Clara Valley a couple of miles south of Morgan Hill. On the north side of the spillway is a landslide formed in the weathered serpentinite. Note the bluish-green to black color of the residual soil; the soil is rich in the clay mineral, montmorillonite.                       What is Greenstone?        What is Serpentinite?                 Highway 101 Serpentinite Boulders: 27    Pass the major power-grid station for  San Jos along U.S. Highway 101. Serpentinite boulders are scattered across the hillsides on the left. This topography is, in-part,  a weathering effect related to soil development in areas underlain by serpentinite.  Some of the serpentinite has been silicified (chert is very chemically stable and is more resistant to erosion on the surface environment).  Areas underlain by this variety of  silicified serpentinite  can be easily recognized on hillsides throughout the South Bay.                       What is Serpentinite?                 Loma Prieta: 27    Loma Prieta (Spanish for black mountain) stands above the southern end of the Sierra Azul (Spanish for blue mountain). The Sierra Azul is actually a steep-sided ridge that runs along the crest of the Santa Cruz Mountains (including Loma Prieta and Mt. Umunhum, and two lower peaks to the north, Mt. Thayer and El Sombroso). The high ridge separates the Santa Clara Valley around San Jos from the San Andreas Rift valley to the southwest. Loma Prieta (3,806 feet) is the highest point in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Its summit consists of a serpentinite diapiric plug (Coast Range Ophiolite) surrounded on the east by middle Tertiary Temblor Sandstone on the east, and by Late Cretaceous sedimentary rocks (shale, mudstone, graywacke sandstone, and conglomerate - Great Valley Sequence equivalent rocks) on the west. The peak is host to a privately-owned radio tower operation.                     What is Serpentinite?                 Mt. Unumhum: 27    Umunhum is the Ohlone Indian word for hummingbird. The blockhouse that resides at the 3,486 foot summit of Mt. Umunhum is a relict of the Cold War missile complex and until recently was on land owned by the U.S. Air Force. In 2001, the land was acquired and added to the Sierra Azul Open Space Preserve. Until environmental restoration is complete, Mt. Umunhum will remains off-limits to the public. A large cliffy exposure on the northeast face of Mt. Umunhum is one of the best Bay Area exposures of the Coast Range Ophiolite. The Coast Range Ophiolite is a piece of Middle Jurassic oceanic crust and mantle that is also known to underlie the rocks of the Great Valley throughout central California. The original oceanic crust has largely been converted to serpentinite and with extensive faulting and diapiric injection upward, some of it is migrated to its current exposures on the Earths surface, including this exposure on the face of Mt. Umunhum and the extensive outcrop areas throughout the Santa Cruz Mountain foothills and elsewhere.                      What is Ophiolite?                   Uvas Reservoir Dam: 27     Uvas Reservoir Dam - examine pillow basalt  and other rock outcrops exposed in the dam spillway and along the exposed shore. In this region the road follows an elevated  terrace roughly 10 meters above the modern stream. The horse pastures in this region are littered with  scattered boulders and outcrops of serpentinite and chert. Large outcrops of metachert and serpentinite that rise above  the grassy landscape are called knockers.  This stop involves less than a mile walk to the bottom of the spillway  and return to the parking area near the dam.  Note the variety of rock exposures along the shoreline.  Nearly every rock type of the Franciscan assemblage can be found within a mile radius of the Uvas Reservoir Dam.  On the shore near the south end of the dam blocks and boulders of graywacke sandstone, volcanic breccia, limestone,  and other rock litter the shoreline. Examine the shoreline and note that different rock-types that occur in pod-shaped  masses or as a chaotic mix. This is classic mlange typical of the Franciscan assemblage.

Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks             Moro Rock: 21    Moro Rock is a dome-shaped granite monolith.  Common in the Sierra Nevada, these domes  form by exfoliation, the spalling or      casting off in scales, plates,  or sheets of rock layers on otherwise  unjointed granite. Outward expansion  of the granite results in      exfoliations. Expansion results  from load relief; when the overburden  that once capped the granite has eroded away, the source of      compression is removed and the  granite slowly expands. Fractures that  form during exfoliation tend to cut corners. This ultimately      results in rounded dome-like forms.                        What is Granite?

The massive granite intruded the crust in Mesozoic time and was uplifted and faulted in the Tertiary during formation of the Basin and Range province to the east. Eroded residue from the Sierra Nevada has filled the Central Valley of California, giving rise to both extensive agriculture and the 1849 Gold Rush.                        What is Granite?

DESIGNATION DATE:        May 1973                 Ubehebe Craters             Ubehebe Craters: 16    The Ubehebe Craters include  over a dozen maar volcanoes formed during hydrovolcanic eruptions of alkali basalt through permeable fanglomerate  deposits on the north side of Tin Mountain.   The craters formed along a range-bounding fault that marks the western margin of Tin Mountain.  The volcanic center is named Ubehebe Crater, the largest tuff ring (0.8 kilometers wide, 235 meters deep) of the volcanic field.  Initial eruptive activity at the center developed a scoria cone south of Ubehebe Crater.  Subsequent activity was predominantly hydrovolcanic and produced two clusters of explosion craters and tuff rings west of, and south of, Ubehebe Crater.  The southern cluster includes Little Hebe Crater, the second youngest crater in the field.  The youngest eruptive events at the center were the episodic hydrovolcanic explosions that formed Ubehebe Crater.  Ejecta from the crater covers all preexisting craters in the area.  The deposits also overlie lake beds of Lake Rogers, approximately 4 kilometers north of the vent. This stratigraphic position, and the lack of erosional modification of the pyroclastic surge apron, suggest the youngest activity was Holocene.  The Ubehebe Craters are accessible via a paved road, west of Scotty's Castle, at the north end of the Death Valley National Monument.  The road leads to an overlook at the west side of Ubehebe Crater.                       What is a Maar Volcano?       What is a Volcanic Field?

In this region the road follows an elevated terrace roughly 10 meters above the modern stream. The horse pastures in this region are littered with scattered boulders and outcrops of serpentinite and chert.

Examine the shoreline and note that different rock-types that occur in pod-shaped masses or as a chaotic mix. This is classic mlange typical of the Franciscan assemblage.     Uvas Reservoir Bedrock: 27    The bedrock around Uvas Reservoir are a mlange (a great chaotic mix) of different rocks ranging in age from Early Jurassic to Eocene, representing a time span over 150 million years ending roughly 50 million years ago. Similar rocks are exposed throughout the Coast Ranges of California and are collectively named the Franciscan assemblage (or Franciscan Group, Franciscan Series, or Franciscan Complex, depending on preferences of various geologists through time). The word assemblage is appropriate because rocks that are included in the Franciscan originally formed in a variety of geologic settings later to be brought together and mixed along a convergent plate boundary (see fig. 6). General rock types that occur in the Franciscan assemblage include ultramafic gabbro, serpentinite, basaltic volcanic rocks, limestone (and dolostone), ribbon chert, shale, graywacke (mudstone and sandstone), serpentinite, and other materials. As the variety of rocks suggests, the origin of the Franciscan assemblage is complex; a short interpretation of its geologic history follows.  The oldest Franciscan assemblage rocks include gabbro (original mantle and oceanic crust). In most places, this original rock has been completely altered to serpentinite. These rocks occur in association with pillow basalt that is inferred to have formed on a mid-ocean ridge or associated undersea volcanoes. On top of some of these volcanos, or on shallow ocean platforms, calcareous limey sediments accumulated (forming limestone similar to what is found forming on modern guyots or atolls). Through time, plate tectonic motion transported new oceanic crust into a deeper water setting where radiolarian ooze was deposited.   Exposures of ribbon chert in the Santa Cruz Mountains are inferred to have formed from deep-sea ooze deposited between the Early Jurassic to the middle Cretaceous. The youngest and most common rocks in the Franciscan assemblage are graywacke mudstone, sandstone, and conglomerate. These sedimentary rocks frequently occur interbedded with shale and are interpreted as  sediments having been derived from a volcanic arc and deposited via turbidity currents into a trench or deep water marginal basin offshore.  The chaotic mix of rocks of the Franciscan assemblage completes the geologic history, involving plate-tectonics (crustal formation, migration, subduction, and accretion). Serpentinite forms from the metamorphic alteration and/or remelting of rocks of ultramafic composition (typical of lower oceanic crust or even Earths mantle).   In the process of subduction and continental accretion, oceanic sediments and crust broken into bits ranging from hand specimens to mountain-sized blocks. These rocks were jumbled and crushed into one another, especially along major continental margin fault zones that formed, faded, and reformed through time. Serpentinite is unusual in that it is less dense in composition that its original host (rock consisting mostly of dunite and pyroxenite). Through time serpentinite migrates towards the surface along faults or forming plugs (or intrusions)   that inject upward into the surrounding host rock.                        What is Basalt?        What is Gabbro?        What is Serpentinite?                  Uvaz Reservoir Greenstone: 27    In some locations around the spillway exposure, the basaltic lava has also been partially altered to greenstone. (Greenstone is a field name for a dark-green altered or metamorphosed basic volcanic rock containing the minerals chlorite, epidote, or actinolite.) The rock is also broken by fractures that are filled primarily by calcium carbonate (possibly derived from the recrystallization of the original limey ocean sediment). The outcrop is broken by several small faults, one of which displays apparent offset of the overlying soil profile. This exposure is on the north side of the cut about 100 feet south of the end of the cement spillway. Be sure to check out the composition of the stream gravel in patches along the shore. Gravel bars provide a glimpse of the various rock types derived from in the drainage area. Some of the gravel is reworked from older stream channel and floodplain deposits, now preserved as terraces, and are exposed along the hillsides below the dam.                     What is Greenstone?                  Uvaz Reservoir Pillow Lava: 27    Cross the dam and turn right. Follow the path down to the spot where the concrete spillway ends. In the creek are exposures of relatively unaltered pillow basalt - pillow-shaped pods of basalt formed from the rapid cooling of basaltic lava on the sea floor. Each pillow displays a chilled crust from the molten lava coming in contact with the cold ocean water. Radiometric determinations suggest these rocks formed in the Lower Cretaceous (between 100-130 million years ago). Note that some of the basaltic lava preserves vesicles (gas bubbles) and that in some places, gray, limey mudrock or limestone (or dolostone) fills in around some of the pillows. Both occurrences suggest that the lava formed in relatively shallow ocean depths, probably on a submarine volcano. Under greater ocean depths the confining pressure would prevent gas vesicles from forming in the lava. In addition, calcareous sediments are not preserved in deep ocean settings; organic pelagic remains containing calcium carbonate dissolve rapidly in cold marine water under pressure.                      What is Basalt?        What is Pillow Lava?                            Whipple Mountains Wilderness            Whipple Mountains: 23    The Whipple Mountains lie east to west across this wilderness. The western half of the range is created from pale green formations. A low angle fault separates the formation on the west from striking brick red volcanic  formations to the east.   The landscape is              diverse, ranging from valley  floors and washes to steep- walled              canyons, domed peaks and eroded  spires towering to 4,000 feet.              Flowing westward from these  colorful spires and domes are bajadas              with isolated lava rock  masses and red sandstone outcrops. Sonoran              creosote bush scrub and  the Sonoran thorn forest decorate the area. In              addition, dense stands of  palo verde, ironwood, smoke tree and cholla,              saguaro, foxtail and Mojave  prickly pear cacti all grow here. This unique              array of vegetation support  a variety of wildlife. Location: San Bernardino County; 10 miles              northwest of Parker, Arizona.

U.S. Department of Interior Bureau of Reclamation Dam Safety Office Denver, Colorado September 1999  UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR  BUREAU OF RECLAMATION   A Procedure for Estimating Loss of Life Caused by Dam Failure Wayne J. Graham, P.E. ABSTRACT Risk assessments and other dam safety studies often require that an estimate be made of the number of fatalities that would result from dam failure. To assist in this effort, an extensive evaluation of dam failures and the factors that contributed to loss of life was conducted. Every U.S. dam failure that resulted in more than 50 fatalities and every dam failure that occurred after 1960 resulting in any fatalities was investigated with regard to warning, population at risk (PAR) and number of fatalities. These dam failure data are used to provide a historical perspective of the risk associated with the U.S. dam inventory. Loss of life resulting from dam failure is highly influenced by three factors: 1)The number of people occupying the dam failure flood plain, 2)The amount of warning that is provided to the people exposed to dangerous flooding and 3)The severity of the flooding. The procedure for estimating loss of life due to dam failure relies heavily on data obtained from U.S. dam failures. The procedure is composed of 7 steps: 1) Determine dam failure scenarios to evaluate. 2) Determine time categories for which loss of life estimates are needed. 3) Determine when dam failure warnings would be initiated. 4) Determine area flooded for each dam failure scenario. 5) Estimate the number of people at risk for each dam failure scenario and time category. 6) Apply empirically-based equations or methods for estimating the number of fatalities. 7) Evaluate uncertainty. 1  Hydraulic Engineer, Sedimentation and River Hydraulics Group, Bureau of Reclamation, D-8540, Denver Federal Center, Denver CO 80225-0007.

Some dam failures would cause only minimal impacts to the dam owner and others, while large dams directly above large population centers are capable of causing catastrophic losses. Dam failure can cause loss of life, property damage, cultural and historic losses, environmental losses as well as social impacts. This paper focuses on the loss of life that results from dam failure. Included is a procedure for estimating the loss of life that would result from dam failure. No currently available procedure is capable of predicting the exact number of fatalities that would result from dam failure. SOME SIGNIFICANT DAM FAILURES The world's most catastrophic dam failures occurred in August 1975 in the Zhumadian Prefecture of Henan Province in central China. A typhoon struck, causing reservoirs to swell. Banqiao Dam, 387 ft (118 meters) high, and Shimantan Dam collapsed as did dozens of smaller dams. Millions of people lost their homes. The death toll estimates for these failures varied widely. Approximately 26,000 deaths occurred from drowning in the immediate aftermath of the dam collapses. There were as many as 230,000 deaths if those who died of consequent health epidemics and famine are included. Europe's most catastrophic event associated with a dam occurred at about 2240 hours on October 9, 1963. The event occurred 3 years after the completion of Vajont Dam which is located in northern Italy. A 350 million cu. yard (268 million cu. m.) landslide fell within 20 to 30 seconds into the reservoir formed behind the dam. The dam, at the time the world's second highest, did not fail. However, the effect of this huge mass of material that slid into the reservoir, which was almost at the maximum water level, was a gigantic wave of 40,500 acre-ft (50,000,000 cu. m.) of water that, after rising for 820 ft (250 m) in height, poured both towards the village of Longarone, 1.2 miles (2 km) downstream from the dam, and upstream along the reservoir, flooding the towns of Erto and Casso which were located on the hillsides surrounding the reservoir. About 2,000 people died as a result of this event, with about 1,269 of these occurring in Longarone where the fatality rate was about 94%. At Belluno, about 10 miles (16 km) downstream from Longarone, there was damage to more than 150 houses; luckily, the river dikes in most places prevented spillage into built-up areas. In the downstream valley area, there were few fatalities, even where there was 1   substantial property damage. More recently, Stava Dam, located in northern Italy, failed at about 1220 hours on July 19, 1985. The failure of this mine waste tailings dam resulted in the death of about 90% of the 300 people at risk in the community of Stava which was located about 0.6 mile (1 km) downstream from the dam. The United States has also had major dam failures. Data for failures occurring in the United States are provided in more detail to provide the reader with an enhanced understanding of the relationships between dam failure, flooding, population at risk, warning and loss of life. The dam failure data are then analyzed to show trends and patterns. History shows that the loss of life from dam United States has diminished with the passage the late 1800's and early 1900's, there were failures with considerable loss of life. The resulting from dam failure during the 1980's been very low. The following is a summary of failure in the United States that caused more fatalities: failure in the of time. In several dam loss of life and 1990's has every dam than 50  Williamsburg Dam, also known as the Mill River Dam, Massachusetts, failed at about 0720 hours on Saturday May 16, 1874. The dam was 9 years old when it failed. The dam was earthfill with a masonry core wall. The dam was about 43 ft (13.1 m) high and contained about 307 acre-ft (379,000 cubic meters) of water at the time of failure. The reservoir was about 4 ft (1.2 m) below the dam crest at the time of failure. The failure was caused by seepage which carried away fill leading to embankment sliding and then collapse of the core wall. The failure resulted in about 138 fatalities and about 750 people were homeless. All of the fatalities occurred within the first 7 mi (11 km) downstream from the dam. After observing the dam failure, the dam tender traveled by horseback and began warning people downstream. South Fork Dam, also known as the Johnstown Dam, Pennsylvania, failed at about 1510 hours on May 31, 1889. The dam was 36 years old when it failed. The earthfill dam was 72 ft (21.9 m) high and contained about 11,500 acre-ft (14.2 million cubic meters) of water. The dam failed as a result of overtopping that occurred during a flood caused by a 25-year frequency storm. The failure resulted in about 2,209 deaths, the largest loss of life from any U.S. dam failure. Nearly all of the fatalities occurred within the first 14 mi (22.4 km) downstream from the dam, with most in the town of Johnstown which was 14 mi (22.4 km) downstream from the dam. The number of fatalities was high because 2   portions of the floodplain were densely populated, the flooding destroyed the majority of buildings in downtown Johnstown, and flooding in Johnstown preceding the arrival of dam failure flooding made it difficult for people to respond to the limited dam failure warnings that were issued. The dam tender traveled by horseback to a nearby community about 3 hours before dam failure and a message was then telegraphed to Johnstown describing the danger, but the warning was largely ignored. Less than a year later, Walnut Grove Dam, Arizona, failed at about 0200 hours on February 22, 1890. The dam was 2 years old when it failed. The timber-faced rockfill dam was 110 ft (33.5 m) high and stored 50,000 acre-ft (62 million cubic meters) of water. During the flood, the dam withstood up to 3 ft (0.9 m) of overtopping for up to 6 hours before the dam failed. The failure resulted in between 70 and 100 fatalities. Many of the people who died were located at a construction camp for a lower dam which was about 15 mi (24 km) downstream from Walnut Grove Dam. Attempts were made to reach and warn people at the downstream construction camp. The distance to the construction camp, as well as the adverse weather, prevented the messenger on horseback from reaching the camp before the dam failure flood wave arrived. Austin Dam, Pennsylvania, failed at about 1420 hours on September 30, 1911. The dam was 2 years old when it failed. The dam was variously described as being either 43 ft (13.1 m) or 50 ft (15.2 m) high and the reservoir contained either 550 acre-ft (678,000 cubic meters) or 850 acre-ft (1.05 million cubic meters) of water. The concrete gravity dam failed during normal weather conditions as a result of a weakness in the foundation or in the bond between the foundation and concrete. The failure resulted in at least 78 fatalities all of which occurred in the first 2 mi (3.2 km) downstream from the dam. A person living near the dam, after observing the sudden failure, phoned telephone operators in the community of Austin which was 1.4 mi (2.4 km) downstream from the dam. Saint Francis Dam, California, failed at 2357 hours (about midnight) on March 12-13, 1928. The dam was 2 years old when it failed. The dam was 188 ft (57.3 m high) and the reservoir contained about 38,000 acre-ft (46.9 million cubic meters) of water. The concrete gravity dam failed as a result of structural defects. Weather was normal at the time of the dam failure. The failure resulted in about 420 fatalities. Unlike most of the other U.S. dam failure cases, loss of life did extend for quite some distance downstream from the dam. This perhaps is expected due to the severity of flooding, the larger population centers being quite some distance from the dam, and the darkness and 3   difficulties in warning during the early morning hours. The highest fatality rates, however, were in areas that were close to the dam. For example, at Powerhouse No. 2, located about 1.6 mi (2.6 km) downstream from the dam, the dam failure claimed all of its occupants. In this same area lived the dam tender who also perished in the flood. At the California Edison Construction Camp, located about 17 mi (27 km) downstream from the dam, 89 of the 150 who had been there perished. This is a fatality rate of about 60%. Efforts to warn and evacuate people did not begin until a few hours after the dam failed. The Buffalo Coal Waste Structure, West Virginia, failed at about 0800 hours on February 26, 1972. The structure did not receive the engineering, design, construction and care of a typical dam and is therefore called a structure and not a dam. The structure, begun in 1970, was continually being modified and enlarged as it was a waste pile used to dispose of material extracted during coal mining. The structure was about 46 ft (14.0 m) high and the failure released about 404 acre-ft (498,000 cubic meters) of water. This coal waste pile structure failed as a result of slumping of the structure face during a 2-year frequency rainfall event. There were 125 fatalities, all occurring in the first 15 mi (24 km) downstream. Warning of people exposed to the flooding began after the structure failed; reaction to the warnings was meager because there had been at least 4 previous false alarms. Canyon Lake Dam, South Dakota, failed at about 2245 hours on June 9, 1972. The dam was 39 years old when it failed. The dam was about 20 ft (6.1 m) high and about 700 acre-ft (863,000 cubic meters) of water was released during the dam failure. The dam failed as a result of overtopping experienced during the Black Hills Flash Flood. The peak inflow to the reservoir was about 43,000 ft 3/s (1220 m 3/s) and the peak outflow was about 50,000 ft 3/s (1420 m 3/s). Some warning was issued to floodplain residents but those issuing the warnings did not initially comprehend the magnitude of the imminent flooding, nor was there a general awareness that the dam was going to fail. It is sometimes reported that all of the people that died during the Black Hills Flash Flood were victims of the dam failure. This is not correct. Of the 236 people who died, 35 died in the first 3 mi (4.8 km) upstream from the dam and 36 died in other basins not impacted by the dam failure. Approximately 165 of the fatalities occurred downstream from Canyon Lake Dam. Many of these people would have died even if the dam had not failed (or had not existed) due to the catastrophic nature of the flooding. Major flooding in Rapid City would have occurred without dam failure. The exact number of people who died as a direct result of the failure of Canyon 4   Lake Dam, i.e, the incremental loss of life, will never be known. It is estimated that the failure of Canyon Lake Dam resulted in 33 fatalities. This estimate is based on the assumption that the incremental loss of life downstream from Canyon Lake Dam caused by dam failure was 20% of the total loss of life downstream from the dam caused by the flood.

During the period 1960 through 1998, there were more than 300 fatalities resulting from dam failures in the United States. Failure of dams less than 15 meters high (dams too small to be included in the International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD) Register of Dams) caused 88% of the total number of deaths occurring during this time period. There are certain types of dam failures that have occurred infrequently and thus information on these types of failures and the consequences that would result from these failures is deficient. These failures would include concrete dams, high embankment dams or any type of dam failing as a result of an earthquake. Surprising as it may seem, most dam failures in the United States have not resulted in fatalities. During the 9-year period from late 1985 to late 1994 there were more than 400 dam failures in the United States. Most of these dams were small and many were unregulated. These dam failures resulted in only 10 fatalities. There were no fatalities from more than 98% of the dams that failed during this time period. It should be noted that many of the 400 dams were small, probably not large enough to be included in the National Inventory of Dams data base. In addition, many of these dams were probably either not classified with regard to hazard potential or classified as low or significant hazard potential dams. Less stringent safety standards usually apply to low and significant hazard dams. Some interesting and relevant observations were developed from the 1960-1998 dam failure data shown in Table 1: Failure of dams less than 20 ft (6.1 m) high caused 2% of the deaths. Failure of dams between 20 ft (6.1 m) and 49 ft (15 m) high caused 86% of the deaths. Failure of dams less than 49 ft (15 m) high caused 88% of the deaths. These dams are not high enough to be included in the ICOLD inventory. There were 5 or less fatalities in 65% of the dam failure events that had fatalities. Failure of (5.2 sq km) Failure of (26 sq km) dams with drainage areas less than 2 sq mi caused 47% of the deaths. dams with drainage areas less than 10 sq mi caused 75% of the deaths.  9   Based on knowledge of the location of victims in 16 of the 23 dam failures (representing 87% of the fatalities) that occurred during the 39-year period from 1960-1998: 50% of the fatalities occurred 3 mi (4.8 km) or less from a dam that failed. More than 99% of the fatalities occurred 15 mi (24 km) or less from a dam that failed. PREDICTING CONSEQUENCES OF DAM FAILURE Loss of life sometimes results from dam failure. Loss of life is likely if a dam fails without warning and the failure produces flooding that destroys residential structures. Procedures for estimating loss of life have appeared in several documents. A good summary of these procedures is found in ""Predicting Loss of Life in Cases of Dam Failure and Flash Flood,"" by DeKay and McClelland, 1993. Reclamation has prepared procedures for estimating loss of life and these are contained in ""Guidelines to Decision Analysis,"" published in 1986 and in ""Policy and Procedures for Dam Safety Modification Decisionmaking,"" published in 1989. The procedure presented herein, which includes an explicit procedure for estimating when a dam failure warning would be initiated, incorporates information from the two Reclamation documents as well as, ""A Procedure for Estimating Loss of Life Due to Dam Failure,"" presented at the 1997 (U.S) Association of State Dam Safety Officials Annual Conference. Procedures for estimating loss of life have also been developed by personnel at British Columbia Hydropower. The procedure is documented in a December 1996 Risk Assessment Report for Hugh Keenleyside Dam. The procedure evaluates the spacial and temporal location of flooding caused by dam failure, the number of people at risk at different locations and times, the time required for warning to be issued and spread to those at risk, the time required for people to begin taking action, the time required for people to escape and the probability that a person caught by the flood water would become a fatality. This procedure is logically sound, but at this time, there are not sufficient data to establish values of the various parameters and their relationship to one another. It is important to determine the incremental consequence of dam failure. The incremental consequence of dam failure is the additional loss or damage caused by dam failure compared to the event occurring without dam failure. For a dam failure occurring from an earthquake, the incremental consequence would be the additional loss caused by flooding over and above the loss caused by the earthquake. For a dam 10   failure caused by a major flood, the incremental consequence would be the additional loss caused by the dam failure over and above the loss that would have occurred if the dam and reservoir had passed the reservoir inflow without failing. Factors Influencing Loss of Life Resulting from Dam Failure Several factors will determine the number of fatalities resulting from dam failure. Included among these are the: Cause and type of dam failure. Number of people at risk. Timeliness of dam failure warnings. Flood depths and velocities in the downstream floodplain prior to dam failure. Flood depths and velocities resulting from dam failure. Availability of sensory clues (sight of floodwater or sounds created by rushing floodwater) to the people at risk. Time of day, day of week and time of year of failure. Weather, including air and water temperature. Activity in which people are engaged. General health of people threatened by floodwater. Type of structure in which people are located. Ease of evacuation. The number of fatalities resulting from dam failure is most influenced by three of the factors described above. These factors are: 1)The number of people occupying the dam failure flood plain, 2)The amount of warning provided to the people exposed to dangerous flooding, and 3)The severity of the flooding. Without exception, dam failures that have caused high fatality rates were those in which residences were destroyed and timely dam failure warnings were not issued. Two examples that show the importance of timely dam failure warning are as follows: Teton Dam, located near Wilford, Idaho, failed at about noon on June 5, 1976. At the time of the failure, the sky was sunny or partly cloudy and the air temperature was a survivable 81 degrees F (27 degrees C). More than 3,000 homes were damaged and more than 700 homes were destroyed. Failure of the dam resulted in flood related injuries to more than 800 people and the death of 11 of the 25,000 people at risk. Failure occurred during the day, warnings to downstream areas commenced about 1 hour and 15 minutes prior to dam failure, and most people were able to evacuate before the house-destroying flood water arrived. The number of fatalities with less warning would have been much higher. For instance, failure of this dam at 3 a.m. probably would 11   have been accompanied by no dam failure warnings and would have resulted in the loss of hundreds of lives. Laurel Run Dam, located near Johnstown, Pennsylvania, failed in 1977. (Western Pennsylvania has seen 3 major dam failure events: South Fork Dam Failure, Austin Dam Failure and Laurel Run Dam Failure). Failure of this 42 ft (12.8 m) high dam claimed the lives of 40 of the 150 people at risk. Failure occurred at night when most people were asleep and dam failure warnings were not issued in the narrow 3 mi (4.8 km) long valley downstream from the dam. In addition, escape was surely hampered by the rain, lightning and darkness that accompanied the arrival of dam failure flooding. The number of fatalities probably would have been near zero if warnings had been issued to the people in the valley prior to dam failure. A dam failure during the day will likely cause fewer fatalities than one occurring at night, all other things being equal. The daytime failure will probably be discovered earlier in the failure process and dam failure warnings would likely be issued earlier than if the failure occurred at night. In addition, during the day, news media and public safety agencies are staffed at higher levels, people are awake and people can see or hear the approaching flood water which in itself is a warning or warning confirmation. Sources of Uncertainty It is difficult to give a precise estimate of the loss of life that would occur from a dam failure for the following reasons: The time of dam failure (day, week, season), conditions existing at the time of failure (clear, rain, snow, darkness) and the number of people at risk at the time of dam failure (seasonal recreational usage, special events) are either unknown or can only be estimated. It is not known exactly when a dam failure warning message would be given. Experience indicates that there is sometimes a reluctance to issue dam failure warnings. Examples include the failure to issue warnings before the Buffalo Creek Coal Waste Structure failure in West Virginia, as well as the delay in initiating the dam failure warnings at Teton Dam in Idaho. The operating procedures or emergency plans that may be available for a dam should provide some guidance regarding when a warning would be issued. There is no assurance, however, that a warning would be initiated as directed in a plan. A study investigating loss of life from dam failure can be used to 12   highlight weaknesses in the dam failure warning process and provide some guidance on how improvements in the process would reduce the loss of life. The procedure for estimating loss of life Even if the time of the failure, conditions time of failure, number of people at risk, which warnings are initiated are known with will be error in the loss of life estimate. is not precise. existing at the and the time at certainty, there  PROCEDURE FOR ESTIMATING LOSS OF LIFE The procedure for estimating loss of life can be broken into various steps. Briefly, the steps are as follows: Step 1: Determine dam failure scenarios to evaluate. Step 2: Determine time categories for which loss of life estimates are needed. Step 3: Determine when dam failure warnings would be initiated. Step 4: Determine area flooded for each dam failure scenario. Step 5: Estimate the number of people at risk for each failure scenario and time category. Step 6: Apply empirically based equations or method for estimating fatalities. Step 7: Evaluate uncertainty. The steps are now given in more detail. Step 1: Determine Dam Failure Scenarios to Evaluate A determination needs to be made regarding the failure modes to evaluate. For example, loss of life estimates may be needed for two scenarios - failure of the dam with a full reservoir during normal weather conditions and failure of the dam during a large flood that overtops the dam. Step 2: Determine Time Categories For Which Loss of Life Estimates Are Needed The number of people at risk downstream from some dams is influenced by seasonality or day of week factors. For instance, campgrounds may be unused in the winter and heavily used in the summer, especially summer weekends. The number of time categories (season, day of week, etc.) evaluated should display the varying usage of the floodplain and corresponding number of people at risk. Since time of day can influence both when a warning is initiated as well as the number of people at risk, each study should include a day category and a night category for each dam failure scenario evaluated. 13   Step 3: Determine When Dam Failure Warnings Would be Initiated Determining when dam failure warnings would be initiated is probably the most important part of estimating the loss of life that would result from dam failure. Table 2, ""Guidance for Estimating When Dam Failure Warnings Would be Initiated,"" was prepared using data from U.S. dam failures occurring since 1960 as well as other events such as Vajont Dam in Italy, Malpasset Dam in France and Saint Francis Dam in California. An evaluation of these dam failure data indicated that timely dam failure warnings were more likely when the dam failure occurred during daylight, in the presence of a dam tender or others and where the drainage area above the dam was large or the reservoir had space for flood storage. Timely dam failure warnings were less likely when failure occurred at night or outside the presence of a dam tender or casual observers. Dam failure warnings were also less likely where the drainage area was small or the reservoir had little or no space for flood storage, i.e, when the reservoir was able to quickly fill and overtop the dam. Although empirical data are limited, it appears that timely warning is less likely for the failure of a concrete dam. Although dam failure warnings are frequently initiated before dam failure for earthfill dams, this is not the case for the failure of concrete dams. Table 2, ""Guidance for Estimating When Dam Failure Warnings Would be Initiated (Earthfill Dam),"" provides a means for deriving an initial estimate of when a dam failure warning would likely be initiated. Guidance has not been provided for the failure of a concrete dam. Estimates for concrete dams must be developed on a case-by-case basis. The use of Table 2, combined with information obtained from any operating or emergency procedure for the dam, should answer the question, ""When will a dam failure warning be initiated?"" It is easily seen using Table 2 that the amount of dam failure warning for a particular dam will be different based on cause of failure and time at which the failure occurs. The availability of emergency action plans, upstream or damsite instrumentation, or the requirement for on-site monitoring during threatening events influences when a dam failure warning would be initiated. Assumptions regarding when a warning is initiated should take these and other risk-reduction actions and programs into account.  14   Table 2 Guidance for Estimating When Dam Failure Warnings Would be Initiated (Earthfill Dam) Dam Type Cause of Failure Special Considerations Drainage area at dam less than 2 100 mi2 (260 km ) Drainage area at dam less than 2 100 mi2 (260 km ) Drainage area at dam more than 2 100 mi2 (260 km ) Drainage area at dam more than 2 100 mi2 (260 km ) Time of Failure Day When Would Dam Failure Warning be Initiated?

""No Observers at Dam"" means that there is no dam tender out of site of nearly all homes and there is no roadway on the dam crest. These dams areas. The abbreviation ""fw"" stands for floodwater.   Step 4: Determine Area Flooded for Each Dam Failure Scenario In order to estimate the number of people at risk, a map or some other description of the flooded area must be available for each dam failure scenario. In some cases, new dam-break studies may need to be prepared. However, existing maps should be used as much as possible to reduce study costs. Judgements will have to be made whether currently published or draft inundation maps reflect the flooding from the various failure scenarios for which loss of life estimates are needed. For instance, a dam failure inundation map based on a failure caused by dam overtopping may not accurately depict the flooding caused by a piping failure with a much lower reservoir level. Analyses based on the use of dam failure inundation studies and maps leads to uncertainty. Dam break modeling requires the estimation of: 1) The time for the breach to form, 2) Breach shape and width and 3) Downstream hydraulic parameters. Variations in estimates of these parameters can result in changes in flood width, flood depth and flood wave travel time. This can lead to uncertainty in the: 1) Population at risk, 2) Warning time and 3) Flood severity. Step 5: Estimate the Number of People at Risk for Each Failure Scenario and Time Category For each failure scenario and time category, determine the number of people at risk. Population at risk (PAR) is defined as the number of people occupying the dam failure floodplain prior to the issuance of any warning. A general guideline it to: ""Take a snapshot and count the people."" The number of people at risk varies throughout the day. The PAR will likely vary depending upon the time of year, day of week and time of day during which the failure occurs. Utilize census data, field trips, aerial photographs, telephone interviews, topographic maps and any other sources that would provide a realistic estimate of floodplain occupancy and usage. Within the Bureau of Reclamation, the Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Group (GIS) can provide products that assist with the estimation of the population at risk. The GIS Group has the capability of estimating population using 1990 population and employment census information in combination with available inundation maps. Caution must be exercised because the 1990 data may not reflect current conditions. In using products from the GIS Group one must recognize that recreationists, campers and other nonpermanent occupants are not counted in population census data. Similarly, it is important that double counting not 16   take place. Centers of employment fill as housing units empty and vice versa. It is important to understand the methods used by the GIS Group to mesh flood boundaries with census block data. There is uncertainty in the methods and hence in the population at risk estimates. Step 6: Apply Empirically-Based Equations or Method for Estimating the Number of Fatalities Various methods have been suggested for estimating loss of life based on measures of population at risk, warning time and other factors. For background purposes, the Brown and Graham as well as the DeKay and McClelland methods are described. It is recommended that these methods be abandoned and replaced with a new flood severity based method for estimating loss of life. This new method is described in detail. Knowledge gained in the 1980's and 1990's regarding the interrelationship between warning, flood lethality and the number of people at risk allowed the development of procedures to estimate the loss of life resulting from dam failure. It was found that loss of life is highly related to the warning issued to the people at risk. The lethality of flooding (which is a function of flood depth and velocity) is also a major factor, especially in those cases where warnings are not issued or when people are warned but fail to evacuate. Two different papers were prepared that provided procedures for estimating loss of life from dam failure. In 1988, Brown and Graham published, ""Assessing Threat to Life from Dam Failure."" In 1993, DeKay and McClelland published, ""Predicting Loss of Life in Cases of Dam Failures and Flash Floods."" A summary of the procedures, and loss of life estimating equations presented by each pair of authors is presented below. The Brown and Graham procedure uses equations that were derived from the analysis of 24 dam failures and major flash floods, shown in Table 3. The concepts contained in the Brown and Graham paper were incorporated into Reclamation's ""Policy and Procedures for Dam Safety Modification Decisionmaking"" (1989) and equations from this document are presented below. Warning time used in the equations is defined as the elapsed time between the initiation of an official evacuation warning to the public and the arrival of dangerous flooding at the population at risk. Warning time must therefore consider the time it takes for flood water to reach the community or group of people at risk. 17   When warning time is less than 15 minutes: Loss of Life = .5(PAR) When warning time is between 15 and 90 minutes: Loss of Life = PAR .6 When warning time is more than 90 minutes: Loss of Life = .0002(PAR) It can easily be seen that the loss of life estimated using these relationships will vary widely depending upon the warning. With 5000 people at risk, loss of life from dam failure could be as much as 2500 people if these people are located in an area that receives less than 15 minutes of warning. The loss of life would only be 1 if the people are located in an area that receives more than 90 minutes of warning.  18   Table 3 Dam failures and Floods used by Brown and Graham  Source: ""Assessing the Threat to Life from Dam Failure,"" published in Water Resources Bulletin , Vol. 24, No. 6, December, 1988.  19   DeKay and McClelland, supported by funding received from the Bureau of Reclamation, expanded on the work begun by Brown and Graham. They submitted the report entitled ""Setting Decision Thresholds for Dam Failure Warnings: A Practical Theory-Based Approach"" to Reclamation on December 31, 1991. In 1993 they published ""Predicting Loss of Life in Cases of Dam Failure and Flash Flood"" in the publication Risk Analysis . The events used by DeKay and McClelland, shown in Table 4, are the same as those used by Brown and Graham. DeKay and McClelland also included a few events that were not used by Brown and Graham. The DeKay and McClelland procedure demonstrated that loss of life is related to the number of people at risk in a nonlinear fashion. They also found that loss of life is greater in situations where the flood waters are deep and swift. DeKay and McClelland have a separate equation for high and low force conditions. Their equation, as it appears in Risk Analysis , for high force conditions, i.e., where 20% or more of flooded residences are either destroyed or heavily damaged is: Deaths = PAR ---------------------------------------------1 + 13.277(PAR 0.440)e[2.982(WT) - 3.790]  Their equation for low lethality conditions, i.e., where less than 20% of flooded residences are either destroyed or heavily damaged is: Deaths = PAR ----------------------------------------------1 + 13.277(PAR 0.440)e[0.759(WT)]  where PAR is the number of people at risk and WT is warning time in hours. Warning time (WT), as used by Dekay and McClelland, is the time in hours from the initiation of dam failure warning until the dam failure floodwater reaches a community or other group of people. Warning time must therefore consider the time it takes for flood water to reach the community or group of people. When dam failure warnings do not precede the arrival of dam failure flooding in an area, WT would be zero. A negative warning time should not be used in these equations. A major difference and McClelland and time is treated as McClelland; whereas and placed warning between the procedure developed by DeKay that of Brown and Graham is that warning a continuous variable by DeKay and Brown and Graham utilized discrete bins time into 2 or 3 categories.  DeKay and McClelland cautioned against using their equations for dams that fail without warning above areas with very large populations at risk. They also stated that their 20   equations should not be applied to cases like Vajont, in which a massive landslide displaced nearly the entire contents of a reservoir. The Brown and Graham procedure as well as the DeKay and McClelland procedure both conclude that loss of life is much greater in those areas that receive little warning compared to those areas that receive more than an hour or so of warning. The value of adequate dam failure warning in reducing loss of life from dam failure can not be overemphasized.  21   Table 4 Dam Failures and Floods used by DeKay and McClelland  Source: ""Predicting Loss of Life in Cases of Dam Failure and Flash Flood,"" published in Risk Analysis , Vol. 13, No. 2, 1993.  22   Limitations of Loss of Life Estimating Equations The empirical data set used by Brown and Graham, and DeKay and McClelland, in developing the loss of life estimating equations did not include some types of events and warning scenarios. Most of the dams in the data set were smaller structures. Only 7 of the dams used in developing the equations were more than 49 ft (15 m) high. The data set included many more earthfill dams than concrete dams. The data set included no dams that failed due to an earthquake. The equations may not be applicable for use with dam sizes, dam types, failure causes, flood severity and warning scenarios not reflected in the data set. Most notably under represented in the empirical data set used by Brown and Graham, and DeKay and McClelland, were events that caused severe flooding, either with or without warning. As a result, the equation for high lethality is deficient when used to predict life loss for dam failures that result in truly catastrophic flooding. The following example explains this problem in more detail: St. Francis Dam, a concrete structure located north of Los Angeles, failed at about midnight, March 12-13, 1928. Warnings did NOT precede dam failure. Within a period of just a few minutes, the area immediately downstream from the dam changed from one of no flooding to one where the flood covered the valley floor to a depth of nearly 100 ft (30 m). Imagine rapidly moving water, with a depth as high as a ten story tall building, battering a typical campsite, mobile home or single family house! There were not many people living immediately downstream from the dam; if there had been, the loss of life from this dam failure would have been much greater. Assume for a moment that there had been 10,000 people living near the river in the first few miles downstream from the dam. The DeKay and McClelland equation for high lethality and a warning time of zero predicts a life loss of about 550 people, which is a fatality rate of slightly less than 6%. This seems far too low for this situation. A fatality rate of 80 to 100% would be more appropriate for flooding of this type, a rate that is similar to what happened in Longarone, located a short distance downstream from Vajont Dam in Italy. The DeKay and McClelland equation for high lethality and no warning results in a fatality rate of 55% if 10 people are at risk but only 5.5% if 10,000 people are at risk. A similar problem exists if it is assumed that a warning goes out a few hours before dam failure. Reclamation has generally assumed that the loss of life would be about 1 person for every 5,000 at risk if the warning is issued to the risk area at least 1.5 hours before flooding occurs in the area. Such a small fatality rate probably is not 23   realistic with very catastrophic flooding. The loss of life is going to be directly related to the number of people who do not receive the warning or ignore the warning and remain in the risk area. The same percentage (80 to 100%) of the people remaining would likely become fatalities if exposed to the type and severity of flooding that occurred immediately downstream from St. Francis Dam or Vajont Dam. It may be very difficult to determine how many people will not evacuate. If a warning does not reach people or if people do not believe the warning or if they do not believe that their life is at risk, then these people are more likely to remain in the danger area. When Brown and Graham originally developed their life loss estimating equations, they thought that it was logical for the fatality rate (the number of fatalities as a fraction of the population at risk) to decrease as the population at risk increased. The assumption was that as the population increased, or became more dense, warning and communication facilities would be more advanced. Probably what was observed, unknowingly, is that as the population at risk increased, the area under consideration was increasing in size and was therefore including areas where the flooding was less lethal. The Brown and Graham as well as the DeKay and McClelland data bases probably contain many cases demonstrating that there is an inverse relation between population at risk and flood lethality. This means that as the population at risk increased, the flood lethality (or flood severity) decreased. Large populations do not fit into narrow canyons - hence larger populations are situated in the flatter areas where the lethality is usually reduced. Some questions regarding the validity of the equations developed by Brown and Graham as well as Dekay and McClelland remain. Do the equations give accurate results when large numbers of people are exposed to truly catastrophic flooding? Should the fatality rate vary so much for different population sizes? Does adequate warning time result in low fatality rates? - Or is adequate warning most likely to occur for benign floods and these floods are not very lethal, regardless of the warning? Some Floods are Benign While others are Catastrophic Dam failure can result in flooding that can be broadly divided into 3 damage categories: low, medium and high. The first would be where homes are flooded but not destroyed. Even without any warning, the fatality rate for dam failures that cause this type of flooding is often 0% and almost always less than 1%. Many of the dam failures that resulted in flooding described by DeKay and McClelland as having a ""low force"" would fit this category. Many of the more than 24   400 dams that failed in the United States from 1985 to 1994 would also fit this category. The second type of flooding resulting from dam failure is that which causes the destruction of homes and businesses. Trees and some homes remain and these trees or rooftops may provide temporary refuge until the flooding recedes. Without warning, the fatality rates for dam failures causing this type of flooding have ranged from a few percent up to about 25% or more. Dam failures that resulted in flooding described by DeKay and McClelland as having a ""high force"" would fit this category. The third type of flooding is that which occurs very suddenly and is truly of catastrophic magnitude. The floodplain is swept clean. Houses are crushed, washed away and there is little or no trace of their prior existence when the flood water recedes. The landslide-generated wave at Vajont Dam, Italy caused this type of flooding in Longarone. The failure of Stava Dam in Italy and St. Francis Dam in California also caused this type of flooding immediately downstream from each structure. Mine tailings dams and concrete dams seem to have the capability of producing this type of flooding due to the short failure times for these dams. Without warning, the fatality rates for dam failures causing this type of flooding have ranged from about 50% up to about 100% for areas immediately downstream from the dam. FLOOD SEVERITY BASED METHOD FOR ESTIMATING LIFE LOSS Recognizing weaknesses in the Brown and Graham, and the DeKay and McClelland equations, a new method for estimating life loss has been developed. The method still uses results from steps 1-5; only the process for determining the loss of life based on the population at risk has changed. The method developed provides recommended fatality rates based on the flood severity, amount of warning and a measure of whether people understand the severity of the flooding. This new method was developed using an enlarged data set which totaled approximately 40 floods, many of which were caused by dam failure. The 40 floods include the data used by Brown and Graham, Dekay and McClelland, nearly all U.S. dam failures causing 50 or more fatalities, and other flood events that were selected in an attempt to cover a full range of flood severity, warning and flood severity understanding combinations. The following paragraphs describe the terms and categories that form the basis for this methodology.  25   Flood Severity along with warning time determines, to a large extent, the fatality rate that would likely occur. The flood severity categories are as follows: 1) Low severity occurs when no buildings are washed off their foundations. 2) Medium severity occurs when homes are destroyed or mangled homes remain for people to seek refuge 3) High severity occurs when the flood sweeps the and nothing remains. Although rare, this type of occurred below St. Francis Dam and Vajont Dam. but trees in or on. area clean flooding  Warning Time is the other factor that is important in determining the fatality rate. The warning time categories are as follows: 1) No warning means or official sources flood water arrival; approaching flooding that no warning is issued by the media in the particular area prior to the only the possible sight or sound of the serves as a warning. media begin warning before flood water flooding indirectly relatives.  2) Some warning means officials or the in the particular area 15 to 60 minutes arrival. Some people will learn of the when contacted by friends, neighbors or 3) Adequate warning means warning in the particular the flood water arrives. flooding indirectly when relatives.  officials or the media begin area more than 60 minutes before Some people will learn of the contacted by friends, neighbors or  Flood Severity Understanding is the last factor that has an impact on the fatality rate. The relative understanding of the flood severity is a function of the distance or time from the dam failure or the source and origination of flooding. The farther one is from the source of the flooding, the greater the likelihood that the warning will be precise and accurate. This is because people have seen the flooding in upstream areas, they understand the damage potential of the flooding and the warnings are adjusted to reflect the actual danger. Similarly, the people receiving the warning should obtain a better understanding of the danger to which they are exposed. A warning of potential flooding, before it actually occurs (because a dam has not yet failed or during a flash flood in which the true flood magnitude is often not known until after the event is over), may not be understood by the warning issuers and would therefore be difficult to describe. Recipients of this warning will therefore not get an accurate picture of the  26   flooding about to occur and may not evacuate at all or not as quickly as they should. This factor will come into consideration only when there is some or adequate warning. The flood severity understanding categories are as follows: 1) Vague Understanding of Flood Severity means that the warning issuers have not yet seen an actual dam failure or do not comprehend the true magnitude of the flooding. 2) Precise Understanding of Flood Severity means that the warning issuers have an excellent understanding of the flooding due to observations of the flooding made by themselves or others. Summarizing, flood severity can have 3 categories, warning time can have 3 categories, and flood severity understanding can have 2 categories. Flood severity understanding does not apply when there is no warning. There are therefore 15 different combinations possible. Table 5 shows the 40 flood events placed in the categories corresponding to the definitions given above. For each flood event evaluated, a determination was made regarding the flood severity category, warning time category and flood severity understanding category that most accurately described the situation at a particular location. Some floods are listed more than once, so from the 40 flood events evaluated, 50 individual entries were made. As an example, Baldwin Hills Dam had approximately 100 people in an area that had medium flood severity, adequate warning and precise flood severity understanding. Baldwin Hills Dam also had 16,400 people in an area that had low flood severity, adequate warning and precise flood severity understanding. Baldwin Hills Dam, therefore, is listed twice in Table 5. Some categories, such as low severity, adequate warning, have many different entries included in Table 5. This is because there have been many cases where warnings have been issued for benign floods. Some categories, such as high flood severity, some or adequate warning, have no entries. This is because warnings have not been issued prior to the failure of dams like St. Francis or Malpasset, or prior to the non-failure catastrophic flood that originated from the landslide generated wave at Vajont Dam. Table 6, ""Fatality Rates Derived from Case Studies,"" summarizes data from the case studies evaluated. The table contains the fatality rates for the events presented in Table 5. Values presented include the average of the fatality rates for each category as well as the range. As 27   an example, if there were 3 cases for one particular category, and the fatality rates were 0.01, 0.09 and 0.11, the average was shown as .07 and the range was shown as 0.01 to 0.11.  28   @ U 6 S  ` U D G 6 U 6 A   ""    $     %    '     (    # (            T C U 6 @ 9   $  #  ( '      ! !   & !

The fatality rates shown in Table 7 were derived from those shown in Table 6. Some changes were made in preparing Table 7 from Table 6 so that there was a consistent pattern in the fatality rates. The changes were based on judgement rather than any statistical analysis of the data. The suggested fatality rate range shown in Table 7 does not always capture the full range shown in Table 6. For those categories in which there were few or no cases, judgement was used in estimating a fatality rate and in developing a suggested range. In determining whether the flood severity is low, medium or high, use the following guidance: 1) Use low severity for locations where no buildings are washed off their foundation. 2) Use medium severity for locations where homes are destroyed but trees or mangled homes remain for people to seek refuge in or on. 3) Use high flood severity only for locations flooded by the near instantaneous failure of a concrete dam, or an earthfill dam that turns into ""jello"" and goes out in seconds rather than minutes or hours. In addition, the flooding caused by the dam failure should sweep the area clean and little or no evidence of the prior human habitation remains after the floodwater recedes. Nearly all of the events used in defining this category caused very deep floodwater that reached its ultimate height in just a few minutes. The flood severity will usually change to medium and then low as the floodwater travels farther downstream. 4) In determining whether flooding is low severity or medium severity, use low severity if most of the structures will be exposed to depths of less than 10 feet and medium severity if most of the structures will be exposed to depths of 10 feet or more. (Note that low severity flooding can be quite deadly to people attempting to drive vehicles).  35   Another method that can be used to separate low severity flooding from medium severity flooding is to use the parameter DV where: DV = And: Qdf is the discharge at a particular site caused by dam failure. Q2.33 is the mean annual discharge at the same site. This discharge can be easily estimated and it is an indicator of the safe channel capacity. As discharges increase above this value, there is a greater chance that it will cause overbank flooding. Wdf is the maximum width of flooding caused by dam failure at the same site. The units of DV is d 2/s or depth times velocity, thus the term DV. Although the parameter DV is not representative of the depth and velocity at any particular structure, it is representative of the general level of destructiveness that would be caused by the flooding. The parameter DV should provide a good indication of the severity (potential lethality) of the flooding. As the peak discharge from dam failure increases, the value of DV increases. As the width of the area flooding narrows, the value of DV again increases. Low flood severity should be assumed, in general, when DV is less than 50 ft 2/s (4.6 m 2/s). Medium flood severity should be assumed, in general, when DV is more than this value. The warning time for a particular area downstream from a dam should be based on when a dam failure warning is initiated and the flood travel time. For instance, assume a dam with a campground immediately downstream and a town where flooding begins 4 hours after the initiation of dam failure. If a dam failure warning is initiated 1 hour after dam failure, the warning time at the campground is zero and the warning time at the town is 3 hours. The preponderance of dam failure data indicates that a high percentage of life loss resulting from dam failure occurs in the first 15 mi (25 km) downstream from a dam that has failed. For smaller dams this distance is considerably less than 15 mi (25 km). Loss of life, as a percentage of people at risk, becomes very small more than 15 mi (25 km) 36 Qdf -Q2.33 -----------Wdf   downstream from a dam for two main reasons. First, these downstream areas receive warning that usually is much better than the warning, if any, issued in areas nearer the dam; and second, the energy exhibited by the flood is lessened, the flood rises at a slower rate and the leading edge of the flooding usually moves at a slower rate in these downstream areas. Based on these empirical data and recognizing that the failure of some large dams could result in loss of life patterns or characteristics that are not observable with this same data base, loss of life studies should extend downstream from a dam for 30 mi (50 km). There may be some very high dams, or those storing very large quantities of water, where severe flooding could extend for 100 miles (161 km) or more downstream from the dam. In these cases, loss of life studies may be extended more than 30 mi (50 km) downstream from the dam. In general, however, life loss more than 30 mi (50 km) downstream from a dam should be very small compared to the life loss estimated for the areas nearer the dam. It is not anticipated that the life loss downstream from mile 30 (50 km) would change the results of a dam safety recommendation.  37   Table 7 Recommended Fatality Rates for Estimating Loss of Life Resulting from Dam Failure  Flood Severity  Warning Time (minutes)  Flood Severity Understanding  Fatality Rate (Fraction of people at risk expected to die) Suggested Suggested Range 0.30 to 1.00  no warning 15 to 60 HIGH more than 60  not applicable vague precise vague  0.75  precise no warning 15 to 60 MEDIUM more than 60 precise no warning 15 to 60 LOW more than 60 precise precise vague not applicable vague precise vague not applicable vague  Use the values shown above and apply to the number of people who remain in the dam failure floodplain after warnings are issued.

In order to estimate loss of life for these events, there is a need to determine the number of people who will remain in the dam failure floodplain after warnings are issued. At this time, no guidance is being provided on this topic. Medium Severity flooding results in a wide range of fatality rates, especially when there is no warning. Factors that influence this range would include: do some people evacuate in response to environmental clues, are people awake, is it night and is it raining? Laurel Run and Kelly Barnes dam failures both had high fatality rates and in each case the events occurred at night and no knowledge of impending dam failure was available to people at risk. The Heppner, Oregon Disaster, with the highest fatality rate, was a very unusual case. A USGS Water Supply Paper stated, ""It seems almost incredible that a flood of a depth of only 5 feet above the general level of the town should cause such a loss of life....Nearly all of the houses simply rested on posts or open foundations of stone....So they lifted off their foundations and floated away like boats."" The USGS learned that ""No building that can be lifted from its foundation and swept away should be allowed in the area of a possible flood."" - The beginnings of floodplain management concepts, nearly 100 years ago! Low Severity flooding results in low fatality rates, regardless of the quantity and quality of warnings. The people writing about these floods at the time frequently commented on the low fatality rates. Examples include: Kansas River Flood of 1951: ""And the wonder is that the death list was not longer."" Hurricane Agnes flooding of 1972: ""The death toll of 117 was light considering the severity of the widespread floods."" Phoenix area flooding of 1980: ""Three people died in Arizona, a surprisingly low number considering the magnitude of the damage."" Using the recommended fatality rates based on the flood severity, warning time and flood severity understanding, can produce results much different than the results obtained with the Brown and Graham or DeKay and McClelland equations. For instance, take a community of 10,000 people exposed to medium severity flooding with 1.5 hours of warning. The Brown and Graham equations predicts 2 fatalities and the DeKay and McClelland equation for high lethality predicts about 7 fatalities. The fatality rate in Table 7 for precise warning issued more than 60 minutes before flood arrival results in a predicted 100 fatalities.  39   The fatality rate in areas with medium severity flooding should drop below that recommended in Table 7 as the warning time increases well beyond one hour. Repeated dam failure warnings, confirmed by visual images on television showing massive destruction in upstream areas, should provide convincing evidence to people that a truly dangerous situation exists and of their need to evacuate. This should result in higher evacuation rates in downstream areas and in a lowering of the fatality rate. Step 7: Evaluate Uncertainty Estimating loss of life from dam failure is an art as much as it is a science. There may never be a procedure available that will provide precise and accurate estimates of the loss of life that results from failure. There are various types of uncertainty that can influence loss of life estimates. One type of uncertainty deals with the cause of dam failure. Step 1 of this procedure suggests that separate loss of life estimates be developed for each failure cause of interest. Various causes of dam failure will result in differences in downstream flooding and therefore result in differences in the number of people at risk as well as the severity of the flooding. Dam failure modeling, which serves as a basis for developing dam failure flood boundaries, flood severity and flood wave travel times, is also fraught with many types of estimates and uncertainty. Another type of uncertainty, generally random in nature, is the time of day, time of week and time of year that failure occurs. Step 2 of this procedure suggests once again that separate loss of life estimates be developed for various possible combinations. The time at which warning is initiated and the number of people at risk may depend upon the time at which failure occurs. Additional uncertainty is associated with when warnings would be initiated. Step 3 and Table 2 provide guidance on when warnings would be initiated. Other warning scenarios may be equally or more likely. Uncertainty associated with warning initiation can be evaluated by varying the assumption regarding when a warning would be initiated. The last type of uncertainty is associated with the inability to precisely determine the fatality rate. There was uncertainty associated with categorizing some of the flood events that are included in Table 5. Similarly, some of the factors that contribute to life loss are not captured in the categories shown in Tables 6 and 7. This type of uncertainty can introduce significant, but unknown, errors into the loss of life estimates. Some possible ways of handling this uncertainty would be to 1) use the range of 40   fatality rates shown in Table 7, 2) when the flooding at a particular area falls between two categories (it is unclear if the flood severity would be medium or low, for example) the loss of life estimates can be developed using the fatality rate and range of rates from all categories touched by the event and 3) the events cataloged in table 5 can be evaluated to see if there are any that closely match the situation at the site under study. SUMMARY The procedure described herein provides a method for estimating the loss of life resulting from dam failure. The procedure was developed using data from about 40 floods, many of which were caused by dam failure. The procedure suggests that fatality estimates be developed for different failure causes and for different times of the day, week or year. The procedure contains guidance on when a dam failure warning would be issued and this warning initiation is based on the drainage area at the dam, the number of formal and informal dam observers, and the time of day (or night) when failure occurs. The procedure then provides fatality rates for converting population at risk to probable life loss. The fatality rates are a function of flood severity, warning time for each group of people at risk, and flood severity understanding. This last factor will influence the quality and accuracy of the warning messages and will influence the response taken by people at risk. The procedure provides a discussion of uncertainty and how it can be evaluated.  41   REFERENCES Ad Hoc Interagency Committee on Dam Safety of the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering and Technology, Federal Guidelines for Dam Safety , June 25, 1979.

In the early part of the twentieth century,          National Park Service Director Stephen T. Mather envisioned a ""new          Yosemite"" where modern comforts of hot water, restaurants, and electricity          could be experienced ""to meet the ever-increasing demand for every          type of experience."" In 1917, visitation reached a total of 34,510.          This increased visitation meant a greater need for providing those modern          visitor comforts, which ultimately led to the 1918 completion of the Cascades          Diversion Dam and Hydroelectric Powerhouse.           What is the dam?                    The Cascades Diversion          Dam is located on the main stem of the Merced Wild and Scenic River, at          the far west end of Yosemite Valley. The dam itself consists of ""cribs""          formed by logs or square timbers spiked together. These cribs were then          filled with boulders and rocks and were anchored by sheet piles some 18          feet below the crest of the dam. The cribs were sheathed with butt-edged,          rough-hewn redwood boards, which are visible during periods of low water.          The dam spans 184 feet across, with a crest height of about 17 feet, flanked          by 30-foot high concrete abutments. It currently impounds approximately          2.5 acres of water, along with an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 cubic yards          of accumulated sediment.                      After 68 years of          operation, the hydroelectric facility was taken off-line in 1985-86 due          to the deteriorated and outdated condition of the entire power system.          In 1996, the National Park Service determined that the Cascades Diversion          Dam should be scheduled for deactivation and removal. This process would          involve removal of the dam's structural elements (including abutments,          foundation, and screenhouse) along with removal of a portion of the sediment          behind the dam.                    A 1999 lawsuit on          the El Portal Road Improvements Project resulted in halting plans to remove          the dam until completion of an approved Comprehensive Management Plan          for the Merced Wild and Scenic River. A record of decision on the  Merced          River Plan   was signed in August 2000.          Why remove the          dam?             The dam in its present          deteriorated condition represents a significant public health and safety          hazard due to potential uncontrolled collapse, a condition exacerbated          by structural damage and weakening caused by the 1997 flood. Additionally,          during periods of average to low water flow, the dilapidated wooden structure          of the dam is exposed, creating a visual intrusion on an otherwise popular          scenic location.                                What are some possible          strategies for removal?          A range of alternatives          will be presented in the Environmental Assessment for the project. The          No Action Alternative will constitute an approach of benign neglect, allowing          the dam to deteriorate over time. One possible strategy may allow the          accumulated sediments to remain in place after removal of the dam, leaving          sediments to erode gradually. Another approach may call for the partial          removal of sediments from the channel. Public comment will be needed to          help identify issues and concerns to be considered in alternatives development.                   What          are the key resource concerns?          The dam serves as          an impoundment on a Wild and Scenic River, which should be protected in          its free-flowing condition. According to the  Merced          River Plan ,  removal of the dam would necessitate an upgrade in          classification for this segment of the river—from ""recreational""          (having had some impoundment or diversion) to ""scenic"" (free          of impoundments).                    The Merced River gorge          maintains a steep gradient as it descends from Yosemite Valley at 4,000          feet in elevation to El Portal at 2,000 feet—over the course of 7.5          miles. Hydrologists and fisheries biologists are studying the potential          effects of dam removal on the overall hydrologic processes of the river          and its aquatic communities. Trout exist above and below the dam, however          the dam is not thought to restrict the movement of fish, as the gradient          and velocity of the Merced River gorge are too great. Spawning salmon          are not found in the Merced River, nor are there any special-status species          of fish.                    The recreational value          of the Cascades Diversion Dam site is also an important resource concern.          Located at a major Yosemite Valley intersection (El Portal and Big Oak          Flat Roads), the dam is a popular site where visitors entering the Valley          enjoy opportunities for photography, fishing, and nature study.          When will removal          occur?          The proposed action          will eliminate an immediate safety hazard and negative impacts to the          free-flowing character of the Merced River. Demolition will need to be          performed during the low water months of September, October, and November          as required by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Pending approval of the          project, demolition is expected to begin in late fall of 2001.          What          is the proposed timeline?           Public          involvement in preparation for the Environmental Assessment:           Through          April 27, 2001                     Public          comment period anticipated on Environmental Assessment:           July          2 through August 1, 2001                     If          approved, initiate project deconstruction:           Late          fall of 2001         How can the public          remain involved?

With this in mind, it makes sense to plan for these severe events and to  mitigate  their future damages.      Flood Mitigation  is defined as a sustained action that reduces or eliminates long-term risk to people and property from floods and their effects.  Essentially, flood mitigation means to do something now to reduce or eliminate the flood threat.  To do this, there are two main types of flood mitigation projects:  structural  and  nonstructural .   As the name implies,  structural  techniques seek to build something in order to change or ""control"" the physical environment; therefore, common techniques are levees or floodwalls.  The goal of structural flood mitigation is take the river away from the people. The   United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)  is the Federal agency charged with the construction and maintenance of major structural flood mitigation projects.    Nonstructural  approaches are designed to change the way human interact with the flood problem and to remove structures from the   floodplain  or   floodway .  The goal of nonstructural flood mitigation is to take the people away from the river. The most prevalent nonstructural activities include: acquisition, relocation, or elevation of flood-prone structures.  In cooperation with each State, the   Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA) funds several nonstructural flood mitigation programs.    These nonstructural programs are highlighted and explained below.

Yosemite Planning Page                     Appendix B: Merced  Wild and  Scenic   River  Section 7 Determination    Introduction    Purpose of this Determination    The purpose of this determination is to evaluate the impact of the proposed Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project on the free-flowing condition and the Outstandingly Remarkable Values for which the  Merced  River  was designated Wild and Scenic.     Authority    The authority for this determination is found in Section 7(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (Public Law 90-542, as amended, 16 United States Code 1271-1278). Section 7(a) states:    …no department or agency of the  United States  shall assist by loan, grant, license or otherwise in the construction of any water resources project that would have a direct and adverse effect on the values for which such river was established, as determined by the Secretary charged with its administration.    While the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act does not prohibit development along a river corridor, it does specify guidelines for the determination of appropriate actions within the bed and banks of a Wild and  Scenic    River . As the designated river manager for the Merced River segments located within the boundaries of Yosemite National Park and the El Portal Administrative Site, the National Park Service must carry out a Section 7 determination on all proposed water resources projects [1]  to ensure they do not directly and adversely impact the free-flowing condition or the values for which the river was designated. [2]    Wild and Scenic River Designation    In 1987, the U.S. Congress designated the  Merced  River  a “Wild and Scenic River” to protect the river’s free-flowing condition and to protect and enhance its unique values for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations (16  United States  Code 1271). This designation gives the  Merced River  special protection under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.    The passage of Public Law 100-149 on  November 2, 1987  and Public Law 102-432 on  October 23, 1992  placed 122 miles of the main stem and South Fork of the  Merced River , including the forks of  Red   Peak ,  Merced   Peak ,  Triple   Peak , and Lyell, into the Wild and Scenic River System. The National Park Service manages 81 miles of the Merced Wild and  Scenic   River , encompassing both the main stem and the South Fork in  Yosemite    National Park  and the El Portal Administrative Site. The U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management administer the remaining 41 miles of the designated river.    Methodology    Wild and Scenic Rivers Act Section 7 Determination    The Section 7 evaluation for the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project is based on guidance provided in the  Wild and Scenic Rivers Act: Section 7 Technical Report ,  Appendix C, Evaluation Procedure under “Direct and Adverse”  (Interagency Wild and Scenic Rivers Coordinating Council 1999). The “direct and adverse” evaluation procedure is carried out for water resources projects licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or other federally assisted water resources projects within the Wild and  Scenic    River  boundary of the designated river. Cascades Diversion Dam is within the bed and banks of the  Merced  River . All proposed activities would occur within the Wild and Scenic boundary of the  Merced River . The Section 7 determination process applies only to the proposed action.    Protection and Enhancement of Outstandingly Remarkable Values    Section 7 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act requires river managing agencies to determine whether water resources projects would adversely affect free flow or directly and adversely impact Outstandingly Remarkable Values. In addition, Section 10(a) of the act requires that rivers be administered to protect and enhance Outstandingly Remarkable Values. Outstandingly Remarkable Values are the river-related values that make the river segment unique and worthy of special protection. Uses that are consistent with this provision and that do not substantially interfere with public enjoyment and use of these values should not be limited (16  United   States  Code 1281[a]). Outstandingly Remarkable Values located outside the Wild and  Scenic    River  corridor boundary must also be protected (NPS 2001a).    The Merced Wild and  Scenic    River  segments applicable to the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project are 3A (Impoundment), 3B (Gorge), and 4 (El Portal). For the purposes of this analysis of potential effects on Outstandingly Remarkable Values, the proposed action is compared to the No Action Alternative (see Chapter II, Alternatives). The focus of the analysis is on long-term effects (e.g., effects that would last 10 years or more or would be permanent). Short-term effects are not addressed in this analysis unless they are of sufficient magnitude (having a substantial, highly noticeable influence) to warrant consideration.    Analysis of Outstandingly Remarkable Values is focused on segment-wide effects, rather than site-specific or localized effects. Exceptions to the segment-wide guideline include site-specific activities that could have substantial effects on Outstandingly Remarkable Values, such as degradation of habitat of a river-related special-status species (a biological Outstandingly Remarkable Value) that is endemic to that location. For the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project, Outstandingly Remarkable Values are evaluated based on effects to such values within the Impoundment, Gorge, and El Portal segments of the Merced Wild and  Scenic    River .     In terms of evaluating potential effects, actions that could degrade Outstandingly Remarkable Values on a segment-wide basis include actions with effects that would be discernible throughout the majority of the river segments, or would be of sufficient magnitude to affect adjacent segments.    For the purposes of this analysis under Sections 7 and 10 of the act, the following assumptions for each Outstandingly Remarkable Value were made:     Scientific:  The analysis considers whether the proposed action would affect the integrity of the Merced Wild and  Scenic   River  as a scientific resource, or would degrade the river’s value for research (all segments).    Scenic:  The analysis considers the specific features that are listed in the scenic Outstandingly Remarkable Value for the Gorge segment and potential effects to views are analyzed from the perspective of a person situated on the riverbank or on the river (Gorge segment).    Geologic Processes/Conditions:  The analysis gives primary consideration to designated processes and those processes (e.g., U -shaped valley, hanging valleys, evidence of glaciation, etc.) that have been responsible for creating the river’s geologic landscape. Effects related to natural meandering of the  Merced River  are addressed in the hydrologic processes Outstandingly Remarkable Value (all segments).    Recreation:  The analysis considers whether opportunities to experience a spectrum of river-related recreational activities would be affected (Gorge and El Portal segments).    Biological:  The analysis focuses on effects to riparian areas, wetlands, and other riverine areas that provide rich habitat for a diversity of river-related species (all segments).    Cultural:  The analysis considers effects to river-related cultural resources that are not intended to divert the free flow of the river and are either eligible for or listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including archeological sites, which provide evidence of thousands of years of human occupation and current traditional use sites. The analysis also considers effects on nationally significant historic resources, such as designed landscapes and developed areas, historic buildings, and circulation systems (trails, roads, and bridges) that provide visitor access to the sublime views of natural features that are culturally valuable (Gorge and El Portal segments).    Hydrologic Processes:  Consideration is primarily given to designated processes, such as river meandering, world-renowned waterfalls, an active flood regime, oxbows, and fluvial processes. Effects on wetlands are addressed in the biological Outstandingly Remarkable Value (Gorge and El Portal segments).    It is possible for Outstandingly Remarkable Values to be in conflict with each other, or for an action to have beneficial impacts with regard to one Outstandingly Remarkable Value and adverse impacts with regard to other Outstandingly Remarkable Values. The Merced River Plan recognizes this possibility, and states (page 32):    Actions must protect all Outstandingly Remarkable Values, regardless of where they are located. When Outstandingly Remarkable Values lie within the boundary of the Wild and  Scenic    River , the value must be protected and enhanced. When values are in conflict with each other, the net effect to Outstandingly Remarkable Values must be beneficial.           The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act stipulates that agencies are given discretion to manage a river system with “varying degrees of intensity for its protection and development, based on the special attributes of the area.” For example, there may be conflicts between protecting cultural resources and hydrologic processes, as is the case with a historic bridge that constricts the flow of the river.     Compatibility with Classifications    The Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project was assessed for its compatibility with the Merced Wild and  Scenic    River  recreational and scenic classifications.     Consistency with the River Protection Overlay    The Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project was assessed for its consistency with the River Protection Overlay prescriptions. The River Protection Overlay includes the Merced Wild and  Scenic    River  channel itself, and extends 150 feet on both sides of the river, measured from the ordinary high-water mark above the Cascades Powerhouse and 100 feet on both sides of the river, measured from the ordinary high-water mark below the Cascades Powerhouse.    Consistency with Management Zoning    The Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project was assessed for its consistency with the Merced River Plan management zoning and the corresponding zoning prescriptions. The management zones applicable to the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project include:      §           Discovery (2B) north of the river in the Impoundment segment    §           Open Space (2A) south of the river in the Impoundment segment    Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Wild and Scenic Rivers Act Section 7 Determination    Table B-1 presents the Section 7 evaluation for the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project.                                              Table B-1      Section 7 Evaluation for Cascades Diversion Dam Removal    Project                        Evaluation Criteria                Project Data                        DEFINE THE PROPOSED   ACTIVITY                   Project proponent             National Park Service,  Yosemite      National Park                   Purpose and need for the project             The purpose of the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal   Project is to remove an unnatural obstruction on the  Merced River    and to restore the river’s natural free-flowing condition. This removal   project is consistent with the Wild and  Scenic      River  guidance provided in the Merced   River Plan and will meet the direction of the  Yosemite Valley Plan , which calls for the dam’s   removal.     The Cascades Diversion Dam is classified as a high   hazard structure (USBR 1997). It is in unsatisfactory condition due to flood   damage experienced in 1997 and continuing deterioration associated with age.   In addition, the dam no longer serves a useful purpose – water is not   diverted from the site to generate electricity or for other uses, and the   impoundment does not regulate high water. Removal of the existing dam   structure is necessary to prevent possible uncontrolled and sudden failure,   which could result in a release of impounded water and the deposition of   concrete and timber debris, grouted rockfill, and impounded sediment along   the downstream channel. Such an occurrence could pose a considerable threat   to valued resources (such as aquatic life, scenic views, and recreational   opportunities), infrastructure ( El Portal Road ,   wastewater, telephone, and electrical lines), and human life.     In addition, the National Park Service is entrusted to   conserve and restore park values. This includes protecting the biological and   physical processes that created the park, along with scenic features, natural   landscapes, and native plants and wildlife. The removal of the dam would work   toward fulfilling this mandate by restoring this segment of the  Merced    River .                   Geographic location of the project             Cascades Diversion Dam is located on the main stem of   the Merced River in Yosemite National Park, near the intersection of El   Portal Road and Big Oak Flat Road (UTM coordinates 11 263647E 4177777N,   approximately river mile 120). Refer to figures I-1 and II-1 of the Cascades   Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment.                    Project description             The proposed action includes complete removal of the   dam, the dam abutments, the intake structure, and the screenhouse, and   restoration of the related river channel located beneath the dam site.   Sediment (including rocks and boulders) in the area upstream of the dam would   be excavated and repositioned to stabilize the river-right bank and decrease   the potential for sediment erosion. Natural river processes would continue to   transport remaining sediments (up to a maximum range of approximately 9,600   to 15,600 cubic yards of sediment) from the impoundment area over time,   allowing for a gradual re-establishment of the natural river channel and   related riparian habitat. It is expected that the river would fully recover   incrementally over time as sediments are transported from the impoundment   area. Following removal of the river-right abutment, intake structure and   screenhouse, the river-right bank would be stabilized using a bioengineered   bank stabilization system to prevent erosion of the river-right bank. The   objective of this alternative would be to restore the natural river character   with a mixture and distribution of boulders, cobbles, gravels, sand, silt,   soil, and vegetation similar to those found in adjacent river bank segments.     Refer to the description of the preferred alternative   (Alternative 2) in the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental   Assessment.     Upon project completion, the river segment through the   damsite would be restored to natural conditions and reclassified from recreational   to scenic.                                                      Table B-1 (Continued)      Section 7 Evaluation for Cascades Diversion Dam Removal    Project                        Evaluation Criteria                Project Data                        Duration of the proposed activities             In-channel work, bank stabilization, and revegetation   would be completed within a two- to three-month period during the fall of   2003 (September through November) when the flow of the  Merced    River  is typically lowest (less than 200 cubic feet per second).   The overall project duration would be approximately five months. Natural   transport of up to approximately 9,600 to 15,600 cubic yards of impounded   sediment (including rocks/bounders) could be transported with high riverflows   during the winter or spring of 2004.                    Magnitude and/or extent of the proposed activities              Refer to the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project   Environmental Assessment, Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences for detailed   data concerning potential impacts of the proposed action.                    Mitigation             The proposed action is designed to restore free-flow   and natural fluvial processes of the  Merced River . The   proposed action would protect Outstandingly Remarkable Values from possible   damage due to continued degradation and eventual failure of the dam, improve   the free-flowing condition of the river, and restore natural fluvial   processes in the vicinity of the dam. Mitigation (e.g., best management   practices and resource-specific measures) is incorporated into the proposed   action. Refer to the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental   Assessment, Chapter II, Alternatives for mitigation measures incorporated   into the proposed action.                    Relationship to past and future management   activities             The  Yosemite   Valley Plan  calls for removal of the Cascades Diversion Dam. The Cascades   Diversion Dam Removal Project is consistent with the Wild and  Scenic      River  guidance provided in the Merced River Plan .  Implementation of the proposed   action would alter management of this river segment from an unnatural   impoundment to management of a free-flowing river segment.                              DESCRIBE WHETHER THE   PROPOSED ACTIVITY WILL DIRECTLY ALTER WITHIN-CHANNEL CONDITIONS                   The position of the proposed activity relative to   the streambed and streambanks             Cascades Diversion Dam is located within the bed and   banks of the  Merced River . Dam removal activities   would occur within the bed and banks of the  Merced River    as well.                    Any likely resulting changes in:                   Active channel location             Removal of the Cascades Diversion Dam will eliminate   an existing human-made structure that affects the natural flow of the  Merced    River . Currently, the impoundment created by the dam has   unnaturally widened the channel of the  Merced River  to   approximately twice its natural width. Once the dam is removed, the channel   of the  Merced River  would be expected to naturally   narrow and deepen immediately upstream of the dam as impounded sediments,   including rocks/boulders (up to approximately 9,600 to 15,600 cubic yards),   wash downstream. A more natural channel configuration within the bed and   banks of the  Merced River  would result from the   proposed action.                    Channel geometry (cross-sectional shape, width,   depth characteristics)             Once the dam is removed, a portion of remaining   sediment (including rocks/boulders) not removed by mechanical means (up to approximately   9,600 to 15,600 cubic yards) would be transported downstream with winter or   spring riverflows. Sediment present behind the dam includes a rock and   sediment island that was present before the dam was constructed; rock,   cobble, and sediments that were excavated during dam construction and left in   place upstream of the dam; and sediment that has accumulated since   construction of the dam (Kennedy/Jenks 2002). Some of this material would   likely remain in the existing impoundment area following dam failure, and it   is expected that the island upstream of the dam would remain relatively   stable given its presence prior to dam construction.                    Channel geometry (cross-sectional shape, width,   depth characteristics) (cont.)             Sediments are expected to wash downstream within the   first year after dam removal (Kennedy/Jenks/Chilton and ROMA Design Group   1988). Sediment transport is expected to be highest in March and April during   spring snowmelt. Sediment concentrations are expected to range from 60   milligrams per liter (October through February) to 160 milligrams per   liter (spring). Sands and gravels would likely settle out near Cascades   Picnic Area. Less than 1% of the material impounded behind the dam is finer   than 0.07 millimeter in diameter. The fine material would be transported   downstream and would be deposited in areas of low-flow energy, such as pools   and downstream reservoirs.     The channel of the  Merced River    would be expected to naturally narrow and deepen as impounded sediments wash   downstream. There would be a progressive lowering of the base level of the   river channel until the river reach attains equilibrium. Water levels are   expected to lower slightly at the upstream end of the impoundment, up to   approximately 10 feet in some locations immediately upstream from the   existing dam. The island upstream from the dam would likely remain.Local scour would occur at the slope   where the diversion dam was located, and is expected to develop into a   channel incision that would proceed upstream (headcut) through the   impoundment.                   Channel slope (rate or nature of vertical drop)             Due to the nature of the material in the channel –   primarily boulders, cobbles, and gravels – little or no channel incision is   anticipated upstream of the present impoundment. The final bed profile would   likely be a smooth slope connecting the reach downstream of the dam to the   reach upstream of the dam. The final bed slope in the vicinity of the dam   would be approximately 3%.                    Channel form (straight, meandering, or braided)             Meander in the reach is anticipated to be minor, since   the incision would tend to follow the channel course that existed prior to   dam construction in 1917 (Kennedy/Jenks/Chilton and ROMA Design Group 1988;   Kennedy/Jenks 2002). Channel adjustment would be episodic, with periods of   incision followed by sediment storage and then renewed incision. The channel   is expected to stabilize at or near its natural level over a period of years   (Kennedy/Jenks/Chilton and ROMA Design Group 1988).                    Relevant water quality parameters (turbidity,   temperature, nutrient availability)             Because less than 1% of the material is finer than   0.07 millimeter in diameter, turbidity impacts to the river would likely be   small and would be mitigated through application of best management   practices. Refer to the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental   Assessment, Chapter II, Alternatives, for mitigation measures incorporated   into the proposed action. The largest increase of turbidity above background   values (Chapter III, Affected Environment, Alluvial Processes) would likely   occur the first time the river flows through the sediments formerly impounded   by the dam. This rise in turbidity would probably last on the order of a few   hours. After the initial rise in turbidity, there may be smaller spikes in   turbidity as flood flows pass through the impoundment region and gradually   erode more sediment and expose the fine material. However, each successive   turbidity spike should be smaller than the previous one until the turbidity   levels return to normal.     Water temperature is expected to decrease (compared to   existing conditions) immediately upstream of the dam as the channel deepens   and riparian vegetation matures. Nutrient availability would be enhanced as   the newly established riparian corridor matures.                    Navigation of the river             River navigation as defined by the U.S. Army Corps of   Engineers is not applicable to this section of the river. Only 20 miles of   the  Merced River , from its confluence with the  San     Joaquin   River ,   is designated as navigable by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.                    DESCRIBE   WHETHER THE PROPOSED ACTIVITY WILL DIRECTLY ALTER RIPARIAN AND/OR FLOODPLAIN   CONDITIONS                    The position of the proposed   activity relative to the riparian area and floodplain             Cascades Diversion Dam is   located within the bed and banks of the  Merced River  –   below ordinary high water and within the 2.33- and 100-year floodplain.                    Any likely resulting changes   in:                   Vegetation composition, age structure, quantity, or   vigor             A portion of the narrow band of existing riparian   vegetation along the north (river-right) bank would be affected (e.g.,   removal, soil compaction) during removal of the dam. At the dam site, the   channel would scour to a more natural condition, becoming narrower and   deeper. As this occurs, the localized water table is expected to drop, and the   existing narrow band of palustrine forests could transition to an upland   community. Approximately 4,500 cubic yards of impounded sediment (including   rocks/boulders) would be reconfigured on the river-right bank and stabilized   with native river rock, consistent with upstream and downstream channel   conditions, to provide substrate for riparian restoration. The size,   connectivity, and integrity of wetlands in the project area, particularly   palustrine forest and riverine habitat, would be enhanced. Palustrine forest   would be expanded and contribution of nutrients, organic matter, and shade to   the riverine system would be increased. The proposed action would result in a   net increase of wetland extent, functions, and values.                    Relevant soil properties such as compaction or   percent bare ground             Downstream deposition of up to approximately 9,600 to   15,600 cubic yards of impounded sediment (including rocks/boulders) would   enhance floodplain soils in the vicinity of Cascades Picnic Area. Sediment   reconfiguration and site restoration and stabilization would reduce erosion   and increase the protection of the river-right bank from unnatural   accelerated erosion, resulting in a local, long-term, minor to moderate,   beneficial impact on soils.                    Relevant floodplain properties such as width, roughness,   bank stability, or susceptibility to erosion             Downstream sediment deposition would enhance   floodplain soils in the vicinity of Cascades Picnic Area. Sediment   reconfiguration and site restoration and stabilization would reduce erosion   and increase the protection of the river-right bank and adjacent roadway,   resulting in a local, long-term, minor to moderate, beneficial impact on   floodplain values and functions. The proposed action would have a beneficial   impact on floodplain values by enhancing the free-flowing condition of the  Merced    River  at this location, increasing available floodplain in this   narrowly constricted portion of the river, and linking river-associated   riparian vegetation that has been degraded and fragmented.                    DESCRIBE WHETHER THE   PROPOSED ACTIVITY WILL DIRECTLY ALTER  UPLAND  CONDITIONS                   The position of the proposed activity relative to   the uplands             The proposed action is located within the bed and   banks of the  Merced River . Staging for dam removal is   the only activity planned for upland areas. The primary staging area would   occupy a currently paved portion of  Big Oak Flat     Road . Traffic on this portion of the road would   be diverted temporarily around the staging area through an existing paved   parking area. Pohono Quarry would be used as a secondary staging area for   storage of equipment used infrequently during project activities and for   storage and sorting or material that would be reused within the park,   recycled, or disposed outside the park.                   Any likely resulting changes in:                   Vegetation composition, age structure, quantity, or   vigor             There would be no measurable effect to age, vigor,   quantity, structure, or composition of upland vegetation. The proposed action   is located within the bed and banks of the  Merced River .   Staging areas are located in previously disturbed and paved areas adjacent to   the river and at Pohono Quarry.                    Relevant soil properties such as compaction or   percent bare ground             There would be no measurable effect to upland soil   resources. Upon completion of the project (approximately five months), the   existing earthen embankment,  El Portal Road ,   and the existing paved parking area would be restored to pre-project   conditions.                    Relevant hydrologic properties such as drainage   patterns or the character of surface and subsurface flows             There would be no measurable effect to upland   hydrologic properties. No portion of the proposed action, including equipment   staging, dam removal activities, or materials storage, would be located   within or otherwise affect surface or subsurface drainage patterns from the   uplands to the Merced River.       Removal of the overflow portion of the dam and river-left   abutment would increase the free-flowing condition of the  Merced    River  and return this portion of the river to a more natural   condition, thereby enhancing its hydrologic integrity. At the dam site, the   channel would scour to a more natural condition, becoming narrower and   deeper. As this occurs, the localized water table is expected to drop and the   existing narrow band of palustrine forest could transition to an upland   community. Reconfiguration of impounded sediment, bank stabilization, and   revegetation would minimize lateral movement of the channel and decrease   erosion.                    Potential changes in upland conditions that would   influence archeological, cultural, or other identified significant resource   values             Construction access and staging would occur on   previously disturbed and paved surfaces. Dam removal would be performed in   accordance with stipulations in the parkwide 1999 Programmatic Agreement and   the 1986 Memorandum of Agreement. The proposed action would not influence   archeological, cultural, or other identified significant resource values in   uplands of the  Merced River .                   EVALUATE AND DESCRIBE WHETHER   CHANGES IN ON-SITE CONDITIONS CAN OR WILL ALTER EXISTING HYDROLOGIC OR   BIOLOGIC PROCESSES                   The ability of the channel to change course,   re-occupy former segments, or inundate its floodplain             The project would restore more natural riverflow   conditions in the project area. Upon dam removal, the channel (in the area of   the impoundment) would scour to a more natural condition, becoming narrower   and deeper – occupying a channel similar to what existed prior to dam   construction. The floodplain would be enhanced by reconfiguration of   impounded sediment, bank stabilization, and revegetation. No element of the   proposed action would have negative long-term effects on the  Merced    River .                    Streambank erosion potential, sediment routing and   deposition, or debris loading             Removal of the dam and attendant structures (dam abutments   and intake structure) would increase the free-flowing condition of the  Merced    River  and return this portion of the river to a more natural   condition, thereby enhancing fluvial processes. Natural sediment transport   would no longer be impeded by the dam. Reconfiguration of impounded sediment,   bank stabilization, and revegetation in the area of the impoundment would   minimize lateral movement of the channel and decrease erosion.                    The amount or timing of flow in the channel             The flow of the  Merced River  would   no longer be impeded by the dam. Streamflow in the vicinity of the   impoundment would increase, consistent with upstream and downstream   conditions.                    Existing flow patterns             Upon dam removal, the channel (in the area of the   impoundment) would scour to a more natural condition, becoming narrower and   deeper – similar to the pre-dam channel. Free flow would be re-established   along this reach of the  Merced River .                    Surface and subsurface flow characteristics             As the channel of the  Merced River    narrows and deepens, the localized water table is expected to drop,   consistent with upstream and downstream conditions.                    Flood storage (detention storage)             Flood storage of the  Merced River    in the vicinity of the impoundment would be increased. Upon dam removal, the   channel (in the area of the impoundment) would scour to a more natural   condition, becoming narrower and deeper.                   Aggregation and or degradation of the channel             Upon dam removal, the channel (in the area of the   impoundment) would scour to a more natural condition, becoming narrower and   deeper. Up to approximately 9,600 to 15,600 cubic yards of impounded sediment   (including rocks/boulders) would be deposited downstream between the dam and   the Cascades Picnic Area – a beneficial effect for floodplain soils and values.                      Biological processes such as:                                 Reproduction, vigor, growth, and/or succession of   streamside vegetation             At the dam site, the channel would scour to a more   natural condition, becoming narrower and deeper. As this occurs, the   localized water table is expected to drop, and the existing narrow band of   palustrine forests could transition to an upland community. Up to   approximately 5,400 cubic yards of impounded sediment would be reconfigured   on the river-right bank and stabilized with native river rock, consistent   with upstream and downstream channel conditions, to provide substrate for   riparian restoration. The size, connectivity, and integrity of wetlands in   the project area, particularly palustrine forest and riverine habitat, would   be enhanced. Palustrine forest would be expanded, and contribution of   nutrients, organic matter, and shade to the riverine system would be   increased. The proposed action would result in net increase of wetland   extent, functions, and values.                    Nutrient cycling             Nutrient cycling of riparian vegetation in the   vicinity of the impoundment would be increased, due to the enhanced and   expanded riparian zone on the river-right and river-left banks that would   result from the drop in the localized water table and restoration along the   river-right bank.                    Fish spawning and/or rearing success             Removal of Cascades Diversion Dam would increase the   free-flowing condition of the  Merced River  and return   this portion of the river to a more natural condition, thereby enhancing the   biological integrity of this segment for native fish and wildlife. Dam   removal would alter approximately 2.5 acres of unnatural slack-water   aquatic habitat upstream of the dam. At the dam site, the channel would scour   to a more natural condition, becoming narrower and deeper. The island that   occurs behind the dam is a natural feature of the river and is likely to   remain. Water temperature through this reach would decrease, and oxygen   levels would be expected to increase. Sediment deposition downstream of the   dam could have short-term adverse effects on fisheries (e.g., suspended   sediments would temporarily reduce dissolved oxygen levels). The application   of best management practices would reduce the potential adverse impacts to   fisheries to a negligible intensity. Refer to the Cascades Diversion Dam   Removal Project Environmental Assessment, Chapter II, Alternatives, for   mitigation measures incorporated into the proposed action. Sediment   deposition could also have long-term beneficial effects on fisheries (sediment   deposition could result in larger sandbars, creating backwater niches).                    Riparian-dependent avian species needs             Riparian restoration would increase the extent,   composition, and diversity of vegetation in the vicinity of the impoundment,   creating riparian avian habitat of higher value compared with existing   conditions.                    Amphibian/mollusk needs             In-channel removal-related activities could result in   short-term impacts to amphibians or mollusks at the site of the impoundment.   Mitigation measures (e.g., best management practices, species-specific   monitoring) would reduce the identified effects to a negligible intensity.   Refer to the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment,   Chapter II, Alternatives, for mitigation measures incorporated into the   proposed action. Because downstream transport and deposition of impounded   sediments are not expected to rise above normal background levels, the proposed   action would not adversely affect species downstream of the dam. Over the   long term, channel and riparian restoration would increase habitat for   species of amphibians and mollusks native to the  Merced River .                      Species composition (diversity)             Bank, floodplain, and riparian restoration would   increase the extent, composition, and diversity of vegetation in the vicinity   of the impoundment, creating riparian wildlife habitat of higher value   compared with existing conditions.                    ESTIMATE   THE MAGNITUDE AND SPATIAL EXTENT OF POTENTIAL OFF-SITE CHANGES                   Consider and document:                                 Changes that influence other parts of the river   system             Indirect effects of the proposed action include   downstream deposition of up to approximately 9,600 to 15,600 cubic yards of   sands and gravels between the dam and the Cascades Picnic Area. Sediment at   Cascades Picnic Area could have an approximate thickness of 0.3 to 2.1 feet.   In addition, the proposed action could transport fine grained sediment to   areas of low-flow energy, such as pools and downstream reservoirs. The   proposed action would restore free-flow and natural fluvial processes to this   reach of the  Merced River . Deposition of sands and   gravels in the vicinity of Cascades Picnic Area would enhance (negligible)   floodplain soils. Turbidity and dissolved oxygen levels would be temporarily   decreased (while sediments are in suspension), but not above normal   background levels. Fine material deposited in downstream pools and reservoirs   would have no perceptible effect.                    The range of circumstances under which off-site   changes might occur (for example, as may be related to flow frequency)              Downstream transport and deposition of impounded   sediments is expected to occur during the winter or spring runoff of 2004.   The positive effect of enhanced free flow would be realized immediately   following dam removal.                   The likelihood that predicted changes will be realized             The changes associated with the proposed action   described above would be realized.                   Specify processes involved, such as water and   sediment, and the movement of nutrients             Natural fluvial processes such as free flow, sediment   transport, and nutrient exchange would be enhanced upon completion of the   proposed action.                    DEFINE THE TIME SCALE   OVER WHICH STEPS 3-6 ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR                   Review steps 3-6, looking independently at the   element of time. Define and document the time scale over which the effects will   occur.             In-channel work, bank stabilization, and revegetation   would be completed within a two- to three-month period during the fall of   2003 (September through November) when the flow of the  Merced    River  is typically lowest (less than 200 cubic feet per second).   The overall project duration would be approximately five months. Natural   transport of up to approximately 9,600 to 15,600 cubic yards of impounded   sediment (including rocks/bounders) would be transported with high riverflows   during the winter or spring of 2004. The positive effect of enhanced free flow   would be realized immediately following dam removal.                          Outstandingly Remarkable Values    Outstandingly Remarkable Values are the river-related values that make the river segment unique and worthy of special protection. They form the basis for the river’s designation as a Wild and  Scenic    River . Outstandingly Remarkable Values identified for the Impoundment (3A), Gorge (3B), and El Portal (4) segments include:               §             Scientific     §             Scenic     §             Geologic Processes/Conditions     §             Recreation             §             Biological     §             Cultural     §             Hydrologic Processes                  The proposed action would include use of Pohono Quarry, located within the Valley segment, as a secondary staging area. The quarry is not located within the bed and banks of the  Merced River  and is currently used for staging for ongoing park operations. The proposed action includes site-specific mitigation measures and the application of best management practices and will not result in off-site impacts within the Valley segment. Therefore, the Valley segment is not included in the analysis of effects of the proposed action on Outstandingly Remarkable Values.    Effects of the Proposed Action on Outstandingly Remarkable Values    The proposed action would remove the Cascades Diversion Dam and attendant structures, restoring the free-flowing condition of the Merced Wild and  Scenic   River  and returning this portion of the river to a more natural state, thereby enhancing its integrity. Table B-2 describes the effects of the proposed action on each of the Outstandingly Remarkable Values that apply to the Impoundment, Gorge, and El Portal river segments. As indicated in table B-1, the proposed action would have a beneficial effect on the biological and hydrologic processes Outstandingly Remarkable Values. The proposed action would not result in any changes to the current level of protection and enhancement of the scientific, scenic, geologic processes, recreation, and cultural Outstandingly Remarkable Values. As a result, the proposed action would protect the Outstandingly Remarkable Values of the Merced Wild and  Scenic    River .                                                                  Table B-2          Effects of the Proposed Action on Outstandingly Remarkable Values in the Impoundment, Gorge, and El Portal Segments of the  Merced   Wild and    Scenic   River   Corridor                        Outstandingly    Remarkable Value                Effects of    the Proposed Action                        Scientific     – The entire river corridor constitutes a highly significant scientific   resource because the river watershed is largely within designated Wilderness   in  Yosemite   National   Park . Scientific Outstandingly Remarkable Values   relate to the  Merced River ’s value for research. This   Outstandingly Remarkable Value applies to all the  Merced River     segments.             The proposed action would have no   effect on scientific resources of the river. Removal of Cascades Diversion Dam   would not affect the  Merced River ’s value for   research. Therefore, scientific values of the river would continue to be   protected and enhanced.                   Scenic     – The Gorge segment provides views from the river and its banks of the   Cascades, spectacular rapids among giant boulders, Wildcat Fall, Tamarack   Creek Fall, the Rostrum, and Elephant Rock.             The proposed action would remove the   dam and attendant structures from the  Merced River     corridor that intrude visually upon the scenic character of this area. Removal   of the dam would not result in the loss of river-viewing opportunities or   views of the Cascades, rapids, Wildcat Fall, Tamarack Creek Fall, the Rostrum,   and Elephant Rock. The proposed action would avoid the deposition of dam   debris in the river channel and the associated gouging of the riverbanks and   channel, which could diminish the scenic Outstandingly Remarkable Values under   the No Action Alternative. Because the dam structures do not dominate the   natural landscape from any viewpoint, removal of the dam would contribute   negligibly to the enhancement of the scenic Outstandingly Remarkable Value.   The proposed action would continue to protect and enhance the scenic   Outstandingly Remarkable Value on a segment-wide basis.                   Geologic   Processes/Conditions   – The Impoundment segment contains the dramatic   transition from the U-shaped, glaciated  Yosemite Valley     to the V-shaped river gorge. The Gorge segment is characterized by a classic   V-shaped river gorge with a continuous steep gradient. The El Portal segment   contains a transition from igneous to metasedimentary rocks (metasedimentary   rocks are among the oldest in the  Sierra Nevada ).             The proposed action would have no   effect on the geologic process Outstandingly Remarkable Value. Removal of   Cascades Diversion Dam would not affect the transition from the U-shaped   valley to the V-shaped river gorge, the V-shaped gorge itself, or the   transition from igneous to metasedimentary rocks. These values would continue   to be protected and enhanced.                   Recreation     – The Gorge segment provides a spectrum of river-related recreational   opportunities, such a picnicking, fishing, photography, and sightseeing. The   El Portal segment also provides a range of river-related recreational   opportunities, in particular white-water rafting and kayaking (class III to V)   and fishing.             The proposed action would remove a   public safety hazard to river-related park users, including those picnicking,   fishing, taking photographs, and sightseeing in the Gorge segment and those   engaging in river-related recreational opportunities in the El Portal segment.   The proposed action would preserve the recreational values on a segment-wide   basis. Overall, the proposed action would have no net effect on the recreation   Outstandingly Remarkable Value for the Gorge and El Portal segments.                             Biological     – The Impoundment segment contains rich riparian habitat. The Gorge segment   is characterized by diverse riparian areas and associated special-status   species that are largely intact and almost entirely undisturbed by humans. The   El Portal segment contains riverine habitats such as riparian woodlands   and associated federal and state special-status species, including Tompkin’s   sedge and Valley elderberry longhorn beetle and its critical habitat   (elderberry shrub). Expanses of north-facing habitat allow unlimited access to   the riparian zone for wildlife species.              The proposed action would have   short-term, adverse, removal-related effects to approximately four acres of   riparian and aquatic habitat in the Impoundment segment. Implementation of   best management practices and site restoration would result in negligible   effects. Refer to the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental   Assessment, Chapter II, Alternatives, for mitigation measures incorporated   into the proposed action. The effect would be negligible.                         Table B-2 (Continued)          Effects of the Proposed Action on Outstandingly Remarkable Values in the Impoundment, Gorge, and El Portal Segments of the  Merced   Wild and    Scenic   River   Corridor                        Outstandingly    Remarkable Value                Effects of    the Proposed Action                        Biological    (continued)             Dam removal and implementation of   best management practices and site restoration and bank stabilization would   restore the free-flowing condition of the  Merced River     and return this portion of the river to a more natural state, thereby   enhancing its biological integrity. The effect applies to the Impoundment and   Gorge segments and would be long term and beneficial.                                 Continued dam deterioration and   eventual failure under the No Action Alternative could result in extensive   erosion, as well as uncontrolled debris release into the  Merced   River   that could affect downstream riparian habitat and   special-status species in the Gorge and El Portal segments. The proposed   action would avoid these impacts to biological resources.     Overall, implementation of the   proposed action would slightly increase the level of protection and   enhancement of the biological Outstandingly Remarkable Values of the   Impoundment, Gorge, and El Portal segments because the proposed action would   have a long-term, minor to moderate, beneficial effect on the Outstandingly   Remarkable Values for these segments.                   Cultural     – There are no cultural Outstandingly Remarkable Values in the Impoundment   segment. The Gorge segment contains cultural resources, including prehistoric   sites and historic sites and structures such as those relating to historic   engineering projects. The El Portal segment contains some of the oldest   archeological sites in the  Yosemite   area, as well as   many historic Indian villages and traditional gathering places. River-related   historic resources include structures related to early tourism and industrial   development.             Although Cascades Diversion Dam is a   historic resource that contributes to the cultural landscape as an element of   the Yosemite Hydroelectric Power Plant, the dam is not considered an   Outstandingly Remarkable Value for Wild and Scenic Rivers Act purposes because   it was intended to obstruct the river’s free flow. As a result, the   Impoundment segment does not have any cultural Outstandingly Remarkable   Values. Because the dam is not considered an Outstandingly Remarkable Value,   removal of the dam would not affect the downstream cultural Outstandingly   Remarkable Values in the Gorge segment.     Controlled removal of the dam and   bank stabilization would avoid potential downstream erosion and dam debris   impacts to the Gorge and El Portal segments associated with the No Action   Alternative. Further, any actions would be performed in accordance with the   park ‘ s 1999 Programmatic Agreement. As a   result, archeological resources throughout the remainder of the  Merced   River   corridor would not be affected. Therefore, implementation   of the proposed action would preserve archeological resources included as   cultural Outstandingly Remarkable Values within the Gorge and El Portal   segments.      Bank stabilization and revegetation   would increase bank integrity and decrease potential erosion, therefore   avoiding adverse dam debris and erosion-related effects within the Gorge and   El Portal segments described under the No Action Alternative. Ethnographic   resources throughout the remainder of the  Merced River     corridor downstream of the dam would not be affected. In   addition, the park would continue to consult with culturally associated   American Indian tribes under this Programmatic Agreement and the cooperative   agreement for traditional uses. Therefore, implementation of the proposed   action would preserve ethnographic resources included as cultural   Outstandingly Remarkable Values within the Gorge and El Portal segments.                Table B-2 (Continued)          Effects of the Proposed Action on Outstandingly Remarkable Values in the Impoundment, Gorge, and El Portal Segments of the  Merced   Wild and  Scenic   River   Corridor                        Outstandingly    Remarkable Value                Effects of    the Proposed Action                        Cultural  (Continued)             Under the proposed action, the dam   would be removed in a controlled manner, compared to uncontrolled failure   under the No Action Alternative. The controlled removal of the dam, performed   in accordance with stipulations in the park’s 1999 Programmatic Agreement,   would avoid impacts to other Gorge segment cultural landscape resources,   including elements of the Yosemite Hydroelectric Power Plant, the Merced   Canyon Travel Corridor, and the Coulterville Stage Road. Nationally   significant historic resources throughout the remainder of the Merced River   corridor, such as designed landscapes and developed areas, historic buildings,   and circulation systems (trails, roads, and bridges), would be unaffected,   including those within the El Portal segment.     Overall, implementation of the   proposed action would preserve the cultural values within the Gorge and El   Portal segments and would have no net effect on the cultural Outstandingly   Remarkable Value for the Gorge and El Portal segments.                   Hydrologic   Processes   – The Gorge segment is characterized by exceptionally steep   gradients (2,000-foot elevation drop in approximately six miles). The El   Portal segment is characterized by continuous rapids.             Dam removal activities could   adversely affect water quality. This short-term effect would be reduced to a   negligible intensity by the application of best management practices. Refer to   the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment, Chapter   II, Alternatives, for mitigation measures incorporated into the proposed   action.     Under the proposed action, Cascades   Diversion Dam would be removed, thus restoring the free-flowing condition of   the  Merced River   and returning this portion of the   river to a more natural state, thereby enhancing its natural hydrologic   regime. Implementation of a bioengineered bank stabilization system on the   river-right bank would minimize lateral movement of the channel and decrease   erosion, thereby protecting the bank, and would result a net increase in the   floodplain at the site of the impoundment. Removing Cascades Diversion Dam   would help restore the active flood regime and hydrologic processes. The   removal of the dam would eliminate constriction of riverflow and improve the   natural hydrologic regime. Implementation of the proposed action would have a   long-term beneficial effect on hydrologic processes that influence river   morphology.                                           Therefore, the proposed action would protect and   enhance the hydrologic processes Outstandingly Remarkable Values in the El   Portal segment and would slightly increase the level of protection and   enhancement of the hydrologic processes Outstandingly Remarkable Values in the   Gorge segment.                          Section 7 Determination    The proposed action would remove a human-made structure from the bed and banks of the Merced Wild and  Scenic    River . Free-flow and natural fluvial processes (e.g., sediment transport, fish passage) would be returned to a more natural condition. Upon dam removal, the channel of the  Merced River   would naturally narrow and deepen. The floodplain in the immediate vicinity of the impoundment would be enlarged and stabilized. Riparian and floodplain extent, functions, and values would be enhanced. The proposed action would have a beneficial effect on the biological and hydrologic processes Outstandingly Remarkable Values. The proposed action would not affect the scientific, scenic, geologic processes, recreation, and cultural Outstandingly Remarkable Values. The National Park Service concludes that the proposed action would enhance free-flow of the  Merced River   and would not have any direct and adverse effects on the Outstandingly Remarkable Values for which the river was designated Wild and Scenic.                         Recommended:                                     Superintendent,  Yosemite National Park                                                                    Date                                                 Approved:                                     Regional Director Pacific West Region,   National Park Service                           Date                                   [1]       A water resources project is any dam, water conduit, reservoir, powerhouse, transmission line, or other works project under the Federal Power Act, or other developments, that would affect the free-flowing characteristics of a wild and scenic or congressionally authorized study river.

GX007-46-11372151	"USGS/Cascades Volcano Observatory, Vancouver, Washington         REPORT:   Potential Volcanic Hazards from Future Activity of Mount Baker,  Washington     -- Cynthia A. Gardner,  Kevin M. Scott,  C. Dan Miller,   Bobbie Myers,  Wes Hildreth,  and Patrick T. Pringle, 1995, Potential Volcanic Hazards from Future Activity of Mount Baker,  Washington: USGS Open-File Report 95-498            This report is preliminary and has not been reviewed for conformity with U.S. Geological Survey editorial standards or with the North American Stratigraphic Code.  Any use of trade, firm, or product names is for descriptive purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government.             INTRODUCTION       Mount Baker is an active volcano.  Its most recent activity  was in the mid-1800's at a time when permanent populations around  its base were few and infrastructures, such as roads, powerlines  and other structures, were virtually non-existent.  Although most  of the area adjacent to Mount Baker is still largely unpopulated  (much of the mountain is in the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National  Forest), population patterns and infrastructure are much different  than 150 years ago, and each year greater and greater numbers of  people live and play in areas that could be affected by future  volcanic activity.  This report discusses the types of volcanic  events that are likely to affect the region.    The primary purpose of this report is to provide planners,  emergency management personnel, and federal and state agencies with  information regarding eruptive and other hazardous geologic  processes that will likely occur at Mount Baker in the future.   Hopefully it will also be of interest to the general public.  A  hazard-zonation map accompanies this report and designates areas  that will most likely be affected by such processes.  Much of the  geologic rationale for the hazard designations is from work by Hyde  and Crandell (1978) and from ongoing hydrologic and geologic  investigations by K. M. Scott and W. Hildreth.    Throughout this report a distinction is made between magmatic  and nonmagmatic volcanic activity.  Magmatic activity involves  magma (molten rock and associated gases) reaching the surface  whereas nonmagmatic activity does not.  The reason for this  distinction is that the movement of magma can usually be detected  through volcano monitoring; therefore, there is generally some  warning prior to a magmatic event.  In the case of nonmagmatic  events, such as the generation of debris flows, there is generally  no movement of magma and an event may not be detected until it  occurs.  Thus volcanic activity not directly related to an eruption  also poses a serious threat.           GEOLOGIC AND GEOGRAPHIC SETTING       Mount Baker (3285 m; 10778 ft.) is an ice-clad volcano in the  North Cascades of Washington State about 50 km (31 mi) due east of  the city of Bellingham.  After Mount Rainier, it is the most heavily  glaciated of the Cascade volcanoes: the volume of snow and ice on  Mount Baker (about 1.8 km3; 0.43 mi3) is greater than that of all  the other Cascades volcanoes (except Rainier) combined.  Isolated  ridges of lava and hydrothermally altered rock, especially in the  area of Sherman Crater, are exposed between glaciers on the upper  flanks of the volcano: the lower flanks are steep and heavily  vegetated.  The volcano rests on a foundation of non-volcanic rocks  in a region that is largely non-volcanic in origin.    The present-day cone is relatively young, perhaps less than  30,000 years old, but it sits atop a similar older volcanic cone  called Black Buttes volcano which was active between 500,000 and   300,000 years ago.  Much of Mount Baker's earlier geologic record  was eroded away during the last ice age (which culminated 15,000- 20,000 years ago), by thick ice sheets that filled the valleys and  covered much of the region.  In the last 14,000 years, the area  around the mountain has been largely ice free, but the mountain  itself remains heavily mantled with snow and ice.    Deposits which record the last 14,000 years at Mount Baker  indicate that Mount Baker has not had highly explosive eruptions  like those of Mount St. Helens or Glacier Peak, nor has it erupted  frequently.  During this time period only four episodes of magmatic  eruptive activity can be definitively recognized  (table 1) . Magmatic eruptions have produced tephra, pyroclastic flows, and  lava flows from summit vents and from the Schriebers Meadow cinder  cone. However, the most destructive and most frequent events at  Mount Baker have been debris flows and debris avalanches, many, if  not most, of which were not related to magmatic activity but may  have been induced by steam emissions, earthquakes, heavy rainfall,  or in some other way.                 [Graphic,27K,GIF]     Table 1.     Summary of last 14,000 years of activity at Mount Baker (reported in calender years).   Modified from Hyde and Crandell, 1978.               Historical activity at Mount Baker includes several  explosions during the mid-19th century, which were witnessed from  the Bellingham area, and since the late 1950s, numerous small- volume debris avalanches.  In 1975, increased fumarolic activity  in the Sherman Crater area caused concern that an eruption might  be imminent.  Additional monitoring equipment was installed and  several geophysical surveys were conducted to try to detect the  movement of magma.  The level of Baker Lake was lowered and people  were restricted from the area due to concerns that an eruption- induced debris avalanche or debris flow might enter Baker Lake and  displace enough water to either cause a wave to overtop the Upper  Baker Dam or cause complete failure of the dam.  However, few  anomalies other than the increased heat flow were recorded during  the geophysical surveys nor were any other precursory activities  observed to indicate that magma was moving up into the volcano.  An  increased level of fumarolic activity has continued at Mount Baker  from 1975 to the present, but there are no other changes that  suggest that magma movement is involved.           VOLCANIC PHENOMENA -  PRODUCTS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED HAZARDS       Phenomena That Can Occur With or Without an Eruption      Debris Flows        Debris flows  are dense slurries of water-saturated debris  (rock, sand, soil, and whatever other debris is available, including  trees and in extreme cases houses, cars, and bridges) that move  downvalley and look and behave much like flowing concrete.  They  may also be referred to as lahars (indicating origin at a volcano),  hyperconcentrated flows, or mudflows.  Debris flows form when loose  masses of unconsolidated  material such as soil and rocks, glacial  deposits, or pyroclastic-flow deposits are saturated with water,  become unstable, and move downslope.  The water can come from a  variety of sources including: 1) rainfall, 2) melting of snow or  ice, 3) glacial outburst floods, or 4) overtopping of crater lakes.   Debris flows can also form when a large portion of a water- saturated volcanic cone collapses and moves downslope.  They can  be hot or cold depending upon their origin and source of their  constituent debris.  The speed at which debris flows move  downvalley depends upon slope and sediment load.  In general, they  move faster on steeper slopes and, (or) with higher concentrations  of debris.  Average speeds are between 30 and 65 kph (20 to 40 mph),  although they can be as low as 10 kph (6 mph) and as high as 100  kph (65 mph).  Debris flows follow topographic lows and are  typically channeled into existing drainages, river valleys, and  onto flood plains.    Debris flows can be subdivided into cohesive and noncohesive  types which differ both in terms of origin and behavior.  Cohesive  debris flows originate as landslides of water-saturated altered  rock.  Many volcanoes such as Mount Baker are composed of large  masses of rock that have been altered by hot fluids that can weaken  the rock and break down some of the minerals into clay particles.   Massive failure of these altered rocks can produce a clay-rich  debris flow that travels downstream as a fairly coherent mass.   Because of their clay content, cohesive debris flows do not easily  incorporate stream water and therefore do not become diluted to a  more watery flow or flood.  Cohesive debris flows tend to sustain  their movement even along fairly flat reaches until they are  trapped in a lake or ocean.    Noncohesive debris flows are flows that have a low clay  content.  They often form during eruptions when hot volcanic  material interacts with snow and ice.  For example, during the  1989-90 eruption of Redoubt Volcano  in Alaska, the debris flows  started when hot rocks from a lava dome collapsed onto the  volcano's snow-and-ice-clad flanks.  The hot rocks mixed with and  melted sufficient snow and ice to proceed downvalley as a debris  flow.  As noncohesive debris flows move downvalley they readily mix  with stream water and become more and more diluted. In general,  cohesive flows travel farther downstream as debris flows than  noncohesive debris flows, which tend to transform into watery  floods.    Debris flows can occur with or without an accompanying  magmatic eruption.  Because debris flows can be generated by  various processes, both eruptive and non-eruptive, and because they  can travel so far, they are the most far reaching (except for tephra  fall) and common hazard associated with snow and ice-clad  volcanoes.    The major hazard from debris flows to life and property is  burial or impact.  Because debris flows follow existing drainages,  the risk tends to decrease with distance downstream and with height  above the river channel; however, it is important that these  factors are considered together.  Thus, someone living downstream  in a flat area, who may be far from the river but at an elevation  not much higher, may be affected more than someone  living upstream  and close to the river but on a hill well above the river in height.   Debris flows can erode the sides of river channels causing bank  failures.  Buildings, roads, water pipes, or bridge abutments built  along those banks may then get incorporated into the debris flow.   If large enough, debris flows can overtop river channels and carry  away structures and objects in their flow paths.  Debris flows can  remain a major concern for many years after a large eruption has  occurred.  An extreme example is the 1991 eruption of Mount  Pinatubo in the Philippines.  There, so much loose material was  deposited on the slopes of Mount Pinatubo during the eruption that  during the subsequent 4 years (and likely for many more years into  the future) this material has remobilized into large debris flows  during periods of intense rainfall.    Debris flows have moved down all drainages that head on Mount  Baker.  Small debris flows (volumes of less than 0.01 km3; 0.002  mi3) are the most frequent, but travel only a few kilometers (up  to a few miles) from source; such events only pose a hazard to  someone unfortunate enough to be on the flanks of the mountain and  caught in the drainage when the debris flow occurs.  Most such small  events are probably caused by intense rainfall or small landslides  that transform into debris flows and are not associated with a  volcanic eruption.    Moderate-sized debris flows (volumes of .01-0.1 km3; 0.002- 0.02 mi3) have occurred both during times of eruptive and non- eruptive activity  (table 1) . These flows have traveled between 10  and 14 km (6-9 mi) from the summit, thus affecting valley bottoms  just beyond the flanks of the volcano.  Events of this size are of  special concern in drainages that head on the east and southeast  sides of Mount Baker, because debris flows originating in these  drainages can potentially reach Baker Lake.  Depending upon the  size of the debris flow and the height of Baker Lake, a debris flow  entering the lake might displace enough water to cause a wave to  overtop Upper Baker Dam and impact Lake Shannon and Baker Dam.   Failure of Baker Dam would result in catastrophic debris flows or  floods down the Skagit River.  Both Upper Baker Dam and Baker Dam  also have the potential of containing debris flows if lake levels  are low enough and volumes of the debris flows do not exceed  reservoir capacity.  It has not been possible to trace debris flows  down the Baker River valley because deposits are now covered by  Baker Lake and Lake Shannon. Thus, it is presently unknown whether  debris flows from Mount Baker have reached the Skagit River or  farther downstream.     In the past 14,000 years, there has only been one event in  which a debris flow exceeded a volume of 0.1 km3 (0.02 mi3).  This  event, which happened about 6800 years ago  (table 1) , is believed  to have originated as a massive landslide on the basis of the amount  of altered rock in deposits.  There is no evidence of an associated  volcanic eruption.  This debris flow moved 12 km (7.5 mi) down the  Sulphur Creek valley and more than 12 km (7.5 mi) down the Middle  Fork of the Nooksack River.  Altitudes on deposits in the Middle  Fork indicate that the debris flow was at least 100 m (325 ft) deep  as it moved downvalley.  Deposits from  this event can be traced  from the Middle Fork to the main Nooksack River and as far  downstream as Deming.  Beyond Deming, these deposits are buried by  river sediments; however, on the basis of the behavior of similarly  sized cohesive debris flows at Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens,  it is likely that this debris flow continued downstream to Puget  Sound.  In addition to the potential devastation caused by a debris  flow of this size, there is concern that deposits of future debris  flows of this volume or larger, or a repeated series of large debris  flows, could raise the river bed along the stretch of the river  between Everson and Lynden.  Such a rise in the river bed could  cause the Nooksack River to overtop the divide between it and the  Sumas River, resulting in flooding of the Sumas River, and, (or)  diversion of the Nooksack River  into the Sumas River basin.        Landslides or Debris Avalanches        Landslides are defined as the downward and outward movement  of slope-forming materials, natural rock, snow, glacial ice, soils  or any combination of these materials:  debris avalanches  are a type  of landslide that moves at high speeds.  Like debris flows, they  may or may not be accompanied by a magmatic event.  Many debris  avalanches will, if they contain sufficient water and fine  sediment, transform downstream into cohesive debris flows.    Debris avalanches were not well recognized in the geologic  record until the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.  Since that  time, debris-avalanche deposits of varying sizes have been noted  at most Cascade volcanoes and at volcanoes throughout the world.   At present, it is not possible to determine just how susceptible  to failure a volcanic cone is, nor is it known with confidence what  has triggered debris avalanches during times of nonmagmatic  activity in the past.  Many debris-avalanche deposits contain a  high percentage of hydrothermally altered rock, indicating that it  is the combination of altered rock, steep terrain, ground water,  and perhaps fractures associated with previous or concurrent  magmatic intrusions that weakens volcanic cones and makes them  susceptible to failure.    Like debris flows, the main hazard from debris avalanches to  life and property is burial and impact.  Because of their high  mobility and speed, it is critical that threatened areas are  evacuated before, or as soon as a large debris avalanche occurs.   Because many, if not most, debris avalanches at Mount Baker  transform downstream to debris flows, downvalley hazards  associated with debris avalanches are those associated with debris  flows.    Debris avalanches of rock, snow and glacial ice are fairly  common occurrences at Mount Baker, most occurring during times of  no eruptive magmatic activity.  At least 6 events have taken place  since 1958, all of small volume (less than 500,000 m3; 650,000 yd3),  none of which have traveled more than 3 km (less than 2 mi)  downslope.  In the past century, these small debris avalanches all  originated in the Sherman Crater area, an area of pervasively   fractured, hydrothermally altered rock.  Such minor events threaten  only those unlucky enough to be hiking in the avalanche's path when  the event occurs.  Slightly larger sized (volumes up to 0.1 km3;  0.02 mi3) debris avalanches have moved down Rainbow Creek valley  in the last 600 years  (table 1) ; the largest of which traveled about  9 km (about 6 mi) from its source.  Deposits  of this debris  avalanche form a hummocky surface on the valley floor in which  depressions between hummocks are occupied by small ponds and lakes,  the largest of which is Rainbow Lake.  These deposits and those of  the last century are the only ones that researchers have expressly  labeled as debris-avalanche deposits.  However, many of the clay- rich debris-flow deposits, including the large Middle Fork Nooksack  debris flow, are interpreted to have originated as debris  avalanches.    On the basis of the amount of altered rock that exists high  on the volcano, the maximum credible debris avalanche from Mount  Baker is estimated to have a volume of 1 km3 (0.6 mi3). Debris  avalanches of such magnitude are recognized throughout the world  at many volcanoes similar in size, composition, structure, and  state of alteration as Mount Baker.  No debris avalanche of this  size is known to have occurred at Mount Baker during the last 14,000  years, and although one is considered possible, it is considered  to have a low probability.  A debris avalanche of this size would  likely transform to a large debris flow that would travel to Puget  Sound depending upon which side of the volcano the collapse  occurred.        Volcanic Phenomena That Accompany Eruptions      Tephra       Tephra  consists of fragments of molten or solid rock which are  ejected into the atmosphere and then fall back to the earth's  surface.  The fragments are usually carried away from the volcano  by the wind.  During magmatic eruptions, a volcano blasts the  fragments into the atmosphere with tremendous force, forming a  vertical eruption column.  Eruption columns can be enormous in size  and grow rapidly, reaching tens of kilometers (miles) in height and  width in 30 minutes or less.  As particles in the eruption column  are carried downwind they form an eruption cloud or tephra plume   (figure 1) .  Particles in the tephra plume begin to fall out of the  plume almost immediately, with the larger and heavier particles  falling out close to the volcano and progressively smaller and  lighter particles falling out with increasing distance downwind.  Thus, the distribution of tephra is largely controlled by the  strength and direction of the wind during an eruption, whereas  particle size and deposit thickness are largely controlled by how  explosive the eruption is and the volume of material ejected.                  [Graphic,10K,GIF]     Figure 1.    Schematic drawing of an erupting volcano showing the eruption  column, tephra plume, tephra fall, tephra deposit, and ballistics  debris.               Tephra hazards vary from a nuisance to life-threatening.   Tephra plumes pose a serious hazard to aviation because particles  in plumes can damage aircraft systems and jet engines, resulting  in loss of power and damage to equipment.  In addition, particles  in a plume can sandblast aircraft windshields such that  visibility  is lost.  On the ground, the hazards to life from tephra vary  depending upon the amount that falls and the health of individuals.   In general tephra hazards diminish downwind.  High concentrations  of tephra can make breathing difficult for people and livestock,  and thick accumulations, especially if wet, can cause roofs of  buildings to collapse, endangering inhabitants within.  Minor  amounts of tephra pose little threat to healthy individuals but may  affect people with respiratory problems, the elderly, infants, and  the infirm. Even minor tephra falls, however, can be detrimental  to machinery (cars, lawn mowers, computers, etc.), can short out  power transformers and electric lines, can be a nuisance to remove  from roads and airports, can cause panic due to darkness during  daylight hours, can cause traffic accidents because of reduced  visibility, and can cause respiratory and eye problems for pets and  livestock.    Data for wind direction and speed  (figure 2)  show that winds at  an altitude between 3,000-16,000 m (10,000-50,000 ft) in the Mount  Baker area are dominantly from the west with the percentage of time  when winds are blowing from the north or south being fairly even.   Winds blow from the east less than 10 percent of the time so that  tephra from Mount Baker will normally be carried to the east away  from major communities.  Wind direction can be unpredictable  however; wind patterns for Mount St. Helens are similar to those  at Mount Baker, yet during 1980 two of the six major eruptions of  Mount St. Helens took place during easterly winds, resulting in  tephra fallout at both Olympia and Portland.  Wind speeds are  generally stronger from the west than from the east, so that tephra  plumes may be carried farther downwind during times of westerly  winds.                     [Graphic,7K,GIF]     Figure 2.     Average frequency of winds between the altitudes of 3,000-16,000 m  (about 10,000-50,000 feet) in northwestern Washington.   Winds blow towards the direction indicated and the length of the  arrow (and value given at the arrow tips) reflects the percentage  of the time, annually, that the winds blow in that direction.   The wind diagram is centered on Mount Baker, but data are from Quillayute, Washington.                Volumetrically, tephra has been a minor component of eruptions  from Mount Baker, and although definitive forecasting is  impossible, it seems likely that future tephra eruptions will also  be relatively small in volume.  Three of the four known tephra  deposits from Mount Baker are related to magmatic eruptions   (table 1) . Two of these tephras are from vents on Mount Baker and the  other one is from an eruption of the Schriebers Meadow cone.  Tephra  from the fourth and youngest event consists mainly of altered and  older volcanic rocks and it may not be related to a magmatic  eruption, but to a steam blast associated with the formation of  Sherman Crater (K. Scott, work in progress, 1995).    The largest tephra event at Mount Baker is poorly constrained  in age (between 550 and 7600 years ago;  table 1 ) and has an  estimated volume on the order of 0.1-0.2 km3 (0.02-0.04 mi3) or  about one-tenth the volume of tephra from the May 18, 1980 eruption  of Mount St. Helens. Other tephra events at Mount Baker have been  considerably smaller.  To illustrate the amount of tephra an area  downwind from Mount Baker might receive, a thickness versus  distance plot for different sized eruptions is shown in  figure 3 . The plot shows that at distances of 50 km (31 mi), or about the  distance of Bellingham from Mount Baker, thicknesses of tephra from  a 0.1 km3> (0.02 mi3 event are on the order of 6 cm (about 2 in).   For an event of 0.01 km3 (0.002 mi3;) thicknesses at 50 km are less  than 2 cm (about 0.5 in).   Figure 4  illustrates the  possible  distribution of tephra from an eruption with a volume of 0.08 km3.   In this example, the data are transposed from Mount Rainier where  details regarding thickness and distribution of a tephra deposit  of this size are well known.  During this eruption, the winds were  from the west, but during a future eruption the winds could be from  any direction.  (The shaded area in  figure 4  can be rotated around  the summit to see what the thickness and distribution would be like  if winds came from some other direction.)  It should be noted that  tephra accumulations would occur beyond the shaded area, but would  be less than 1 centimeter (less than 0.4 in) in thickness.                  [Graphic,9K,GIF]     Figure 3.      Relation between distance from volcano and the  thickness of tephra preserved.  The solid lines represent three tephra deposits of different  volumes from Mount St. Helens: layer Yn, layer T, and an unnamed layer  deposited in 1842.  These are estimated to have volumes of approximately  1-3, 0.1, and 0.01 km3 respectively.  The dashed line represents the  Red Banks (R.B.) tephra layer from Mount Shasta, which has a volume of approximately 0.1 km3.   (From Miller, 1980.)

Hypothetical tephra distribution and thickness from a future eruption of Mount Baker similar in size to the largest tephra producing event there.  The data is from an eruption of Mount Rainier with a volume of 0.08 km3 and was superimposed on Mount Baker.  Orientation of a future tephra deposit will depend on prevailing winds during the eruption     (see figure 2)   and may not be to the east of Mount Baker as depicted here.                 There are two sources of tephra hazards for people living in  the vicinity of Mount Baker: one is from eruptions of Mount Baker  itself, the other is from eruptions of more distal and more  explosive volcanoes in the Cascades.    Figures 5a  and  5b  shows the  annual probability of an area receiving tephra from Mount Baker or  from an eruption from another Cascade volcano in the United States,  respectively.  As can be seen from the plots, residents in the  Bellingham area have a greater chance of receiving tephra from a  distant volcano as from Mount Baker.  Both probabilities, however,  are relatively low - on the order of 1 chance in 5,000 to 1 chance  in 100,000 for any given year (however, still better than the odds  of winning the lottery jackpot).                   [Graphic,10K,GIF]     Figure 5a.      Annual probability of 1 cm (about 0.4 inches) or more of tephra accumulation from Mount Baker.  The shaded annual percentages  are keyed to the scale bar at right.  For example 0.005% equals a chance of 1 in 20,000 years.

Distribution is strongly affected by Mount St. Helens, the greatest tephra producer in the Cascades.                  Ballistic Debris         Rock fragments are often explosively blown out of a volcano  either during steam explosions or magmatic eruptions. This   ballistic debris  moves outward from the volcano along an arc, much  like a cannon ball shot out of a cannon  (figure 1) . The debris can  range in size from pebbles to boulders.  Most are thrown only a few  kilometers from the vent area, although some have been thrown as  far as 10 km (6 mi).  The principal danger from ballistics is being  hit by rock fragments (particularly large ones) moving at high  speeds.        Lava  Flows        Lava flows are coherent masses of hot, partially molten rock  that flow downslope.  They generally follow valleys, move  relatively slowly, and, because they are extremely hot, burn  vegetation potentially causing forest or brush fires.  Lava flows  that move over snow and ice can generate sufficient melt water to  produce debris flows.    Most lava flows pose little risk to human life because they  move so slowly and because once started, their paths can be fairly  well predicted.  They will destroy structures and property in their  paths, however, by burial or burning.  The secondary effects of  lava flows include debris flows and forest fires that threaten life  and property alike.    In the past 14,000 years, lava flows have moved down the  Boulder and Sulphur Creek drainages and probably down the Glacier   Creek drainage as well (W. Hildreth, work in progress, 1995).  The  sources for the Boulder and Glacier Creek flows appear to be high  on the volcano; the source of the Sulphur Creek lava flow is the  Schriebers Meadow cinder cone.  The latter flow moved down Sulphur  Creek valley and across the Baker River valley, temporarily damming  Baker River; a remnant of the flow is found on the east side of  Baker Lake.  Cinder cones, like the Schriebers Meadow cone, are  short-lived features and it is doubtful that new lava flows will  issue from this vent.  Another small volcanic cone is present 10  km (6 mi) southeast of the Schriebers Meadow cone and appears to  have erupted prior to 14,000 years ago but not since. This cone is  the source of a pyroclastic deposit that had earlier been  interpreted as originating from Mount Baker (W. Hildreth, work in  progress, 1995).  The past record indicates that future lava flows  will most likely have their source on Mount Baker.  If a lava flow  emanates from a vent high on Mount Baker, generation of debris flows would be a concern, especially if the debris flows  entered Baker Lake (see section on debris flows).        Pyroclastic Flows, Pyroclastic Surges, and Ash Clouds        Pyroclastic flows  are avalanches of hot ash, rock fragments,  and gas that move at high speeds (greater than  150 km/hr; 95 mi/hr)  down the sides of a volcano during explosive eruptions or when  the edge of a thick, viscous, lava flow or dome breaks apart and  collapses. Such flows can be as hot as 800C (~1500F) and are  capable of burning and destroying everything in their paths.   Pyroclastic flows, like debris flows and lava flows, tend to follow  valley bottoms or other topographic lows, but can have enough  mobility to overtop hills and ridges.  Often associated with  pyroclastic flows are  pyroclastic surges , which are more energetic  than pyroclastic flows, and thus are less restricted by topography.   They often move over ridge tops and slopes adjacent to pyroclastic  flows.  The finest particles of moving pyroclastic flows and surges  are transported upward by hot gases and carried downwind as ash  clouds, eventually falling out over the landscape like tephra  derived directly from the vent.    Pyroclastic flows and surges are extremely dangerous and the  hazards associated with them are numerous.  Injury or death can  result from a number of factors including burial, impact, burning,  and asphyxiation.  Although pyroclastic flows move down valleys  like lava and debris flows, the immediate hazards associated with  them are very different.  In the case of lava flows, one can usually  out run the advancing front.  In the case of debris flows, one can  climb quickly up the valley sides to a height above the debris flow.   In the case of pyroclastic flows and surges, however, the high  mobility and heat associated with these flows threatens anyone  nearby, such that ridge tops and valley slopes may be unsafe.   During a magmatic eruption at the summit of Mount Baker any of the  drainages that begin high on the volcano could be affected by this  phenomena.    When hot pyroclastic debris melts snow and ice,   debris flows are generated. Owing to the large amount of snow and  ice on Mount Baker, any pyroclastic flow or surge generated on the  upper slopes of the volcano will produce noncohesive debris flows.   Large pyroclastic-flow-induced debris flows would move into the  Baker-Skagit or Nooksack River systems and travel  downstream  either as debris flows or watery floods.    Only one period of pyroclastic-flow and -surge activity is  recognized at Mount Baker.  This activity occurred about 9,600 years  ago and deposits from this period are confined to the Boulder Creek  valley  (table 1) . At least 11 pyroclastic-flow and ash-cloud  deposits are present there along with at least 16 debris-flow  deposits and two lava flows.  These deposits make up part of a large  fan that forms the west bank of Baker Lake.        Lateral Blasts         Lateral blasts  are explosive events in which energy is  directed horizontally instead of vertically as in an eruption  column.  Lateral blasts vary in size, but large ones are fairly  rare, with only a few historical examples known worldwide, the most  recent occurred during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.   There, the gas-charged, hot (initial temperatures greater than  300C or 570 F), mixture of rock, gas, and ash moved out at speeds  up to 1000 kph (~650 mph), and surmounted ridges as high as 750 m  (2500 ft) above valley floors  Within a few minutes the blast  extended outwards about 25 km (15 mi) and had carried off or knocked  down virtually all the trees in its path.  Almost everything within  the blast zone perished and all manmade objects were moved or  significantly damaged.    No lateral blast of this magnitude has been recognized at  Mount Baker, but such blasts were not recognized before 1980 at  Mount St. Helens either.  Such an event is considered credible,  although unlikely.  Because lateral blasts are directed outwards  instead of upwards (one can think of them in a simple way as an  eruption column lying on its side) only a portion of the area  surrounding a volcano is affected by a lateral blast.  At Mount St.  Helens, a 180-degree sector out to a distance of 25 km (15 mi) from  the summit was devastated by the 1980 lateral blast.  In that case,  nearly two months of deformation of the north side of the volcano  preceded the events that triggered the lateral blast.  Similar  deformation at Mount Baker would help define what areas around the  volcano might be affected by a blast before one occurred.             HAZARDS-ZONATION MAP       Assessment of volcano hazards at Mount Baker is based on the  philosophy that future volcanic activity is most likely to be  similar to what has happened in the past.  The time period since  settlers have come to the area is too brief to serve as the basis  for estimating the future behavior of the volcano which is hundreds  of thousands of years old.  Fortunately, at least some of the record  of prehistoric eruptions and events is preserved in  the deposits  they produced. Such deposits can be mapped, studied, and dated in  order to learn about the types and frequencies of past events and then  to identify areas that could be affected by future events.  At Mount  Baker, many of the deposits older than 14,000 years were eroded  away by ice sheets and so the past 14,000 years is assumed to be  representative of the type of activity that has occurred throughout  the volcano's lifetime.    Areas designated as hazardous are delineated on the basis of  past eruptive events as well as topography, degree of alteration  of the volcano (to help determine the likelihood of a debris  avalanche), and knowledge of comparable eruptive phenomena at other  volcanoes.  Hazards are depicted in all drainages that begin high  on Mount Baker - whether or not deposits of past events are  preserved there.  Thus, unless protected by topographic barriers,  any valley starting high on Mount Baker could be affected during  the next eruption.    The accompanying hazard maps shows areas that could be  affected by future flowage hazards such as debris flows, debris  avalanches, lava flows, pyroclastic flows, and pyroclastic surges.   Tephra hazards are shown in  figures 5a  and  5b  and a lateral blast hazard map is shown in  figure 6 . It is important to recognize that  the degree of hazard does not change abruptly at the hazard-zone  boundaries.  Rather, the level of hazard typically decreases  gradually as one moves away from the source area, or in the case  of debris flows, as one moves above the valley floor. Areas  immediately outside hazard-zone boundaries should not be regarded  as hazard free, because many of the boundaries can only be  approximately located, especially in areas of low relief.  Too many  uncertainties exist about the size, mobility, and source of future  events to definitively locate hazard-zone boundaries.        Debris-Flow And Debris-Avalanche Zone      The major hazard at Mount Baker is from debris flows and  debris avalanches, many of which will occur without accompanying  magmatic activity.  The boundaries on the hazard map illustrate  probable debris-flow inundation levels based largely on past  extents of these events at Mount Baker.  Three zones, termed Cases  M, 1, and 2, are delineated in order of increasing frequency and  decreasing size.  The boundaries for these zones are largely the  work of K. M. Scott in conjunction with data reported in Hyde and  Crandell (1978).    Case M represents a maximum known or envisioned debris flow  for the Nooksack and Skagit Rivers.  The maximum known debris flow  is the 6800 year-old debris flow in the Middle Fork of the Nooksack  River that can be traced as far downstream as Deming.  Flow limits  are not shown below Deming, but are likely to be several meters  higher than those of the Case I flows shown on the map.  The likely  cause of a Case M debris flow would be a debris avalanche that  transformed into a cohesive debris flow.  As only one event of this  size is known, the recurrence interval is on  the order of 1 in  14,000 years and so this event is considered to be a high  consequence, but low-probability event.    In the Skagit River Valley, a Case M flow is shown as the  consequence of the failure of Baker Dam, and (or) Upper Baker Dam  that sends a debris flow or watery flood down the Skagit River.  A  large debris avalanche, pyroclastic flow, or debris flow entering  Baker Lake could cause failure of the dams.  With all the potential  scenarios and modes of dam failure, the possibilities are so  complex that no specific downstream inundation level can be  forecast.  We concur with Hyde and Crandell (1978) that the only  reasonable approach to a Case M event down the Skagit River is to  include the entire flood plain downstream to Puget Sound.  A  possible inundation depth in this zone is at least 5 meters (16  feet).    A case M event is also shown for the Sumas River drainage in the  case where aggradation causes the Nooksack River to overtop its  divide and flow into the Sumas River.    A Case 1 event is a noncohesive debris flow related to melting  of snow and ice as a consequence of magmatic eruptive activity or  by increased fumarolic heating or steam explosions.  The size of  the flow would depend upon how much snow and ice were melted, and  where on the volcano the activity occurred.  This is the most likely  type of event to affect the drainages on the northern side of the  volcano.  The recurrence interval based on known deposits of  noncohesive debris flows is in excess of 500 years.  However, the  likelihood of a Case 1 event would be greater if precursory  activity indicative of a magmatic eruption or if further increased  fumarolic activity were to occur.    Case 2 events are cohesive debris flows derived from small to  moderate debris avalanches of water-saturated altered rock from  either the Sherman Crater or the upper Avalanche Gorge (Rainbow  Creek) areas.  On the east side of the volcano where Case 2 flows  are designated, Case 1 flows are not likely to be significantly  larger in these drainages, and consequently are not separately  shown.  The recurrence interval between Case 2 events is 100 years  or less, representing a debris flow analogous to that of a 100-year  flood.  Inundation lines on the map are based on the largest such  flows that have taken place since the mid-1800's.  Case 2 events  may occur during times of no volcanic activity or during times of  increased fumarolic or other precursory activity.  For both Case 1  and 2 types of events, when increased thermal activity or other  types of volcanic unrest occur, it would be prudent to lower the  reservoirs to accommodate moderate-sized debris flows that might  enter the lake, as was done during the start of the increased  fumarolic activity in the mid 1970's.       Pyroclastic Flow, Surge, Lava Flow, and Ballistic  Zone      The boundary for this zone is based on the possible  distribution of products during a summit eruption of Mount Baker.   Because pyroclastic flows and surges tend to be the most mobile of  these phenomena, the hazard zone is based on the distances that  these flows are likely to travel.  This is estimated by determining  the difference in elevation of the eruptive vent (in this case we  used the summit) and the farthest point that any  flow or surge  reached (H), divided by the distance between these  points (L), and is expressed by the simple ratio of H/L. We  determined a value of H/L (for this case of 0.2) based on the  distance that pyroclastic flows have traveled down the Boulder  Creek drainage and on our calculations for other pyroclastic flows  and surges at other similar volcanoes.  The resulting zone is  irregular in shape because of the irregular topography around Mount  Baker, which influences the flow paths of pyroclastic flows and  surges.    Lava flows tend to follow topographic lows and depending upon  where the next active vent is, may travel down drainages that are  already designated as debris-flow hazard zones. Regardless of vent  placement however, lava flows and ballistic debris are generally  confined to within 10 km (6 mi) of their source; thus, during future  events at Mount Baker the hazard zone for these two phenomena will  be contained within the zone calculated for pyroclastic flows and  surges.  Most debris avalanches will also occur within this zone.   During any given eruptive event, some drainages may be completely  unaffected by pyroclastic flows, surges, or lava flows, whereas  others may be adversely affected.  Because of the H/L value chosen,  the area on the west-northwest side of the volcano downslope of the  Black Buttes was included in the hazard zone, although the Black  Buttes will provide a topographic barrier to all but the most  extreme flowage events.  The areas of greatest concern from the  above hazards, where there are no topographic barriers to impede  flows of any kind, are those areas that head above Baker Lake on  the east, the Middle Fork of the Nooksack River on the southwest,  and Glacier and Bar Creeks on the north.         Tephra Hazard Zone      Tephra hazard maps, shown in  figures 5a  and  5b ,  show the annual probabilities of a tephra fall of 1 cm (about 0.4 in) or  more from an eruption at Mount Baker or another Cascade volcano.   The data base for  figure 5a   (an eruption from Mount Baker) includes  all tephra falls from Mount Baker in the last 10,000 years and  assumes present day wind directions.  The data base for  figure 5b   includes tephra falls for all U. S. Cascade volcanoes during the  last 10,000 years, and again assumes present day wind directions.   The patterns for both figures are keyed to scales shown at the right  of each map.  A 0.002% probability means that there is 1 chance in  50,000 (1/50,000 x 100) that the area shaded with that pattern will  experience an accumulation of 1 cm (about 0.4 in) or more of tephra  during any given year.       Lateral-Blast Zone      No lateral blast deposits have been recognized at Mount Baker  and a future large event is considered to have a low probability.   However, in order to have a sense of the area at risk from a lateral  blast comparable to the 1980 blast at Mount St. Helens, a ""maximum""  lateral-blast zone is shown in  figure 6 . The blast-hazard zone was  estimated using a similar calculation as that used to determine the  hazard zone for pyroclastic flows  and surges, but in this case the  H/L value chosen is 0.09.  This value is based on the distance  traveled by the 1980 Mount St. Helens blast. The zone is irregular  because of topographic barriers, such as Mount Shuksan, which would  stop the blast well short of its potential runout distance.                    [Graphic,21K,GIF]     Figure 6.      Lateral Blast Hazard Zone.  Area that could be affected by a lateral blast similar in size to the May 18, 1980 lateral blast event at Mount St. Helens.  During any given lateral blast the entire  area around the volcano (360 degrees) would not be affected,  but rather a sector most likely between 90 and 180 degrees.                   VOLCANIC MONITORING AND ERUPTION RESPONSE       Future magmatic eruptions at Mount Baker are likely to be  preceded by changes at the volcano that can be detected by modern  volcano-monitoring techniques.  Magma moving up into a volcanic  edifice causes rock fracturing, deforms the ground surface, and  releases magmatic gases.  Therefore, volcanic seismicity  (earthquakes), deformation, and gas studies are the principal  monitoring tools that the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) employs  to detect magma movement.  In conjunction with the University of  Washington's Geophysics Program, the USGS operates and  continuously receives data from a network of seismometers on and  around Mount Baker.  Deformation measurements, that could detect  magma movement within the volcano, is done to provide baseline  information on the state of Mount Baker.  Gas measurements and  fumarole temperatures have been measured sporadically at Mount  Baker since the early 1970's to detect changes in gas composition  or increases in temperature, both of which may accompany movement  of  magma to shallow levels.    If one or more of these techniques were to show consistently  anomalous behavior indicative of magma movement, additional  seismic, deformation, and gas monitoring would be initiated.  If  the evidence indicated that conditions were developing that might  lead to an eruption, USGS crews would begin monitoring the volcano  on a round-the-clock basis and the status of the volcano would be  communicated as often as necessary to appropriate officials at  Federal, State, County, and local levels - usually through a  coordinating agency.  If an eruption appeared imminent and during  an eruptive crisis, updates regarding the status of the volcano and  anticipated tephra plume paths based on wind forecasts would be  issued by the USGS at least daily to the above groups and to the  aviation community.  Hazard maps and delineation of hazard zones  would be updated as new information dictates.  If an eruption  occurred, notification of the eruption would be sent out  immediately to the coordinating agency and other concerned groups.  Equally important, these groups would be notified of the cessation  of an eruption as soon as practical; monitoring of the volcano and  tracking of the tephra plume would continued for as long as the  hazards persisted.  Such full-scale monitoring and hazard  communication would continue throughout any period of intense  volcanic unrest until the monitoring evidence indicated that  further activity was no longer a threat.    The onset of eruptive activity differs from volcano to  volcano.  The range in lead time from the start of anomalous (mostly  seismic) behavior to an eruption for some well-monitored volcanoes  was 2 months for the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens; 24 hours  for the 1989-1990 eruption of Redoubt, Alaska; 2.5  months for the  1991 eruption of Pinatubo Volcano in the Philippines; and 10 months  for the 1992 eruption of Crater Peak (Mount Spurr), Alaska. Because  lead times prior to volcanic crises may be on the order of only a  day to a few months, it is important that coordination among  officials occur and decisions regarding the roles of the various  agencies be made before a crisis begins.         SUMMARY          The main hazards at Mount Baker are from debris flows and debris  avalanches.  These may occur with or without an accompanying  eruption.         Most cohesive debris flows (Case 2 events) will be small to  moderate in volume and will originate as debris avalanches of  altered volcanic rock, most likely from the Sherman Crater,  Avalanche Gorge, or Dorr fumarole area.  Small volume debris flows  will pose little risk to most people, but moderate volume debris  flows could travel beyond the flanks of the volcano.  The  recurrence interval for these events is higher than for noncohesive  debris flows (Case 1) because they need not be related to magmatic  eruptions.        If a summit magmatic eruption occurs, all drainages around the  volcano will be susceptible to noncohesive debris flows (Case 1  events) that form as the result of hot volcanic material  (pyroclastic flows, surges, or lava flows) melting snow and ice.   These debris flows will likely transform downstream into watery  debris flows or floods.        Of special concern is a debris flow (of any type) or pyroclastic  flow entering Baker Lake and displacing enough water to either  overtop Upper Baker Dam or cause failure of the dam.  Either  scenario would have consequences for the stability of Baker Dam.   If Baker Dam should fail, the resulting debris flow or flood would  most likely affect the entire Skagit flood plain to Puget Sound.        The largest debris flow in the last 14,000 years (6800 years  ago) probably originated as a large debris avalanche.  This flow  moved down the Middle Fork of the Nooksack to the main Nooksack and  can be traced as far downstream as Deming, where it is buried by  younger river deposits.  In all likelihood this debris flow  traveled all the way to Puget Sound.        A very large debris flow like the one that occurred 6800 years  ago, or series of large debris flows moving down the Nooksack  River, could deposit enough material in the stretch of river  between Lynden and Everson to raise the river bed enough to cause  flood waters to spill into the Sumas River or to divert the Nooksack  River into the Sumas River basin.  Such an event is considered to  be of high consequence but low probability.       Pyroclastic flows, pyroclastic surges, and lava flows occur during  magmatic eruptions. Pyroclastic flows and surges are particularly  dangerous and areas that could be affected by them should be  avoided during periods of volcanic unrest.  Ballistic debris could  be ejected during steam explosions or during magmatic events.        Mount Baker has not produced large amounts of tephra in the past  and probably will not in the future.  Because winds are dominantly  from the west, it is likely that any tephra that is produced will  carried to the east away from most major communities.  For most the  tephra will only be a nuisance.  However even minor amounts of  tephra can affect the performance of aircraft, sandblast aircraft  windshields, damage machinery, and disrupt everyday lives.        Mount Baker is presently not showing signs of renewed magmatic  activity, but someday in the future it will surely become restless  again.  Even without renewed magmatic activity, however,  potentially hazardous geologic processes can occur.  It is  important that coordination among officials and decisions  regarding the roles of the various responsible agencies are known  in advance of a crisis.  The time to plan for future events is now,  while populations living near the volcano are sparse and  infrastructures such as roads, bridges, and other facilities are  of relatively low density.               GLOSSARY       Ash cloud   - the fine material that is generated by a pyroclastic  flow and rises above it.      Cinder cone   - a small conical-shaped volcano formed by the  accumulation of ejected cinders and other volcanic debris that  falls back to Earth close to the vent area      Debris Avalanche   - the very rapid and usually sudden sliding and  flowage of an unsorted mixture of soil and weathered (altered) rock      Debris flow   - a flowing mixture of water and rock debris, sometimes  referred to as a lahar (originating at a volcano) or mudflow      Deposit   - Earth material that has accumulated by some natural  process.  For example, a flowing mixture of water and rock debris  is called a debris flow, but when the flow ceases to move, a layer  of fine and coarse rock is left which is called a debris-flow  deposit.      Fumarole   - a vent that releases volcanic gases, including water  vapor (steam).      Fumarolic activity   -  volcanic gas  emissions, that may be  accompanied by a change in the temperature of the gases or fluids  emitted.      Glacial till   - an unsorted, unstratified mixture of fine and coarse  rock debris deposited by a glacier.      Glacier outburst flood   - a sudden release of melt water from a  glacier or glacier-dammed lake sometimes resulting in a  catastrophic flood, formed by melting of a channel or by subglacial  volcanic activity.      Hummocky ground   - a ground surface that has lots of small hills and  swales; uneven ground.      Hydrothermal   - pertains to hot water or the action of heated water,  often considered heated by magma or in association with magma.      Hydrothermal alteration   - alteration of rocks or minerals by the  reaction of hot water (and other fluids) with pre-existing rocks.   The hot water is generally heated groundwater and dissolved  minerals.      Lateral blast   - an explosive event in which energy is directed  horizontally instead of vertically as in an eruption column      Lava   - molten rock that erupts from a vent or fissure.      Lava dome   - a steep-sided mound that forms when viscous lava piles  up near a volcanic vent.      Magma   - molten rock that contains dissolved gas and minerals.  When  magma reaches the surface it is called lava.      Pyroclastic flow   - a hot, fast-moving and high-density mixture of  fine and coarse particles and gas formed during explosive eruptions  or from the collapse of a lava dome.      Pyroclastic surge   - similar to a pyroclastic flow but of much lower  density (higher gas to rock ratio).      Tephra   - particles of either molten or rock erupted from a vent  into the air above a volcano.      Vent   - an opening in the Earth's surface through which volcanic  materials (magma and gas) escape.      Volcanic cone or edifice   - used here to describe the uppermost  slopes and summit area of a volcano.

GX004-08-1827994	"National Water Summary on Wetland Resources    United States Geological Survey Water Supply Paper 2425            Restoration, Creation, and Recovery of Wetlands    Effects of the Great Midwest Flood of 1993 on Wetlands       By James R. Kolva,  U.S. Geological Survey               The Great Midwest Flood of 1993 was the ""most devastating flood in modern  United States history"" with economic damages near $20 billion.  More than  50,000 homes were damaged or destroyed.  The areal extent, intensity, and  long duration of the flooding makes this event unique in the 20th century  (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 1994).  At least 38  people lost their lives as a result of this extreme flood (Interagency  Floodplain Management Task Force, 1994).    Significant flooding in the Upper Mississippi River Basin began in mid-June  and persisted into early August 1993.  The areal extent of this flooding  included southern Minnesota, southwestern Wisconsin, Iowa, western  Illinois, northern Missouri, southern North Dakota, and eastern parts of  South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas  (fig. 62) .   Record flood-peak discharge was recorded at 39 streamflow-gaging stations in the Upper Mississippi River Basin.  Fifteen other gaging stations recorded peak discharges exceeding previous maximum known regulated discharges (Parrett and others, 1993). The recurrence interval of the peak discharge at 40 stations exceeded the 100-year flood (one-percent chance of occurring in any given year).   Near-record and record precipitation in June and July, falling on soil  already saturated by as much as twice normal early spring rains, caused  these record floods.  Precipitation for the period January-July 1993  totaled more than 20 inches in most of the flooded area and more than 40  inches in parts of northeastern Kansas and east-central Iowa (Wahl, Vining,  and Wiche, 1993).  Many areas received more precipitation in those 7 months  than is normally received during the entire year.   The Great Midwest Flood of 1993 was unique not only because of the record  high water levels and flows and the wide areal extent, but also because of  the long duration of flooding.Many rivers were above flood stage for  several months.  The long period of inundation had significant effects on  agricultural land and wetlands.                 (Click on image for a larger version.)       Figure 62.  Areal extent of flooding in the Upper  Mississippi River Basin during the Great Midwest Flood of 1993.    (Source: Modified from Parrett and others, 1993).     The flood effects on wetlands varied in both the short term and long term.  In the Upper Mississippi National Wildlife Refuge, the flooding lasted 14 weeks-from April through mid-August.  ""This prolonged inundation of bottom-land hardwood forest and backwater wetlands caused many tree tip-overs, scoured out ground cover and tree regeneration sites, eroded islands, destroyed emergent/submergent vegetation beds, impacted project dikes, and thus destroyed most of the moist soil plants at three sites,"" according to James Lennartson of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  The effects on wildlife populations also were severe.  Many birds, including green-backed herons and red-shouldered hawks, fledged few young due to flooded foraging areas.  Substrate disturbance and massive sedimentation saffected freshwater mussel populations.  Mussels were found buried by 1 to 2 feet of sand.  Mammals were displaced from the flood plain and suffered higher than normal mortality rates on adjacent roads and railroad tracks (James Lennartson, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, written commun., 1994).  Fishes that rely on sight to find their food were handicapped because of the increased turbidity.   The flooding, however, had some short-term benefits.  Many fish feed and  spawn on inundated flood plains.  ""Ideal conditions for spring spawning  fishes occur during years in which flood and temperature rise are coupled""  (Scientific Assessment and Strategy Team, 1994).  The evidence,  particularly in the lower Missouri River flood plain, ""***indicates that  the magnitude and timing of the 1993 flood provided appropriate temperature  and discharge cues for spawning river-floodplain fishes"" (Scientific  Assessment and Strategy Team, 1994).     ...the ""most devastating flood in modern United States  history""...    ...a historically unprecedented hydrometeoro- logical event...                     The long-term effects of the floods are still being evaluated.  Fish  habitat may have been improved by creation of deep scour holes and massive  underwater debris piles which provide more cover (James Lennartson, oral  commun., 1994).  Greater-than-normal sedimentation on flood plains and in  wetland ponds may have introduced contaminants and excess nutrients into  those areas.  Exotic plants such as purple loosestrife have colonized  disturbed areas and displaced native vegetation (Susan Hassletine, U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service, oral commun., 1994).  Purple loosestrife  colonies also have been observed at higher elevations than normal, probably  because seeds were carried by the extremely high floodwaters to these  locations (James Lennartson, oral commun., 1994).  Flood debris on flood  plains has caused access problems for people at some places, but provides  good wildlife cover.  Open wetland aquatic vegetation appeared to be  back to normal condition during the summer of 1994 (Susan Hassletine,  oral commun., 1994).     Wetlands commonly mitigate the effects of floods.  Wetland areas can be  filled with and temporarily store floodwaters so that flood effects on  agricultural and residential areas are lessened.  However, wetlands have  been steadily dissappearing or converted to other uses throughout the  flood-affected area for the last two centuries (see ""History of Wetlands in  the Conterminous United States"" in this volume).  These wetlands include  the river flood plains and the upland prairie potholes.   Many upland prairie pothole wetlands are closed flow systems, which fill  with rain and melting snow and then slowly evaporate or drain through the  ground-water system.  Thus, they areideal retention basins during and after  intense rains because they ""do not normally contribute to stream flow  byrunoff, except during storms large enough to make the depressions fill  and spill""(Scientific Assessment and Strategy Team, 1994).  This seems to  have been the case in the flood of 1993.  All available storage capacity of  the wetlands was exceeded, and usually noncontributing areas did contribute  to runoff (Interagency Floodplain Management Task Force, 1994).  In  modeling done by the Scientific Assessment and Strategy Team (1994), upland  wetlands simulated decreased flooding in a 1-year event by 9-23 percent,  but only by 5-10 percent in a 100-year event.  Flood-plain wetlands  decreased flooding 5-6 percent for 1-year floods and only 2-3 percent for  the 100-year storms.

The Executive Summary of the Report of the Interagency Floodplain  Management Review Committee to the Administrative Floodplain Management  Task Force (1994) states the effect that wetlands had on the Great Midwest  Flood of 1993:     The loss of wetlands and upland cover and the  modification of the landscape throughout the basin over the last century  and a half significantly increased runoff.  *** Although upland watershed  treatment and restoration of upland and bottom-land wetlands can reduce  flood stages in more frequent floods (25 years and less), it is  questionable whether they would have significantly altered the 1993  conditions (Interagency Floodplain Management Task Force,  1994).    In conclusion, the Great Midwest Flood of 1993 was a historically  unprecedented hydrometeorological event in area affected, severity of the  effects, and duration of the effects.  Wetlands were affected beneficially  and detrimentally in the short and long term.  The historical loss of  wetlands from the basin increased the severity of the flood, but even if  all presettlement wetlands had still existed,the flood would probably still  have set records and caused billions of dollars in damages.

GX006-76-2036358	"USGS/Cascades Volcano Observatory, Vancouver, Washington        REPORT:   Volcanic-Hazard Zonation for Mount St. Helens, Washington, 1995      -- Edward W. Wolfe and Thomas C. Pierson, 1995, Volcanic-Hazard Zonation for Mount St. Helens, Washington, 1995: USGS Open-File Report 95-497            This report is preliminary and has not been reviewed for conformity with U.S. Geological Survey editorial standards or with the North American Stratigraphic Code.  Any use of trade, firm, or product names is for descriptive purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government.              INTRODUCTION       Mount St. Helens remains a potentially active and dangerous  volcano, even though it is now (1995) quiescent.  In the last 515  years, it is known to have produced 4 major explosive eruptions  (each with at least 1 km3 of eruption deposits,    fig. 1 )   and dozens  of lesser eruptions.  Two of the major eruptions were separated by  only 2 years.  One of those, in 1480 A.D., was about 5 times larger  than the May 18, 1980 eruption, and even larger eruptions are known  to have occurred during Mount St. Helens' brief but very active  50,000-yr lifetime.  Following the most recent major eruption, on  May 18, 1980, there were 5 smaller explosive eruptions over a  period of 5 months. Thereafter, a series of 16 dome-building  eruptions through October 1986 constructed the new, 270-m- (880- ft) high, lava dome in the crater formed by the May 18, 1980  eruption.              Figure 1:    Eruptive history of Mount St. Helens shown on a  logarithmic time scale.                    Figure 1:    Eruptive history of Mount St. Helens shown on a  logarithmic time scale (expands with decreasing age). Eruptive  periods (at right) are subdivisions of the Spirit  Lake eruptive stage. Large explosive eruptions are those that  deposited at least 25 cm of tephra at distances of 8 to 10 km  downwind of Mount St. Helens. Modified from Pallister and others  (1992). Additional data from Mullineaux (in press) and Yamaguchi  and Hoblitt (in press).               Volcanoes commonly repeat their past behavior.  Thus, it is  likely that the types, frequencies, and magnitudes of past activity  will be repeated in the future.  Among the possibilities for  renewed eruptive activity at Mount St. Helens are resumption of  dome growth, eruption of basaltic or andesitic tephra and lava  flows, or explosive eruptions of dacitic tephra and pyroclastic  flows in volumes that could be as large as or even larger than the  volume erupted in 1980.  Lahars (sediment-rich floods in volcanic  terrain) generated by snowmelt are likely to accompany any eruptive  activity.  Lahars may also be generated without an eruption by  intense storm runoff over erodible sediment, by landslides, or by  failure of the Castle Lake impoundment as a consequence of an  earthquake or heavy rains.  Neither a large debris avalanche nor a  major lateral blast like those of May 18, 1980 is likely now that  a deep, open crater has formed.       Sufficient time has elapsed since the last dome-building  eruption in October 1986 for magma in the conduit beneath the dome  to crystallize and form a plug.  The pressure needed to overcome  this blockage may exceed that of any eruption since May 18, 1980;  therefore, the next eruption may be initially explosive owing  simply to blockage of the conduit.  Several scenarios for renewed  eruptive activity notwithstanding, a conservative approach to  hazards assessment requires us to assume, until there is specific  evidence to the contrary, that the next eruption will be explosive  and as large as or larger than the eruption of May 18, 1980.      Future eruptions are certain.  Although we do not know when  the next one will occur, it should be planned for.   This report  delineates areas that are likely to be at risk (hazard zones)  during another major eruption.  It updates previous assessments,  taking into account both recent experience at erupting volcanoes  and topographic, hydrologic, and geologic changes initiated at  Mount St. Helens by the 1980 eruptions.  These changes include (1)  beheading of the summit, forming a truncated cone with a deep  crater open to the north, (2) a large and growing volume of snow  and ice in the crater, (3) the existence of a large, potentially  unstable, debris-dammed lake (Castle Lake) in a tributary to the  North Fork Toutle River, and (4) large volumes of erodible sediment  in most of the river valleys draining the volcano.           HAZARDOUS GEOLOGIC PROCESSES       This section describes the major hazardous geologic processes  that are likely to occur in the future at Mount St. Helens.  Any  or all may occur as consequences of future eruptions. However, one  potentially lethal process (lahars) can also be triggered by  noneruptive mechanisms and thus may occur with little warning.  We  do not address other noneruptive processes such as  rockfalls,  avalanches, and small debris flows that commonly produce local  hazards in areas of steep terrain, both volcanic and nonvolcanic.       Tephra Fall       During explosive eruptions, a mixture of hot volcanic gas and  tephra, which includes volcanic ash (sand-sized or finer particles  of volcanic rock) and larger fragments, is ejected rapidly into the  air from volcanic vents .  This plume of  rock fragments and  expanding gas not only jets upward but is commonly less dense than  the air and thus rises into the atmosphere until no longer buoyant.  (The May 18, 1980 tephra plume rose about 25 km [15 mi]  in less  than 30 min).  As the energy required to keep them in suspension  diminishes, the particles begin to fall out of the plume under the  influence of gravity.  Large fragments fall back to earth close to  the vent.  Finer (ash-size) particles drift downwind as a large  cloud, eventually falling to the ground to form a blanket-like ash  deposit that is generally thinner and finer-grained with increasing  distance away from the vent.  Large eruptions can produce tephra  thicknesses of many meters (yards) near the vent, with tephra  fragments ranging up to tens of centimeters (10-20 inches) in  diameter, whereas tephra deposits several hundred kilometers  (several hundred miles) downwind typically consist of a trace to a  few centimeters (few inches) of fine powder.      The major hazards of tephra fall are derived from (1) impact  of falling fragments, (2) suspension of  abrasive fine particles  in the air and water, and (3) burial of structures, transportation  routes, and vegetation.  As learned in the 1980 eruptions of Mount  St. Helens, tephra fall can cause severe social disruption over a  vast area.        Fragments larger than a few centimeters (1-2 in), that have  sufficient mass to cause severe injury or damage through impact,  generally fall within about 10 km (6 mi) of the vent. Thus, damaging  or lethal impact from falling tephra is likely only in the  immediate vicinity of Mount St. Helens.      Ash suspended in the air from a large eruption can be a major  source of aggravation and hazard even hundreds of kilometers (a few  hundred miles) downwind from its source, both during its initial  accumulation and later as fine dry ash is remobilized by wind or  passing vehicles.   Airborne ash (a) causes eye and respiratory  irritation for some people and can cause severe air-quality  problems at critical facilities such as hospitals; (b) can cause  severe visibility reduction, even complete darkness during  daylight hours, which can make driving particularly hazardous; (c)  can damage unprotected machinery, especially internal-combustion  engines; (d) can cause short circuits in electric-power  transmission lines; and (e) can endanger aircraft flying through  ash clouds, especially jet aircraft, which can completely lose  engine power.  Suspension of ash in water can lead to damage at  hydroelectric facilities, irrigation pumping stations, sewage- treatment facilities, and stormwater systems.       Burial by tephra can collapse roofs of buildings and other  structures, break power and telephone lines, and damage or kill  vegetation.  Wet tephra is 2 to 3 times heavier than dry uncompacted  tephra and adheres better to sloping surfaces.  Ten centimeters (4  inches) of wet tephra impose a load in the range of 100 to 125 kg/ m2 (approximately 20 to 25 lb/ft2), sufficient to cause some roofs  to collapse.        Pyroclastic Flows       Pyroclastic flows are avalanches of hot (300 - 800C [570 -  1470F]), dry, volcanic rock fragments and gases that descend a  volcano's flanks at speeds ranging from 10 to more than 100 meters  per second (20 to more than 200 miles per hour).  Owing to their  mass, high temperature, high speed, and great mobility, pyroclastic  flows are destructive and pose lethal hazard from incineration,  asphyxiation, burial, and impact.  Because of their high speed,  pyroclastic flows are difficult or impossible to escape.   Evacuation must take place before such events occur.     Just as mixtures of hot volcanic gas and tephra rise into the  atmosphere when the mixture is less dense than the surrounding air,  mixtures of hot volcanic rock fragments and gas that are more dense  than the surrounding atmosphere flow down the volcano flanks as  pyroclastic flows. Such flows can originate from high vertical  eruption columns, from low fountains of erupting pyroclastic  material that appear to ""boil over"" from the vent, and from  gravitational or explosive disruption of hot lava domes.  The first  two mechanisms operated during the explosive eruptions of 1980 at  Mount St. Helens and are likely again should eruptive activity be  resumed.  The third mechanism, disruption of a hot lava dome, has  operated at numerous times in the past at Mount St. Helens but would  be significant there only if new dome growth should become  established.     Driven by gravity, pyroclastic flows seek topographically low  areas and, beyond the steep flanks of the volcano, tend to be  channeled into valleys.  Pyroclastic flows from the May 18, 1980  eruption ran out only about 8 km (5 mi) from the vent.  As they  impinged on Johnston Ridge, they were deflected westward downvalley  and eastward to Spirit Lake.   During the past 4,000 years, during  which time the volcano's modern edifice formed, numerous  pyroclastic flows are known to have traveled at least as far as 10- 15 km (6-9 mi), and at least one older flow is known to have  traveled as much as 20 km (12 mi).  Although the present crater  geometry favors distribution of pyroclastic flows into the North  Fork Toutle River valley, all flanks of the volcano are subject to  pyroclastic-flow hazard during a large eruption.         Pyroclastic Surges       Pyroclastic surges are turbulent, relatively low-density (but  still denser than air), mixtures of gas and rock that flow above  the ground surface at high velocities similar to those of  pyroclastic flows.  Hot pyroclastic surges are generated similarly  to pyroclastic flows as well as by lateral blasts and as mobile,  turbulent ash clouds winnowed from pyroclastic flows. Hazards  resulting from pyroclastic surges include incineration,  destruction by high-velocity ash-laden winds, impact by rock  fragments, burial by surge deposits, exposure to noxious gases, and  asphyxiation.  Like pyroclastic flows, pyroclastic surges are too  fast-moving to escape; evacuation must take place before they  occur.     Because they are less dense, pyroclastic surges are less  constrained by topography than are pyroclastic flows.  Surges may  climb or surmount valley walls, affecting areas well beyond the  limits of pyroclastic flows.  For example, pyroclastic surges  surmounted Johnston Ridge and entered the drainage of South  Coldwater Creek on May 18, 1980, even though the related  pyroclastic flows were deflected by the steep north-facing  escarpment of the ridge.       The presence of water-saturated sediment beneath the crater  floor raises the potential for steam-driven explosions that could  be generated by intrusion of magma into the water-bearing material.   Such explosions may produce relatively low-temperature pyroclastic  surges that could flow at high speeds through the crater breach and  down the volcano?s north flank toward Spirit Lake and Johnston  Ridge.  Steam-driven explosions are likely during early stages of  the next eruption.        Explosive Ejection of Ballistic Projectiles       Volcanic explosions can impel rock fragments on ballistic  trajectories that may be counter or oblique to the wind direction.   Such events may occur either during or independently from an  ongoing magmatic eruption and are likely to occur without warning.   A blast related to emplacement of the Sugarbowl dome on the north  flank of Mount St. Helens about 1,200 years ago propelled ballistic  fragments as large as 5 cm (2 in) as far as 10 km (6 mi) from the  vent. More recently, a  series of relatively small steam-driven  explosions in 1989-91 threw hundreds of blocks, some as large as a  meter (yard), for distances of as much as 1 km (0.6 mi) from the  dome within the Mount St. Helens crater.  Similar explosions could  occur without warning in the future but become progressively less  likely with continued cooling of the dome's hot interior and the  subsurface conduit that supplied the magma for dome growth.        Lateral Blasts       A lateral blast is a volcanic explosion that has a significant  low-angle component and is principally directed toward a sector of  no more than 180.  Lateral blasts may generate complex pyroclastic  flows and surges and launch ballistic projectiles.  Previous  lateral blasts are known in two contexts at Mount St. Helens: (1)  blasts generated by abrupt landslide-induced decompression of a  shallow magma body and the hydrothermal system surrounding it  within a volcano; (2) explosions originating from sudden release  of gases at growing lava domes.       A massive landslide abruptly removed the volcano?s summit on  May 18, 1980, and the resulting decompression of shallow magma and  the hydrothermal system that enveloped it initiated the well-known,   highly destructive lateral blast.  The current shape of the  volcano?with its large crater and much lower summit makes a similar  landslide and massive laterally directed blast unlikely when  eruptive activity next resumes.      However, smaller lateral blasts could ensue if dome growth  recurs.  Explosions related to emplacement of the Sugarbowl dome  about 1,200 years ago generated pyroclastic flows that extended  several kilometers (miles) and impelled rock fragments at least 10  km (6 mi) from the vent.  Destructive effects of a lateral blast  that might occur from a new dome growing within the crater would  be directed northward.  Addition of a 50 percent safety factor to  the 10-km (6-mi) range identified for ballistic fragments from the  Sugarbowl blasts suggests that hazard from rock projectiles might  extend 15 km (9 mi) northward from the crater in laterally directed  explosions from a growing dome.  A comparable laterally directed  explosion could result from abrupt failure of the plug blocking the  1980-86 conduit under elevated pressure related to renewed magmatic  activity.          Lava Flows       Numerous elongate lava flows have issued from Mount St.  Helens.  Most have affected only areas within 10 km (6 mi) of the  summit, but two basalt flows that issued about 1,700 years ago  extended 16-17 km (c. 10 mi) from the volcano?s summit; one of them,  which flowed south to the Lewis River valley east of Cougar,  contains the Ape Cave lava tube.   Andesite lava flows, which were  erupted repeatedly during the 16th century and once again at the  beginning of the 19th century, were less fluid than the basalt and  extended only as far as 6 km (4 mi) from the volcano's summit.       Lava flows are controlled by the topography; they flow  downhill, becoming channeled into river valleys if they extend far  enough.  Thus, a lava flow affects only terrain that is downslope  from its vent, which could be either in the crater or anywhere on  the volcano?s flanks. A lava flow from a vent in the present crater  would be directed down the north flank of Mount St. Helens and  possibly into the upper part of the North Fork Toutle River valley.   Lava flows are destructive but generally not life-threatening  because they normally advance so slowly that people can walk or run  away from them.     Extremely viscous dacitic lava does not flow easily; it tends  to form  steep-sided lava domes over vents or very thick, stubby  lava flows extending away from vents.  On steep slopes like those  of a volcano's upper flanks, the steep margins of such domes or  stubby lava flows may collapse, spawning avalanches of hot volcanic  debris that generate pyroclastic flows and surges. Such events have  occurred repeatedly in the past at Mount St. Helens and would be  expected again if a dome grows on the upper flanks or fills the  crater.       Lahars        Lahars are rapidly flowing mixtures of water and rock debris  (at sediment concentrations higher than for normal floods or stream  flow) that originate from volcanoes.  They can range from dense,  viscous slurries resembling wet concrete and termed ""debris flows""  or ""mudflows"" (containing about two thirds sediment and one third  water by volume) to turbulent muddy floods that carry relatively  little sediment.  Lahars can begin as sudden releases of large  volumes of water or as large landslides of saturated soil and rock  debris. Potential sources of large volumes of water include runoff  from extremely heavy rainfall, rapid melting of snow and ice, and  outbreaks of water from lakes.  All of these mechanisms have  produced lahars at Mount St. Helens in the past.      Lahars are gravity-controlled flows that are channeled into  valleys as they move downhill, and they can flow about twice as  fast as water in channels of similar depth and slope.  Lahars  triggered at Mount St. Helens in 1980 were 3 to 15 m (10 to 50 ft)  deep and traveled at speeds of 20 to 40 m/s (45 to 90 mph) on the  volcano?s steep flanks; in valleys more than about 10 km (6 miles)  from the volcano, they flowed typically at 10 to 20 m/s (22 to 45  mph).  In addition, lahars can get bigger as they move downstream  by incorporating additional sediment and water en route (called  bulking), commonly increasing in volume by a factor of 3 to 5.  As  lahars get farther from a volcano, they slow down and spread out  in the wider, flatter river valleys, often burying roads, bridges,  and buildings with their deposits.  Past lahars at Mount St. Helens  have traveled from 50 to 100 km (30 to 60 miles), often reaching  the Columbia River via the Toutle, Kalama or Lewis Rivers.     Lahars threaten lives and property, both on the flanks of  volcanoes and far downstream in the valleys that drain volcanoes.   Lahars are a greater threat to life and property in communities of  the Cowlitz and lower Toutle River drainages than any other  volcanic phenomenon.  Damage is done by impact from large boulders  or logs carried in the flows, by high drag and buoyancy forces  imposed by the dense fluid, by abrasion, and by burial.  Lahars  commonly destroy mature forests and any human-made structures in  their paths, including bridges, dams, roads, pipelines, and  buildings.  They can also bury extensive areas of agricultural  land, fill stream channels (decreasing a channel?s capacity to  safely carry normal high runoff), and block shipping lanes in  navigable river channels.  In contrast to pyroclastic flows and  surges, lahars have sharply defined upper limits in well-defined  valleys, and in many cases people can quickly climb or drive to  safety by evacuating the valley floor.  Future lahars at Mount St.  Helens can be expected to have travel times approximately as shown  in  Table 1.

Wind direction and  velocity, along with the vigor and duration of the eruption,  control the location, size, and shape of the area affected by  tephra fall.  Wind direction and velocity vary with both time and  altitude, making it impossible to predict the velocity and  direction of tephra transport more than a few hours in advance.   Westerly winds prevail; thus, significant tephra accumulation from  a single eruption is more likely east than west of Mount St. Helens    (fig. 2).   The calculated probability that ten or more centimeters  (four or more inches) of tephra from a large eruption will fall as  far as 60 km (40 mi) directly east of Mount St. Helens is 20  percent; the probability that such an eruption would deposit ten  or more centimeters (four or more inches) 60 km (40 mi) directly  west of Mount St. Helens is less, between 1 and 2 percent.     Mount St. Helens has repeatedly produced voluminous tephra and  has erupted much more frequently in recent geologic time than any  other volcano in the Cascade Range.  Thus, its influence dominates  the annual-probability distribution in Washington and Oregon of ten  or more centimeters (four or more inches) of tephra accumulation  from eruptions throughout the Cascade Range    (fig. 3).                Figure 2:    Map of Washington and Oregon showing the percentage  probability of accumulation of ten or more centimeters (four or  more inches) of tephra from a large eruption of Mount St. Helens.                      Figure 2:    Map of Washington and Oregon showing the percentage  probability of accumulation of ten or more centimeters (four or  more inches) of tephra from a large eruption of Mount St. Helens  (star). Probability distribution reflects interplay of two  variables: wind direction and likelihood that a large eruption will  deposit ten or more centimeters of tephra at a give distance.                         Figure 3:    Annual probability of accumulation of ten or more  centimeters (four or more inches) of tephra in Washington and  Oregon from eruptions throughout the Cascade Range.                    Figure 3:    Annual probability of accumulation of ten or more  centimeters (four or more inches) of tephra in Washington and  Oregon from eruptions throughout the Cascade Range. Probability  distribution reflects the frequency of explosive eruptions at each  major Cascade volcano, the variability in the thickness of tephra  that could be deposited at various downwind distances, and the  variability in wind direction.                 Flowage Hazard       The accompanying flowage-hazard zonation map shows areas  potentially threatened by flowage hazards from an eruption as large  as any since 1480 A.D., from intense posteruption rainfall, or from  an outbreak of Castle Lake.  The map draws extensively on  previously published hazard zonations (Crandell and Mullineaux,  1978; Miller, Mullineaux, and Crandell, 1981), which were strongly  based on the geologic record of past eruptive events at Mount St.  Helens.  In addition, the current zonation reflects both changes  in the landscape as a consequence of the 1980-86 eruptions and  experience with recent volcanic eruptions at Mount St. Helens and  elsewhere.     The flowage-hazard zonation map portrays three zones: (1) a  proximal zone of high-concentration (high-density) flows, which  are strongly channeled into topographically low areas; (2) a  proximal zone of low-concentration (low-density) flows  (pyroclastic surges), which are appreciably less constrained by  topography; and (3) a distal zone, where well-channelized lahars  represent the only significant flowage hazard.  The proximal zones  (1 and 2) are subject to the full gamut of hazards--pyroclastic  flows and surges, explosive ejection of rock fragments, laterally  directed blasts, lava flows, and lahars.  Most of the eruptive  processes within the zones 1 and 2 occur so rapidly that it is too  late to evacuate after an eruption has begun; in these areas,  evacuation must occur before the eruption begins.       As shown in 1980, a single eruption is unlikely to affect the  entire zoned area, but evidence before an eruption will probably  be insufficient to identify which parts will be spared. Further,  it is important to understand that hazard-zone boundaries are  approximate.  They indicate the most likely maximum extents of  flows, based on past eruptive behavior or on results of numerical  models, and they assume the next eruption will be explosive and as  large or larger than the May 18, 1980 eruption.  The actual extents  of future flows will depend upon factors such as volume, mobility,  velocity, and exact mixture composition, all of which are difficult  to forecast.  Therefore, one must not assume that hazard-zone  boundaries mark well-defined limits beyond which there is little  or no risk of harm.            Flowage-Hazard Zone 1         Zone 1 represents the area vulnerable to passage of high- concentration (high-density) flows, including pyroclastic flows,  lava flows, and the proximal parts of lahars.  Such flows can spread  across broad sectors of the volcano's upper slopes, but they become  well channelized in the major drainages at lower elevations.  The  boundaries are similar to those shown by Miller and others (1981)  after the 1980 eruptions, and they are based on field evidence for  the distribution of past flows at Mount St. Helens and other  volcanoes.         Flowage-Hazard Zone 2         Zone 2 represents the area that could be overrun by  pyroclastic surges, which are low-concentration (low-density)  flows that are much less constrained by topography than are the  high-concentration flows.  Crandell and Mullineaux (1978) showed a  similar but slightly less extensive zone for ash clouds (surges)  associated with pyroclastic flows, based on their knowledge of the  distribution of ash-cloud deposits in Mount St. Helens? geologic  record.  We expand the zone  slightly on the basis of experience  with highly mobile pyroclastic surges that leave thin deposits  unlikely to be preserved in the geologic record.  For example, a  dilute surge at Redoubt Volcano, Alaska, in February 1990 deposited  only a few millimeters of ash and small pebbles, fragments of  transported, charred wood, and a scorched and battered bird carcass  on a ridge crest 10 km (6 mi) distant and 700 m (2,300 ft) above  the intervening valley bottom.  The drop in elevation from the vent  to the ridge crest was only 1,300 m  (4,300 ft); a similarly mobile  surge, if generated from an eruption column onto the south flank  of Mount St. Helens, would probably have reached Swift Reservoir.          Flowage-Hazard Zone 3         Zone 3 includes the intermediate and lower reaches of valleys  that could be inundated by lahars.  The maximum size of a potential  lahar is limited principally by the amount of available water,  which can be estimated for the North Fork Toutle River (see below).   However, several major uncertainties are involved in estimating  potential lahar size.  The zone-3 hazard boundaries in the North  Fork Toutle, main stem Toutle, and Cowlitz Rivers are based on  previous numerical modeling studies for a hypothetical outbreak of  Castle Lake (Laenen and Orzol, 1987; MacArthur and others, 1990),  taking into account the effects of the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers' Sediment Retention Structure (SRS) on a lahar coming  down the valley.  If an outbreak of Castle Lake were to occur during  a large storm or during an eruption that released water from the  crater, a flood larger than that indicated by the zone-3 boundaries  could be anticipated.  Hazard boundaries for the other river  valleys are based on mapped limits of past flows and the expected  mitigative effect of the hydroelectric reservoirs in the Lewis  River valley.         Potential Water Sources for Lahars at Mount St. Helens         If a large lahar were to occur at Mount St. Helens within the  next few decades, the mechanism most likely to be responsible would  be rapid melting of snow and ice in the crater or a sudden outbreak  of Castle Lake.  Either mechanism would produce a lahar only in the  North Fork Toutle River (and downstream).  Rainfall is seldom  intense enough to directly produce lahars in the Cascades, and the  flows produced by this mechanism tend to be fairly small. Likewise,  any landslides occurring on the flanks of Mount St. Helens are  likely to be relatively small, especially now that the volcano's  height has been lowered by the 1980 eruption.         Snow and Ice at Mount St. Helens          A large volume of snow and ice is presently accumulating in  the Mount St. Helens crater, protected by the shade of the high,  steep crater walls.  This accumulation provides a growing potential  water source for lahars in the North Fork Toutle River valley    (Fig. 4).     It is already mixed with rock debris eroded from the crater  walls, and this debris would augment the formation of a lahar.  It  is possible that a large eruption could melt most or all of this  snow and ice in a matter of tens of minutes.  A very small eruption  in 1982 rapidly melted enough snow and ice in the crater to trigger  a 4 million m3 (5.2 million yd3) flood that transformed into a lahar  and flowed all the way to the Cowlitz River.  At the present time  (1995), about 53 million m3 (70 million yd3) of snow and ice has  accumulated.  If completely melted, this would produce about 38  million m3 (50 million yd3) of water.  At the present rate of  accumulation, the volume of snow and ice will double in about 15  years.       Permanent and seasonal snow and ice also blanket the outer  flanks of Mount St. Helens. A sufficient volume exists there in  winter or spring to produce flank lahars similar in magnitude to  those of May 18, 1980, if another large eruption were to occur.   Lahars formed on the outer flanks can be expected to be  substantially smaller than flows generated in the crater.                Figure 4:    Volume of ice and snow in the Mount St. Helens crater.                     Figure 4:    Volume of ice and snow in the Mount St. Helens crater.  Measured data (dots) from H.H. Mills (written comm., 1994); dashed  line, extrapolated.                      Lakes in Valleys Draining Mount St. Helens         A number of natural and human-made lakes exist close to the  volcano in the North Fork Toutle and Lewis River valleys.  The  uppermost lake in the Lewis River valley, Swift Reservoir, receives  drainage from the volcano via Swift Creek, Pine Creek, and Muddy  River.  In 1980, lahars descending these streams dumped about 14  million m3 (18 million yd3) of sediment and water into the lake,  abruptly raising the lake level 0.85 m (2.8 ft).  Because the  operators of the reservoir, Pacific Power and Light, lowered the  lake level about 18 m (23 ft) below normal in anticipation of  possible lahars, the small lake-level rise and the 0.4 m (1.3 ft)  accompanying wave posed no threat to the dam.  It is assumed that  (1) future lahars reaching Swift Reservoir would not be appreciably  larger than those of May 18, 1980, and (2) dam operators would again  take precautionary steps to lower lake level if Mount St. Helens  were to show signs of imminent eruption.  Therefore, Swift  Reservoir and the downstream lakes (Yale Lake and Lake Merwin) are  not considered to be at risk from lahars.       Three natural lakes in the North Fork Toutle River, formed by  natural debris dams during the 1980 eruption, have required  modifications to their outlets in order to prevent catastrophic  outbreaks.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers provided (1) a tunnel  outlet to Spirit Lake, (2) a bedrock spillway channel at Coldwater  Lake, and (3) a reinforced spillway channel at Castle Lake to hold  the levels of these lakes constant and to prevent them from  overtopping their erodible natural dams.  A recent study (Roeloffs,  1994), however, has verified earlier conclusions that the natural  dam at Castle Lake is potentially susceptible to modes of failure  other than overtopping and, under certain conditions, is only  marginally stable.  Castle Lake contains about 23 million m3 (30  million yd3) of water and would produce a large lahar if the  blockage were to fail.  We assume that an outbreak of Castle Lake  is a potential hazard, and the inundation levels of a numerically  modeled lahar with an initial magnitude of 37,400 m3/s (1.32  million cfs) were used to produce the Zone-3 hazard boundaries in  the North Fork Toutle, main Toutle, and Cowlitz Rivers.  This model  lahar (for which we conservatively assumed the SRS ""full"" condition  and a bulking factor of 3.3) has an intermediate magnitude within  the range of possible lahars modeled by MacArthur and others  (1990b) for a potential outbreak of Castle Lake. Channel cross  sections from a previous modeling study (Laenen and Orzol, 1987)  were used to translate flow magnitude at different points into  approximate lahar-inundation levels.          Effect of the SRS Sediment Dam on Downvalley Lahar Hazard         The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed a sediment dam,  called the Sediment Retention Structure or SRS, in the North Fork  Toutle River to trap the large volumes of sediment washing down the  river from the fresh volcanic deposits near Mount St. Helens.  The  SRS is located just upstream of the Green River confluence and was  completed in 1989.  The 56-m- (184-ft) high dam has already lost  more than half of its original freeboard due to infilling by  sediment and is expected to be completely full (to the spillway  crest) by about 2005.  The remaining capacity and the dam?s ability  to trap a lahar decrease every year.  The reinforced spillway was  designed to safely pass a flood discharge of 6,460 m3/s (228,000  cfs).       The numerical modeling by MacArthur and others, (1990b)  indicates that a range of lahar magnitudes is possible, depending  on assumptions made about the level of Castle Lake, the mode of  breaching of the debris dam, the amount of sediment picked up by  the flood to form a lahar (bulking factor), and the level of  sediment fill behind the SRS.  Given that Castle Lake is now fixed  at its ""full"" level, flow through the SRS spillway could vary from  1,350 m3/s (47,600 cfs) to 6,710 m3/s (237,000 cfs), depending on  whether the reservoir was partly full of sediment (1990 existing  condition) or completely full and depending on whether lahar volume  increased 2.5, 3.3, or 4.5 times due to incorporation of eroded  sediment.  At the SRS-outflow discharge considered most likely by  the Corps of Engineers (2,980 m3/s [105,200 cfs]), the lahar  reaching the Cowlitz River would be approximately equivalent to a  100-year flood.  Such a lahar would be fully contained within the  channel at both Kelso-Longview and at Castle Rock.  At the high end  of the range, flooding would occur all along the Cowlitz River both  downstream and slightly upstream of the Toutle River confluence.   The modeled lahar chosen to define the Zone 3 hazard boundaries  (bulking factor 3.3; SRS ""full"") would be contained within channel  at Kelso-Longview but not at Castle Rock nor in parts of the Toutle  River valley between the SRS and the Cowlitz River.           The present water-equivalent volume in the Mount St. Helens  crater is 65 percent larger than the volume of lake water in Castle  Lake, but it is also about 10 km farther upstream.  We assume that  the additional distance would attenuate lahar peak discharge coming  from the crater to roughly the scale of a lahar that would be  produced by an outbreak of Castle Lake. Therefore, the potential  Castle Lake lahar is used to delineate lahar-hazard zones on the  map.  However, the volume of snow and ice in the crater is steadily  growing and steadily increasing the possibility of creating a flood  too large to be contained by the SRS.  At the same time, the SRS  is steadily being filled in with sediment and decreasing in its  ability to trap lahars.  For example, in about 15 years the crater  could have approximately twice as much snow and ice as now, and an  eruption then could potentially produce a lahar roughly 100 percent  larger than the zone-3 model lahar. Earlier modeling by MacArthur  and others (1990a) showed that a lahar 84 percent larger than the  zone-3 model lahar could be expected to overtop the SRS by about 3  m (10 ft) if the reservoir were full of sediment.  Overtopping of  the N-1 sediment dam by a lahar in 1982 heavily damaged and breached  that structure in two places.  Because of the many uncertainties  involved in trying to quantify these predictions, such as the  continued rate of infilling of crater ice and snow, the melt rate  of ice and snow during an eruption, the expected bulking factor for  a lahar coming from the crater, and the size and type of the next  eruption, it is impossible to predict exactly when a potential  lahar might be large enough to overtop the SRS.  However, a lahar  of such a magnitude is possible sometime within the next few  decades.  Overtopping (and possible breaching) of the SRS could  result in significantly greater lahar flooding in the Toutle and  Cowlitz Rivers than is postulated on the accompanying hazard map.

Some kinds of events, such as crater-wall avalanches or steam- driven explosions from the dome have occurred without warning in  the past and may do so again.  However, our experience since early  1980 at Mount St. Helens and elsewhere indicates that the  monitoring is sufficient for us to detect the ascent of fresh magma  that must take place before another large eruption.  As in the past,  interpretation of phenomena related to magma ascent will enable us  to provide warnings and updated assessments of hazards.      Lahar and flood hazards are monitored by the U.S. Geological  Survey and the National Weather Service; the latter agency has  responsibility for providing warnings of floods, including lahars.   Currently monitoring includes: (1) lake-level gages on Castle,  Coldwater, and Spirit Lakes, (3) sensors to measure movement on the  Castle Lake debris dam, (3) flow-vibration sensors in the North  Fork Toutle River valley to detect passage of lahars or floods, and  (4) streamflow gages in the North Fork, South Fork, and main  channel of the Toutle River and in the Muddy River.

GX004-44-3032610	"Contaminants in the Mississippi River  U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY CIRCULAR 1133  Reston, Virginia, 1995  Edited by Robert H. Meade        Setting: Geology, Hydrology, Sediments, and Engineering of the Mississippi River    By Robert H. Meade        Geologic Settings      (Click on image for a larger version, 132K)        Figure 4. --   The Mississippi River follows the trend of an ancient continental rift system down the center of North America, flowing through different landscapes that record different geologic histories (Redfern, 1983).  Three vignettes (A, B, and C) in this figure exemplify some of the different processes that shaped the landscapes during the latest ice ages and during the 10,000 years since the ice melted away.         A          The Upper Mississippi River (""Upper"" is conventionally assigned to the Mississippi above its confluence with the Ohio) flows for much of its length through a valley 1-10 km wide between bluffs that stand 50-100 m above the river and its fringing flood plain.  The painting, done in 1844 by John Casper Wild, shows the bluffs above the confluence of the Minnesota (left) and Mississippi (right) Rivers, at the site of Fort Snelling, which is now included in the city of Minneapolis.  The bluff-bordered river valleys here and farther down the Upper Mississippi were formed by a combination of glacial and riverine processes.  The great ice ages of the Pleistocene epoch gave the basin of the Upper Mississippi much of the shape that we consider characteristic today.  Pre-existing river valleys were widened and deepened by the ice as it pushed its way south.  Between and after the ice ages, the rivers transported and rearranged the sediments in the valleys by meandering across them and constructing islands and flood plains.  The main valley in the painting (upper left to lower right) formed mostly when the ice-age predecessor to the Minnesota River (called Glacial River Warren) was the main outlet of a large lake, Lake Agassiz, that was dammed along its northern margin in southern Canada by the retreating ice sheet.  The small notch out of which the Mississippi River is flowing (upper right in painting) was cut, mostly after the demise of Glacial River Warren, by a retreating headcut that can be seen today at St. Anthony Falls, 13 km upriver of the confluence with the Minnesota River.        B          The Lower Mississippi River flows along and through a wide alluvial plain formed by the river and its predecessors.  Vignette B (taken from R.T. Saucier, 1991) shows the contrast in stream patterns between those formed during the latest ice age (left) and those formed since the ice ages.  Typical of glacial meltwater rivers heavily laden with coarser sediments are the so-called ""valley trains"" like those shown in the western half of the vignette.  Even though no great river has flowed there for thousands of years, the braided and anastomosing pattern still shows on the landscape and is clearly visible from the air.  The present pattern, in which the Mississippi River meanders through a belt 20-30 km wide defined by the traces and remnants of older meanders through which the river once flowed, is typical of most of the length of the lower river.           C          Where the Mississippi River meets the Gulf of Mexico, its delta has a complex history that has been described in classic papers by C.R. Kolb and J.R. Van Lopik (1958, 1966).  The succession of different river channels and delta lobes during the last 5,000 years are numbered from oldest (1) to youngest (7) in Vignette C.  Let John McPhee (1989, p. 5-6) recount the story:         ""Southern Louisiana exists in its present form because the Mississippi River has jumped here and there within an arc about two hundred miles wide, like a pianist playing with one hand-frequently and radically changing course, surging over the left or the right bank to go off in utterly new directions.  Always it is the river's purpose to get to the Gulf by the shortest and steepest gradient.  As the mouth advances southward and the river lengthens, the gradient declines, the current slows, and sediment builds up the bed. Eventually, it builds up so much that the river spills to one side. Major shifts of that nature have tended to occur roughly once a millennium.  The Mississippi's main channel of three thousand years ago is now the quiet water of Bayou Teche [3], which mimics the shape of the Mississippi......Eight hundred years before the birth of Christ, the channel was captured from the east [4].  It shifted abruptly and flowed in that direction for about a thousand years.  In the second century A.D., it was captured again, and taken south, by the now unprepossessing Bayou Lafourche [5], which, by the year 1000, was losing its hegemony to the river's present course, through the region that would be known as Plaquemines [6, 7].""            Water Discharge      (Click on image for a larger version, 99K)          Figure 5. --   The Mississippi River discharges an average of 520 cubic kilometers of water each year past the cities of Vicksburg and Natchez, Mississippi.  This represents the greatest amount of water discharged by the river while it still is confined to a single channel, but it does not represent all water that the Mississippi River system discharges to the Gulf of Mexico.  The river bifurcates 77 km below Natchez, and the lesser of its two main distributaries is joined by another significant tributary, the Red River.  The two outlets of the Mississippi River eventually discharge a combined average of 580 cubic kilometers per year (or about 420 billion gallons per day) of freshwater to the Gulf of Mexico.  This discharge ranks seventh in the world, being exceeded only by those of the Amazon, Congo (or Zaire), Orinoco, Yangtze, the combined Ganges-Brahmaputra, and Yenisey Rivers.         A     Not all parts of the Mississippi River drainage basin contribute water in equal measure.  Nearly one-half the water discharged to the Gulf is contributed by the Ohio River and its tributaries (including the Tennessee) whose combined drainage areas constitute only one-sixth of the total area drained by the Mississippi.  By contrast, the Missouri River drains 43 percent of the total area but contributes only 12 percent of the total water.  As the Mississippi flows southward from its headwaters in the northern Midwest, its discharge is more than doubled by the waters it receives from the Illinois and Missouri Rivers.  This combined discharge, in turn, is more than doubled again as it joins the waters of the Ohio River.        B     Just as the spatial distribution of sources of water in the Mississippi River is uneven, so is the temporal distribution of river flow.  Shown here are the yearly flows of the Mississippi since 1930 at Keokuk, Iowa, and since 1931 at Vicksburg, Mississippi.  Keokuk is at the Iowa-Missouri State line, 235 and 270 km, respectively, up the Mississippi from its confluences with the Illinois and Missouri Rivers.  Vicksburg is downriver of the mouth of the Arkansas River and upriver of the Atchafalaya diversion (see fig. 10B), and the discharges recorded at Vicksburg represent the largest and most integrated flows measured in the Mississippi River system.  The two graphs are drawn so that the long-term mean discharges at the two stations are represented equally; although the mean discharges at the two stations differ by a factor of nine, the scales and ranges of variability can be compared directly by simple visual inspection.  Wet years and dry years at the two cities generally coincide.  The range of flow variation is somewhat less extreme at Vicksburg than at Keokuk, which is a reflection of the damping influence of flows from the intervening large tributaries, especially the Illinois, Missouri, Ohio, and Arkansas Rivers.  The ratio between the extreme maximum and minimum yearly discharges shown here (1973 compared to 1934) is 5.5 at Keokuk but only 3.1 at Vicksburg.       C     Average seasonal differences in river discharge are on the same order as the extreme annual differences between wet and dry years.  Shown here are mean monthly discharges at Keokuk and Vicksburg for the same periods of record as shown in B.  In nearly all years along the length of the Mississippi River, mean discharges during the high-water months can be expected to be about three times the discharges during the low-water months.  At Keokuk, spring runoff usually begins quickly, in response to the melting of ice on the river.  At Vicksburg, the usually high flows from the Ohio River during the months of December through March give a more gradual beginning to the annual peak of spring runoff.       Suspended-Sediment Discharge      (Click on image for a larger version, 83K)     Figure 6. --  The Mississippi River now discharges an average of about 200 million metric tons of suspended sediment per year past Vicksburg and eventually to the Gulf of Mexico.  This sediment discharge to the ocean ranks about sixth in the world today, being equaled or exceeded by those of four rivers of Asia (the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers of China, the Ganges-Brahmaputra of India and Bangladesh, and probably the Irrawaddy River of Burma) and two rivers of South America (the Amazon River of Brazil and possibly the Magdalena River of Colombia).          A          The suspended-sediment loads carried by the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico have decreased by one-half since the Mississippi Valley was first settled by European colonists.  This decrease has happened mostly since 1950, as the largest natural sources of sediment in the drainage basin were cut off from the Mississippi River main stem by the construction of large reservoirs on the Missouri and Arkansas Rivers (see fig. 8).  This large decrease in sediments from the western tributaries was counterbalanced somewhat by a five- to tenfold increase in sediment loads in the Ohio River-an increase that has resulted from deforestation and rowcrop farming.  Further complicating the picture today is the controlled diversion of part of the water and sediment from the Mississippi River below Vicksburg into the Old River Outflow Channel and the Atchafalaya River (see fig. 10B).  The average suspended-sediment discharges portrayed for 1980-90 are taken mainly from the extensive compilations of M.P. Keown and his colleagues (1981, 1986) and of R.S. Parker (1988).        B          Temporal variation of suspended-sediment discharge in the Mississippi River is more pronounced than that of water discharge (compare with fig. 5B).  Shown here are the yearly totals of suspended sediment discharged past three long-term monitoring stations: Burlington, Iowa, 335 km upriver of the confluence with the Missouri River; St. Louis, Missouri, 25 km downriver of the confluence with the Missouri River; Tarbert Landing, Mississippi, 13 km downriver of the Atchafalaya diversion at Old River.  Sediment discharges shown for Burlington and Tarbert Landing are based on data of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Rock Island and New Orleans Districts).  Although records of sediment at all three stations began some years prior to 1959, only partial records are shown here to eliminate the confusion that might have been introduced by including pre-reservoir sediment discharges at St. Louis (see fig. 8) and pre-diversion sediment discharges at Tarbert Landing (see fig. 10B).  The three graphs are drawn so that the long-term mean sediment discharges at all three stations are represented equally and the scales and ranges of variability may be compared by simple visual inspection.  Years of high and low sediment discharges generally coincide at all three stations, but the range of year-to-year variation is more extreme in the upper river than in the lower river. The ratios between extreme maximum and minimum yearly suspended-sediment discharges for the periods of record shown here are 11.7 at Burlington, 9.2 at St. Louis, and only 2.8 at Tarbert Landing. Even during 1988 and 1989, when sediment discharges in the upper river were especially small, the Ohio River contributed enough sediment to damp the extremes of year-to-year variation at Tarbert Landing.        C     Average seasonal differences in river-sediment discharges are of the same order as extreme annual differences between wet and dry years in the Upper Mississippi, and they exceed the range of year-to-year differences in the Lower Mississippi.  Shown here are the monthly average suspended-sediment discharges at Burlington, St. Louis, and Tarbert Landing for the same periods of record as shown in B. In the Upper Mississippi River (Burlington), average suspended-sediment discharges during the high-water months following ice breakup are nearly ten times greater than discharges during midwinter months when the river usually is covered with ice.  In the Lower Mississippi (Tarbert Landing), the late winter-early spring runoff from the Ohio River contributes sediment during the months of December through March.  Even with this temporal offset in tributary contributions, the maximum monthly sediment discharge (March) in the lower river averages five times greater than the minimum monthly discharge (September).          Particle Sizes of Sediments      (Click on image for a larger version, 83K)     Figure 7.--  Sediment particles in the Mississippi River range in size from the very finest clays or colloids to coarse sand and gravel.  Different sizes of particles are found in suspension and on the river bed, and the interrelations between the sediments being transported in suspension and those stored or being transported along the riverbed are complex and variable.  The finest particles play the largest role in the transport and storage of toxic contaminants.          A          In the freely flowing reaches of the Mississippi River downstream from St. Louis, part of the suspended-sediment load interacts with the channel bed and part of it is independent of any such interaction. The examples shown here are data collected from the Mississippi River at Thebes, Illinois, on June 10, 1989, and at Vicksburg, Mississippi, on March 27, 1989.  The channel bed at these two sites (and through most of the 1850-km length of the Mississippi between St. Louis and the Gulf of Mexico) consists almost entirely of sand and fine gravel, with few particles, if any, finer than 0.063 mm (millimeter) in diameter.  Some of the finest sand (mostly 0.125-0.25 mm) is mobilized from the channel bed to become part of the suspended sediment; hydraulic engineers refer to such sand in suspension as ""bed-material load"" because it usually represents an exchange of sand particles between the river waters and the beds over which they flow.  Most of the sediment in suspension, however, is finer than sand.  To aid in understanding the chemistry of the suspended matter, we have divided the fine suspended sediment into two fractions called ""silt"" and ""colloid."" The division between the two fractions is here defined arbitrarily at about 0.001 mm.  The relative volumes of silt and colloid shown in the figure represent the sizes of the individual particles after they have been disaggregated in the laboratory with a dispersing agent.  In the river itself, most of the colloid-size particles are found in aggregates that are large enough to be transported and deposited as silt particles.        B          In the Upper Mississippi River, which has been dammed in order to form a series of lakes to provide depth sufficient for barge navigation (see fig. 10A), the sizes of the particles in both the bed sediments and suspended sediments are distributed differently from those in the unimpounded reaches of the lower river.  The examples shown here are data collected from the Mississippi River at Hastings, Minnesota, in the upper end of navigation Pool 3 on October 10, 1991, and from the nonchannel areas of lower Pool 3 on October 11, 1991; and from the Mississippi River near Winfield, Missouri, at the upper end of Pool 26 on July 24, 1991, and from the nonchannel areas of lower-middle Pool 26 on November 1, 1991.  In the navigation channels, the bed sediments consist largely of sand, as they do in the channels of the freely flowing lower river.  Suspended sediments, however, consist almost entirely of silt and colloidal particles and contain very little sand except during floods.  In the shallow nonchannel areas of the navigation pools, which cover the former flood plains of the upper river, the bed sediment is typically intermediate in size-finer than the bed material in the main channels but generally coarser than the bulk of the sediment in suspension.         Effects of Reservoirs      (Click on image for a larger version, 99K)    Figure 8.--  Reservoirs reduce the sediment discharges of the Mississippi River and its tributaries by trapping sediment that otherwise would have been transported downriver.          A          The Missouri River has been the principal supplier of sediment to the Mississippi River since the end of the last ice age.  The graphs show the annual discharges of suspended sediment measured by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the USGS at three gaging stations on the Missouri River and two gaging stations on the Mississippi River over a period of about four decades.  After five large dams were completed for hydroelectric power and irrigation above Yankton, South Dakota, between 1953 and 1963, the discharge of sediment from the Upper Missouri River Basin virtually was stopped.  Following the closure of Fort Randall Dam and Gavins Point Dam in 1953, downriver sediment discharges were diminished immediately, and the effect could be observed all the way down to the mouth of the Mississippi River. Sediment discharges to the Gulf of Mexico in 1992 were less than one-half of what they were before 1953.         B     In this downriver view (looking west-southwest) of Lake Cumberland, a reservoir on the Cumberland River in Kentucky, sediment-laden brown water can be seen flowing into the upper end of the lake during late winter (February 28, 1988); the sediment gradually settles out to leave blue water farther down the lake.        C     Deltas form where rivers flow into reservoirs, especially if the inflowing rivers transport substantial amounts of sand.  This large sand delta has formed where the Canadian River flows into Lake Eufala, a large reservoir in eastern Oklahoma near where the Canadian River joins the Arkansas River.  The view is down Lake Eufala (looking east-northeast) in early spring (March 25, 1988).          Engineering Activities      (Click on image for a larger version, 99K)    Figure 9. --  For more than 270 years, the banks and the channel of the Mississippi River have been engineered for various purposes: originally, starting about 1720, for flood control; eventually, starting about a century later, for navigation.           A          The Lower Mississippi River from Cairo, Illinois, to the Gulf of Mexico is constrained by a system of flood-control levees that is longer than the Great Wall of China.  The Z-shaped levee in this photograph (view north) separates the active flood plain of the Mississippi River (left of levee) from intensively cultivated cropland in the fertile ""Delta"" region of Mississippi about 30 km upriver of Vicksburg.        B     Dikes and wing dams are constructed to focus the main flow of the river into the navigation channels, and they encourage sediment to deposit in areas of the river that lie outside the navigation channels.  These dikes have allowed sandbars to grow and stabilize into permanent islands along the right (western) bank of the Mississippi River about 10 km upriver of Cape Girardeau, Missouri. The sediment stored behind and between dikes such as these is virtually immobilized and is unlikely to be resuspended for transport downriver during the foreseeable future.         C          Bank-protection measures are applied along most of the Mississippi to impede erosion and to maintain the shape of the navigation channel. Shown here is an articulated concrete mat that is laid like carpet on the riverbank by a special machine.  Other banks along the Mississippi are stabilized by boulder-size rock fragments that are quarried from bluffs near the banks of the Upper Mississippi and brought downriver by barge.  One effect of the bank stabilization is to prevent the remobilization of sediment previously deposited on the flood plains of the river.       D          Despite the controls on water flow and sedimentation that are provided by dikes and other engineering works, some reaches of the river require periodic dredging to maintain the depth of water necessary for navigation.  In the Lower Mississippi, as shown in the photograph, the dredged material is frequently piped out to the fast flowing part of the river to be discharged.  In the Upper Mississippi, where sand is frequently the material dredged, large spoil banks and artificial islands have been built alongside the main navigation channel.        Major Engineering Works      (Click on image for a larger version, 83K)    Figure 10.--  The two most prominent examples of river engineering on the Mississippi are the lock-and-dam system on the upper river and the Atchafalaya diversion on the lower river.          A     The entire 1080-km reach of the Upper Mississippi River between Minneapolis, Minnesota, and St. Louis, Missouri, is controlled for barge navigation by a series of 29 lock-and-dam structures (O'Brien and others, 1992).  One of these structures-the first to be completed, in 1913, at Keokuk, Iowa-was built to impound water to generate hydroelectric power.  The other 28 structures were built, mostly during the 1930s, to maintain a minimum river depth of 9 feet (2.7 meters) for barge navigation.        Before the dams were built, navigation during low-water periods was extremely hazardous, if not impossible, across rapids such as those at Keokuk and Rock Island, and it was difficult in many other reaches of the upper river.  The lower reaches of the navigation pools, such as the one shown in the photograph, are shallow lakes in which former flood plains, previously inundated for infrequent short periods, are now permanently under water.  These shallow lakes are storage areas for fine-grained sediments and the contaminants adsorbed to them.        B          About 500 km upstream from its main outlet to the Gulf of Mexico, the Lower Mississippi River is partly diverted into the Atchafalaya River. About one-fourth, on average, of the water that flows down the Mississippi River past Vicksburg is diverted at a place called ""Old River"" to join the waters of the Red and Ouachita Rivers in forming the Atchafalaya River (McPhee, 1989).  The diagram on the lower right is an excerpt of figure 5A that has been enlarged and rotated 90 degrees so that the direction of flow is to the right. The accompanying photograph (view east, June 1991) shows the Mississippi River flowing from center left to upper right.  In the foreground is the Old River Outflow Channel (flow west toward the viewer), an artificial channel that joins the Red River just off the lower edge of the photograph to form the Atchafalaya.  Three artificial channels, each containing a control structure, divert water from the Mississippi River into the Old River Outflow Channel: (1) the original channel, in the center, contains the Old River Control Structure, completed in 1963; (2) the southernmost channel (upper right in photograph) contains the Old River Auxiliary Control Structure, completed in 1987; and (3) the northernmost channel (left center) contains a low-head hydroelectric power dam, completed in 1990 and having a rated capacity of 194 megawatts, which supplies electricity to communities in Louisiana.

GX005-36-5979816	"The Mississippi River is flooding in its upper reaches.            How is the current flooding different than that which occurred during the terrible floods of 1993?                       ""Big Muddy"" is misbehaving again. Flood waters have been raising havoc in the upper reaches of the Mississippi, and the flood crest (highest water) is inexorably moving down river at about 40 miles a day. In some places, the river is cresting higher than in the flood of 1993, which was one of the worst in the past 100 years. There's so much water in the tributaries of the Mississippi, and the main stem itself, that water levels will remain exceptionally high for weeks after the crest passes. If rainfall is above normal in the days to come, then the flooding could be of historic proportions. Human chains have been piling up tens of thousands of sand bags along river and stream banks in an attempt to keep the river from invading their community. Flooding has also been unsafe for river barge traffic - more than 400 miles of the river has been closed to shipping. Thus far, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Iowa have all declared states of emergency in the counties bordering the Mississippi.   Cities and towns that raised money to build flood walls and levees are breathing a little easier than cities like Davenport, Iowa where no such protection exists. Davenport is one the cities that make up the Quad Cities, and it's being hit hard by the flooding. A portion of the city near LeClaire Park and Main Street is underwater and the Minor League baseball park in Davenport where the Quad Cities River Bandits plays has been ruined. The River Bandits have been flooded out for the rest of the season - they'll play their home games in a different park 25 miles from the Mississippi. Yesterday, the river was very close to reaching its projected 22.5 foot crest, which is just shy of the record 22.63 feet crest set in July 1993 and more than 7 feet above flood level. The crest could last up to 36 hours before receding. As was the case 8 years ago, the question as to whether or not a flood wall should be built in Davenport will likely be the subject of spirited debate by its citizens after the flood waters retreat.   For cities like Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, for instance, this has been the worst floods since the severe flooding of 1965. Earlier in the week, strong winds, gusting to 50 miles per hour, compounded the high water by pushing 3-4 foot waves against the manmade sandbag dikes. In places, the dikes were overwhelmed by the waves, and even when the bags were piled high enough, the tremendous pressure exerted by the high volume of water squeezed through the sandbags, compromising the integrity of the dikes. Once the river finds a weak spot in the dikes, theres not much anyone can do to stop the Mississippi from spreading out. All along the upper Mississippi, beleaguered flood fighters have been working long hours using more sand bags to plug leaks in dikes and worn out levees in an all-out effort to contain the bloated Mississippi River.   A number of the same problems and concerns that are occurring now were issues during the 1993 flooding of the Mississippi. In 1993, 10 states in the upper Mid West and central plains had to deal with flooding. There were several principal factors that led to the 1993 flooding. For several consecutive months in early 1993, above normal precipitation in the upper Mid West swelled the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers and their tributaries. Then during the spring and summer, when anomalously heavy rains fell, there was no place for the excess water to go. Much of the Mid West received over 150% of normal rainfall, and parts of North Dakota, Kansas, and Iowa received more than double their typical rainfall. Individual storms frequently dumped large volumes of precipitation that local streams simply couldn't handle. One other factor leading to flooding in 1993 was cooler than normal temperatures acted to retard evaporation rates. Thus, there was less evaporation of rain water and the rainfall could not be readily absorbed by the saturated ground. So, more ran-off into streams.   In contrast to 1993, this year's flooding has a snow component that was missing from the floods of 8-years ago. Heavy winter snowfall in the headwaters area of the Mississippi produced a healthy snowpack, and even though no record snowfalls occurred, and the snowpacks didn't build to record depths, there was plenty of snow to cause problems if it melted quickly. If 12 inches of snow covers an area of say about 200 miles by 200 miles in the upper Mid West, and if an equivalent of about 4 cubic inches of water is stored in each 1"" X 1"" X 12"" slice of snow, then this could result in as much as 2 1/2 cubic miles of water when the snow melted. Of course, sublimation and evaporation would remove some of the snow and some of the meltwater during the ablation process, and some of the water would be absorbed by the ground. Nevertheless, there's still a tremendous amount of water now available to runoff toward streams that wasn't there before the snow began to melt.   In general, the snowpack can be thought of as a reservoir that effectively stores water. If the snow melts gradually, water is slowly released. This year, a late March cold spell kept the pack in a frozen state, and when unseasonably warm temperatures arrived, much of the snow melted simultaneously. Because the ground was still cold and hard, most of the melting snow didn't penetrate into the soil but instead ran-off directly into streams. On top of this, heavy rains in early April added still more water to swollen streams and rivers. By the way, rain falling on snow doesn't accelerate snowmelt by very much. Normally, the majority of the energy that's available to melt snow comes from short-wave solar radiation (from 0.2 to about 2.2 microns), which is absorbed by the snowpack. Convective and latent energy exchanges between the snowpack and the air above are of secondary importance.   The Mississippi River drainage basin has been altered over the previous century by draining wetlands, construction of housing developments, allowing building in the floodplains, and by attempting to confine the flow of the Mississippi and its tributaries. Increasing the amount of impervious area and decreasing the amount of land in marsh and woodlands will only increase the potential for flooding of the ""Big Muddy"" in the future.

This includes projects and related activities of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers--Civil and the Bureau of Reclamation of the Department of the Interior. The Federal water resource development program provides lasting benefits to the Nation in the area of flood control, municipal and industrial water supply, irrigation of agricultural lands, water conservation, commercial navigation, hydroelectric power, recreation, and fish and wildlife enhancement. Water is our Nation's most precious and valuable resource. It is evident that water supply in the near future will be as important, if not more so, than energy. There is only so much water available. Water cannot be manufactured. Our Nation cannot survive without water, and economic prosperity cannot occur without a plentiful supply. While many areas of the country suffer from severe shortages of water, others suffer from the other extreme--an excess of water which threatens both rural and urban areas with floods. Because water is a national asset, and because the availability and control of water affect and benefit all States and jurisdictions, the Federal Government has historically assumed much of the responsibility for financing of water resource development. The existing national water resource infrastructure in America is an impressive system of dams, locks, harbors, canals, irrigation systems, reservoirs, and recreation sites with a central purpose-- to serve the public's needs. Our waterways and harbors are an essential part of our national transportation system--providing clean, efficient, and economical transportation of fuels for energy generation and agricultural pro-   6 duction, and making possible residential and industrial development to provide homes and jobs for the American people. Reservoir projects provide hydroelectric power production and downstream flood protection, make available recreational opportunities for thousands of urban residents, enhance fish and wildlife habitat, and provide our communities and industries with abundant and clean water supplies which are essential not only to life itself, but also to help maintain a high standard of living for the American people. When projects are completed, they make enormous contributions to America. The benefits derived from completed projects, in many instances, vastly exceed those contemplated during project development. SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS  The Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development of the Committee on Appropriations held three sessions in connection with the fiscal year 1997 appropriation bill. Witnesses included officials and representatives of the Federal agencies under the subcommittee's jurisdiction. In addition, the subcommittee received numerous statements and letters from Members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, Governors, State and local officials and representatives, and hundreds of private citizens of all walks of life throughout the United States. Testimony, both for and against many items, was presented to the subcommittee. The recommendations for fiscal year 1997, therefore, have been developed after careful consideration of available data. VOTES IN THE COMMITTEE  The subcommittee, by unanimous vote on July 11, 1996, recommended that the bill, as amended, be reported to the full Committee on Appropriations. By unanimous vote of 28 to 0 the Committee on July 16, 1996, recommended that the bill, as amended, be reported to the Senate.   TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE--CIVIL DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY C ORPS OF  ENGINEERS--C  IVIL  GENERAL INVESTIGATIONS  Appropriations, 1996 .............................................................................

By combining several harbor and navigation studies into this one study, the Corps is expected to be able to continue significant work substantially below the cost to address each project separately. Red River navigation, southwest Arkansas, Arkansas, and Louisiana.--The Committee has included $600,000 for the Corps of Engineers to initiate a cost-shared feasibility study to extend navigation on the Red River from Shreveport, LA, into southwest Arkansas. The Committee recognizes that this region is economically depressed and that extending commercial navigation upstream of Shreveport-Bossier City, LA, into southwest Arkansas holds the potential to provide benefits to the Nation due to lower transportation costs and economic activity in the area. The Committee understands that a non-Federal interest has offered to cost share the feasibility study on a 5050 basis in order to expedite completion of the study. The Committee expects the Corps of Engineers to work closely with the local sponsor to control study costs, and plan and conduct an efficient expedited study. Kawaeh River, CA.--The Committee has provided an additional $400,000, over the $600,000 budget request for the Kawaeh River, CA, study for the Corps to initiate geotechnical studies, hydraulic and sedimentation analyses in order to allow completion of the planning and engineering design in fiscal year 1998 if possible. Port Everglades Harbor, FL.--The Committee has included $175,000 for the Corps of Engineers to initiate a feasibility study on the Port Everglade Harbor, FL, project. The study will address geotechnical, environmental, economic, design, and ship simulation efforts. Kaumalapau Harbor, HI.--In the past, this Committee appropriated over $900,000 toward the research and design of a new breakwater to replace the current breakwater which users regard as unsafe. The Committee is aware that Lanai's petroleum products supplier recently announced its intention to cancel all deliveries to the island due to the unsafe condition of the breakwater. The Committee recognizes that the standard procedures in determining a benefit/cost ratio may not fully take into consideration the unique requirements of an island State dependent on ocean traffic for the delivery of supplies. The Committee, therefore, expects the Army Corps of Engineers to work toward resolving concerns about the formula for establishing a benefit/cost ratio. Similarly, the Committee urges the Corps to work with residents and businesses on Lanai, the barge operators, the State of Hawaii, and this Committee to determine how best to resolve the safety problems at Kaumalapau Harbor. Any action on the part of the Corps of Engineers is contingent, however, upon the State of Hawaii taking over control of the harbor. Upper Mississippi and Illinois navigation study, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin.--The Committee has included $11,000,000 for the Upper Mississippi and Illinois navigation study. This is the full capability of the Corps of Engineers for fiscal year 1997. The Committee directs the Corps to accelerate the exe-   21 cution of the feasibility study activities in accordance with the approved project study plan in such a manner that schedule recovery will be maximized and a final report will be completed as early as practicable. The Committee reaffirms the position taken on this project in the conference report on the Energy and Water Development Act for 1996. Kentucky lock and dam, Kentucky.--The Committee has provided the full budget request of $3,000,000 for the Kentucky lock and dam to continue preconstruction engineering and design activities. If additional funding is needed during the year to keep work on schedule, the Committee urges the Corps to take appropriate actions to reprogram additional funds into the project. Amite River and tributaries, Louisiana.--The recommendation includes an amount of $200,000 to reevaluate the benefit-cost analysis in connection with proposed flood control solutions in the Amite River basin and continued review of the previous studies of Darlington Reservoir. Ocean City, MD, and vicinity, (Assateague Island).--In addition to the budget request of $740,000, the Committee has recommended $250,000 for the Corps to initiate preconstruction engineering and design of measures to mitigate damages to Assateague Island National Seashore and vicinity impacted by Federal projects constructed to stabilize inlet conditions for navigation and protection of shoreline erosion. St. Louis Harbor, MO.--The Committee has included $650,000 for the St. Louis Harbor, MO, project, to continue the general reevaluation, including the collection of basic physical and economic data, identification of potential harbor sites, and formulation and evaluation of alternative plans. Devils Lake, ND.--An appropriation of $1,100,000, the full budget request, has been included for the Corps to expedite work on the Devils Lake, ND, feasibility study for lake stabilization, including an inlet and outlet at the lake. The Committee urges the Corps to work cooperatively with the Bureau of Reclamation and the State of North Dakota in this effort. The Committee expects the study will address all aspects of the project set out in the study evaluation. Barnegat Bay, NJ.--The Committee had included $350,000 for the Corps to initiate a reconnaissance study to develop a comprehensive management plan for a variety of water resource problems in the Barnegat Bay area of New Jersey. New Jersey Intracoastal Waterway [NJIWW], NJ.--The bill includes $375,000 for the Corps to undertake a reconnaissance study to identify the ecosystem restoration opportunities along the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway in New Jersey, including the emphasis of techniques for the beneficial use of dredged material. Chemung River basin, Susquehanna River basin, New York and Pennsylvania.--An amount of $200,000 has been provided to undertake a reconnaissance study of the water resource improvements needs for streambank stabilization, flood damage reduction, environmental restoration, and other allied purposes in the Chemung River basin in New York upstream of the confluence with the mainstem Susquehanna River.   22 Tahoe basin, Nevada and California.--The Committee recommendation includes $500,000 for the Tahoe basin study in Nevada and California. The study will examine flood control, water quality, wetland habitat, and other environmental restoration opportunities. The study is critical for restoring the health of Lake Tahoe and the Lake Tahoe basin. Willamette River temperature control, Oregon.--The Committee directs the Corps to remain on its present schedule for the Willamette River temperature control project at Cougar Lake in Oregon. In particular, the Committee directs the Corps to complete plans and specifications for the Cougar Lake project by December 1997. Lackawanna River, Scranton, PA, (Green Ridge and Plot sections).--The Committee has provided $300,000 each for the Lackawanna River, Green Ridge and Plot sections for the Corps of Engineers to undertake the cost-shared planning and design phase of the projects. Rhode Island, south coast, Rhode Island.--The Committee has provided $300,000 for the Corps to conduct a reconnaissance study of potential flood control and watershed improvements, frontal erosion prevention, coastal storm damage reduction, and habitat restoration along the Rhode Island south coast from Watch Hill to Narragansett, RI. Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway [AIWW], SC.--The Committee has included $225,000 for the Corps to initiate a reconnaissance study to develop a master plan for the maintenance and operation of the AIWW in South Carolina caused by significant changes along the waterway; including the development a long-range disposal plan, the feasibility of releasing excess easement areas, restoration of the environment, and development and protection of wildlife habitat in the existing easement areas consistent with disposal requirements. Memphis metro area, Tennessee and Mississippi.--The bill includes $1,200,000 for the Corps to initiate a reconnaissance study to evaluate the problems and opportunities for flood control, urban drainage, storm water management, water quality, environmental enhancement and protection, and other water resource problems in the Memphis metropolitan area in Tennessee. Cheat River basin, West Virginia, environmental restoration.-- The Committee is aware of and supports efforts of the Corps of Engineers to identify environmental restoration problems in the Cheat River basin in West Virginia. However, the Committee feels that prior to proceeding with the Lick Run project, more detailed analysis and investigations of potential higher priority sites in the Cheat River basin is warranted. Therefore, the Committee directs the Corps to use the $350,000 provided herein to further Cheat basin reconnaissance studies in an effort to identify the highest priority acid mine drainage projects in the basin. The Corps is to work closely with the State in this effort. Greenbrier River basin, West Virginia.--The Committee has provided $500,000 for the Corps to resume feasibility studies in the Greenbrier River basin in West Virginia. The Committee is aware of the Corps' efforts to update hydrology and hydraulics in the basin to account for recent floods in the area. These studies will   23 allow the Corps to evaluate a wide range of alternatives and recommend a specific plan for implementation. Research and development.--An appropriation of $28,600,000 is recommended for research and development activities of the Corps of Engineers. The Committee believes it inappropriate to earmark funding for university research institutions given the limited resources and severe budget constraints. The Committee has provided $1,500,000 for zebra mussel research, which is the same as the fiscal year 1997 budget allocation. Given that this is a nationwide program and the limited funding available, the Committee believes it inappropriate to earmark the limited funds available. The Committee has been informed of the need to conduct activities in the Great Lakes region and Lake Champlain, VT. The Committee expects the Corps of Engineers to apply the funds to various regions geographically, and on varying technologies and applications in order to accomplish the highestpriority work. The Corps research and development program includes materials and structural engineering activities to provide improved techniques and technologies to significantly reduce construction costs and to improve structural durability, service life, and safety. As the Nation undertakes to rehabilitate its domestic infrastructure, it is becoming increasingly apparent that for reasons of both environmental protection and longevity, traditional construction methods and materials are not cost effective when compared to new designs and composite materials. In an effort to demonstrate the feasibility of advanced composite designs for application in a marine environment, the Committee has included $1,600,000 for cost-shared research and development and installation of composite pilings with the Greater New Orleans Expressway Commission at Lake Pontchartrain and the Waterways Experiment Station [WES] in Vicksburg. Coordination and studies with other agencies.--The Committee recommendation for coordination and studies with other agencies includes $450,000 for the Corps of Engineers to continue to participate as a stake holder in the interagency ecosystem management task force's Pacific Northwest forest case study with responsibility to restore, sustain, and develop coordinated watershed ecosystem management strategies for species viability on all public lands. These strategies will consider ecological, social, and economic principles to manage biological and physical systems in a manner that safeguards the long-term ecological sustainability, natural diversity, and productivity of the watershed and its landscapes. The strategies will include the evaluation, planning, design, and completion of restoration or demonstration projects and the development of coordinated directives for the management of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. In as much as possible, these strategies will complete or complement State and local watershed restoration efforts on public and private lands or in conjunction with American Indian tribes.   24 CONSTRUCTION, GENERAL  Appropriations, 1996 ............................................................................. Budget estimate, 1997 ........................................................................... Committee recommendation .................................................................  $804,573,000 914,000,000 1,024,195,000  An appropriation of $1,024,195,000 is recommended for ongoing construction activities. BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND PROGRAM EXECUTION  The Committee has been faced with difficult choices in development of the budget for the Corps of Engineers for fiscal year 1997. Severe reductions in budgetary resources last year forced the Committee to ask the Corps to undertake more work than available funds could support. In addition, after several years of poor performance in utilizing the funding provided by the Congress, the Corps has responded by raising their execution rate from around 70 percent to over 95 percent. The Committee received testimony that during the first quarter of this year the actual utilization of construction funding was 104 percent of that planned. This has severely limited the Corps ability to respond to changing construction needs and eliminated the flexibility within the construction program to meet the demands of Congress to provide critical flood control protection, essential commercial navigation improvements, and other infrastructure needs in a timely manner. The Committee expects the budgetary resources for non-Defense discretionary programs to continue to decline. In response to Committee questions, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works indicated that OMB budget planning allocations between now and the year 2000 for Corps of Engineers programs and activities are expected to decline by $600,000,000. NEW CONSTRUCTION STARTS  With continued reductions in budgetary resources, increased performance by the Corps of Engineers, severely limited program flexibility, and the uncertainty of future funding allocations, the Committee has decided not to commit to new construction projects, but to apply available resources on ongoing construction work. In addition, budgetary constraints and lack of program flexibility have limited the number of requests which could be accommodated by the Committee. NEW PROJECT AUTHORIZATIONS  Finally, the Committee is troubled with the prospects of another extended period of stalemate, dispute, and lack of cooperation in the area of water resource policy. A similar dispute occurred between 1970 and 1986, a period of 16 years, when the water resource infrastructure needs of the Nation were neglected. The ever increasing population of the United States will require larger and larger amounts of water, not only for human needs, but also to support industrial development in order to sustain employment and create new jobs. Therefore, it is vitally important to the Nation that the executive branch and the Congress work together to develop sound and realistic water resource policy.   25 The Committee received numerous requests to include project authorizations in the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill. However, in an effort to support congressional authorizing committees desires to enact comprehensive water resource authorizing legislation, and to underscore the importance of enacting authorizing legislation on a regular schedule, the Committee has not included new project authorizations. The Committee has included minor provisions which increase the cost ceiling for ongoing projects in order to prevent construction delays and associated increased costs. The budget request and the approved Committee allowance are shown on the following table:   CORPS OF ENGINEERS--CONSTRUCTION, GENERAL [Amounts in dollars] Project title Total Federal cost Allocated to date Budget estimate Committee recommendation  Type of project  ALABAMA 6,184,000 16,123,000 87,300,000 27,400,000 5,061,000 1,565,000 83,019,000 ......................... 1,123,000 600,000 4,281,000 900,000 1,123,000 600,000 4,281,000 900,000  (N) (N) (N) (MP)  (FC) (N) 11,500,000 25,000,000 29,700,000 632,500,000 200,000,000 137,975,000 44,000,000 63,300,000 204,000,000 100,700,000 3,450,000 23,600,000 85,900,000 25,700,000  4,123,000 16,133,000 10,116,000  500,000 12,333,000 1,206,000 11,296,000 20,594,000 4,666,000 599,465,000 18,614,000 100,262,000 30,787,000 37,678,000 18,874,000 4,640,000 1,002,000 7,548,000 16,090,000 3,355,000  ......................... 3,800,000 4,000,000 204,000 4,406,000 6,000,000 1,414,000 5,886,000 ......................... 2,400,000 5,000,000 14,400,000 850,000 50,000 4,200,000 800,000 100,000  3,302,000 3,800,000 .........................  26  (FC) (FC)  204,000 4,406,000 6,000,000 1,714,000 5,886,000 6,000,000 2,400,000 7,500,000 14,400,000 10,000,000 50,000 4,200,000 800,000 100,000  (MP) (N) (N)  (FC) (FC) (FC) (N) (FC) (FC) (FC) (FC)  BAYOU LA BATRE, AL .................................................................................................................................

TYPE OF PROJECT: (N) NAVIGATION (BE) BEACH EROSION CONTROL (FC) FLOOD CONTROL (MP) MULTIPURPOSE, INCLUDING POWER   35 Dillingham, AK, shoreline erosion.--The Committee has included $3,302,000 for the Corps of Engineers to continue the Dillingham, AK, shoreline erosion control project in the vicinity of Snag Point. The Committee understands that serious erosion is endangering sewer lines, homes and businesses along a 1,500 foot section of shoreline near Snag Point. McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River navigation system (Montgomery Point lock and dam), Arkansas.--The bill includes $5,886,000 for the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River navigation project, as proposed in the budget request. Red River emergency bank protection, Arkansas.--An appropriation of $6,000,000 is included in the bill for the Corps of Engineers to initiate and complete construction of the Dickson revetment feature of the Red River emergency bank protection project in Arkansas. Los Angeles Harbor, CA.--An appropriation of $10,000,000 is recommended for the Los Angeles Harbor project in California. This is $9,150,000 over the budget for fiscal year 1997. This is a good example for the impact of current and future budget constraints have on providing for the infrastructure needs of the nation. The Committee understands that the Corps of Engineers could utilize nearly $30,000,000 to maintain efficient progress on this project which contributes billions of dollars to the national economy through export and import of goods, direct and indirect employment, and associated economic activity generated in the region. Yet, the Committee is unable to provided the full amount required for 1997, and budget profiles for the next several years project a continued decline in available resources to support projects such as the Los Angeles Harbor that contribute so much to the national economy. Sacramento River flood control project, (Glenn-Colusa irrigation district), California.--The Committee has provided $2,000,000, the same as the budget request for the Corps of Engineers to continue construction on the riffle restoration project. Kissimmee River restoration, Florida.--The Committee recommendation includes $3,000,000 for the Corps of Engineers to continue the Kissimmee River restoration project in Florida. This is the same amount as included in the budget request. Lee County, FL, (Captiva Island).--An amount of $1,000,000 has been included in the Committee recommendation to reimburse the Federal share of costs for the renourishment of the beach at Captiva Island, FL. McCook and Thornton Reservoirs, IL.--While the budget request for the McCook and Thornton Reservoirs, IL, project does not include a request for new funding, the Committee understands that $6,655,000 of previously appropriated funding is available and adequate to undertake scheduled activities in fiscal year 1997. Arkansas City, KS, and Winfield, KS.--The Committee is aware of the severe flooding problems in Arkansas City and Winfield, KS, and the urgent need to provide flood protection in those areas. Therefore, the Committee has provided $1,000,000 for each of these projects to accelerate construction. The Secretary of the Army is directed to initiate construction on the first of two contracts for each project on an accelerated basis if the non-Federal sponsor is able   36 to acquire necessary lands by the second quarter of fiscal year 1997. The Committee has recommended a provision in the bill to increase the cost ceiling for this project. Lake Pontchartrain storm water discharge, Louisiana.--The Committee has included $3,500,000 to continue the development of the Lake Pontchartrain storm water discharge project in Louisiana. Lake Pontchartrain and vicinity, Louisiana.--The Committee has provided an additional $14,300,000 for this project of which is to be used by the Corps of Engineers to continue construction of parallel protection along the Orleans Avenue and London Avenue Outfall canals. Ouachita River levees, Louisiana.--The Committee recommends an appropriation of $2,600,000 for the Corps of Engineers to award and complete construction of levee raising from Bastrop to Monroe items 1 and 2 in Louisiana. Red River Waterway, Mississippi River to Shreveport, LA.--An appropriation of $8,500,000 is recommended for the Red River Waterway, LA, project. The Committee recognizes the economic tourism development of the waterway region is critical to provide the full value to the Nation. Therefore, an additional $3,700,000 has been provided for the design and construction of the visitor center and interpretive displays and exhibits, and to subsequently initiate continuing contracts, not to be considered fully funded, for a regional visitor center at Shreveport, LA, as specified by Public Law 10446, and an enhanced recreation site with appropriate project oriented exhibits and displays at Grand Ecore, near Nachitoches, LA, as specified in the Red River Waterway master plan for recreation. Both center and site are to be constructed at full Federal expense. Engineering, design, and construction need not await completion of the recreation master plan supplement and project cooperation agreement for pools 35 recreation development. The center will provide educational information to the public on the Red River Waterway project, the Red River basin, and national and local water resources development by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Red River emergency bank protection, Louisiana.--The Committee recommendation for the Red River emergency bank protection project in Louisiana includes $3,900,000 for the Corps to design and construct the Cat Island revetment, and $500,000 for the Corps to undertake a sediment transport study on the stretch of the Red River from Denison Dam to Index, AR. The sediment transport study is needed to determine if bank erosion sediment entering the river above Index, AR, is being transported into the navigation channel at Shreveport, thereby increasing the maintenance dredging costs associated with the Red River Waterway project. Missouri River levee system, L385, Missouri.--The Committee directs the Corps to proceed with completion of engineering and design on the L385, Riverside/Quindaro Bend levee project. St. Charles County flood control project, Missouri.--The Committee is aware of the severe flood damages suffered during the floods of 1993 and 1995 in the St. Charles County, MO, peninsual affect-   37 ing homes, businesses, critical infrastructure, and cropland. The Committee has added $250,000 to the Missouri River levee system, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri project to initiate detailed engineering and design including preparation of the general reevaluation report and related NEPA compliance documentation for the L15 levee unit of the Missouri River levee system project. North Jefferson City, MO.--The Committee understands that there have been delays on the L142, North Jefferson City levee and encourage the Corps to proceed expeditiously to complete the economic analysis and feasibility study. Poplar Island, MD, (sec. 204).--The Committee understands that use of the $22,000,000 budget request for the Poplar Island, MD, project is contingent upon enactment of authorizing legislation which would resolve significant policy issues and provide an assured funding stream for the project. The Committee has reduced, without prejudice, the recommended funding to $500,000. The $500,000 has been provided under the authority of section 204 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1992, in an effort to keep the project moving forward until authorizing legislation is in place. The Corps of Engineers is directed to use the funding to continue essential activities related to water quality certification requirements, coordinate with the non-Federal project sponsor and various interested parties, and to evaluate alternative construction sequences (phases versus nonphased) to determine associated impacts on project costs, financing, and construction activities. Missouri River fish and wildlife mitigation, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri.--The Committee has provided $5,000,000 for the Missouri River fish and wildlife mitigation project. The Corps is directed to use the additional funds to expedite those elements which are ready for construction funding. Acequias irrigation system, New Mexico.--The Committee has provided $1,300,000 for the acequias irrigation system in New Mexico in order to continue progress on this important project. Red River basin chloride control, Texas.--The Committee believes that there is an urgent need to accelerate construction of the Red River basin chloride control project. Therefore, the Committee has provided $4,500,000 for the award and first year's execution of a contract for construction of the Crowell Brine Lake embankment, spillway, and access roads. In addition, the Committee is aware that the Army Corps of Engineers will carry over $5,400,000 into fiscal year 1997 which will be used to continue engineering and design and award construction contracts of the collection facilities at areas VII and IX. Columbia River juvenile fish mitigation, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.--The Committee continues to support the Columbia River juvenile fish mitigation program and has provided the full budget request of $107,000,000 to continue the project in fiscal 1997. A significant portion of the funds will be used to investigate new technologies and approaches to improve juvenile fish survival at the Federal projects on the Columbia and Snake Rivers. In particular, the Committee supports the testing and installation of surface bypass facilities at several of the projects and understands that they may hold great promise for improving fish survival in the system.   38 The Corps is directed to continue its work on gas abatement measures, including the construction of spillway flip lips at Ice Harbor and John Day Dams. The Committee encourages efforts to continue improving monitoring of dissolved gas levels at the projects, and directs the Corps to work with the National Marine Fisheries Service, the Northwest Power Planning Council, States, and tribes to further improve the current physical gas monitoring and reporting system. In addition, the Committee supports the construction of passive integrated transponder [PIT] tag detectors at the John Day and Bonneville projects. The Committee understands that the Corps' cost estimate for the construction of the John Day PIT tag facility has been revised upward due to recently discovered problems at the construction site. The Committee considers this facility to be a high priority, and directs the Corps to allocate sufficient funds within the overall program to ensure that the facility is completed no later than October 1997. The Committee strongly encourages the Corps to carry out all its activities associated with the program in a manner that is based upon the best available science, and fosters consensus among the affected States, Indian tribes, Federal agencies, and the council. The Corps should pursue procedures for reaching technical consensus, including dispute resolution procedures, that have been used to address other anadromous fish-related issues in the Columbia basin. In consultation with affected States, the council, Indian tribes, and Federal agencies, the Corps shall report to the Committee prior to the Committee's hearings on the fiscal year 1998 budget regarding these efforts. The report should take into consideration the views of all participants. The Committee is aware that the Corps has generally had difficulty contracting with Indian tribes to carry out fish and wildlife actions, such as evaluation of water temperature conditions in the Snake River in relation to adult migration of salmon, or in the protection of tribal cultural resources. In the past, research proposals submitted by the tribes, fully peer reviewed, and accepted by the region for scientific merit have not been funded by the Corps apparently due to limitations in the Corps' authorities. The Committee directs the Corps to establish contract mechanisms under its existing authorities to carry out such work expeditiously with affected Indian tribes, or report to the appropriate committees of Congress on the changes in authority which are necessary to initiate the contracts. In prior years, the Committee has encouraged the Corps to investigate the efficacy of underwater sound generating acoustic guidance systems and underwater strobe lighting guidance systems to help decrease fish mortality at the Columbia and Snake River projects. The Committee is not aware, however, of any significant tests or studies that the Corps has initiated at the projects themselves. Recent improvements have been made in both technologies, and the Committee directs the Corps to fully investigate the feasibility of both guidance technologies, with additional laboratory research, at one or more of its projects on the Columbia or Snake Rivers.   39 The Committee is concerned that the Corps continues to be unable to meet critical milestones for completion of important components of salmon recovery program. The Committee cannot over emphasize the importance and need for the Corps to meet deadlines on critical features and urges the Corps to take appropriate actions to ensure future critical milestones are met. Finally, the Committee is very disappointed the Secretary of the Army and the Corps of Engineers has not responded to language contained in the conference report on the fiscal year 1996 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill which directed the development of a set of recommendations for improving the system by which fish passage improvements in the Columbia River power system are designed, tested, and implemented. Recent issues involving the installation of a prototype surface collectors at lower Granite Dam and the installation of the John Day juvenile fish sampling and monitoring facility have heightened the concerns of the Committee. The Committee believes it appropriate to have an independent entity that has engineering experience and familiarity with current practices of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bonneville Power Administration, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and other Federal agencies and the private sector to develop an objective independent report to identify specific recommendations that, if implemented, would shorten the time requirements, reduce the costs, and improve the biological success of fish passage projects. The report should include an evaluation of how projects are identified, moved through the Federal and regional review process, and ultimately selected for construction. The report shall include not only Corps, BPA, NMFS, and other Federal agencies, but also State and tribal elements that combine to result in the development and installation of fish facilities along the entire Columbia River power system. Further, the Committee believes that the involvement of a variety of interests is essential in developing this report and should consider the views of States, tribes, utilities, and environmental interests. The Committee expects all parties to work closely and collaboratively in this effort. Elk Creek Dam, OR.--The Committee is aware that the Elk Creek Dam in southern Oregon was authorized as part of a three dam system for flood control in the Rogue River basin, and that two of the three dams have been completed and that Elk Creek Dam is over one-half completed. Despite completion of several NEPA documents on the Elk Creek project, construction was enjoined by a Federal district court in 1987. This injunction was upheld recently by the ninth circuit court of appeals which directed that another supplemental EIS be completed. The Committee is informed by the Corps of Engineers that significant funding and effort would be required to address issues raised by the court without certainty of success in future court decisions. In light of this fact, the Committee had included language in the bill to enable the Corps to utilize $2,500,000 of funds previously appropriated for the Elk Creek project to undertake appropriate engineering, biological, and environmental studies of options to manage the project in its uncompleted state.   40 Little Dell Lake, UT.--The Committee has included an appropriation of $4,000,000 to complete construction of recreation facilities at the Little Dell Lake, UT, project, and reimbursement to the Metropolitan Water District of Salt Lake City consistent with supplement No. 3 to design memorandum No. 4 titled ``Little Dell LakeRecreation, Salt Lake City Streams, Utah'' dated September 1995. The cost allocation and cost apportionment shall be consistent with Public Law 99662 and the figures shown in supplement No. 3. Levisa and Tug Forks of the Big Sandy River and Upper Cumberland River, WV-KY-VA.--The Committee has provided a total of $38,521,000 for the Levisa and Tug Forks of the Big Sandy River and Upper Cumberland River project. In addition to amounts provided in the budget request, the bill includes $10,000,000 to continue the Harlan, KY, element of the project; $4,700,000 for the Williamsburg, KY, element of the project; $3,000,000 for the Pike County (Tug Fork) element; and $4,00,000 for continuation of flood proofing on the Middlesboro, KY, element of the project. In addition, the Corps is directed to continue construction of the Pike County, KY, element using funds previously appropriated. The Committee recommendation also includes $4,000,000 for the Upper Mingo County, WV, element; $4,200,000 for the Lower Mingo (Kermit), WV, element and $1,600,000 for the Hatfield Bottom, WV, nonstructural element of the Levisa and Tug Forks of the Big Sandy River and Upper Cumberland River, (sec. 202) project, and $105,000 for the Lower Mingo, WV, tributaries supplement to the detail project report. Aquatic plant control program.--The Committee has included $4,000,000 to continue the aquatic plant control program. In light of severe budget constraints and the fact that this is a nationwide program, the Committee believes it inappropriate to earmark the small amount of funding available for fiscal year 1997. The appropriations are to undertake the highest priority activities. Small flood control projects, (sec. 205).--The Committee recommendation for section 205 small flood control projects is $32,650,000. The Committee recommendation includes $3,900,000 to complete construction of the Muscle Shoals, AL, project; $150,000 each for the Elba and Geneva, AL, levee rehabilitation projects; $2,950,000 for the Corps to initiate construction of the St. Peters, MO, Old Town levee project; $100,000 to initiate and complete a feasibility study of nonstructural solutions to flooding in Lincoln County, MT; an additional $3,100,000 over the $270,000 included in the budget for the Cedar River, Renton, WA, project to complete plans and specifications and initiate construction; and $500,000 each for the Corps to plan and install early flood warning systems for the Cheat River and Greenbrier River basins in West Virginia which the Committee understands will be done at full Federal expense. Further, the Corps is directed to use $25,000 of funds provided to perform a combined reconnaissance/feasibility study to further assess the flood control problems along the Mahoning River in the vicinity of Struthers, OH. Small navigation projects, (sec. 107).--An appropriation of $9,632,000 is recommended for small navigation projects, section   41 107, projects. The Committee recommendation includes $2,000,000 for construction of Ouzinkie Harbor, AK; $2,000,000 for construction of Larsen Bay Harbor, AK; $120,000 for initiation of plans and specification for the King Cove Harbor, AK, project; $212,000 to complete the feasibility report and initiate plans and specification on the Whittier Harbor, AK, project; $124,000 to complete the feasibility study on the Tatitlik Harbor, AK, project; and $176,000 to complete the feasibility report and initiate plans and specifications for the Tamgas Harbor, AK, project. Emergency streambank and shoreline protection, (sec. 14).--The Committee recommendation for section 14, emergency streambank and shoreline protection projects is $8,500,000. The recommendation includes the full budget request of $278,000 for the Wash-onthe-Brazos, TX, project; $310,000 for the Manitou Beach Drive and Murden Cove Road bulkhead repair in Bainbridge Island, WA; and $400,000 to initiate and complete the Emmonak, AK project. Beach erosion control, (sec. 103).--An appropriation of $4,700,000 is recommended for beach erosion control, section 103 projects for fiscal year 1997. The Committee has included $1,700,000 to complete the Lummi Shore Road, Lumi Indian Reservation, WA, project. Projects modifications for improvement of the environment, (sec. 1135).--The Committee has provided a total of $17,280,000 for section 1135, projects modifications for improvements of the environment. The recommendation includes $1,000,000 for the Valdez Harbor, AK, intertidal water retention project; $1,700,000 for the Amazon Creek restoration project in Oregon; $100,000 for the Numana Dam fish passage project in Nevada; and $180,000 for the Bernado Waterfowl Management Area in New Mexico. Shoreline protection policy.--The Committee is equally troubled by the administration's proposals to terminate the Federal role in shore protection projects and smaller navigation projects. While these proposals would only directly affect the coastal States, including the Great Lakes States, the impacts of terminating the Federal Government's role in protecting our shorelines and maintaining small boat harbors would be felt throughout the Nation. The Committee also strongly rejects these proposals.

The Corps shall provide the Committee with a report not later than January 31, 1997, which provides details on the nature of the problem, options to solve the flooding problem and associated costs for each option, and statutory authority for the Corps to do the work necessary to resolve the problem. Mississippi River levees, MR&T.--The Committee has included an additional $2,300,000 for the Corps to undertake additional work in Mississippi including Wilson Point-Lookout Point item 489R, State line-Wilson Point item 506R, and item 501L. Yazoo basin projects, Mississippi.--The Committee notes the reduction in funding for many Yazoo basin projects from last year's planned levels and is concerned that these reductions could result in schedule slippages, thus increasing the risks of flood damages in this region. Accordingly, the Committee requests a report from the Corps of Engineers not later than January 31, 1997, which provides information on the effects of reduced funding for the Mississippi River levee enlargement projects and all Yazoo basin construction and operations and maintenance projects. This report shall include, but not be limited to, the effect of the reduced funding on project schedules. Demonstration erosion control, MR&T.--The Committee is very concerned by the significant decrease in funding for the demonstration erosion control project, and does not endorse plans by the Corps of Engineers to eliminate this funding entirely in fiscal year 1998. Accordingly, the Committee has added an additional $7,300,000 for the Demonstration Erosion Control Program, and directs that from the funds provided the Corps immediately initiate maintenance procedures to alleviate the backwater flooding on the Yalobusha River in Calhoun County, MS. Yazoo basin, MS, Big Sunflower River, including Steele Bayou.-- The Committee has included an additional $4,193,000 for the Corps to undertake additional work including, Steele Bayou item 66A/B phase III, Robert Shaw ditch, and main canal item 2 channel. Yazoo basin, Upper Yazoo projects, MS.--The bill includes $14,000,000 for the Upper Yazoo projects to continue items 3A2 and item 3B in Yazoo River, Alligator-Catfish Bayou water control structure and other related work. The Committee has included language in the bill to direct that the variable cost recovery rate be used to establish the rates charged for the Mississippi River Commission aircraft in accordance with OMB Circular A126, appendix A. The Committee understands that use of the variable cost recovery rate in accordance with OMB Circular A126 will result in more use of the aircraft by other agencies and offices of the Corps when operations costs are less than the cost of commercial travel, therefore, providing net saving in the cost of Government travel.
