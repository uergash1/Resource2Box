The Sonoma County District Attorney's office said search                      warrants were served in Marin, Sonoma and Napa counties. Two                      were served in San Rafael, one in Sebastopol and one in unincorporated                      Napa County.                      The targets of the probe are ""women's gifting clubs,''                      which operate under many names including ""Women Empowering                      Women,'' ""Female Philanthropy Circle,'' ""Prosper                      Forever,'' and variations of ""dinner'' and ""garden''                      clubs or circles.                     Offenders face charges of conspiracy, securities fraud, theft                      and tax evasion, according to the California Department of                      Corporations which said the scheme has surfaced in Sacramento,                      San Diego and other parts of the state recently.                     ""It's the same old beast dressed up in different ways,''                      a spokeswoman for the Department of Corporations said.                     Sonoma County authorities said the scams they are investigating                      are variations of one known in Sacramento as ""Women Helping                      Women.'' Eight women were arrested there last month. There                      were no arrests today in the North Bay, said Sonoma County                      Deputy District Attorney Dani Jo Handell.                     The scams depend on a tight regime of secrecy, phone conferences                      and e-mail and Internet involvement, Sonoma County authorities                      said.                     Women victims are lured into the scheme by promises of reaping                      $40,000 by bringing eight other women into the club or circle,                      each of whom contributes $5,000 then recruits eight more women.                     At the center of the circle is the ""bouquet'' who stands                      to make $40,000 through the recruitment of ""buds'' ""blooms''                      and ""blossoms'' as the circle divides. The Sebastopol                      ""garden circle'' employed this method, Handell said.                     Only a few players at the top of the pyramid, or center of                      the circle, receive a $40,000 payout before the scheme collapses,                      authorities said.                     Handell said the current variation of the age-old scheme                      is ""alarming'' because it is very regimented and holds                      training seminars on recruitment methods and uses the Internet                      to maintain its structure. Hundreds of women in the North                      Bay are involved, Handell said.                     Women who recognized the scheme for what it was when they                      were approached about it tipped off authorities, Handell said.                     The investigation in the North Bay has been going on for                      months, Handell said.                     ""This gets more sophisticated as time goes by,'' she                      said.                                                                                                                                                    • Securities   • Franchises  •  Off-Exchange Commodities  • Investment and Financial Services •  • Independent Escrows  • Consumer and Commercial Finance Lending  • Residential Mortgage Lending •         Back to Top of Page                © 2003 State of California.

This page last updated:    June 13, 2002                                         OCS  Study MMS 98-0048           Petroleum Extraction in Santa Barbara County, California:           An Industrial History           BACKGROUND: MMS requested researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara         to conduct an historic analysis of the petroleum extraction industry in San Luis Obispo,         Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties from 1950 to 2015. The researchers developed separate,         stand-alone reports on each of the three counties include an analysis of the oil         industry’s evolution and projected future, its relationships with the surrounding         communities, and its role in a complex economy. They also investigated the regulatory         context in which oil does business, and to the kinds of innovations developed to operate         in the Santa Barbara Channel’s natural and social environment. In addition to these         reports, they produced an inventory of all firms operating in the tri-counties during         these years, and which oil fields they operated (OCS Study MMS 98-0061).            This summary was developed by the researchers.           OBJECTIVES: Our goal is to provide an historical analysis of the evolution of the         petroleum extraction industry in Santa Barbara County, including its changing business         structure, economic impacts, technological advances, local social contexts, and         governmental effects. We attempt to depict a comprehensive view of what an industry means         as it operates in a given locale, documenting a wide variety of both direct and indirect         consequences and relationships.           DESCRIPTION: Our methods are diverse, tailored to the specific research issue and         available data. We interviewed or consulted approximately 100 persons with relevant views         or information, drawn from a wide variety of business, government, and civic groups. We         scrutinized government statistics from state, federal, and local agencies. We used         multivariate regression analysis to determine economic effects; we examined tax documents         to specify industry dollars contributed to the county tax base. Through interviews, phone         inquiries, and document searches, we derived estimates of the industry’s local         philanthropic contributions. We reconstruct, using state of California archives, a record         of company activities in terms of which firms operated in which fields at which time         points. We also provide information regarding oil firm adaptation and the special role of         environmental consulting companies as part of the industry.           We provide information regarding local support and opposition to the industry and how         political campaigns affecting the industry were conducted and funded. We indicate the         nature of the industry’s labor supply, including the wage levels of personnel. We         analyze the kind of regulations and local oversight faced by the industry and the way         controversies, regulations, and permitting activities impacted local government         operations. We also discuss technological advances stimulated by local drilling and         production. Finally, we offer scenarios of potential future local operations.           SIGNIFICANT CONCLUSIONS: The petroleum industry’s long presence in Santa Barbara         County has had important impacts both on the industry and the region, but not always of         the expected kind. In economic terms, the effects have primarily been significant in terms         of contributions to the county tax base (especially in certain earlier periods), as         opposed to significantly stimulating growth in the private economy. In terms of business         structure, the Santa Barbara County oil industry has consistently allowed room for small         operators and independent producers, despite dominance by major companies. In terms of         social context, the industry has been highly controversial, reflected in an on-going split         between north and south county communities on the benefits and liabilities of the         industry.           In part due to the county’s internal controversies over the industry, it has been         highly regulated compared to its operations elsewhere, having consequences both for the         industry’s ability to time its projects and the county’s administrative         capacities. Among the innovations have been changes in regulatory rules as well as         technological advances (stimulated as well by specific geologic conditions). Given current         local and national attitudes toward the industry and offshore drilling in particular, any         new initiatives will be carefully scrutinized by local government units.           STUDY RESULTS: The decline in volume of oil produced in Santa Barbara County onshore         was compensated by offshore development, at least through the early 1980s. Based on our         econometric analysis, it appears that although oil activity has been a steady part of the         local economies over the period of our study, the region would have been equally as well         off economically had there been no such activity. We could not find, using our regression         analyses, any statistical pattern of positive impacts of the industry’s presence on         the overall scale of economic activity. In terms of property tax payments, the industry         generated $12.6 million in county revenues at its 1985 high point, a level it has recently         approached again in 1996 after a decade of declining tax payments (falling as much as 33         percent in 1991).           The industry structure was remarkable in the degree that opportunities for new entrants         continued over time, rather than the tendency toward monopolization often characteristic         of industrial maturation. While major oil companies predominated until very recently,         large independents and smaller operators have constantly been a significant part of the         industry, keeping over 100 different producers in the fields of Santa Barbara County         across the years. Turnover among producers (except, until recently, the major companies)         has been a regular feature of the county’s industry, with successive waves of         operators finding opportunity in the declining fields that no longer seemed as promising         to previous producers. That is true of Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) activity, where a         significant shift continues of major operators leaving the area, turning their investments         over to smaller independents. Some oil-related firms diversified beyond petroleum         operations, including a significant sector of environmental consulting which is         particularly strong in the Santa Barbara South Coast region.           Santa Barbara County’s relatively stringent regulatory regime on all development         issues has affected oil with particular force. Costly political campaigns have been waged,         including elections at the local supervisorial level and county-wide initiatives affecting         the industry. The North County region tends to support the industry’s expansion, both         through the kinds of candidates it elects to office and voters’ positions on         oil-related initiatives. Past pollution events, especially the 1969 oil spill and—to         a lesser degree—the long-term and high-volume diluent spill at the county’s         northern border, are significant to local discourse. In terms of innovations over the         years, the most important local technological advances have come in the form of enhanced         capacity to drill at great water depths. Regulatory innovations have also been strong,         such as the SEMP program through which the industry pays offsets as its impacts are         detected and measured rather than through fees set in advance of development.            Current proposals for additional oil activities (and likely scenarios for the         near-term) involve one or two slant-drilling initiatives. Given the modest impacts of the         industry’s current production regime, it is doubtful that such operations will have         important aggregates impacts on the county’s economy, social make-up, or governmental         structure (although site-specific impacts are potential).

Ellen Tauscher (D-Contra Costa & Alameda Counties) and George Miller (D-Martinez) announced that the $1 million they requested for the County Connection bus service crossed a key legislative hurdle today. The provision is part of the annual transportation funding bill that was approved today by the House Appropriations Committee. The $1 million will help the County Connection buy new buses to help increase service in Pleasanton and Martinez.   ""The $1 million that George and I are securing for County Connection will help commuters by increasing the number of bus trips to the ACE trains in Pleasanton as well as the BART train in Martinez,"" said Tauscher. ""We need to make a greater investment in County Connection to help it keep pace with the increasing demands of commuters in Contra Costa County. Right now, the County Connection is short 18 full-size buses to meet expected service demands over the next four years. As our region becomes more crowded, the only way to deal with the influx of cars on our roads is to make mass transit a relevant and efficient option for East Bay commuters.""   ""County Connection provides a tremendous service to commuters eager to use public transportation instead of overcrowded freeways,"" said Miller. ""This $1 million will help County Connection meet its goals to better serve our residents.""   The total cost of adding 18 full-size buses is expected to be $6,281,000. State and local funding is expected to make up the difference. When fully operational, the buses will support an increase in shuttle service in downtown Martinez, provide express service from the North Concord BART station to downtown Martinez, and provide expanded service to Bishop Ranch and to the ACE train in Pleasanton.   The $15.8 billion national transportation spending bill that includes this provision is expected to be taken up by the full House of Representatives next week. The Senate must also consider the bill. Last year, Tauscher and Miller secured $500,000 to help expand County Connection service.     ###"

Operation    Arizona Man Shipped Products to Make Fake Driver's Licenses to 41 States          August 12, 2003    03-096  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  (916) 324-5500     (SACRAMENTO)  – Attorney General Bill Lockyer today announced his office and the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) have broken a huge counterfeit driver's license operation believed responsible for producing fake I.D.'s that were distributed in California, 40 others states and the District of Columbia.  The investigation is believed to be among the largest involving driver's license fraud in DMV's history.   ""These fake I.D.s predominantly were used by underaged college students who wanted to get into bars and buy alcohol,"" Lockyer said.  ""This sophisticated operation, which provided the tools to manufacture fake driver's licenses throughout the county, not only contributed to the widespread problem of underage drinking.  During these times of increased concern about financial privacy, I.D. theft and terrorism, this ring  greatly enhanced the opportunity for criminals to establish fake identifications to commit fraud and acts of terrorism.""   In his criminal  complaint , the Attorney General charged Jason Andrew Miller, 21, of Tempe, Arizona, with producing hundreds of counterfeited driver's license laminates bearing the California DMV and California State seals and, in some cases, the magnetic strips.  Miller also is accused of selling those laminates to individuals who used them to manufacture fake driver's licenses.  Miller is alleged to have charged $5.25 per laminate, 75 cents to generically encode each magnetic strip, and $2 for specific encoding of the magnetic strip.   The investigation conducted by the Attorney General and the DMV showed that Menux Inc., a company owed and operated by Miller, also manufactured counterfeited laminates consistent with the state of Texas, and offered for sale on his website laminates consistent with the states of Arizona, Oregon, Michigan and New Jersey.  The company operated over the Internet and shipped products using United Parcel Service to addresses in 41 states and the District of Columbia.   Miller will surrender himself on Wednesday, August 13, 2003, at 10:30 in Department 8 of the Sacramento County Superior Court.  Judge Gary E. Ransom has set his bail at $250,000.   The Sacramento Valley High Technology Crimes Task Force, composed of members of the Attorney General's Office and the Sacramento Sheriff's Office, assisted in serving search warrants in Sacramento and Davis.  Other high tech task forces throughout the state passed on information to local law enforcement agencies for possible actions regarding individuals identified in the investigation throughout the state.   The investigation already has led to other arrests.  Three University of California, Davis, students were arrested on April 1, 2003: Daniel Paul Aleksander, Joseph Aaronelijah Stewart and Nicholas William Blasgen.  The cases, which will be prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office, accuse the defendants of receiving the laminates from Menux and using them to manufacture counterfeit California driver's licenses.   The investigation has already resulted in the arrest and convictions of Jason Richardson, 20, of Elk Grove.  Richardson pled guilty to one count of forgery related to the production and sale of counterfeited driver's license laminates bearing the California DMV and California State seals.  He was sentenced on April 1 to 150 days in county jail and five years of formal probation.   Rouben Kirakossian, 32, pled guilty to possession of Menux material while committing the crime of identify theft.  He was sentenced on July 18, 2003, in Placer County, to 150 days in county jail and three years of formal probation.   Shipping records obtained during the investigation show that Miller, doing business as Menux, sent 857 packages to various addresses throughout the United States, including 261 in California.  In California, the packages were sent to residences in Albany, Aliso Viejo, Aptos, Atascadero, Bakersfield, Bay Point, Beverly Hills, Buena Park, Burbank, Carlsbad, Carson, Chico, Chula Vista, Concord, Coto de Caza, Danville, Davis, Del Mar, Dove Canyon, El Cajon, El Sobrante, Elk Grove and Encinitas.   Packages also were sent to residences in Foster City, Goleta, Granada Hills, Hayward, Irvine, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Los Gatos, Malibu, Manhattan Beach, Menifee, Mission Viejo, Modesto, Montclair, Mountain View, North Hollywood, Oakland, Oxnard, Pacific Palisades, Panorama City, Pasadena, Pittsburgh, Pleasant Hill, Pleasanton, Rancho Palos Verdes, Rancho Santa Fe, Redlands, Rodeo, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, San Leandro, San Mateo, San Pedro, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Santa Monica, Sherman Oaks, Simi Valley, South Lake Tahoe, Stockton, Sunnyvale, Tustin, Vallejo, Walnut Creek, Westlake Village and Willits.   The investigation continues and more arrests are expected.        # # # #   BACK                                                                                          OFFICE OF THE AG  |  PROGRAMS & SERVICES  |  NEWS & ALERTS  |  PUBLICATIONS  |  CONTACT US  |  SEARCH REGISTERING WITH US  |  CAREER OPPORTUNITIES  |  LINKS TO STATE SITES Privacy Policy  |  Terms & Conditions  |  © 2001 DOJ"

             August              30, 2000  -               Former Assembly Republican Leader Scott Baugh requests Governor Davis              to call a Special Session that would be dedicated to focusing on the              looming state-wide energy crisis, which has already struck San Diego              residents.                                                               September              6, 2000 -               Davis signs two bills stemming from the power crisis in San Diego.              One would spread energy price increases for San Diego customers over              several years, the other speeds up the approval process for new power              plants.             September              7, 2000 -              The state Public Utilities Commission approves the rate-averag ing              plan for San Diego customers, which caps their rates for three years.              Fitch Investors warn that even higher energy rates and mounting debts              for utilities are coming.             September              8, 2000 -   Wholesale energy prices on the California Power Exchange              continued to soar in August, pushing the state's three utilities more              than $3 billion into a financial hole and creating calls for dismantling              the state's deregulated power.             September              12, 2000 -                 The Governor renews his request for immediate action by the FERC to              restore wholesale prices to fair levels.             September              14, 2001 -               PG&E credit rating changes from ""stable"" to ""negative.""             September              21, 2000 -              The CPUC unanimously grants to SDG&E the ability to purchase 1,900              MW (half of its peak load) under contracts covering periods as long              as 5 years.

PG&E writes Loretta Lynch that after 9 weeks, the CPUC staff has              not produced guidelines for long-term contracts and still has not              done so today. SCE later concurred that they were hitting roadblocks              with the CPUC staff while trying to get approval of long-term contracts.              Edison asks a total of seven times in 20 months for broader authority              to make the kind of electricity buys the governor now says will deliver              us from the crisis. Each time, the CPUC either denies Edison's request              or approves it only after applying significant restrictions that ultimately              make it impractical for the utility.                                 November        1, 2000 -        PG&E, SCE and SDG&E report they are now more than $6 billion in        the red due to their inability to pass along their wholesale costs to their        customers. The FERC recommends California utilities enter into long-term        contracts and denies Davis' request for $100 mWh wholesale electricity rate        caps saying that amount won't even cover the generators' costs.                                       December 1, 2000              -               The Governor issues his 8-point plan to help solve the energy              crisis. The CEC provides status report on all pending power plant              applications.             December 6, 2000              -              A request is made by the ISO and later repeated by the Governor that              all California residents turn OFF their outdoor Christmas lights until              after 7 p.m. each evening.             December 7, 2000              -              The ISO declares the first Stage Three emergency when power reserves              fall below 1.5 percent. Officials say conservation efforts averted              rolling blackouts throughout the state.             December 8, 2000              -              The FERC lifts wholesale electricity price cap $250 mWh at the request              of the ISO. Utilities intensify catastrophic predictions.             December 13, 2000              -              Davis and legislative leaders meet in D.C. with Energy Secretary Bill              Richardson who orders 12 generators to continue selling power to PG&E              and SCE. A federal order is issued by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson.              The order from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) instructs approximately              75 entities, some within the state of California and others within              the western region, to make arrangements to generate, deliver, interchange              and transmit the electric energy requested by the California ISO.              Loretta Lynch announces the CPUC will consider raising retail electricity              rates.             December 15, 2000              -              The FERC issues its plans for generation in California, including              a soft cap of $150 per megawatt.             December 16, 2000              -              Davis concedes that a Special Session will have to be convened, and              reserves $1 billion in his budget to address the crisis.             December 20, 2000              -              The CPUC meets to consider rate increases to prevent bankruptcies              of So Cal Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric; sets and conducts              hearings on December 27, 28, 29 and January 2 for public input on              effect of rate increases.             December 26, 2000              -              Southern California Edison sues the FERC, alleging the Commission              failed to ensure that wholesale electricity is sold at ``just and              reasonable'' rates.                                                                  January              2, 2001 -              The ISO announces there were 55 Stage One Alerts, 36 Stage Two Alerts              and one Stage Three Alert in the year 2000. There were no rolling              blackouts initiated in 2000. The three investor-owned utilities estimate              they now have spent more than $9 billion for power which they must              collect from rate-frozen ratepayers. The Governor announces that he              will file a ""friend of the court"" brief in support of the              lawsuit filed last week by Southern California Edison against the              Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that charges the federal              agency with failing to protect ratepayers from record prices charged              by power generators.                            January 3, 2001 -                Governor Davis convenes a Special Session to address the California                Energy Emergency, 132 days after the Republicans asked for one.                         January              3-4, 2001 -              The CPUC announces it will grant a rate increase for PG&E and              Edison of 9% for residential customers, 7% for small business customers,              12% for medium commercial customers, and 15% for large commercial              and industrial customers. The increase will be for 90 days only. The              AB 1890 rate freeze is continued.             January              5, 2001 -              A federal court in Washington rejects Edison's bid to force federal              regulators to cap prices on wholesale electricity. Edison announces              it will cut 1,850 jobs over the next several months.             January              8, 2001 -              Davis, in his State of the State speech, proposes a public agency              to build power plants, and threatens to seize the plants of wholesalers              who gouge consumers and utilities and pledges at least $1 billion              in state funds to resolve the crisis.             January              9, 2001 -              State and federal officials meet for seven hours in Washington but              find no solutions.             January              11, 2001 -              The ISO declares a Stage Three power alert, but stops short of ordering              scattered blackouts. U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson extends              an emergency order keeping power flowing to the state after Davis              submits a conservation plan. An Assembly committee approves bills              to shake up two power boards and require utilities to get state permission              to sell power plants. PG&E lays off 325 employees and says it              will let another 675 go if its finances do not improve.             January              12, 2001 -              Davis meets with the governors of Oregon and Washington. Other Western              governors say California needs to build more power plants. The FERC              approves PG&E's request for permission to restructure to insulate              assets in the event of bankruptcy.             January              13, 2001 -              State and federal officials resume talks with representatives of power              companies. Under the proposal that emerges, the Legislature would              let the state buy electricity from wholesalers and sell it to utilities              at a reduced rate under long-term contracts.             January              15, 2001 -              Power supplier Dynegy Inc. threatens to take SoCal Edison and PG&E              to bankruptcy court if they fail to make payments due this week.             January              16, 2001 -              The ISO declares a Stage Three alert as several plants report a shortage              of natural gas. Edison tells federal regulators it doesn't have the              money to pay $596 million it owes this week, including $215 million              to the California Power Exchange for wholesale-power purchases. The              exchange considers whether to make the utility buy its power elsewhere.              Standard & Poor's downgrades the credit ratings of SoCal Edison              and PG&E to junk-bond status.             January              16 & 17, 2001 -              Rolling Blackouts are implemented as the ISO is unable to procure              enough electricity to keep supply and demand balanced on the statewide              grid. Silicon Valley reports losses in excess of $500 million. Governor              Davis declares a State of Emergency and asks the Legislature for help.             January              17, 2001 -              AB 1X passes out of the Assembly. The Governor signs AB 5X and 6X.              AB 5X shrinks the ISO board from 25 members to 5 members, who are              all appointed by the Governor, and the appointments are not subject              to Senate approval.             January              18, 2001 -              The Assembly concurs with SB 7x that authorizes the Department of              Water Resources to spend $400 million to buy and sell electricity.              This bill is based on a plan to have the state buy electricity from              wholesalers and sell it to utilities at a reduced rate. The Governor              signs AB 5X (Keeley) and AB 6X (Dutra and Pescetti).             January              19, 2001  -              Governor Davis signs SB 7X (Burton) giving the DWR $400 million to              buy power for California until February 1, 2001. Davis appoints another              person to the CPUC, creating a Davis-controlled majority.             January              22, 2001 -              Governor Davis announces auction for long-term energy contracts, officially              putting the state into the energy business.             January              24, 2001 -              Davis hosts an internet auction for power bids. Thirty-nine suppliers              offer deals. Davis' office reports that he is considering using his              emergency powers to take over Edison's contracts.             January              26, 2001 -              Davis announces that rate hikes are now a possibility.             January              26-28, 2001 -              The LA Times reports that Alan Greenspan said the crisis will threaten              the nation's economic growth. The CPUC halts the voluntary conservation              program, which shuts off about 1400 industrial users doing power shortages.              Davis names Freeman to head energy negotiations. Mexico agrees to              sell California power.             January              29, 2001 -              Assembly Republican Leader Bill Campbell criticizes Governor Davis'              lack of leadership on the energy crisis, and his lack of direction              regarding what he would support in legislation. An executive summary              of the audits conducted on PG&E and Edison shows that the utilities              are entitled to 20% rate hikes. The utilities file lawsuits to recover              these lost funds.             January              30, 2001 -              President Bush appoints Vice President Cheney to head a cabinet-level              task force to tackle California's crisis and its potential effects              on the national economy.             January              31, 2001 -              Assembly Republican Leader Bill Campbell issues a press release calling              on Davis to demonstrate leadership on the energy crisis. A few hours              later, Governor Davis sends letters to the Senate and Assembly, urging              the passage of AB 1X. Assemblywoman Carol Migden attacks Republican              Legislators for not offering up any solutions to the energy crisis,              when, in actuality, Republicans have offered up 12 bills, and one              has been signed by the Governor. The Joint Republican Caucus releases              a 15-point plan on resolving the energy crisis. Senator Perata begins              circulating a manifesto that calls on Davis to act quickly to establish              a public power authority.                                                                  February 1, 2001 -              Democrat Assemblywoman Barbara Matthews is the only Democrat not to              vote for AB 1X. She later changes her vote. Governor Davis signs AB              1X, putting the state into the power buying business. The state joins              the major utilities in purchasing power in the spot market, which              the utilities find troubling - as they believe they should have been              out of the spot market when the state got into it. Davis announces              his publicity campaign for energy conservation.             February 2, 2001 -              Governor Davis directs the state energy negotiators to sign some deals              by February 5, 2001 - the day before the federal order to continue              selling energy to California expires. The DWR says it will buy a maximum              of 5% of the state energy load in the spot market.             February 5, 2001 -              Governor Davis seizes $160 million in PG&E contracts, right before              they would have been seized by one of the utility's creditors.             February 7, 2001 -              Assemblyman La Suer introduces AB 34X, which expedites the environmental              review, permitting and completion of ""repowering"" projects.             February 8, 2001 -              Davis announces a plan to streamline the siting and permitting process.              U.S. District Court Judge Frank Damrell orders four companies to continue              selling power to the ISO - the order lasts until February 16, 2001.             February 15, 2001              -              Davis announces his support to purchase 32,000 miles of power lines.              Assembly Democrat approval ratings fall to 25%, and Davis is at 45%..             February 16, 2001              -              Energy Costs and Availability Committee Chairman Rod Wright says that              there will most likely be a rate increase.                            February 20, 2001 -                 It becomes clear to Republican                members of the Legislature that Governor Davis is keeping them out                of the loop, as Democrats are made privy to the cost of Davis' plan                for bailout ($7 billion) and Republicans are not.                         February 21, 2001              -              The first day that California has not been in a Stage Three energy              alert in more than 30 days. The California Energy Commission pinpoints              32 spots in the state for construction of peaker plants. Chief State              Budget Analyst Elizabeth Hill announces that the state budget is taking              major hits, and that the state economy has already lost $1 billion              due to the energy crisis.             February 22, 2001              -              Duke Energy says that it will not sign any long-term contracts with              California unless the Governor promises to pay for all emergency power              that was purchased by Edison and PG&E. The State has now spent              $1.7 billion on energy, and announces that it expects to spend $2.3              billion by March. SMUD announces the necessity of a rate hike.             February 25, 2001              -              Republican Secretary of State Bill Jones attacks Governor Davis for              his counter-productive leadership activities during the energy emergency.             February 26, 2001              -              The DWR wants to amend 4-month old contracts for peaker plants; the              DWR's actions dramatically slow the construction plans for the plants              that will provide auxiliary energy during peak consumption. Governor              Davis meets with Federal Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham. Governor              Davis announces ""an agreement in principle"" with Edison.              Mirant Corporation agrees to sell California 750 megawatts in March.                           February 27, 2001              -               Davis said the state is two weeks to a month away from completing              all the ""legislative fixes"" to the electricity crisis, and              that with ""a little luck and a lot of conservation"" he hopes              to avoid power blackouts this summer when demand is at its peak. Orange              County business leaders announce that companies might have to shut              down or leave California if rolling blackouts aren't averted and the              state doesn't fix its ""interruptible"" conservation program.             February 28, 2001              -              California power regulators declare a Stage Two power alert as electricity              reserves threaten to drop below 5 percent. The declaration marks the              end of a brief respite from power alerts.                                                                 March 1, 2001 -              Calpine Corp. said it signed two more long-term contracts with the              state Department of Water Resources valued at $8.3 billion. Southern              California Gas Co. agreed to provide as much as 30 million cubic feet              of gas per day to PG&E in the next month. The DWR announces that              it will not buy power above what it deems a reasonable rate. This              leaves the ISO to bill the utilities for the power it buys to cover              the state's real-time needs, and power suppliers are concerned they              will not be paid. The San Jose Mercury News announces that power generators              allegedly overcharged wholesale customers for electricity by as much              as $550 million. Now, the agency is asking federal regulators to refund              the high costs, said the draft press release obtained by the Mercury              News. Edison agrees to support AB 24X authored by Republican Assemblywoman              Lynn Daucher. Republican Assemblyman Tony Strickland files a request              for disclosure of the power contracts under the Public Records Act.             March 4, 2001 -              Assemblyman Strickland sends a Public Records Act request to the Department              of Finance asking for the spot market power purchases to date and              the long-term contracts for energy.             March 5, 2001 -              The Assembly Republican Caucus asks Governor Davis to call a special              legislative session to solve the state's pending natural gas crisis.              The San Jose Mercury News reports that Pacific Gas and Electric has              agreed to sell its transmission lines to the state as part of a larger              deal to rescue the company from financial collapse.             March 6, 2001 -              Governor Davis announces that he has 40 contracts for long- term power.              (In actuality, less than 25 of these contracts are finalized at the              time of the announcement). These contracts are valued at about $40              billion, and supposedly include enough power to light 9 million homes              over the next decade. The average purchase price of each deal is $69              per megawatt hour -- well above the $30 to $40 charged by power generators              before California's energy market went awry.             March 8, 2001 -              The Senate and Assembly weekly histories are published. Between the              two houses of the Legislature, a total of 186 bills have been introduced              in the special session; 4 have been signed.             March 9, 2001 -              Governor Davis' office begins to make public some details of the 40              contracts that he has signed for long-term power. Governor Davis says              he needs $500 million more from the state's general fund so that the              state can continue purchasing power until the $10 billion in revenue              bonds are issued to finance long-term supply contracts. Assembly Speaker              Robert Hertzberg has appointed a subcommittee of the Energy Costs              and Availability to focus on natural gas supplies and prices.                            March 12, 2001 -                 Assemblyman Strickland forwards                Public Records Act requests to the Department of Water Resources                (DWR), Controller Kathleen Connell, and the Department of General                Services. Governor Davis announces that his first two proposals                for peaker plants have been received by the California Energy Commission.                Congresswoman Anna Eshoo asks U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft                to investigate whether electricity wholesalers engaged in unlawful                trade practices to manipulate energy prices in order to reap higher                profits.                          March 13, 2001 -              Assemblyman Runner, Budget Committee Vice Chair, published a report              on the budget proceedings that states that the budget is going to              take major hits due to the energy crisis. Governor Davis announces              his plan to spend nearly $90 million additional taxpayer dollars in              order to provide rebates to energy consumers who conserve. The state              Senate forms a committee to investigate whether power generators illegally              manipulated California's electricity market to drive up prices over              the past year. Five energy producers announce that they are planning              to default on $11.1 million in property taxes they owe in 9 California              counties. Edison owes them hundreds of millions of dollars for power              it never paid for. Secretary of State Bill Jones speaks out against              the Governor's energy spending.             March 14, 2001 -              The FERC announces that it has serious concerns about two power generators              in California engaging in price gouging as a way of profiting at the              expense of Californians, who experienced rolling blackouts when an              adequate supply of energy was unavailable.             March 15, 2001 -              A Stage Two power alert is declared. Three bills were passed out of              the Assembly: AB 8x by Assemblywoman Migden (57-5), AB 24x by Assemblywoman              Daucher (67-0), AB 31x by Assemblyman Wright (67-0). Federal Energy              Secretary Spencer Abraham warned that electricity blackouts in California              ""appear inevitable"" this summer, and voiced strong opposition              to implementing price caps on wholesale energy prices. The FERC declared              that they have `serious questions' about the unavailability of two              generating units last spring that resulted in nearly $11 million in              profits for the owners of the companies. The Federal Energy Regulatory              Commission announced several regulatory actions designed to mitigate              the energy shortage, including actions to expedite the approval for              natural gas pipelines into the western region of the United States.              The Legislative Analyst's Office concludes that there may be enough              power to avoid outages this summer. Three qualified facilities sign              a petition for bankruptcy against Edison. The Public Utilities Commission              votes to prohibit PG&E and SoCal Edison from cutting 3,000 workers.             March 16, 2001 -              The San Francisco Chronicle publishes an article which says that Governor              Davis' administration has been spending on average $6 million more              a day ($51 million total) on power than previously stated ($45 million).              The Senate Budget committee tentatively slices $1.9 billion from Davis'              proposed spending plan. Casualties include $40 million for park land              along the Los Angeles River, $100 million to protect beaches from              polluted runoff and $50 million in grants to people who buy or lease              electric vehicles. U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham sends Governor              Davis a letter saying the Bush administration does not oppose the              state's proposal to buy the power grid, but is recommending that the              required FERC approval be contingent upon the grid being available              to other power generators.             March 19, 2001 -              The ISO declared a stage two power alert today, as energy reserves              grew scarce. Rolling blackouts followed in the Sacramento area, as              the utilities were forced to shed 500 megawatts. The Department of              Water Resources announced that there be may serious problems with              getting precious water to the Central Valley due to the significant              expenditures that the DWR has made purchasing energy for the state.              The Dow Jones Newswire is reporting that the Senate Budget Committee              will deny further requests for state funds to buy electricity unless              state regulators immediately carve out a revenue stream to allow the              Department of Water Resources to recover the money. The federal government              is going to be providing $50 million to 3,100 public housing authorities              throughout the nation in order to help pay for high utility bills.              The Federal Energy Department announces that they have concerns over              gas prices this summer, since gas stock is low and crude oil prices              are high.              March 20, 2001 -              Rolling blackouts are ordered across California again as demand for              electricity exceeds supply. The ISO warns that blackouts could happen              between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. The blackouts are the result of a patchwork              of circumstances: increased demand, more power plant outages, less              output from the state's financially struggling alternative energy              producers, lower electricity imports from neighboring states, and              sharply reduced voluntary power cuts by big businesses. PUC Administrative              Law Judge Joseph R. DeUlloa says that he will issue a draft decision              on how the state will be paid for power purchases ""as soon as              practical"" but must first take comments on a letter sent by the              state on March 14. The Assembly Republican Caucus delivers a letter              to the Governor, demanding the resignation of Loretta Lynch, due to              her utter job failure during the energy crisis. Republican members              of Congress from California meet with Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham              to discuss the ongoing situation in the wake of blackouts that began              Monday of this week.             March 21, 2001 -              The San Francisco Chronicle reports that Pacific Gas and Electric              and Southern California Edison are attempting to make higher rates              a condition for agreeing to a bailout scheme in which they would sell              the state their transmission systems and some land. California State              Controller Kathleen Connell says the state's general fund surplus              has dropped to $3.2 billion from $8.5 billion in January, mostly because              of electricity purchases made by the state's Department of Water Resources.              U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr issues a preliminary injunction              Wednesday ordering Reliant Energy Services to continue selling energy              to California despite its fear that it will not be paid. State Controller              Kathleen Connell complains that the energy crunch is imperiling California's              financial health. Connell orders an audit of the state's power buying,              saying Davis is withholding key financial information from her office              and the Legislature. She also refuses a request by Davis and the Legislature              to transfer $5.6 billion into a 'rainy day fund' she said was set              up to impress Wall Street as the state prepares to issue $10 billion              in revenue bonds to cover its power buying. Transferring the money              would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in debt.                           March 22, 2001 -              An Imperial County judge rules that geothermal energy supplier CalEnergy              Operating Co. can suspend delivery to Edison and begin selling power              on the open market. An economist working for the ISO concludes that              electricity wholesalers have overcharged California more than $5 billion              by manipulating the energy market. The ISO files the findings with              federal regulators yesterday, and asks for a refund. The judge said              Californians were at risk of irreparable harm if Reliant stopped selling              power to the ISO, which buys at the last minute on behalf of utilities              to bolster supplies and try to fend off blackouts. David Boies, the              attorney who led the Department of Justice's antitrust case against              Microsoft Corp., is retained as counsel to two small California power              producers in their bid to get Edison to repay more than $100 million              in past due payments. AB 8X fails passage out of the Assembly, after              being approved by the Senate.             March 23, 2001 -              The Assembly reconvenes to try and pass AB 8X, but the bill is not              taken up after a day of caucusing. Assembly Speaker Hertzberg cancels              the trip to Washington, D.C. in light of the growing crisis and lack              of solutions.             March 25, 2001 -              CPUC Chairwoman Loretta Lynch announces that the commission plans              on increasing rates anywhere from 20 to 50%.             March 26, 2001 -              Edison announces that it will begin paying the QF's on a forward-going              basis, starting with energy supplies for April. The New York Times              runs a story which suggests that El Paso Merchant Energy Company took              steps to manipulate the natural gas market in order to control both              retail prices and supply.             March 27, 2001 -              The PUC unanimously approves a 46% increase in retail electricity              rates, the largest in the state's history. In light of the rate hikes,              the utilities' stocks are again on the rise.             March 28, 2001 -              The FERC orders further inquiry into allegations by California officials              that El Paso Natural Gas Co. manipulated the natural gas market by              keeping supply artificially low, thus contributing greatly to the              skyrocketing price of electricity in the state. Governor Davis meets              with legislative Democrats to brief them on the status of talks between              the state and the utilities regarding the purchase of the power grid.             March 29, 2001 -               Strickland files a Public Records Act lawsuit in San Diego Superior              Court. Defendants are Governor Gray Davis, Controller Kathleen Connell,              DWR Director Thomas Hannigan and DWR. He joined in his suit by Strickland              is joined in the lawsuit by Assembly members Roy Ashburn, Bill Campbell,              John Campbell, Dave Cogdill, Dave Cox, Dennis Hollingsworth, Jay LaSuer,              Bill Leonard, Dennis Mountjoy, Keith Richman and Phil Wyman. A Stage              Two power alert is declared as power reserves dip. It is called off              later when power supplies exceeded 7% (a warning was still in effect).              PG&E announces that almost 70 percent of its 4.6 million customers              can expect an increase in their bills as a result of the $4.8 billion              rate increase adopted by the California Public Utilities Commission.              The Office of the Ratepayer Advocate, a division of the CPUC accuses              San Diego Gas and Electric of padding electricity bills in a scheme              that has cost area ratepayers at least $170 million in recent months.                                                                               April 2, 2001 -              A Stage Two Power Alert is called. An Imperial County judge delays              action on power wholesaler CalEnergy's case against Southern California              Edison over $140 million in bills the utility has failed to pay. Judge              Donal Donnelly plans a hearing April 16. The Foundation for Taxpayer              and Consumer Rights releases a countdown to ``Judgment Day,'' saying              there are 582 days until its anti-rate hike initiative goes to voters              on Election Day in November 2002.             April 3, 2001 -              Power grid managers declare another Stage Two alert as power reserves              approach 5 percent. Downed transmission lines complicate the flow              of electricity up the state and about 13,000 megawatts of electricity              remained offline for repairs or maintenance. Gov. Gray Davis appears              before the Senate Democrats' caucus to brief the lawmakers on energy              issues.             April 4, 2001 -              Energy Commission lawyers decide that California cannot require builders              of new power plants to sell electricity to California, even in exchange              for a rushed environmental review of their projects. The Assembly              approves legislation extending a rate cap for San Diego Gas &              Electric's residential and small-business customers to medium and              large businesses. The measure now goes to the Senate. The Senate Appropriations              Committee sends the Senate a $408 million energy conservation measure              that would provide grants and loans to improve energy efficiency at              homes, businesses and government agencies. Congressional Democrats              including Reps. Mike Honda and Anna Eshoo of California announce legislation              that would impose power rates based on the cost of service and let              western states recover overcharges by power suppliers.             April 5, 2001 -              Legislature passes legislation for conservation efforts. Davis addresses              state on TV in order to discuss his support for conservation and rate              increases. He also outlines his alternative to the PUC's rate hike.             April 6, 2001 -              PG&E files for bankruptcy.             April 9, 2001 -              Gov. Gray Davis announces a deal for the state to buy transmission              lines from Southern California Edison for $2.76 billion. A federal              bankruptcy judge rules PG&E can continue using its assets to back              its purchases of natural gas, assuring suppliers will continue being              paid despite the company's filing for Chapter 11 protection. The state              Attorney General's office and state Department of Finance conclude              the state is not a PG&E creditor and will continue to be paid              for the electricity it is buying on PG&E's behalf, despite the              utility's bankruptcy.             April 10, 2001 -              FERC holds a conference in Boise, Idaho, on Western energy issues.              The first of three House Government Reform Committee hearings begin              in Sacramento.             April 11, 2001 -              A second member of the FERC begins supporting price caps. A confidential              document emerges from the LA Times demonstrating that public power              agencies have engaged in price gouging - the LADWP is named. Federal              court orders Enron to continue selling energy to universities. Davis              signs $850 million in conservation bills.             April 12, 2001 -              Roseville PUC says it will have to raise rates. Supplier Reliant announces              it filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court on Friday, asking that              California's Attorney General keep private records it plans to supply              to the state as part of an investigation into price manipulation.              Reliant says it wants assurances that the subpoenaed documents won't              get leaked to its competitors.              April 16, 2001 -              PG&E and Edison are scheduled to pay back debts starting this              week. The California Energy Commission says business and residents              cut their electricity use by 9.2 percent in March compared to a year              ago. Power use fell 8 percent in February and 6.2 percent in January              over a similar period last year. Davis taps David Freeman, general              manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, to be his              permanent chief energy adviser and to help launch the energy conservation              programs signed into law last week. The Federal Energy Regulatory              Commission orders energy wholesalers to justify $587,000 in possibly              excessive charges for electricity sold to California's utilities in              March. The order is the third time the FERC has ordered power wholesalers              to justify more than $124 million in charges for January and February.                                         April 17, 2001 -              Gov. Gray Davis lobbies Senate Republicans and Assembly Democrats              on his plan to buy the transmission lines owned by Southern California              Edison. Edison is scheduled to release its earnings report. The state              remains free of power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent. A Los              Angeles County Superior Court judge has scheduled a hearing on a lawsuit              filed against Davis by Judicial Watch, a conservative legal group.              The group wants Davis to announce the details of power purchases made              by the state. Edison International declares a huge write-off of electricity              and other costs. Edison posts a fourth-quarter operating loss of $3.8              billion, versus operating income of $326.9 million in 1999. Operating              loss for 2000 was $1.73 billion, compared with operating income of              $1.75 billion in 1999.

Legislative Democrats adjourn first extraordinary                session in order to make bonds available in 90 days. Governor calls                for second extraordinary session, which is convened. Assemblymembers                Dutra and Nation offer an alternative to Davis' proposal to purchase                Southern California Edison's transmission lines for $2.76 billion                to help the company pay its massive debt. They propose that Edison                give the state a five-year option to buy the utility's transmissionlines                for $1.2 billion. The Assembly Energy Oversight Subcommittee releases                a report criticizing FERC for approving contracts it says led to                exorbitant natural gas prices. FERC holds a Washington, D.C., hearing                on the natural gas market. A lawsuit by Democratic legislative leaders                asking a federal judge to order FERC to trim energy prices has been                delayed until next week. Edison International reports a $617 million                first-quarter loss. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali hears arguments                from lawyers for both Pacific Gas and Electric and the state Public                Utilities Commission, but has yet to rule whether the PUC was within                its rights to force PG&E to make an accounting change that prevents                the utility from recouping its $13 billion debt from its customers.

May 22, 2001 -              A new peaker plant has been licensed, and should be up and running              by September. Legislative Democrats sue FERC for not setting reasonable              rates, citing that the state's elderly and hospitalized populations              are being put at tremendous risk. Under a stipulation filed in San              Francisco Superior Court, Reliant Energy, Mirant Corporation and Dynegy              will provide documents demanded by the state justice department's              investigation of possibly unlawful or anti-competitive behavior that              may have triggered soaring electricity prices in California. Gov.              Gray Davis signs Assembly Bill 3X. It requires the state Public Utilities              Commission and the utilities to sign up more low-income customers              for discounted electricity rates. Davis signs Senate Bill 28X, giving              local governments more than $3 million in grants to speed reviews              of power plant proposals; shortens approval times for remodeling existing              plants from 12 months to six months and extends the four-month siting              process for peaker plants.

State Controller              Connell says contracts the administration negotiated with electricity              generators give them first priority. Davis' advisors say she's wrong              and the general fund will be repaid the money the state is spending              to buy power on behalf of three cash-strapped utilities.             May 24, 2001 -              The PUC votes on whether to provide 30 minute warnings before blackouts.              Reliant Energy sharply lowers its power prices in anticipation that              Southern California air quality monitors will let three plants release              more pollution this summer. Davis says he is considering paying businesses              to run dirty diesel generators to boost the state's power supply and              help avert rolling blackouts. The state Department of Water Resources              signs a 19-month agreement with Mirant for 500 megawatts of power              beginning in June. The state Public Utilities Commission approves              a new round of programs that offer big customers cheaper electricity              in exchange for less power use. The PUC decides to begin re-examining              the calculation that determines which residential customers of the              state's two largest utilities will see their bills rise under a recent              record rate increase.

The California Energy Commission              licenses a 530-megawatt addition to the existing Contra Costa Power              Project a mile northeast of Antioch. Construction on the $250-300              million project should begin in early summer 2001, with the plant              on line by early 2003.             May 31, 2001 -              A Stage Two energy alert is declared, as reserves fall below 7%.

State energy regulators say they are close to              proving how power wholesalers manipulated the energy market and participated              in price gouging. Twelve Long Beach residents file a lawsuit against              their city, saying officials violated the law by charging much more              than neighboring Southern California Gas Co. The lawsuit, which seeks              class-action status, claims $38 million in damages.                                                                 June 1, 2001 -              Judge Linda B. Quinn, San Diego Superior Court, Department 74, sets              oral arguments for June 13, 1:30 pm. California grid managers respond              to a federal order that offered some price controls on wholesale electricity              but only if the state gives up some control of its power grid. In              April, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered California              to file a proposal to join or create a regional transmission organization,              or RTO, or forego the limited price caps that took effect Tuesday.              Officials with the California Independent System Operator, keeper              of the state's power grid, say FERC's order is illegal, since it links              price caps to the state's joining an RTO.             June 4, 2001 -              56% of respondents to a Washington Post support wholesale electricity              price caps. PG&E's creditors agree to allow the top executives              to receive $17.5 million in bonuses, as long as the management submits              a financial reorganization plan by January 2002. Chevron Corp. will              reduce gasoline production at its two California refineries unless              they are exempted from rolling blackouts. The Senate Rules Committee              agrees to issue subpoenas to eight out-of-state power generating companies              demanding documents on pricing, bidding and other aspects of electricity              sales in the state.             June 5, 2001 -              Two major power suppliers, AES and Williams Energy, say they are the              subject of a Justice Department investigation. The civil probe is              focused on whether an agreement between AES and Williams Energy limited              the expansion of power plants that AES owns in Southern California""             June 6, 2001 -              Pacific Gas & Electric Co. asks U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali              to stop the manager of the state's power grid from buying electricity              for utility or charging it for any electricity bought after the utility              filed for bankruptcy on April 6. Separately, the utility's creditors              support its request to the bankruptcy court to pay out $17.5 million              in bonuses to the management team that guided the utility into bankruptcy.              California Department of Water Resources reveals it is negotiating              with municipal utilities to buy their surplus power. Department spokesman              Oscar Hidalgo says talks began last week but no agreements are imminent.              Pacific Gas and Electric announces a decrease in natural gas prices,              down 38 percent from May's rates and 66 percent lower than January's              rates. The LA Times publishes reporting that wholesale prices of electricity              and natural gas in California have fallen sharply in recent weeks,              and experts say that the relief could be the harbinger of an energy              turnaround. At night, when demand slackens, power sometimes sells              for less than $20 per megawatt-hour. That is reminiscent of the days              before prices went haywire last summer. It is a drastically different              scenario than the $500 to $800 the state paid during a spate of hot              weather last month. Meanwhile, wholesale natural gas prices at a bellwether              pipeline junction on the Southern California-Arizona border dipped              last week to their lowest levels since November, according to a publication              that tracks the industry. Separately, Southern California Gas Co.              and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. reported June rate cuts for their              residential gas customers of 16% and 38%, respectively. Experts credited              a combination of conservation, mild weather, a burst of increased              hydroelectric generation and lower natural gas prices for the drop              in electricity costs.""                           June 7, 2001 -              House Republicans announce that they are abandoning efforts to push              for a short-term energy bill to help California this summer after              failing to come to an agreement with Democrats over capping Western              electricity prices. State power regulators increase the electric bill              discount for low-income customers from 15 percent to 20 percent. Gov.              Gray Davis announces a plan to install more than 3,400 real-time electricity              meters in businesses in the Los Angeles area.             June 11, 2001 -              Gov. Gray Davis signs an executive order letting natural gas-fired              power plants operate in excess of usual air emission limitations.              Attorney General Bill Lockyer briefs Davis on his criminal investigation              of power generators. The state Assembly, by a 50-17 vote, asks Congress              to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to order refunds              of excessive energy charges and set wholesale electricity price caps.              Department of Water Resources Deputy Director Ray Hart sends a letter              to the generators that the state has signed long-term contracts with.              He advises them that the state is prepared to release ""redacted,""              or edited contracts to the judge at the June 13th hearing and ask              her to release the state from the secrecy clauses contained in the              contracts.                            June 12, 2001 -              Southern California Edison reaches an agreement to stabilize prices              and pay part of its debts to alternative power producers. The deal              calls for an end to litigation by those small companies that produce              power from alternative sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, bio-mass              and at gas-fired co-generation facilities. The Environmental Protection              Agency denies California's request for an exemption from using ethanol              in gasoline - a move that is sure to hike up California gas prices.              The FERC is expected to consider expanding wholesale electricity price              caps when the have a committee hearing next week. Attorney General              Bill Lockyer announces that he will convene a criminal grand jury              to investigate possible illegal market manipulation practices. Vice              President Dick Cheney tells Californians in Congress Tuesday not to              expect energy price controls from the Bush administration. Senator              Burton says he'll introduce three energy-related measures in the Legislature              including one that would repeal a 10 percent rate hike scheduled to              take effect next year.             June 13, 2001 -              A San Diego County Superior Court judge orders the state to release              details of 38 long-term power contracts. Judge Linda B. Quinn gives              the governor's office until noon on Friday to make the contracts,              worth $42 billion, available to the public. The state Public Utilities              Commission unanimously passes an agreement between Southern California              Edison and small power generators that could help the utility avoid              bankruptcy and keep the lights on this summer.             June 14, 2001 -              The state pays $29 million for power, the first time the cost has              dropped that low since the state began buying electricity on behalf              of three cash-strapped utilities Jan. 17. Air quality management officials              tell a Senate committee that third-party transactions and sales to              brokers are driving up the price of air emission credits.              June 15, 2001 -              Gov. Davis releases nearly $43 billion worth of state long-term energy              contacts with 18 electricity providers, for the public to review.                           June 18, 2001 -              A heat wave marks the return of rolling blackouts to California, with              the ISO forecasting the possibility of Stage 3 alerts for Monday and              Tuesday. Federal energy regulators order price restraints on              electricity sales throughout 10 Western states and California. Governor              Davis announces a deal with Sempra (SDG&E), which relieves ratepayers              from having to pay the debt of the utility. PG&E executives will              get their $17.5 million in bonuses as a way to retain them in their              current employment.             June 19, 2001 -              Edison International chief John E. Bryson says a federal ruling this              week limiting wholesale energy prices in 10 Western states isn't enough              to pull its utility, Southern California Edison, any further from              the brink of bankruptcy. More than two months after Davis signed a              memorandum of understanding to assist financially strapped Southern              California Edison, a Senate committee begins hearings on the proposal.              The Senate Energy Committee will hold at least three days of hearings              before the Judiciary and Natural Resources committees begin their              own hearings before the Aug. 15 deadline for legislative action. The              governments of California, New York and Connecticut, along with several              environmental and consumer groups, file suit to stop the Bush administration's              decision to weaken efficiency standards for central air conditioners.             June 21, 2001 -              Gov. Gray Davis testifies before the U.S. Senate Government Affairs              Committee, telling senators that the state should get a $9 billion              refund from power wholesalers that overcharged the state in the past              year. Davis says the price controls approved by federal regulators              will help the state, but they don't address the overcharges.             June 25, 2001 -              The FERC and various other parties to the dispute on generator over-charges              begin meetings to determine if and how much refunds will be. Governor              Davis announces that three new power plants will be brought on-line              in the next three weeks. Three more ""whistleblowers"" come              forth to accuse Duke Energy of intentionally taking power off line              during an energy crisis. FERC commissioners Pat Wood and Nora Brownell              meet with Davis and attend California Energy Commission meeting. The              Senate, by a 34-0 vote, gives final approval to a resolution asking              Congress to allow states to extend daylight-saving time to the full              year to save energy. Assemblyman Mike Brigg's bill to give customers              a one-month schedule of when they might be vulnerable to rolling blackouts              is rejected by the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee.             June 26, 2001 -              State treasurer Phil Angelides announces the state has received a              $4.3 billion loan that will go to buy energy in the months to come.              The Coyote Valley power plant, to be built by Calpine, is approved              by the San Jose City Council. Assemblyman Strickland is triumphant              against Davis, as the San Diego judge ruling on his case, Strickland              V. Davis, forces to Davis to disclose the financial details of the              contracts the Governor signed with wholesale power generators.             June 27, 2001 -              State regulators postpone a scheduled vote barring consumers from              shopping around for electricity until next Tuesday at the request              of state lawmakers seeking a compromise to keep the ""direct access''              option alive. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali orders that Pacific              Gas & Electric Co. is free to ignore hundreds of millions of dollars              worth of electricity bills from the ISO, and for the ISO to stop purchasing              power on behalf of the cash-starved utility.                                                                 July 2, 2001 -              The state discloses that Californians cut their energy consumption              by 12.3% percent in June, down from May 2001. The ISO announces that              they were responsible for telling Duke Energy to cut their production,              to keep an even amount of energy on the grid, which makes Governor              Davis, Lt. Governor Bustamante, and the supposed ""whistleblowers""              all look like fools. State Controller Kathleen Connell releases the              unedited contracts that Governor Davis has signed with energy producers.              A Stage Two energy alert is declared. Electricity supplier Duke Energy              unveiled operations logs Monday to fight accusations that it manipulated              turbine output to boost prices in California during January. State              grid operators already have acknowledged that they, not the company,              were the ones in charge during the three days in question. The Sutter              Power Plant comes on line, adding 540 megawatts to the grid.             July 3, 2001 -              Pacific Gas and Electric Co. asks a bankruptcy judge to give the company              until Dec. 6 to submit its plan of reorganization. Under the current              timeline, the utility has until Aug. 6 to file that plan. State power              regulators cancel a vote on whether to continue allowing Californians              to shop for their electricity as they do for long distance phone service.              State grid managers declare a Stage 2 power alert as electricity reserves              drop below 5 percent.             July 9, 2001 -              Energy talks wind down in Washington DC, with little hope of resolution.              Presiding Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner said that the state              is owed no more that $1billion. The state is demanded over $8 billion,              and the energy companies have offered only $740 million in settlements              and refunds.             July 10, 2001 -              U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis says a committee of Pacific Gas and Electric              Co. ratepayers has no legal standing in bankruptcy court. Calpine              Corporation says it is near agreement with California officials over              money the state says the company overcharged for electricity. That              would make it the first company to settle a portion of the $8.9 billion              dollars the state is seeking in proceedings before the Federal Energy              Regulatory Commission. Enron Corp. is suing state officials to stop              a Senate subpoena of its financial records in a dispute over alleged              overcharges for its electricity sales to California.             July 12, 2001 -              Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., releases his recommendation, which says              that while there are ""vast sums"" due for overcharges, California              utilities, grid managers and the state agency purchasing power owe              generators even more. Wagner says the state's estimate that it's owed              $8.9 billion ""has not and cannot be substantiated."" Several              members of California's congressional delegation will submit a letter              to federal energy regulators, supporting Gov. Gray Davis' position              in the settlement talks over refunds for alleged electricity overcharges.              The Senate approves a resolution supporting the governor's use of              his emergency powers that let him commandeer power plants or contracts              to stabilize wholesale electricity prices. The Public Utilities Commission              approves a program that lets large industrial companies bid for how              much they get paid when they cut electricity use as blackouts loom.              An energy company scraps plans to build a new power plant in Chula              Vista, blaming state officials for failing to guarantee that the facility              would turn a profit. Officials from Ramco Inc., announce that they              couldn't reach an agreement with the state Department of Water Resources              on the amount of energy to be generated at the proposed plant. The              natural gas-fired generator would have produced up to 62 megawatts              during peak usage and was scheduled to be operational by Sept. 30.             July 16, 2001 -              US Bankruptcy Court Judge Dennis Montali rules that is acceptable              for PG&E to pay top level executives their bonuses, as a means              to retain them as employees, and steer the utility out of its current              financial crisis. The State Assembly passes the budget act.              July 17, 2001 -              A new, bi-partisan bill to bail out Edison emerges, co-athored by              Assemblymen Rod Wright (D) and Keith Richman (R). PG&E sues the              state seeking reimbursement for millions of dollars in energy contracts              Davis legally seized Jan. 31. Duke Energy reports a 27 percent jump              in its second-quarter earnings, beating Wall Street's expectations.             July 18, 2001 -              A CBS News poll finds that 40 percent of California residents blame              government for the energy woes, more than the 33 percent who blame              energy companies. California officials acknowledge the state has begun              selling power for a fraction of its purchase price as cool weather              creates an abundance of electricity. The state Public Utilities Commission              issues a proposed agreement, which explains how it will work with              the state Department of Water Resources to ensure the state is repaid              for the billions it has spent buying electricity for the customers              of three              financially ailing utilities: A RATE INCREASE. Both the Senate and              the Assembly try to pass their versions of the governor's Memorandum              of Understanding with cash-strapped Southern California Edison. The              Davis administration on tells consultants buying energy for the state              to sell their stock holdings in energy companies immediately or quit              their jobs.                           July 19, 2001 -              Pacific Gas and Electric Co. decides to extend contracts to buy electricity              from 131 small power plants for the next five years. Assemblyman John              Campbell sends a letter to the director of the Department of Water              Resources, demanding to know how much surplus power the state is selling              and at what price. Californians now say that although the state needs              power, nuclear energy is not a safe enough source. The poll, released              Thursday by the Public Policy Institute of California, showed that              55 percent of residents believe nuclear power is too dangerous, even              if building more nuclear power plants would help alleviate the country's              energy problems. In a Field Institute poll of 1,015 adults released              in May, 59 percent of Californians favored nuclear power and 36 percent              were opposed. Edison International Inc., the parent of troubled utility              Southern California Edison, reports a loss of $102 million in the              second quarter, primarily due to unrecovered costs of buying power.             July 22, 2001 -              The DWR announces that rate hikes will most likely not be necessary.             July 23, 2001 -              U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham unveils a plan Monday to help              alleviate a transmission bottleneck that has kept power from flowing              freely throughout the state during times of peak usage. The plan calls              for expanding the state's power grid along so-called Path 15 by attracting              private investment for the $300 million project. The San Francisco              Chronicle publishes a story that Morgan Stanley, a multibillion dollar              financial firm and adviser to several power generators, destroyed              documents that potentially could show efforts to gouge California              consumers. Secretary of State Bill Jones asks the state Assembly to              allot $250,000 for a legislative review into whether Gov. Gray Davis'              advisers complied with conflicts of interest laws. A Senate committee              investigating possible price manipulation has given the full Senate              a report asking for Houston-based Enron Corp. to be cited for contempt.              U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali gives Pacific Gas and Electric              Co. four additional months to produce a reorganization plan in its              Chapter 11 filing. Reliant Energy Inc. sues California for failure              to pay for long-term power contracts Gov. Gray Davis seized in February              from the state's now defunct Power Exchange.              July 24, 2001 -              The San Francisco Chronicle publishes a story which shows the state's              financial losses in selling energy back to the grid at a loss. Pacific              Gas and Electric Co. officials ask the state to hold a public hearing              on its revised revenue requirements from customer rates. State Controller              Kathleen Connell refuses to pay claims totaling $3,661 for meals for              DWR employees. She says they improperly used a state credit card to              pay for meals, including $910 for sushi and $439 for Italian takeout.              Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr. called for a trial-like hearing within              60 days to resolve the dispute. California claims generators overcharged              by $8.9 billion; wholesalers offered to refund slightly more than              $700 million.              July 25, 2001 -              Federal energy regulators agree with California that it was charged              too much for electricity in the past year, but put off until the fall              a decision on the amount. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission              orders an evidentiary hearing, to be completed within 60 days, to              determine the size of the refund from providers of wholesale power.              Secretary of State Bill Jones calls for the federal Securities and              Exchange Commission to investigate Davis administration energy advisers,              particularly consultant Vikram Budhraja, for ""possible insider              stock trading.'' Attorney General Bill Lockyer has ordered State Contoller              Kathleen Connell to pay a contract with Davis' energy advisers. Connell              had refused to make the payments, saying the advisers had a conflict              of interest. The AG's office says there are no grounds to withhold              payment to Saber Partners, LLC or Blackstone Group, LP, for work they've              done for the state on energy issues. If the controller doesn't pay              by Wednesday, the attorney general's office says it will sue her to              force the payment.              July 27, 2001 -              Governor Davis fires five energy consultants amid accusations and              a Securities and Exchange Commission Insider Trading investigation              regarding the consultants' energy stock purchases.             July 29, 2001 -              Gov. Gray Davis plans to appeal the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission              decision, state officials say. Refunds could help prevent the state              from raising electric rates to cover its power buying costs, which              are now beyond $8 billion.              July 30, 2001 -              After several delays, the entrance of Texas into the deregulated electricity              market is set to begin Tuesday. Under a pilot program, officials of              the state's electrical grid will begin switching some customers to              new power providers at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. The state has been joined              by natural gas industry players in accusing Houston-based El Paso              Corp.of restricting the flow of natural gas into California to drive              up its price and ultimately the cost to ratepayers. The gas shippers              that lease the pipeline space now also say El Paso is to blame for              soaring California energy prices.                                                                 August 2, 2001 -              Steve Maviglio, spokesperson for Governor Davis, sells his Calpine              stock, amid accusations of insider trading.             August 3, 2001 -              Rep. Doug Ose, R-Sacramento, criticized Gov. Gray Davis and his chosen              directors of the state's electricity grid Thursday for costing California              potentially billions of dollars in electricity refunds from power              wholesalers. Ose, chairman of a House investigative subcommittee,              said the California Independent System Operator, manager of the state's              electricity grid, lacks independence from Davis, a Democrat.              August 6, 2001 -              Curtis Hebert, a target of congressional Democrats and California's              governor over his handling of the Western power crisis, announces              that he is resigning at the end of the month as chairman of the Federal              Energy Regulatory Commission.             August 8, 2001 -              Pacific Gas and Electric Co. tells state power regulators the amount              of electricity each household can buy at the cheapest rate should              be adjusted upward. Gov. Gray Davis ceremonially flips the switch              on a peaker power plant in the Palm Springs-area. Public Utilities              Commission President Loretta Lynch and Consumers Union say the future              resignation of the nation's top energy regulator is good news for              California. Patrick Wood III, a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory              Commission and former PUC chairman in Texas, is FERC Chairman Curtis              Hebert's likely replacement. California consumer's electric rates              won't climb any higher, according to officials from the agency that              has spent more than $9 billion buying power on behalf of millions              of utility customers. The state Department of Water Resources, however,              did raise by roughly $5 million its estimate of how much money it              would need to keep buying electricity and recoup its debts, said department              spokesman Don Strickland.              August 9, 2001 -              State Controller Kathleen Connell says the state plans to issue $6              billion in short-term bonds to cover California's electricity costs              until it irons out complications with issuing an expected $12.5 billion              in municipal bonds. Connell says the state's general fund is running              low after recent power purchases and the bonds could be issued as              early as September. California power managers say 65 million customers              in 14 Western states and parts of Canada and Mexico were at risk of              blackouts last week when several power suppliers failed to deliver              electricity to the region as promised. Gregg Fishman, a spokesman              for the California Independent System Operator, said during last Thursday's              incident, the balance was so close that the unexpected loss of a single              power plant could have triggered the region's worst outage in five              years.              August 15, 2001 -              Energy companies say they're owed $1.25 billion for power sold through              the state grid in April and May. Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director              of the Independent Energy Producers, says payment for April sales              is more than a month late. Republican Assemblyman John Campbell is              urging the Legislature to hold oversight hearings on Gov. Gray Davis'              energy actions. Campbell says the governor has committed more than              $50 billion in ratepayer's funds without enough oversight. Assembly              Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, would have to set a hearing              on the issue. The unexpected resignation of Enron Corp. president              and chief executive Jeffrey K. Skilling sends the Houston-based energy              giant's stock tumbling to a 52-week low.              August 18, 2001 -              The state announces that it paid less in July for power purchases              than each of the two preceding months. Officials say the state paid              $909 million to purchase electricity in July, nearly $100 million              less than in June and more than $1 billion less than in May.              August 20, 2001 -              Lawmakers return to Sacramento on Monday to the unfinished business              of how to prevent Southern California Edison from following the state's              largest utility, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., into bankruptcy.             August 21, 2001 -              The Public Utilities Commission announces a preliminary list of businesses              and institutions that could receive exemptions from rolling blackouts.              Pacific Gas and Electric Co. asks a Sacramento Superior Court judge              to order the Department of Water Resources to hold a public hearing              on the department's revenue requirements. Gov. Gray Davis swears in              four members of the state's new power authority. S. David Freeman              will be the chairman of the new board and Sunne McPeak, John Stevens              and Donald Vial will serve on the board. Freeman receives a salary              of $220,008 for the position. Davis says he has agreed with Assembly              Democratic leaders on a version of his deal to rescue Edison from              bankruptcy. The new plan calls for the state to allow Edison to issue              $2.9 billion in revenue bonds, which would be repaid by Edison's commercial              and industrial customers. The utility would still have $1 billion              in debts to energy companies. August 23, 2001 Republican lawmakers              again call for legislative oversight hearings to examine energy purchases              and possible conflicts of interest by state power traders and members              of Gov. Gray Davis' staff.              August 23, 2001 -              Southern California Edison officials tell state lawmakers Thursday              that a plan moving through the Assembly is close to what would allow              the utility to regain its financial health, even though it leaves              the utility with $1 billion in debt. The Assembly, by a 43-23 vote,              approves a bill that creates a new board within the Public Utilities              Commission to find ways to encourage more low-income families to sign              up for current energy-bill assistance programs. It moves to the Senate.              A state commission will attempt to determine whether a top energy              adviser to Gov. Gray Davis had a conflict of interest in negotiating              a contract with an out-of-state power company he had worked for months              earlier. Vikram Budhraja had worked for the Williams Cos. months before              he participated in contract negotiations between the state and the              Tulsa, Okla.-based energy company. The state Fair Political Practices              Commission will examine whether there was a conflict of interest.                           August 24, 2001 -              Members of the new California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing              Authority opens its inaugural meeting to a packed crowd, vowing to              support energy consumers. At the top of the new authority's inaugural              agenda: how to avoid the conflicts of interest allegations that have              plagued the state's other power-related agencies, the Department of              Water Resources and the California Energy Commission. S. David Freeman,              chairman of the power authority, vowed to screen all prospective employees'              statements of economic interest before hiring for the new agency.                           August 27, 2001 -              Gov. Gray Davis announces a new $1 million program for California              K-12 teachers to receive grants of up to $3,000 for energy conservation              education.              August 28, 2001 -              The Public Utilities Commission delayed release of the draft rate              agreement that gives the state Department of Water Resources the authority              to raise utility customers' rates without PUC review. The PUC plans              to vote on the draft agreement, and several other key energy measures,              on Sept. 6.             August 29, 2001 -              The Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee passed the Edison              MOU on an 11-7 vote - largely along party lines. An energy glut and              advances in water purification are sparking fresh interest in desalination              plants that could boost water supplies in Southern California. The              Metropolitan Water District, which supplies 300 cities between Ventura              County and the Mexican border, said Thursday it will begin soliciting              bids this fall from potential builders for plants capable of supplying              water for up to 250,000 people.              August 30, 2001 -              Pacific Gas and Electric Co. sends letters to Northern and Central              California lawmakers, urging them to oppose a proposal from state              power regulators to shift $500 million in power costs from Southern              California customers to PG&E customers. Consumer advocates protest              a $2.9 billion revenue bond deal to prevent Southern California Edison              from slipping into bankruptcy, after the Assembly energy committee              voted to strip out a requirement that Edison transfer 21,000 acres              of sensitive Sierra watershed lands to a trust created by the state.              The Association of California Water Agencies joins other business              groups around the state protesting the looming suspension of direct              access, or the right for Californians to shop around for the best              deal on electricity.                                                                 September 4, 2001              -              The Public Utilities Commission issues its latest revision of how              much ratepayer money three ailing California utilities must provide              the state's electricity-buying agency. The latest numbers show Pacific              Gas and Electric Co. was ordered to hand over about $6.5 billion,              Southern California Edison $4 billion and San Diego Gas and Electric              $1.5 billion. The Assembly Appropriations Committee approves a bill              to rescue near-bankrupt Southern California Edison, sending the measure              to the full Assembly for approval as early as Wednesday. The committee              reinstated 20,000 acres of development rights on timberland surrounding              Edison's hydroelectric facilities. However, consumer advocates warned              the bill does not sufficiently safeguard ratepayers from having to              pay off Edison's $3.9 billion debt. The Assembly Energy Costs and              Availability Committee approves a bill that would require the Department              of Water Resources to hold public hearings on their power purchases.              The bill, by Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, also sets aside a              portion of customer rates to repay $12.5 billion in revenue bonds.              It also limits how that money can be spent by DWR to power purchases              and legislatively approved administrative costs. The bill moves to              the Assembly Appropriations Committee.              September 8, 2001              -              The State Assembly passes the Edison MOU on a vote of 41-32. State              treasurer Phil Angelides says the state will have to re-time its expected              sale of $12.5 billion in bonds because of the PUC's delay on suspending              direct access and a host of other issues key to shaping California's              response to its energy debacle. Enron Corp. must turn over sensitive              financial documents to a state Senate committee investigating possible              price manipulation of wholesale energy prices, a judge rules.             September 10, 2001              -              California businesses are now threatening to sue following recent              increases of up to 49 percent. This week, regulators are expected              to raise rates 19 percent for large businesses in San Diego County              while limiting increases for residents to an average 12 percent. The              Los Angeles Times breaks a story that the LA DWP made far more money              on the state's energy crisis than even previously thought - sometimes              as much as 53% over cost. Records show that during the worst 13 months              of the crisis ending in May, the DWP profited $200 million on sales              of $680 million, the Times said. The agency says it is still owed              $180 million.              September 13, 2001              -              The Senate Energy Committee considers yet another version of Gov.              Gray Davis' plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy.              The latest plan would let the utility issue $2.5 billion in bonds,              leaving the company with $1.4 billion in debts. The state Senate approves              a bill that requires Senate confirmation of the governor's appointees              to the Independent System Operator board of governors. The bill, by              Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, also increases the terms from              one to three years. It was sent to the governor's desk on a 33-4 vote.              The Enron Corp. and the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price              Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market agree to get Enron documents              to committee investigators.              September 17, 2001              -              Governor Davis and Senator Burton engage in verbal sniping over the              possibility of a third extraordinary session - Burton says he will              immediately adjourn any special session. Security is stepped up at              power plants throughout California.             September 18, 2001              -              Edison creditors begin mulling over the idea of forcing Edison into              bankruptcy, in light of diminishing hopes of a bailout (see September              17, 2001).             September 20, 2001              -              Pacific Gas and Electric Co. will split its corporation into four              entities, company officials said Thursday, as part of its bankruptcy              reorganization plan. The plan, filed Thursday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court              in San Francisco, will allow the utility to pay about $13.2 billion              in creditor claims without asking the court to raise customer rates.              PUC announces it expects to decide whether to suspend the option of              California consumers to switch from their electric utility to a competitor              for lower prices or electricity generated from renewable resources.              The commission also is expected at its Thursday meeting to raise electric              rates for San Diego utility customers and allow the state's power-buying              agency to pass along its power costs to consumers without scrutiny              to ensure they spent taxpayer money reasonably. U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein,              D-Calif., asks Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Pat Wood              to review the commission's ethics regulations and record-keeping procedures.              Feinstein says a recent General Accounting Office report found that              former Chairman Curt Hebert, Jr., had discussed support for his continued              appointment as chairman with Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay. The              GAO says those calls didn't violate any law or ethics standards, but              Feinstein says FERC should review its policies on communications between              commissioners and the regulated community. Gov. Gray Davis announces              that total costs in August reached $815 million down nearly $100 million              from July spending. Power prices have dropped over the summer, in              part due to cooler-than-expected temperatures and boosted energy conservation,              which lowered demand.              September 25, 2001              -              Newspapers report that Davis will call for the Third Extraordinary              Session to begin next Tuesday. The state files its first claim against              PG&E. A report says California is relying too heavily on natural              gas to fuel its power plants. The California Public Interest Research              Group says the state should diversify its mix of power and include              more renewable resources, such as wind and solar, to prevent another              energy crisis. State Controller Kathleen Connell announces that the              Franchise Tax Board has filed a $22 million claim in federal bankruptcy              court seeking payments from Pacific Gas and Electric Co.             September 26, 2001              -              Gov. Gray Davis calls a third special legislative session, to begin              Oct. 9. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. announces October natural gas              bills for its customers should be at least 50 percent lower than last              year. State Treasurer Phil Angelides says delays by the California              Public Utilities Commission mean the state won't issue $12.5 billion              in energy bonds to repay the state general fund until next year, and              any more delays could cause a $9.3 billion deficit in the next fiscal              year. The Alliance for Retail Energy Markets sends a letter to Gov.              Gray Davis and the leaders of the House and Senate, asking lawmakers              to allow businesses and California residents to switch from their              utility to a competing electricity provider to take advantage of lower              energy costs.              September 27, 2001              -              State Controller Kathleen Connell announces that the Franchise Tax              Board has filed a $22 million claim in federal bankruptcy court seeking              payments from Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Energy supplier Reliant              Resources Inc. is buying Orion Power Holdings Inc., an East Coast              electric power generating company, for $2.9 billion in cash.             September 28, 2001              -              Gov. Gray Davis calls a third special legislative session, to begin              Oct. 9. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. announces October natural gas              bills for its customers should be at least 50 percent lower than last              year.                                                                  October 1, 2001 -              California power plants which postponed routine maintenance and upgrades              in order to keep churning out electricity earlier this year have rescheduled              such work for fall, potentially triggering rolling blackouts if a              heat wave arrives. The state expects to have 9,300 megawatts offline              due to maintenance and environmental restrictions, leaving 36,927              megawatts available during October. Plaintiffs in chemical exposure              cases against Pacific Gas and Electric Co. that inspired the movie              ``Erin Brockovich'' still could receive $160 million in settlement              money, though a portion could be delayed by a decade under the utility's              bankruptcy recovery plan. Congressman Doug Ose, R-Sacramento, announces              he has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to investigate              the conduct of the Independent System Operator, the agency that manages              the state's power grid. California officials agree the state's general              fund must be repaid for the nearly $9 billion the Department of Water              Resources has paid for electricity, but months-long debates over the              details continue to slow progress. Five major creditors are threatening              to push a second California utility, Southern California Edison, into              bankruptcy, days after Davis called lawmakers back to Sacramento to              craft a rescue plan for Edison. Two consumer groups called on California              Attorney General Bill Lockyer to conduct an ethics probe into a state              contract with an Oklahoma-based energy company. The Consumers Union              and The Utility Reform Network want Lockyer to investigate whether              a 10-year contract with Williams Cos. was tainted because it was negotiated              by one of Gov. Gray Davis' top energy advisers, whose company earned              consulting fees from the deal. If there was a conflict of interest,              the agreement should have been voided or re-negotiated, the groups              allege.             October 2, 2001 -              California power regulators reject a plan governing the issuance of              $12.5 billion in bonds, again delaying efforts to repay the state              general fund for billions of dollars spent on electricity this year.              California power regulators announced an agreement Tuesday with Southern              California Edison Co. that the state says will allow the utility to              pay some $3 billion in debt and help it avoid following Pacific Gas              and Electric Co. into bankruptcy. The settlement was reached by the              Public Utilities Commission over a suit Edison filed in federal court              against the PUC in November 2000, in which Edison said the commission's              refusal to raise electric rates violated federal law and was an unconstitutional              taking of its property. Under the settlement, Edison will release              the PUC from all claims. The plan intends to ``restore Edison to creditworthiness              so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its              customers,'' said a release issued by the PUC.                            October 3, 2001 -                Officials with Edison International and Southern California Edison                Co. say the settlement they've negotiated in secret with the Public                Utilities Commission will allow it to retire more than $3 billion                of the utility's nearly $4 billion of debt, allowing it to pay hundreds                of creditors. Attorney General Bill Lockyer files a second round                of state agency claims against Pacific Gas and Electric Co. in federal                bankruptcy court, bringing total payments claimed from the utility                to more than $1 billion.                         October 4, 2001 -              Secretary of State Bill Jones unveils an ethics reform plan that he              said will prevent conflict of interests by government officials. The              plan, which Assemblyman George Runner, R-Lancaster, plans to sponsor              as legislation next year, would require public officials to file a              statement of economic interest the first day on the job. Paychecks              would be withheld until they are filed. Jones said the proposed rules              are necessary to avoid conflicts of interests such as those revealed              among some of the governor's energy advisers.             October 5, 2001 -              A federal judge approves a settlement designed to keep Southern California              Edison out of bankruptcy. U.S. District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew calls              the settlement ""fair, adequate and reasonable to the parties,              the shareholders and to the public and is not a bailout by any means.''              The approval came after lawyers for the state's second largest utility              and the state Public Utilities Commission filed papers Thursday urging              Lew to allow the deal to stand. The agreement is designed to allow              Edison to pay off an estimated $3.3 billion of its more than $6 billion              debt by forcing its customers to continue paying higher rates imposed              last May for at least two more years. It also would require Edison's              shareholders to forego $1.2 billion worth of dividends over three              years.             October 9, 2001 -              Lawyers for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. meet in court with a federal              bankruptcy judge, state representatives and lawyersrepresenting thousands              of creditors to craft a timeline of the process by which the utility              could emerge from bankruptcy and pay its debts.             October 10, 2001 -              Curtis L. Wagner, chief administrative law judge of the Federal Energy              Regulatory Commission, rules that El Paso Natural Gas Company did              not manipulate the cost of natural gas, although through two subsidiaries              violated federal rules governing the award of natural gas contracts.              The Public Utilities Commission urges the State Treasurer's Office              to obtain an unconditional 90-day waiver or extension of the $4.3              billion interim loan, negotiated by their office, and to consider              the various options for repayment of the interim loan.              October 17, 2001 -              The California Energy Commission votes 3-2 to lift the requirement              that ""peaker plants"" cease operation within three years              or convert to systems that burn much cleaner thus allowing those plants              to run dirtier, ""simple cycle"" turbines throughout their              30-year life. The Commissioners also temporarily waive a rule excluding              developers of ""major"" polluting generators - those typically              emitting 100 tones or more of pollutants a year - from the agency's              fast-track licensing process. These waivers apply to proposed projects              that have license applications completed by December 19 and that can              start operating by next September.             October 18, 2001 -              Gov. Gray Davis announces that he is considering renegotiating dozens              of long-term power contracts.             October 19, 2001              -              Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham has announced a $300 million project              to add a third power line to California's notorious Path 15, an 84-mile              electricity bottleneck that contributed to the blackouts that hit              the state earlier this year. Reliant Energy Inc. and Mirant Corp.              ask the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to investigate transactions              between the California Independent System Operator and the California              Department of Water Resources. They are charging California grid operators              with giving preferential treatment and sensitive market information              to state power traders. Edison International, parent of Southern California              Edison, reports a loss of $413 million, due mainly to a $1.15 billion              write down related to the sale of two money-losing coal power plants              in the United Kingdom. By delaying by three months a vote to ban direct              access for utility customers, utility regulators have shifted $8 billion              in energy costs from big businesses to residential and small business              customers, state Treasurer Phil Angelides said today. In a letter              to Public Utilities Commission Chairwoman Loretta Lynch, Angelides              said the PUC's delay gave businesses time to sign electricity contracts              outside the utilities.             October 23, 2001 -              Davis begins meetings with staff and state regulators began talks              to break a deadlock over renegotiating power contracts that has stalled              a $12.5-billion bond sale to cover energy costs. PUC President Loretta              Lynch and Commissioner Geoffrey Brown met Monday with Barry Goode,              Davis' legal affairs secretary, to explore options for opening talks              with generators.             October 24, 2001 -              Board of Equalization votes to take over the appraisal of power generators              and to remove the protections of Proposition 13 for large commercial              power plants. Both decisions will become effective January 1, 2003              unless the Legislature can change the law so plants can be assessed              at full market value each year and so cities where plants are located              will get the bulk of the tax money. The Board has asked the Legislature              to consider this issue next year.                            October 29, 2001 -                 U.S. Supreme Court justices                decline to review an appellate court decision that could potentially                expose the state to a limited lawsuit by Pacific Gas and Electric                Company.                          October 30, 2001 -              A federal appeals court temporarily blocks a settlement between Southern              California Edison and state regulators that helps the utility avoid              bankruptcy and keeps higher rates in place through 2003. The stay              is sought by The Utility Reform Network (TURN), a San Francisco-based              consumer organization. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has directed              TURN to go back to District Judge Ronald S. W. Lew -- who approved              the settlement earlier this month -- to ask for an injunction until              an appeal can be heard. If Judge Lew decides against the stay, the              Court of Appeals says it may consider one. Governor Gray Davis receives              a total $50,000 in campaign contributions from two out-of-state independent              power producers that sell electricity in California and are involved              in construction of new power plants.             October 31, 2001 -              Officers of Cal-ISO testify before the Senate Select Committee to              Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market to accuse              the DWR of threatening to stop buying power unless provided with exclusive              information about the grid. The officers accuse the state of using              privileged information to schedule controversial, high-priced long-term              energy contracts when lower-priced electricity was available.                                                                 November 1, 2001 -              Californians begin paying a higher interest rate on a $4.3 billion              loan that was used to repay the state treasury for energy purchases.              The state received the loan to tide it over until the $12.5 billion              bond was issued. Since the loan has not been paid back by in a timely              manner, the interest rate will jump almost two percentage points to              about 7.5%, an added cost of about $6.8 million a month.             November 6, 2001              -              Department of Water Resources officials announce a $3 billion reduction              in the estimated cost the state will pay for power through the next              year. The reduction is partly due to a number of commercial customers              fleeing the utilities while the PUC delayed a vote to stop letting              customers choose alternate providers. A special Senate committee questions              Terry Winter, president and chief executive officer of the Independent              System Operator, regarding his decision to ask the Federal Energy              Regulatory Committee to lift the $250-per-megawatt price cap on power              last winter. He testifies that he had defied his bosses and the governor              when he asked federal regulators last December to lift caps on energy              prices because he had made up his mind and didn't want any interference.              San Franciscans vote on two ballot measures that would launch a municipal              utility to replace PG & E as the city's power provider. Measure              I would establish a municipal utility district for San Francisco and              nearby city of Brisbane (similar to SMUD) and Proposition F would              create a water and power agency in San Francisco (similar to LADWP).             November 7, 2001              -              San Francisco voters approve a $100 million revenue bond for solar              and wind energy for government use, as well as a measure allowing              the city to issue future bonds for renewable energy projects without              voter approval. Attorney General Bill Lockyer and the Public Utilities              Commission urge the federal bankruptcy judge reviewing PG & E's              reorganization plan to hold a full-blown trial before acting upon              the utility's request for relief from existing state regulation. The              key point of contention is PG & E's request for the judge to issue              orders that would trump state law and allow it to transfer state-regulated              company assets to new companies not subject to state regulation. Sacramento              Municipal Utility District announces it expects to lift a special              three percent surcharge in May if enough water builds up behind its              dams and power plants along the American River. The Federal Energy              Regulatory Commission orders the California Independent System Operator              to send invoices within 15 days to the state's Department of Water              Resources in an attempt to help power generators collect $1.2 billion              from California for power sales since January.             November 8, 2001 -              The United States Justice Foundation files suit in Sacramento Superior              Court seeking to void $43 billion in long-term energy contracts. The              arguments put forth in the lawsuit are that the contracts run afoul              of California's anti-trust laws and were negotiated and promoted by              state officials with serious conflicts of interest.             November 9, 2001 -              Dynegy Incorporated announces its purchase of Enron Corporation for              $7.8 billion shares of stock.                             November 11, 2001 -                 San Francisco's two energy                initiatives fail by a close margin.                                        November 12, 2001 -                 Department of Water Resources                announces sharp decrease in state spending on energy purchases for                October. Figures show that California spent $415 million on power                purchases in October, half of what it spent in August and $264 million                less than in September. SMUD considers leaving the ISO to set up                its own control area. SMUD officials say the move could save the                utility at least $2 million, and perhaps up to $30 million a year.                Senators Burton, Bowen, and Byron ask the California Energy Commission                to rescind new rules for peaker plants' air emissions, saying the                new rules alter the law approved earlier this year to speed energy                production (see October 17 for CEC decision).                          November 13, 2001              -              A coalition of news organizations settle with the Governor's office              to release to the press short-term and spot-market energy contracts              within 47 days of the end of each contract. A statewide poll reveals              that Californians now rank the energy crisis as the third most important              issue facing the state behind the economy and terrorism. Reliant Energy              and Mirant Corp. accuse the DWR and Cal-ISO of violating federal wholesale              electricity rules before a special Senate hearing.              November 20, 2001              -              Federal Energy Regulatory Commission orders the Independent System              Operator to stop giving the Department of Water Resources advance              notice of its electricity needs, unless it provides that information              to all market participants. In addition, the commissioners order the              ISO to bill DWR using the same format as it bills its other energy              customers.                            November 26, 2001 -                 Enron employees file a lawsuit                in federal court alleging that Enron misled workers about its profitability                and breached its fiduciary duty by inducing them to buy company                stock for their 401(k) retirement plans. Enron stock has plunged                95% this year.                         November 27, 2001              -              PG&E files a response in bankruptcy court to the state's allegations              that the utility is using the bankruptcy process to profit its parent              company by selling assets to its corporate parent at the public's              expense. Further, PG&E accuses the state and PUC of trying to              stall its reorganization plan.             November 28, 2001              -              Thirty-one proposed projects that would have added more than 3,200              megawatts of electricity by next summer have been held up as officials              of the California Power Authority determine whether the plants are              needed. Dynegy terminated its previously announced $23 billion purchase              of Enron Corp. after Standard & Poor's Ratings Group and Moody's              Investors Service downgraded Enron's debt to junk status. Dynegy cited              Enron's breaches of representations, warranties, covenants and agreements              in the merger agreement as reasons for terminating negotiations. DWR              officials announce that the state's average cost of power this summer              fell from $78 per megawatt in July to $53 in August, $36 in September,              and $34 in October. Officials also add that the average daily power              costs have dropped from a high of $65 million in May to $13.4 million              in October. The US Court of Appeals in San Francisco denies a further              temporary stay thereby allowing the state and Southern California              Edison Co. to start implementing a settlement that lets the utility              keep higher rates in place through 2003. The plan will freeze current              rates for two years, costing customers potential refunds totaling              as much as $3 billion.             November 29, 2001              -              California Public Utilities Commission votes unanimously to give investor-owned              utilities access to about 80% of the $235 million in funding available              for energy efficiency programs for 2002. Businesses and other non-utility              entities can seek the remainder of the funding. An additional $50              million will become available to non-utilities in 2003. PUC President              Loretta M. Lynch reports that energy efficiency programs will receive              less total funding next year.                                                                 December 2, 2001              -              Enron Corp. files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in one of the              largest corporate bankruptcy cases in US history. It also files a              $10 billion breach of contract lawsuit against Dynegy Inc. In addition              to seeking damages, Enron is asking the Bankruptcy Court to prohibit              Dynegy from taking over its Northern Natural Gas pipeline network.             December 3, 2001              -              US Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali rejects the state agencies' request              to require PG&E to hold a separate trial to prove that preemption              of California laws to allow the utility to transfer its assets to              a federally regulated affiliate is legally authorized. In related              news, The Utility Reform Network (TURN) is denied permission to participate              in the PG&E bankruptcy case as the official voice of the utility's              customers. Southern California Edison reaches a new agreement to pay              back most of the $400 million it owes renewable energy producers.              The agreement also sets a fixed price of 5.37 cents a kilowatt hour              for Edison to buy electricity from the renewable suppliers over the              next five years. Enron warns that it might be able to service customers              because of its financial problems.              December 5, 2001              -              In a unanimous vote, California Energy Commission rescinds its decisions              exempting ""peaker"" plants, licensed under the four-month              review, from converting to cleaner-burning systems within three years              and temporarily allowing ""major"" polluters to use the agency's              fastest licensing process if they applied by December 19th.              December 6, 2001              -              PG&E agrees to pay back $326.7 million plus 5 percent interest              for power bills that went unpaid for months before it filed for bankruptcy              in April. The utility agrees to make monthly interest and principal              payments for 12 months beginning December 31. FERC suspends its investigation              into whether Enron, Duke Energy, and other power sellers owe California              as much as $8.9 billion in refunds for electricity sales from October              2000 through January.              December 7, 2001              -              California's state government makes it first payment to the California              Independent System Operator after ordered to pay by Federal Energy              Regulatory Commission. The $404.8 million payment, which covers the              month of February, also covers part of the $955 million owed to power              suppliers for this year's last-minute electricity purchases.             December 11, 2001              -              Calpine Corp. schedules to meet with California officials later this              week to try and renegotiate $13 billion in long-term power contracts              the company signed with the state last spring. The Public Utilities              Commission launches an investigation into the potential impact of              Enron's bankruptcy on the state's energy marketplace and California              customers.             December 27, 2001              -              Bankruptcy judge Dennis Montali approves Pacific Gas & Electric              's proposal to resolve claims of $100,000 or less owed to thousands              of individuals and small businesses. The proposal allows PG&E              to investigate, negotiate, and settle those claims with its creditors              without having to return to the bankruptcy judge or the official creditors'              committee to sign off on the results. Nevertheless, no money can be              paid to those creditors until the utility's overall bankruptcy reorganization              plan clears all the legal hurdles.                                                                                January 2, 2002 -                 The California Public Utilities                Commission votes 4 to 1 to deny the Utility Reform Network's (TURN)                request for a rehearing on the 2001 rate increase. The PUC also                denied a request by PG&E and Edison to reconsider a related                change in how the utilities account for debt. Yet the PUC did decide                to hold a new hearing to end the rate freeze in place since 1998.                U.S. Trustee Linda Stanley decides not to appoint a committee of                local government creditors in addition to the official creditors                committee in the PG&E bankruptcy proceeding.                         January 8, 2001 -              The California Public Utilities Commission asks a federal bankruptcy              judge for permission to file an alternative plan for reorganizing              PG&E. Its plan would block PG&E's attempt to transfer generation              and transmission facilities to new corporate entities and would keep              the utility's operations under PUC regulation. It also calls for fully              repaying the company's creditors within a year. A California Public              Utilities Commission judge proposed dividing $10 billion in energy              purchases nearly equally among all three utilities' customers, which,              compared with earlier proposals, would shift costs away from PG&E              and onto customers of Edison and SDG&E. Under PUC Administrative              Law Judge Pulsifer's proposal, PG&E customers would pay about              $4.8 billion; Edison customers would pay nearly $3.7 billion; and              SDG&E customers would pay nearly $1.6 billion. The plan could              be voted on by the commission as early as February 7.             January 10, 2002 -              Attorney General Bill Lockyer files a lawsuit in Superior Court against              PG&E Corp., the parent of PG&E Co., alleging that it illegally              siphoned as much as $4 billion from the utility, driving it into bankruptcy.              The suit claims that PG&E Corp. violated agreements with state              regulators that were designed to protect the utility and its ratepayers              and seeks to recoup between $600 million and $4 billion; it also seeks              penalties for each alleged improper transfer of funds, which could              amount to at least $500 million.             January 17, 2002 -              Pacific Gas & Electric Co. files a $4.1 billion damage claim with              the State Victim Compensation and Government Claims Board against              the state of California. The claim alleges that the state, through              its passage of AB 6X, has blocked the utility from selling its power              to consumers, at federally regulated rates, until at least 2006 in              direct violation of the state's deregulation agreement with PG&E.                                                               February 7, 2002              -              U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali rejects Pacific Gas & Electric              Co.'s reorganization plan stating that federal bankruptcy law does              not automatically override state laws and regulations. He orders PG&E              to respond to the state Public Utilities Commission's alternative              plan, to be proposed next week, and gave PG&E until February 21              to decide whether to revise its plan or appeal Montali's ruling in              federal court.             February 11, 2002              -               The City of San Francisco files suit against Pacific Gas and Electric              Co.'s corporate parent seeking a ratepayer refund of $5 billion. The              City's suit follows the same outline as one filed Jan. 10 by Attorney              General Bill Lockyer. While the Attorney General's suit seeks to return              the money to the utility for distribution to creditors and ratepayers              alike, the City's suit seeks to set the funds aside for PG&E's              4.5 million customers. Senator Barbara Boxer demands that the Federal              Energy Regulatory Commission void the expensive long-term electricity              contracts signed by Governor Gray Davis in response to last year's              energy crisis. Senator Boxer also wants the federal regulators to              order a full refund of the $8.9 billion the state claims it is owed              in overcharges from energy producers.             February 12, 2002              -              The Senate Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the Wholesale              Energy Market votes to hold Enron Corp. in contempt for the second              time due to failure to produce documents requested by the committee.              The committee also votes to seek criminal charges against the company              for destruction of subpoenaed documents. Violations of the state anti-destruction              laws could result in jail or prison terms for Enron executives.                             February 13, 2002 -                 Federal Energy Regulatory                Commission Chairman Patrick Wood announces the commission decision                to launch a formal fact-finding investigation into whether Enron                Corp. manipulated electricity prices in the West last year.                         February 21, 2002              -              The California Public Utilities Commission approves the State's plan              to sell $11.1 billion in energy bonds. Commissioner Henry Duque, a              Republican opposes the plan. In addition, the Commission approves              a cost-based approach to allocating state power purchases between              the three state utilities. According to its decision, PG&E customers              will pay DWR 9.3 cents per kilowatt-hour of power provided, Edison              customers will pay 9.7 cents per kilowatt-hour, and San Diego customers              will pay 7.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.             February 25, 2002              -              The California Public Utilities Commission and the Electricity Oversight              Board file complaints with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission              seeking to void $45 billion worth of long-term electricity contracts              signed by Governor Davis last Fall. The agencies allege that the 32              contracts were negotiated at a time when power providers were manipulating              the energy market and resulted in California consumers being overcharged              $21 billion.             February 27, 2002              -              Richard A. Bilas, one of two Republican commissioners on the California              Public Utilities Commission, resigns siting failing health and growing              frustration with current PUC policy as his reasons. U.S. Bankruptcy              Judge Dennis Montali grants the California Public Utilities Commission              permission to submit an alternative reorganization plan in the PG&E              bankruptcy case on or before April 15th. Judge Montali appoints two              mediators in the PG&E bankruptcy case - Anthony Piazza and Marc              Feder - to resolve issues between the state, the utility, and the              creditor committee. Assemblymember Fred Keeley along with a coalition              of consumer groups request the PUC to lower electricity rates about              3.5 cents per kilowatt hour claiming that low generating costs are              allowing PG&E to accumulate large profits at the ratepayers' expense.                                                               March 4, 2002 -              The U.S. Supreme Court upholds a 1996 FERC order that forced electric              utilities to open their transmission lines to competitors, but rejects              an argument that federal regulators did not go far enough in opening              access to transmission grids.             March 5, 2002 -              Governor Gray Davis appoints Michael R. Peevey - former head of Southern              California Edison and husband to Assemblymember Carol Liu - to the              California Public Utilities Commission, effective March 2, 2002. Mr.              Peevey replaces Republican Commissioner Richard Bilas who resigned              last week.             March 7, 2002 -              PG&E files a revised version of its reorganization plan with the              federal bankruptcy court. The plan still contains provisions for transferring              the utility's transmission lines, power plants, hydroelectric dams              and other assets to its parent company -- but reverses PG&E's              position on transferring the watershed lands surrounding its hydroelectric              plants, thus requiring the utility to maintain as much as 60 percent              of the property.                            March 14, 2002 -                The Fair Political Practices Commission fined the Department of                Water Resources $69,500 for conflict of interest violations. This                money is essentially paid by the taxpayers since the DWR was charged                for the violation instead of the people themselves who failed to                file their FPPC reports on time.                         March 21, 2002 -              The Public Utilities Commission voted 3-2 to end private power-purchases              contracts as of September 20, essentially taking away the ratepayers'              right to choose their own power provider.                                                                              April 4, 2002 -                The Public Utilities Commission decided that PG&E will be able                to collect $2.9 billion from its customers this year for electricity                produced by their nuclear and hydroelectric plants and several long-term                power contracts.                         April 24, 2002 -              Federal energy regulators ordered hearings to investigate whether              billions of dollars in long-term power contracts California entered              into during the height of the power crisis are overpriced and should              be scrapped or modified to lower the costs.                                                                              May 6, 2002 -                Assembly adjourns special energy session, second extraordinary.               Internal Enron documents released                today show that traders for the company drove up electricity prices                during the power crisis through questionable practices that may                have contributed to power shortages.                                        May 8, 2002 -                 In response to the released                memos showing Enron's possible market manipulation, the Federal                Energy Regulatory Commission ordered 150 energy trading companies                to hand over documents dealing with their tactics.                                        May 28, 2002 -                 Papers report that California's electric grid operator will                hire an independent investigator to probe allegations it manipulated                the state's energy market.               Dynegy Inc.'s Chief Executive Chuck                Watson resigns today amid questions about the company's energy-trading                business that could have contributed to California's energy crisis.                         May 30, 2002 -               California energy officials declare an alert due to tight electricity              supplies. The alert was called when desert heat in the Southwest caused              out-of-state suppliers to divert some energy that otherwise would              have gone to California. Cal ISO says there is no reason to believe              that there will be any blackouts now or this summer.                                                               June 3, 2002 -               The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rules 2-1 that Davis did              not have the authority to take over en estimated $200 million in energy              contracts because Congress has not granted the states such rights              in energy matters.                                                                             July 9, 2002 -                CAL-ISO issues a Stage 1 power alert due to hot weather up and down                the state. Governor Davis reminds Californians to conserve in order                to keep the lights on.                                        July 10, 2002 -                 CAL-ISO issues a Stage 2 power alert. A power plant also broke                down in Southern California, causing a shortage of power.                           July 11, 2002 -               Ross Perot visits the State Capitol today and testifies before              a state Senate committee that his Texas-based firm did not try to              profit from inside knowledge of California's energy market. Senator              Joe Dunn began his investigation of Perot when a 44-page document              surfaced from Perot Systems that revealed flaws in California's power              market."
GX231-13-8349238	"California Stephen P. Sands, Registrar  Licensed Fall 2001  Contractor Gray Davis, Governor  Free, Fast & Fascinating CSLB Contractor Seminars for 2002!  Governor Signs Bills Relating to Contractors  G  T  he Contractors State License Board is currently planning its 2002 Contractor Education Seminar series. To better serve working contractors, the 2002 series will include four weeknight seminars and one Saturday morning seminar to be held January through April 2002 in locations from Sacramento to the San Diego area. Take advantage of this unique opportunity. Each three and one-half hour seminar will include a 70-minute presentation on contract requirements, a Q&A session with a panel of experts and contractor-related exhibits. During the 70-minute presentation Bill Dexter, Risk Management Consultant, veteran CSLB Contractor Ed speaker and former Director of the California Center for Construction Education, College of Architecture and Environmental Design, Cal Poly asks, ""Does Your Contract Measure Up?"" His presentation will be based on the five most common complaints submitted to the Board. The panel of experts will include Board licensing and enforcement deputies, a local building official, and a Cal/OSHA representative. Also, for the first time, the Board has invited local building exchanges, building departments, Cal/OSHA, the National Association of the Remodeling Industry (NARI), and the Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE), and a construction bookstore to set up exhibits at the seminars. All these organizations can provide a wealth of resources and helpful information. Don't miss your opportunity to attend one of these informative seminars. See page 8 for a list of locations and registration instructions.  overnor Davis recently signed three bills relating to the Contractors State License Board and contractors. Following is a summary of relevant legislation. Each new law becomes effective January 1, 2002, unless otherwise specified. Copies of the bills are available at www.leginfo.ca.gov or through the Legislative Bill Room in the basement of the State Capitol. The phone number is (916) 445-2323. AB 678 (Papan--Chapter 226)  referred for investigation after a Board Enforcement representative has determined that a probable violation occurred and that if proven, the violation would be appropriate cause for license suspension or revocation or criminal prosecution. SB 135 also limits the disclosure period for citations and disciplinary actions (suspensions and revocations). The bill becomes effective July 1, 2002, or as soon thereafter as specified provisions are administratively feasible. SB 724 (Figueroa--Chapter 728)  An extension of existing law that prohibits unlicensed contractors from using California courts to obtain compensation for contracting work, AB 678 further authorizes those who hire unlicensed contractors to seek court action and recovery of compensation they've paid to unlicensed contractors. SB 135 (Figueroa--Chapter 494)  Existing law allows the Board to disclose only those complaints against contractors that have been referred for legal action. SB 135 requires the Board to disclose all complaints that have been  SB 724 is the Contractors Board's ""clean up"" bill and makes multiple revisions to licensing law. Among other provisions, it authorizes the Board's Registrar to use collection agencies to collect civil penalties; limits licensees to one business name per license; and extends the time during which a claim may be made against a licensee's cash deposit (to three years after the expiration of the license). The bill also revises the licensing application and renewal process for misrepresentations or omissions made on the application or renewal form.  New Home Improvement Contractor Disclosure Requirements Delayed  T  he last issue of the California Licensed Contractor reported that, as a result of legislation passed last year (SB 2029), new disclosure requirements could become mandatory for Home Improvement Contractors as early as October 2001. Board staff now expects the new provisions to be filed with the Secretary of State before December 1, 2001 and the regulation will then become effective three months from the filing date. The new disclosure requirements will also require HIC contractors to disclose whether or not they carry Commercial General Liability insurance (CGL) -- and if they do, the name and telephone  number of the insurance company. HIC contractors will also be required to provide a consumer information sheet on the importance of Commercial General Liability Insurance (CGL) along with a form called the ""Checklist for Homeowners,"" which describes the main points of home improvement contracting. Contractors building new single-family homes pursuant to Business & Professions Code Section 7164 will also be expected to provide the CGL notice and disclose whether they carry CGL. CSLB will make the new notices available on its web site or, upon request, by mail as soon as possible after they are filed with the Secretary of State.   California  Licensed  Contractor Board Briefs  John O'Rourke Appointed to CSLB  Anthony Elmo Reappointed to Board  I The California Licensed Contractor  is an official publication of the Contractors State License Board  State of California Gray Davis Governor Aileen Adams Secretary, State and Consumer Services Agency Kathleen Hamilton Director, Department of Consumer Affairs Stephen P.

Hearings Scheduled on License Classifications  A  Home Improvement Certification Update ome improvement contractors become certified as As of November 1, more than 148,300 contractors have obtained Home Improvement Certification. They are the only contractors legally allowed to contract for home improvement work. In fact, many local building departments now refuse permits to contractors without HIC. Subcontractors must also be certified if they want to sub on home improvement contracts.  t its July 2001 meeting, the Board voted to initiate the regulatory process to reinstate the C-6 Cabinet and Millwork classification and relevant exam. The process requires amending the current C-5 Carpentry, Cabinet and Millwork license classification. The Board also voted to amend Board Rule 832.54 (relating to C-54 Tile Contractors) to include the installation of granite and other natural stone for kitchen and bathroom countertops, and Board Rule 832.09 (relating to C-9 Drywall Contractors) to specifically include the application of texturing materials and installation of nonstructural metal studs. Public regulatory hearings on these issues have been scheduled for December 13, 2001, at the Contractors State License Board located at 9821 Business Park Drive, Sacramento. Exact times and additional information on the hearings will be available on the Board's web site at www.cslb.ca.gov as soon as possible.

There are 55 Habitat for Humanity affiliates in California, so there is sure to be one near you. Often, several affiliates located in the same region are in various stages of building. This means licensed contractors can make the best use of their skills by picking a project based on the stage of construction. Donated professional labor, support, and even supplies of licensed contractors play a vital role in producing Habitat homes and are critical components of Habitat's ability to sell these homes at prices affordable to families with extremely low incomes. Through partnerships with licensed contractors, construction professionals, local volunteers and other community businesses and organizations, labor and material donations support the affordable construction of Habitat homes. Since its inception in 1976, Habitat for Humanity and its local affiliates have built thousands of decent, affordable homes and sold them at no profit and with zero-percent interest loans to lowincome families who, until then, had lived in unsafe, deteriorated, and substandard housing. Because their low incomes would prevent them from obtaining traditional mortgages, home ownership is an otherwise unattainable dream for the families who buy these homes. Each family selected to purchase a Habitat home contributes 500 hours of ""sweat equity"" to their community as they work to build their Habitat home and those of other Habitat families. Through the united efforts and personal investment of people throughout the community, neighborhoods and communities become more cohesive, integrated and revitalized. While contributing ""sweat equity,"" Habitat families also learn to care for and maintain their new homes. For more information about the Habitat affiliate nearest you and their current projects, visit www.habitatforhumanity.org or call Habitat for Humanity's Western Region at (800) 228-6407.

How do leads turn into action, and who hunts down illegal activity? This complex task belongs to the Board's investigative staff at its eight Investigative Centers and the Statewide Investigative Fraud Team (SWIFT).  E  and pose as homeowners interested in contracting for a variety of home improvement projects. Unlicensed contractors advertising in local print media are then contacted by the agents and invited to bid on various jobs at the sting site. If an unlicensed contractor submits a bid of more than $500 (for labor and materials) for any job, he has broken license law. Perpetrators are usually arrested and given a Notice to Appear in criminal court.  Investigators scour print media for contracting advertisements that do not include a license number (usually an indication that the contractor is not licensed). Investigators then determine the contractor 's license status and issue appropriate administrative citations.  Educational Outreach Seminars Investigators present approximately 10 educational seminars throughout the state each month. Contractors, law enforcement personnel, consumers and other groups are educated on how to hire licensed contractors, identify unlicensed activity and avoid scams.  While Investigative Center personnel investigate consumer complaints of inferior work performed by unlicensed contractors, the SWIFT unit--comprised of 27 investigators statewide, several of whom possess powers of arrest--uses a variety of proactive investigative techniques to deter unlicensed contracting. All told, CSLB investigators referred 723 unlicensed contractors for criminal prosecution and issued another 1,015 administrative citations during the 2000 Fiscal Year (July 1, 2000 through June 30, 2001). Many of the techniques SWIFT uses to locate and snare unlicensed activity are detailed below.  Sweeps On average, 10 sweeps are conducted statewide, each month. After traveling to areas dense with active construction, investigators visit numerous job sites and issue administrative citations to contractors unable to produce their licenses. Many sweeps are coordinated in conjunction with the Department of Labor Standards Enforcement and the Employment Development Department. Each of these state organizations routinely performs job site checks to curtail the underground economy. SWIFT staff focuses on unlicensed contracting, failure to pay state taxes and employers' Workers' Compensation Insurance coverage.  Hot Tips Board staff receives an average of 25 reports of known or suspected unlicensed contracting activity in California each day. Approximately eighty percent of these leads are investigated and result in some form of disciplinary action. If you have knowledge of or suspect unlicensed contracting activity in your area and would like to report it to SWIFT, you may report the lead or request a Lead Sheet in Southern California by calling (562) 466-6017 or (562) 466-6018. In Northern California call (916) 255-2924. Important Note: Leads may be called in anonymously and confidentially and need not involve paperwork. They may be submitted verbally over the phone.  Stings An average of five undercover sting operations are conducted throughout the state each month. Each sting requires undercover investigators to set up at a predetermined home site  Boiler Room The Boiler Room is used in geographical locations rich with construction.  Paying Wages ""Under the Table"" . . . Is it Worth the Risk? hen employers disguise wage payments to avoid associated payroll taxes and insurance expenses, create an unfair competitive advantage, and/or reduce bookkeeping burdens, they take on a huge financial and legal risk. The financially dangerous and illegal practice of paying employee wages ""under the table"" can actually be very costly and time consuming in the end. Many employers do not realize that when they are caught paying wages under the table, their state payroll tax liability can be 20 times more than if they had voluntarily reported the employee's wages and paid the associated payroll taxes and insurance. When audited, employers who pay wages under the table will be unable to prove the number of employees and will, therefore, be unable to take advantage of certain tax and insurance 4  W  limits that apply to each employee. Higher tax and insurance bills will result when those expenses are assessed on the full payroll.  not been correctly reported, their insurance benefits may be delayed or denied and an EDD investigation will follow. Wage payments made under the table often violate labor laws, too, which in turn can cost the business thousands of dollars in penalties. When under the table wages are discovered, both the employer and employee are subject to applicable state and federal income tax audits. However, when an employer fails to withhold employee-paid taxes, those taxes become the employer 's responsibility. For more information about payroll tax reporting, contact the Employment Tax Customer Service Office in your local EDD office. To report instances of cash wages paid ""under the table"" call (800) 528-1783. If you wish to remain anonymous, you need not provide your name.  Paying employee wages under the table can actually be very costly and time consuming in the end. Regardless of whether or not other businesses in your industry pay wages under the table, the practice is illegal. When caught, employers who pay wages under the table may also face criminal prosecution. If an employee asks you to hide his or her wages, deny the request. You are legally obligated to report the wages and withhold payroll taxes. Furthermore, if your employee is injured on or off the job they have the right to file a claim for Worker 's Compensation or State Disability Insurance benefits. If their wages have   California  Licensed  Contractor What Would You Do?  CSLB Industry Experts Offer Concrete Advice for C-8 Contractors  C  SLB Industry Expert Mario M. Leon realized that many of the complaints he reviews pertain to cracks in concrete. In an effort to minimize these complaints and resulting actions against the contractors, Mr. Leon wrote in with the following suggestion for placing control joints (commonly called scorelines). ""The American Concrete Institute recommends placing control joints at maximum intervals of 30 times the slab thickness. For instance, a three inch thick concrete slab would require a control joint at 7.5 foot maximum intervals in either direction (.25 feet X 30 = 7.5 feet), while a four inch thick slab would require a control joint at 9.9 foot maximum intervals (.33 feet X 30 = 9.9 feet). Often, the homeowner wants to minimize control joints and convinces the contractor to place them beyond the recommended distance. If the specifications have not been placed in the contract, the contractor often receives an unfavorable ruling when the concrete cracks."" A Building Official for the southern California cities of Fountain Valley and Paramount, Howard Larnard notes that Mr. Leon's suggestion is just one of many ways to address the problem of concrete cracking and crazing (light, surface-level cracks). He notes that concrete made with a lower water-tocement ratio will not need as many control joints because it will be inherently stronger and shrink less. A lower water-to-cement ratio can be achieved by adjusting the amount of each ingredient in the concrete. For example, if the contractor reduces the volume of sand and increases the cement content while using the same amount of water, the result will be a lower water-to-cement ratio and stronger concrete. ""Obviously, using more cement in the mix will cost more. Therefore, clear communication in the contract is imperative. The contract should contain cement specifications, control joint placement, applicable reinforcement and the expectations of the concrete performance,"" he explains. The quality and consistency of concrete batching and placement for slabs-onground is also a factor in cracking. Industry Expert Steve Maragakis states, ""For slabs-on-ground (also called slab-  on-grade), preventing or controlling defects is better accomplished with an understanding of the material and its limitations. Typical concrete poured for residential applications will shrink about five-eighths inch per 100 linear feet. Stress created by the volume change and restraints of underlying soils causes concrete pavement to break at regular intervals."" Adding reinforcement such as steel or mesh may also help reduce cracking caused by soil movement. Whether used to build walls, sidewalks or patios, concrete construction is one of the most technically varied specialties in the construction field.

M  any contractors have written with a response to the anonymous question posed in the summer CLC. Their responses are below. Q: ""Most design/build projects involve a design (floor plan) which I provide. Once accepted by the homeowner, contract specifications are written, the contract is signed and I collect a deposit. The drawings often cost more than the $1,000 deposit. If the homeowner decides to cancel the project and forego the deposit, I am often left holding the bag, and the bill, for the working drawings. Is there anything I can do as a design/build contractor to receive full payment from the homeowner for working drawings before I pay for them? I want to avoid having to go through the legal system after the fact."" A: ""The next time you have a design/ build project, I would suggest providing drawings for an agreed price ahead of time. That way whether you do the construction portion of the work or not, you will be compensated for the design drawings. As an incentive to the homeowner, you might even offer the design fee towards the construction cost, if you are awarded the job. An example would be offering the drawings for $1,000, which would be credited toward the job if you were awarded the contract. If they decided to cancel the project, then you still get the $1,000 for the design fees. Just remember to agree on this in writing before providing any drawings to a homeowner."" --Josh W. Shields, Laguna Beach A: ""I charge my customers an up-front, non-refundable design fee. The amount is based upon the complexity of the project. I have them sign a one-page ""Design Agreement"" which explains what they are getting and what is not included. The agreement states that the fee will be off-set against the cost of the job should they elect to hire me, less out of pocket expenses such as travel and postage. The design fee is not to be confused with the job deposit."" --Pat Wallen, San Rafael A: ""Stop giving away your time--you will go broke in no time. You can give a free estimate to your clients, but how do you do that with no drawings? You must set up a preliminary design contract where you get paid for your design time.

The contract should reimburse the homeowner money not charged or apply the credit towards the building project. This will weed out the serious clients from the ones that just want to use your resources for free. Even if they cancel the project you are still covered for your design work."" --Victoria Foster, Wilton, CA A: ""The approach we use that seems to have been successful for many years is to use an ""Intent Agreement"" for the final bid and contract package along with the working drawings. The way we work it is as follows. I will go out and look at a project and briefly discuss with the homeowner what their needs and desires are, indicating to them that the estimate will be an approximate figure based on a brief meeting and time spent on the estimate. This cuts my time for the estimate (which is free) to a minimum. If the budget allows and the homeowner decides to proceed, we will enter into an ""Intent Agreement"" for which they will pay, as per the agreement, a fee for the plans to be drawn, final estimate, specifications, and the contract to do the work. If the customer decides to go ahead with the project, we will enter into the ""Contract"" phase of the project; if not, I have been paid for my time and they can let the project out for bid elsewhere. Our agreement provides for us to retain design rights to the plans, but fees may be adjusted if you want to give the right to the customer to use your plans for the final project (they probably will anyway). The safety valve created by doing it this way is that there seems to be less pressure on the customer to feel obligated to enter into a contract if they feel that they can get out without feeling obligated. The upside for us is that if through the design phase, we decide that there is a personality conflict with the customer, we know it before we enter into a contract with someone that we don't really want to work with. Another plus is that by spending the time on something that you know you are being paid for, you will be more careful in the design, specifications, contract terminology and project description. By eliminating any gray areas, there seems to be a better customer-contractor relationship throughout the project."" --George VanDusen, Orangevale If you have an answer to the question above or would like fellow contractors to answer one of your questions, send your comments to the editor at Gina Crawford, CSLB, P.O.

Yosemite Planning Page                  Chapter VI: Consultation and Coordination    Compliance  History    Environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of resources did not exist when the Cascades Diversion Dam was constructed in 1917. Environmental compliance for Cascades Diversion Dam began in 1982, when alternatives for managing the future of the hydroelectric generating facility were considered. An overview of environmental compliance documents completed pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act that relate to Cascades Diversion Dam are presented below.    Hydroelectric Power System Environmental Assessment  (NPS 1982). The purpose of this document was to study and evaluate alternatives for approaching the future of the then 62-year-old hydroelectric generating facility. Alternatives included retaining, replacing, enlarging, and abandoning the system. The preferred alternative proposed repairs, replacements, and a slight increase in capacity.    Electrical Distribution System Replacement and Cascades Dam Removal Environmental Assessment  (NPS 1987b). The purpose of this document was to consider alternative proposals for the removal of the abandoned Cascades Diversion Dam and the restoration of the dam site to natural conditions.    Addendum to the Electrical Distribution System Replacement and Cascades Dam Removal Environmental Assessment  (NPS 1987a). This document provided additional data on the removal of Cascades Diversion Dam. The addendum concluded that further environmental analysis would be required to make an informed decision on the method and extent of dam removal. Consequently, removal of the dam was eliminated from the project.    Finding of No Significant Impact, Phase II Replacement of the Electrical Distribution System in  Yosemite Valley  (NPS 1987c). The Finding of No Significant Impact described replacement of the electrical distribution system within  Yosemite Valley .    Finding of No Significant Impact, Electrical Distribution System Replacement  (NPS 1988). The Finding of No Significant Impact presented the preferred alternative described in the  Electrical Distribution System Replacement and Cascades Dam Removal Environmental Assessment  (NPS 1987b), excluding removal of Cascades Diversion Dam and attendant structures.    Merced  Wild and  Scenic River  Comprehensive Management Plan  ( Merced River  Plan) (NPS 2001a). The Merced River Plan applies seven management elements to prescribe desired future conditions, typical visitor activities and experiences, and park facilities and management activities allowed in the river corridor. The Merced River Plan applies to any project that is within the Wild and  Scenic   River  boundary, or that would affect the Outstandingly Remarkable Values or free-flowing condition of the river. Removal of the Cascades Diversion Dam complies with the intent of the Merced River Plan to protect and enhance free-flowing conditions.           Yosemite Valley Plan  (NPS 2000a). The National Park Service recently developed the  Yosemite Valley Plan  to implement the goals of the  General Management Plan  in  Yosemite Valley . The  Yosemite Valley Plan  is designed to meet the resource preservation and visitor experience goals in  Yosemite Valley , and calls out specific actions to meet these goals. Among the actions identified in the  Yosemite Valley Plan  is removal of Cascades Diversion Dam.    Scoping  History    On  April 18, 2001 , the National Park Service held an informal public scoping meeting to discuss the potential removal of Cascades Diversion Dam. The meeting included project orientation, group discussion, and a visit to the dam site to view the existing conditions. The purpose of the informal public scoping meeting was to: (1) provide participants with an overview of existing conditions and the proposed action; (2) ask participants to identify key issues that should be analyzed during the environmental review and compliance process; and (3) provide an opportunity for participants to ask questions regarding project alternatives and the overall environmental review and compliance process. Public scoping comments were accepted through  April  27, 2001 .      Over 75 public scoping comments were received. All comments were reviewed and analyzed to determine public concerns. In addition, the National Park Service posts a project fact sheet and project planning updates on the park’s web site. Project planning updates have also been presented at ongoing open house meetings and in the park’s planning update newsletter. Based on public scoping comments and applicable federal law, regulations, and executive orders, the National Park Service determined that an environmental assessment (not an en environmental impact statement) would be the appropriate level of compliance for the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project. Public scoping comments and issues raised by National Park Service staff were used in the alternatives development process and the analysis presented in this document.    Agency  Consultation    U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers    The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a Special Site Permit for the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project in conjunction with preparation of the  El Portal Road Improvements Environmental Assessment  in 1997. In December 2002, the National Park Service requested an extension on the timeline of the permit for dam removal activities. The extended permit would be valid only for actions related to dam removal and not for future  El Portal   Road  improvements. In addition, the National Park Service notified the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project was a discrete project from the future El Portal Road Improvement Project and would not include road improvements. The extended permit would be in place prior to implementation of the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project.    Central Valley  Regional Water Quality Control Board    The National Park Service is currently coordinating with the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board to obtain required permits. The National Park Service may be required to submit a report of waste discharge, and obtain Waste Discharge Requirements or an individual waiver. Copies of the existing waste discharge waiver are on file at  Yosemite National Park . The permit would be in place prior to implementation of the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project.    U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service    The Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 United States Code 1531 et seq.), requires all federal agencies to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to ensure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by the agency does not jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or critical habitat. The National Park Service requested a list of federally listed endangered and threatened species that may be present in the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project area from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on  September 23, 2002 . The list received from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on  September 27, 2002  was used as a basis for the special-status analysis in this environmental assessment (see Appendix D, Special-Status Species Evaluation). Consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will continue, as defined by Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, as environmental compliance for the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project is finalized.    California   State  Historic Preservation Officer/Advisory Council on Historic Preservation    Cascades Diversion Dam has been the subject of previous evaluation and mitigation actions, as described at the beginning of this chapter. In 1986, the National Park Service evaluated the impacts associated with the demolition, relocation, and/or rehabilitation of all components of the Yosemite Hydroelectric Power Plant (also known as the Cascades Powerhouse). This evaluation included the removal of the dam. With the completion of this evaluation, the National Park Service completed the consultation process associated with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. As part of this process, the National Park Service signed a Memorandum of Agreement with the California State Historic Preservation Officer and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. A copy of the memorandum is located at the end of this chapter. The memorandum identified stipulations for dam removal, including the preparation of Historic American Engineering Report documentation, the submittal of archival photographs and narrative to the State Historic Preservation Officer and the  Fresno    Metropolitan   Museum , and the development of an accurate scale model of the entire  Merced  River  hydroelectric system. The National Park Service has complied with the various stipulations of the Memorandum of Agreement and has sent a letter to the State Historic Preservation Officer indicating that the Section 106 consultation process is complete.    In addition to compliance with stipulations of the 1986 Memorandum of Agreement, removal of the dam would also comply with the requirements in Appendix E (Adverse Effects and Standard Mitigation Measures for Historical Properties) of the  Yosemite Valley Plan . These requirements are included in the 1999 Programmatic Agreement between the National Park Service, the State Historic Preservation Officer, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation for the “Resolution of Adverse Effects” associated with planning, construction, operations, and maintenance activities within  Yosemite  National Park.           American Indian Consultation    As part of the development of the  Draft  and  Final Yosemite Valley Plan/SEIS,  the National Park Service consulted with the following park-associated, federally recognized tribes and nonfederally recognized American Indian communities who refer to themselves as “tribes”: the American Indian Council of Mariposa County, Inc.; the North Fork Mono Rancheria; the Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians; the Chukchansi Tribal Government; the Mono Lake Indian Community; the Bridgeport Paiute Indian Colony; and the Bishop Paiute Tribal Council. These consultations were ongoing throughout the planning process for the  Yosemite Valley   Implementation Plan/SEIS  and will continue through the design and implementation phases for activities taking place under the  Yosemite Valley Plan . At present, the National Park Service is consulting with seven American Indian tribes and groups regarding such as issues access for traditional use, gathering of traditional materials, protection and mitigation of impacts to traditional cultural resources, and preservation and management of important cultural places.    Between June 28, 2000 and July 17, 2000, National Park Service representatives met with representatives from seven tribal groups associated with Yosemite National Park. Since July of 2000, tribal consultation has been ongoing regarding concerns associated with the proposed project. Recently, the National Park Service requested that the Southern Sierra Miwok identify concerns regarding plant gathering within the river corridor between Cascades Diversion Dam and Cascades Picnic Area.    Future  Information    Updated information about various aspects of the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project will be periodically distributed via newsletters, mailings, the  Yosemite   National   Park  web site ( www.nps.gov/yose/planning ), and regional and local news media. There will be a 30-day public comment period on the environmental assessment.

GX226-40-16176801	For Immediate Release:  May 1, 2003        Contact:  Daryl Savage         Phone:  (650) 688-6330                                                  Simitian Seeks To Limit Cruise Ship Dumping        “Clean Coast” Legislation Addresses Air And Water Pollution                               Palo Alto – A pair of “Clean Coast” environmental bills to reduce air pollution and the amount of sewage dumped from cruise ships made headway this week after both bills passed in the Assembly Environmental Safety Committee. The legislation, introduced by Assemblymember Joe Simitian (D-Palo Alto), seeks to strictly regulate cruise ship waste along the California coast.           The proposed crackdown on dumping waste comes in the wake of increased concern by environmental groups about dangerous toxins being discharged by large vessels on the California coastline and its sanctuaries, including Monterey Bay.                  Simitian’s first piece of Clean Coast legislation, Assembly Bill 121, prohibits cruise ships from discharging specific kinds of waste, including raw sewage, bilge and ballast water, which threaten both water quality and wildlife along the coast and sanctuaries. The recent surge in cruise ship popularity and the opening of ports in San Francisco and Monterey for cruise line travel also has the potential to pose a public safety risk to swimmers and beach-goers.                 “It’s a double-edged sword. I’m happy to see the cruise business expanding into Northern California, but we’ve got to set limits on the amount and type of waste these ships discharge in the water. It’s the coastal ecosystem that’s at risk,” Simitian said.                 Specifically, Simitian seeks to prohibit dumping waste within three miles of the California coastline. Sewage and toxic chemicals are currently being dumped too close to shore, according to Simitian. And the problem with ballast water is that the discharge often contains microscopic organisms picked up in foreign ports of call. When ballast water is released in the Bay Area, it can disrupt local coastal ecosystems. “This practice has the potential to seriously threaten local species of fish and wildlife,” Simitian said. “It’s the kind of damage that, once done, is exceedingly hard to undo.”                 The bill further requires cruise ship owners and operators to submit a quarterly report detailing the contents of what they discharge into the coastal waters.                 A typical seven-day cruise can generate 50 tons of garbage and more than 200,000 gallons of sewage, according to Bluewater Network, a San Francisco–based environmental group, who is a sponsor of Simitian’s bill.  One passenger generates about 10 gallons of pure sewage a week, according to data from the Environmental Protection Agency. “Multiply that by the number of people on cruise ships, upwards of 3,000 individuals, and in some cases you’ve literally got tons of waste floating in the water,” Simitian said.                 “Backpackers have known for years that when ‘you hike it in, you hike it out.’ The cruise ship industry needs to learn this lesson. Assemblyman Simitian’s legislation will force cruise ships to do exactly that,” said Russell Long, Executive Director for Bluewater Network.                 The bill prohibits dumping biological and chemical wastes, hazardous substances, sewage, industrial waste, medical waste, munitions, ballast, oil, radioactive materials, solid wastes, toxic wastes, and wrecked or discarded equipment.                 Simitian’s other bill in the Clean Coast pair, Assembly Bill 471, concentrates on the volume of air pollution emitted by fuel from cruise ships.                  When a cruise ship is at port, such as San Francisco Bay, it emits the same amount of pollution as 12,200 cars, according to Monterey Bay Air Pollution Control District. Additionally, the South Coast Air Quality Management District reported a 71% cancer risk from toxic air pollution in Los Angeles, a significant portion of which comes from ocean vessels.                  “Another problem is the incineration of garbage on cruise ships,” Simitian said. The legislation will prohibit on-board incineration of garbage within 90 miles of the coastline. This, in turn, will further decrease the amount of air pollution emitted by cruise ships. AB 471 also addresses the type of fuel a large vessel can utilize. Only low-sulfur diesel fuel can be used within 25 miles of the California coast.                 The Clean Coast bills are sponsored by Bluewater Network. Additional supporters include: Oceana, Natural Resources Defense Council, Save Our Shores, Ocean Conservancy, Surfrider Foundation, WaterKeepers, San Franciscans For a Healthy Waterfront, Friends of the Sea Otter, Sierra Club (Ventana Chapter), American Cetacean Society (Monterey Chapter), Carmel-by-the-Sea Councilmember Barbara Livingston, and District 1-PCD, Meba AFL-CIO, which is the oldest maritime union in the United States.                 Assemblymembers George Nakano (D-Torrance) and John Laird (D-Santa Cruz) are joint authors on AB 121 and AB 471. Simitian is also a joint author on AB 906, which regulates the discharge of “gray water” by cruise ships.                                                                                                                                                     ###

TOD can be new construction or redevelopment of one or more buildings whose design and orientation facilitate transit use.""  Technical Advisory Committee to the Statewide Transit-Oriented Development Study   Overview This study has taken a comprehensive look at the `state-of-the-practice' of transit-oriented development (TOD) in California and across the United States. This 14-month study began in September, 2000 and was completed early in 2002. The major objectives of this study were to: Define transit-oriented development and its successful components; describe the potential benefits of TOD; examine the status of implementation of TOD in the U.S. and California; identify the major barriers and impediments to the wider implementation of TOD; identify what is working well, as well as the need for additional resources to overcome barriers; and, finally, develop a set of potential strategies and activities that the state of California may implement to facilitate the broader implementation of TOD in this state. The study was guided by two advisory committees that included representatives of state and local government agencies, transit providers, private developers, financial institutions, environmental groups, and others. (Members of these committees are listed inside the back cover). It also involved interviews with private developers and with staff members of numerous local jurisdictions, transit agencies, and other organizations. This process has resulted in the publication of a final report, ""Statewide Transit-Oriented Development Study: Factors for Success in California"", that contains up-to-date and practical information on TOD. Separate from the final report, a Technical Appendix volume contains: an overview of TOD in America; detailed information about twelve TODs in California; information on funding sources; and other resources. In addition, the study team produced a special report that examines parking in TODs. All of these reports are available, at: http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/MassTrans/tod.htm Statewide Transit-Oriented Development Report - Executive Summary 1  The American Plaza in downtown San Diego, CA Metropolitan Transit Development Board (MTDB) in San Diego has TOD projects and plans in place at over 15 of the system's 49 light-rail stations  TOD is an effective strategy to help manage California's growth and improve its quality of life.   From 1990 to 2000, California invested approximately 14 billion dollars on mass transportation Richmond Transit Village, Richmond, CA The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) has set aside $54 million in flexible federal funds for the Transportation for Livable Communities Program (TLC). Whisman Station, Mountain View, CA The City of Mountain View in the San Francisco Bay Area has taken a leadership role in providing a framework for TOD. Calthorpe Associates  What is Transit-Oriented Development? TOD is a strategy that has broad potential in both large urban and small communities using bus or rail transit systems. It focuses compact growth around transit stops, thereby capitalizing on transit investments by bringing potential riders closer to transit facilities and increasing ridership. TOD can also produce a variety of other local and regional benefits by encouraging walkable compact and infill development. Transit agencies often play an important role in TOD. Local governments can play a significant role in promoting TOD through plans, policies, zoning provisions, and incentives for supportive densities, designs, along with a mix of land uses. For development to be transit-oriented, it needs to be more than just adjacent to transit. Development generally needs to be shaped by transit in terms of parking, density, and/or building orientation in comparison to conventional development for it to be considered transit-oriented. A successful TOD will reinforce both the community and the transit system. Successful TOD implementation typically involves a number of elements such as: optimal transit system design; community partnerships; understanding local real estate markets; planning for TOD; coordination among local, regional, and state organizations; and providing the right mix of planning and financial incentives and resources.  Why TOD in California? Over the next 20 years, California is expected to add 11-16 million new residents and over four million new households. This unprecedented growth is more than California experienced during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, combined. California's success at managing this growth will determine its future prosperity, the quality of its environment, and overall quality of life for its residents. TOD is a strategy to help manage this growth and improve California's quality of life. TOD provides communities with an alternative to the consequences of low-density suburban sprawl and automobile- dependent land use patterns. In addition, TOD can help answer California's dramatic need for more affordable housing.  2 California Department of Transportation   TOD Profile: Ohlone-Chynoweth, San Jose Ohlone-Chynoweth on the Guadalupe Light Rail line in San Jose includes housing and community facilities developed on an under used light-rail park-andride lot. The former 1,100space park-andride lot now includes a variety of uses: 240 park-and-ride spaces, 330 units of affordable housing, 4,400 sq. ft. of retail, and a day care center. At 27 dwelling units per acre, the residential density is relatively high compared to the single family neighborhood nearby. The $31.6 million project included $14.5 million in tax-exempt bonds, $10.5 million in tax credit equity, a $5.2 million loan from the City to support affordable housing, $824,000 in federal transportation funds for improvements, a $500,000 Affordable Housing grant, and $350,000 State Proposition 1 funds to reimburse the school fee.  Parsons Brinckerhoff  Posey's Corner, Sacramento, CA Sacramento Regional Transit has recast its role in transitoriented development with a major TOD planning program  underway for the eastward Folsom Corridor and South Line light-rail extensions.  Need for Mobility Options By aligning transit investments with a community's vision for how it wants to grow, TOD seeks to create mixed-use, denser, walkable ""transit villages"". By implementing TOD, California can make significant progress towards improving its quality of life by coordinating investments in transportation and land use projects. The Federal Transit Administration now gives priority for funding of proposed rail transit projects to areas with transitsupportive land use policies and practices. If California expects to be able to successfully compete nationwide for limited federal rail transit funds, we need to pay attention to implementing TOD. Accompanying significant population and employment growth is the concern over increasing traffic congestion and lengthening commute times. From 1990 to 2000, as the state's population grew by 13.6%, the average time people spent commuting increased by nearly 4% . That trend is expected to increase into the future. From 1990 to 2000, the state of California invested approximately 14 billion dollars of state funds on mass transportation programs and projects. These investments, along with California's congested roads and freeways, have helped reverse a long trend of decline in transit ridership.  Statewide Transit-Oriented Development Report - Executive Summary  3   Several demographic trends are expected to contribute favorably to the market demand for T ransit-Oriented Development Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative  North Hollywood Transit Park, Los Angeles, CA BEFORE The City of Los Angeles adopted ""A Transportation/Land Use Policy for Los Angeles,"" in 1993 to guide TOD planning. TOD  AFTER plans have been adopted for four Red Line subway stations and several stations on the Pasadena Blue light-rail line.  California's transit use is increasing 40% faster than the average national rate. In 1999, two of California's transit systems had the hightest increases in ridership in the nation. However, despite California's impressive investment in transit, most of California's future growth will likely continue to follow typical ""sprawl"" development patterns. The result would be higher costs of local services, continued loss of farmland and open space, and increased dependence on automobiles. Consequently, the total number of annual `vehicle miles traveled' in California is expected to increase from 296 billion miles in 2000 to 400 billion miles by 2020, a 33% increase. 4 California Department of Transportation  What are the Benefits of TOD? The results of this study indicate that implementing TOD can have significant benefits to individuals, communities, regions, and the state as a whole. (The extent that these benefits are realized depends on whether developments have the primary characteristics of TOD, as well as on the type and quality of transit service available.) Ten major areas of benefits from TOD are:  TOD can provide mobility choices. By creating ""activity nodes"" linked by transit, TOD provides important mobility options, very much needed in the state's most congested metropolitan areas. This also allows young people, the elderly, people who prefer not to drive, and those who don't own cars the ability to get around. TOD can increase public safety. By creating active places that are busy through the day and evening and providing ""eyes on the street"", TOD helps increase safety for pedestrians, transit-users, and many others. TOD can increase transit ridership. TOD improves the efficiency and effectiveness of our transit service investments by increasing the use of transit near stations by 20 to 40 percent.   TOD Profile: Pleasant Hill, BART Station Area TOD planning for the Pleasant Hill BART station in Contra Costa County is now entering its second generation following the initial Specific Area Plan developed in the 1980s. Following a charette process the County, BART and the community reached a consensus in March 2001 to turn BART's 18-acre surface parking lot into a TOD. Lennertz and Coyle Associates Lennertz and Coyle Associates  Housing at Hazard Station, San Diego, CA The City of San Diego has been a willing partner in supporting both mass transportation and TOD. The City was one of the first  in the nation to adopt ""Transit-Oriented Development Design Guidelines"" in 1992.  TOD can reduce rates of vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Vehicle travel in California has increased faster than the state's population for years. TOD can lower annual household rates of driving by 20 to 40% for those living, working, and/or shopping near transit stations. TOD can increase households' disposable income. Housing and transportation are the first and second largest household expenses, respectively. TOD can free-up disposable income by reducing driving costs; saving $3-4,000 per year for each household.  TOD reduces air pollution and energy consumption rates. By providing safe and easy pedestrian access to transit, TOD can lower rates of air pollution and energy consumption. Also, TODs can reduce rates of greenhouse gas emissions by 2.5 to 3.7 tons per year for each household. TOD can help conserve resource lands and open space. Because TOD consumes less land than low-density, auto-oriented growth, it reduces the need to convert farmland and open spaces to development.  The draft project proposal includes: 411,000 square feet of office space, up to 345 apartments and townhouses (up to 50 forsale units) a town square and community green, a child care facility, and about 40,000 square feet of ground floor retail and restaurants. All 1,477 of BART's commuter parking spaces would be replaced in structured parking. Subject to negotiations, the Redevelopment Agency will finance the replacement of BART parking, be a partner in the long-term lease and will receive a proportionate share of the revenues.  Statewide Transit-Oriented Development Report - Executive Summary  5   TOD Profile: EmeryStation, Emeryville EmeryStation is a 20-acre mixed-use TOD anchored by a busy Amtrak station. The site is a former contaminated `brownfield' located in the East Before Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area. The developer, Wareham Properties, and the City provided the leadership to implement the After project. The project includes reuse of old industrial buildings and new construction. The project was initiated by Amtrak (Capital Corridor), which was interested in locating a train station in Emeryville. Amtrak offered to pay lease expenses for a station. Wareham agreed to build a new rail station on land leased from the city. In 1998, construction began on Emery Station Plaza, a three-building, 550,000 square foot mixed-use complex on the north, east, and south sides of the Amtrak station. Approximately 150 units of owner-occupied loft and town home developments, plus a senior housing project, have been constructed. At build-out, the investment in EmeryStation is estimated to total $200 million. 6 California Department of Transportation  Wareham Properties  San Francisco Embarcadero Light-Rail Transit San Francisco Muni is entering into its first joint development project following the construction of a new light-rail line to the  South Beach area. A 65-year ground lease is expected to generate $311 million in revenue for Muni, while an additional $540 million in other taxes will flow into the City of San Francisco.  TOD can play a role in economic development. TOD is increasingly used as a tool to help revitalize aging downtowns and declining urban neighborhoods, and to enhance tax revenues for local jurisdictions. TOD can decrease infrastructure costs. Depending on local circumstances, TOD can help reduce overall infrastructure costs for expanding water, sewage and roads to local governments by up to 25% through more compact and infill development.  TOD can contribute to more affordable housing. TOD can add to the supply of affordable housing by providing lower-cost and accessible housing, and by reducing household transportation expenditures. Housing costs for land and structures can be significantly reduced through more compact growth patterns.  Parsons Brinckerhoff   What is the market for TOD? In California and across America, a number of TODs have been built and are performing well in the marketplace. This indicates that the viability of TOD at many locations in today's California real estate market is not a significant concern. However, at the same time, there are still not sufficient financial resources to implement TOD at a large number of transit stations in California. This is particularly true for building affordable housing and parking structures. Mixed-use TODs remain a challenge to finance and implement. And TODs with a retail element historically have proven to be the most challenging in two regards  for financial performance and for adherence to TOD design principals.  Several broad demographic trends influencing California's future are expected to contribute favorably to the market demand for TODs. For housing, these trends not only include unprecedented population and household growth, but a shortfall of housing production and a significant need for housing that is affordable to many households in  California. Regarding employment, recent trends include increased numbers of jobs, particularly in the state's major metropolitan areas. These trends, along with a growing demand for urban housing that offers reduced commute times and urban amenities, point to increasing market demand for TOD projects, especially within the state's major metropolitan areas. Statewide Transit-Oriented Development Report - Executive Summary  TrizecHahn Ehrenkrantz Eckstut & Kuhn Architects  Trends Point to Increasing Demand  Hollywood/Highland, Los Angeles, CA The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) has focused its efforts on joint development of agency-  owned properties, resulting in projects such as Hollywood/ Highland near a Red Line subway station.  TrizecHahn Ehrenkrantz Eckstut & Kuhn Architects  7   Solid track record. Develop a solid track record for implementing projects and conduct accurate market studies. Multiple sources of capital. Having multiple capital sources with varying investment timelines allows a development to satisfy the higher rate of return on some short-term capital sources. There are only a handful of private or public capital sources specifically targeted to TOD, and those sources have a tendency to be modest in scale. Not surprisingly, successful TOD projects are often funded from sources that are available to a variety of projects. TODs in California with affordable housing typically rely on seven or more funding sources. For example, the Fruitvale Transit Village in Oakland has 20 different sources of funds, all with different rules.  There are many major barriers that limit implementation of T ransit-Oriented Development in California The history of TOD in California is both an encouraging story and one of missed opportunities. California has recently produced a number of new TODs across the state, and bus and rail TOD have been shown to be an effective tool to help shape growth and provide mobility alternatives. Yet, while interest in TOD is significant, the reality in California is that TOD is the exception and not the rule at most major transit stations. The dominant land use around the majority of the California's significant bus and rail stops is lowdensity automobile-oriented development that does not take advantage of proximity to high-quality transit service and does not provide optimal access to transit stations.  Parsons Brinckerhoff  Bay Area Rapid Transit Pleasant Hill Station, CA BART has a complex history with TOD. The original premise was that development at stations would naturally occur so no concerted TOD effort was undertaken. BART now has an extensive joint development and station area planning program in concert with local jurisdictions at many of its stations.  Funding for TODs Whether real or perceived, many developers believe there are significant barriers to overcome in trying to secure funding for TODs. These barriers include: the belief that mixed-use developments are risky, difficulty in appraising TODs using traditional appraisal methods, and a perceived unwillingness of investors to fund developments in central cities. Three things are required for TOD projects to overcome a financiers' hesitation and to increase their chances to obtain financing:  What is happening with T OD in California?  There is more activity with TOD planning and implementation in California now than at any time during the last century. At every major transit agency that was surveyed for this study, there are at least one or more Well-planned phasing. Some componew TOD projects currently underway at its nent of the overall development needs to bus and/or rail stations. For some transit start generating cash flow early while systems, these are the first TODs the the remaining phases of the TOD are transit agency has been directly involved completed. with, even after more than a decade of providing rail service.  What are the Major Barriers to Implementing TOD in California? Although the community and transportation benefits of TOD can be significant, there are still many major barriers that limit the broader implementation of TOD in California.  8 California Department of Transportation   Based on this study's review of TOD, it is possible to summarize the major barriers into the following broad areas: Transit system design. The design of transit systems can be a major barrier to successful TOD. Stations often have poor pedestrian access, and broad expanses of surface-level parking lots often separate the stations from the surrounding community. Stations and transit corridors are often located in areas with little to no development potential, reducing transit's ability to link activity centers. Local community concerns. To local neighborhoods, proposals for TOD projects often are met with concerns about changing the character of a community. Even with quality design and appropriate density, and despite local government support for a TOD, community concerns about density and traffic are often huge hurdles to implementation. Local zoning not transit-friendly. In many major transit station areas in the state, local zoning has not been changed to reflect the presence of transit. Local development codes around stations often tend to favor low density, auto-oriented uses. Creating and implementing transitfriendly zoning becomes an additional challenge. Moffett Park, Sunnyvale, CA The City of Sunnyvale's Transportation Demand Management (TDM) ordinance helped create an ""unintentional TOD"" at Moffett Park leveraged by the developer's ability to build a bigger building with a TOD design. A $2.5 million privately financed light rail station serves the project.  Higher developer risk & cost. Mixeduse, higher density projects with reduced amounts of parking (such as in TOD) can significantly increase risks for developers and financiers. TOD can be more costly, and subject to added regulations and more complex local approval processes, as compared to conventional ""auto-oriented"" development. Financing difficult to obtain. Obtaining private financing for TODs is often also a barrier. Lenders typically have concerns about financing mixed-use projects or those with lower parking ratios (which are typical in TOD). Public financing available for implementing TOD is very limited and often difficult to obtain in California. Statewide Transit-Oriented Development Report - Executive Summary  9  Jay Paul Company  Jay Paul Company   Parking Reductions for TOD TOD offers significant opportunities to reduce the number of parking spaces below conventional parking requirements typical for retail, office and residential land uses. TOD provides these opportunities by increasing transit accessibility and combining a mixture of land uses. The design and location of TODs enables a reduction in the number of parking spaces needed. The resulting cost savings can be significant. Reduced parking requirements can lower TOD construction costs, which in turn helps make housing more affordable and/or allows more development to be built on sites near transit. For example, in one case study of six San Francisco neighborhoods, reducing the standard requirement for off-street parking was found to decrease costs for condominiums by more than ten percent. Research indicates TOD offers the potential to reduce parking per household on the order of approximately 20%, as compared to non transit-oriented land uses. A wide range of parking reductions has also been found for commercial parking in TODs. However, to date, there are no clear conclusions regarding how much parking may reasonably be reduced for any particular TOD. Therefore, parking need calculations must be made on a site-by-site basis.  How can the state of California facilitate T OD implement ation? Recommendations regarding potential statelevel strategies to encourage broader implementation of TOD emerged from an extensive process that lasted over a year. Based on the results of this process, the Policy Steering Committee to the Statewide Transit-Oriented Development Study recommended fourteen promising state-level strategies to assist in overcoming TOD implementation barriers. These strategies can be grouped into two broad areas, as follows: Strategy Area #1: State Policies and Practices Strategies in this category include: Encouraging improved coordination of land use and transportation planning at local and regional levels. Facilitating the use and sale of state-owned land near major transit stations for TOD. Examining state environmental review requirements in relation to TOD to determine whether changes may be indicated to reduce barriers. Contributing to improved data on travel and economic impacts of TOD, and incorporating data into improved analysis and decision-making tools; and Providing information and technical assistance on TOD implementation.  T ransit-Oriented Development has the potential to reduce parking per household by approximately 20% The state can encourage local agencies to more closely link land use practices that promote a transit-friendly urban form by providing information, funding for planning, and by fostering cooperation. TOD proponents often face significant delays and difficulties when trying to secure local land use approvals for projects, even in areas where regional and local policies are supportive of this type of development. In addition, the state can provide direct assistance for TOD implementation by reducing existing barriers to leasing or purchasing state-owned ""excess"" and/or underutilized land located near major transit stations. There is also an important role for the state in developing and disseminating data and information about the effects and benefits of TOD regarding travel, economic, and social benefits and impacts. This information is necessary in order to improve the accuracy of analysis prepared for proposed TOD projects and also could help expedite local land use approval processes.  10 California Department of Transportation   Strategy Area #2: State Funding for Planning and Implementation This study recommends that the state of California could help overcome barriers to implementing TOD by: Providing funding to local jurisdictions to prepare plans and adopt ordinances that facilitate transit-oriented development. Providing financial incentives to enable local agencies and private organizations to implement TOD. Offering funding for specific types of TOD demonstration projects. Changing existing law to allow local agencies to provide `tax-increment financing' around major transit stations, even if they are located outside redevelopment areas. Allowing greater flexibility in the use of state transportation funds for TOD; and Helping to make private TOD mortgage instruments (such as the ""Location Efficient Mortgage"" (LEM) program more widely available. The Transit Villages Act of 1994 is acknowledged by many as the most important step in California, at the state level, regarding TOD. This act provides for cities and counties to prepare plans for `transit village' districts near major existing or planned transit stations. It stipulates that transit villages should contain a mixture of land uses, and it establishes that transit village plans are eligible for transportation funding.  However, although this legislation is an important step, it provides no funding for implementing TOD, which has been a major barrier to its wider implementation in California. Research conducted for this study indicates that there is an overall strong real estate market outlook in California for TOD, and favorable demographic trends in the major metropolitan areas of the state. However, even so, TOD project proponents widely report that they often encounter significant difficulty obtaining private financing to implement TOD projects. Public funding for TOD implementation in California is very scarce, outside established local redevelopment areas. The mixed-use aspect of many TOD projects tends to complicate the process of obtaining development financing, and the high cost of building parking structures can add significantly to project costs. Obtaining financing for affordable housing within TODs can be extremely complex because these projects typically require multiple funding sources with widely varying requirements. To complicate the situation, local jurisdictions often lack the necessary funding to be able to prepare TOD plans or development ordinances. In addition, local agencies typically lack the ability to provide effective financial incentives or assistance to encourage the development of quality TODs, unless a project is located within an established redevelopment area where taxincrement financing may be available.  TOD Profile: Uptown District, San Diego The Uptown district is a 14-acre mixed-use bus TOD put together under the leadership of the City of San Diego. For this project, San Diego wanted to showcase a mixeduse development. There was no public opposition to the project since it required relatively little change to the community (the site was a former Sears store in an existing mixed-use community). The residential component has 320 units at an average density of 43 units per net acre; the 145,000 square feet of retail and commercial space includes a 42,500 square foot supermarket. The Uptown project was financed by the redevelopment agency and has been successful in creating a community where it is convenient to walk to shopping and where transit service is excellent. The project is parked conventionally; no special parking reductions were implemented to account for the presence of transit. The parking ratio for commercial is 1 space per 285 square feet and 2.25 spaces per unit for the residential. Residential and supermarket parking is underground, and street level spaces are available for retail shoppers.  Statewide Transit-Oriented Development Report - Executive Summary  11   T OD in America A TOD renaissance is underway across America. More so than at anytime in recent history there is heightened interest in planning for and implementing TOD. The forces driving America's TOD renaissance include: escalating traffic congestion increasing the attractiveness of sites close to rail; an increased trend of Americans moving back into America's cities; demographic changes underpinning an expanding market for higher density mixed-use communities; increased support for smart growth and the strategies necessary to implement it; changes in Federal Transit Administration policies for transit `joint development' and an emphasis on transitsupportive land uses in funding recommendations for new rail starts; and finally, more transit agencies are starting to realize they are in both the community-building and the people-moving businesses.  One of the lessons for succeeding with TOD is the need to start TOD planning very early in the project development process. Decisions on alignment, where to put stations and the layout of transit facilities all can make a huge difference between a successful or unsuccessful TOD strategy.  Detailed descriptions of these strategies are provided in chapter 9 of the report, ""Statewide Transit-Oriented Development Study: Factors for Success in California"".

Solving problems early-on means bringing an expanded `cast of characters' to the table. To enhance coordination, engineers and transit planners designing transit systems need to work closely with land use planners, real estate economists, architects, landowners, and residents. In addition, land-use planners should coordinate with transit agencies in planning and locating transit-supportive development.

GX234-96-2854787	"Description of the Affected Environment: Community Characteristics and Tourism Resources 4.10 COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS AND TOURISM RESOURCES importance of community attributes to an area. The county comprises the appropriate unit for an analysis of the affected environment for coastal community concerns and tourism as opposed to individual OC S production leases grouped as units. This county-wide approach is consistent with previous social development and petroleum extraction industry (MMS 1996, 1998). 4.10.1 STUDIES IN THE AREA Table 4.10.1-1 lists some of the numerous studies that address onshore and offshore tourism in the area. 4.10.2 REGIONAL SETTING The regional setting primarily consists of the coastal portions of Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo County. 4.10.2.1 VENTURA COUNTY  Tourism is not a standard category in which economic data are collected. Tourism activities generally affect several service sectors through expenditures such as lodging, dining, and special activities. Tourism also generates transportation activity and increases in retail sales. In all these areas there is local demand as well as tourist demand. The California Department of Tourism defines tourism as any nonroutine visit to an area. This definition encompasses business and personal travel in addition to leisure travel most typically associated with tourism. In the absence of a discrete measure of tourism activity, a number of indicators may be utilized to estimate the activity. This section examines the aggregate economic activity. The Recreation section examines specific activities, amenities, and infrastructure the serve both tourism and recreation. Researchers have developed the extract/intact ratio as an indicator of an area's reliance on extractive industries (petroleum development, mining, sand and gravel) compared to those activities that rely on so-called ""intact"" industries such as eating, drinking, and lodging establishments and museums. The industries that make up the intact sector serve as a proxy for tourism (MMS 1996, 1998). To the extent that tourism depends on amenities a community has to offer, the ration will function as an indicator of the Table 4.10.1-1. Tourism Studies  The UCSB Economic Forecast Project (2000) quantifies the importance of tourism to Ventura County.

Tourism accounted for approximately 8.8 percent of the County's employment, with approximately 1 percent employed in the lodging sector. Starting early in the County's history and until very recently, the petroleum industry and agriculture have been the major industries. Many cities in coastal western portion of the county such as Ventura and Oxnard and the inland cities of Fillmore and Santa Paula developed around these two activities. The petroleum extraction industry was integral to the social, cultural, and economic development of the area. The County has largely been very amenable to both onshore and offshore development. The County was a production and service center for the regional petroleum industry, a role that moderated in the 1980s and has begun to decline, albeit one that remains very important but is no longer dominant as the industry has declined and the economy diversified (MMS 1996a, 1998a). For much of the period of 1970 to 1995, the extract/intact ratio, using aggregate income for Ventura County, hovered around 80% before slipping to approximately 40 percent in the period from 1985 to 1995. This trend illustrates the importance of extractive industries to the county's economy for much of the period, and the rising importance of the tourism economy with the decline in the petroleum industry. Long-term patterns of economic and community development resulted in beach front areas being developed for uses other than outdoor recreation and tourism. In the city of Ventura, while beach area recreation and tourism is quite high, during the sum-  mer, year-round tourism remains sparse. The City is actively engaged in trying to draw tourist and residents alike to its beach area and incorporate the beach area into the recently redeveloped adjacent downtown area (MMS, 1996a). 4.10.2.2 SANTA BARBARA COUNTY The UCSB Economic Forecast Project (1999) quantifies the importance of tourism to Santa Barbara County and the county's southern (coastal) area. Table 4.10.2.2-1 summarizes these statistics, that indicate tourism and lodging is a very valuable sector the County's economy. In 1999, the expenditures in the County for lodging rose 9.6 percent and are expected to grow annually between 1 and 2 percent per year for the next decade. For purposes of analysis and description, the County can be subdivided into the coastal area of the County or so-called ""South Coast"" which borders the Santa Barbara Channel and the inland North County, separated from the Pacific Ocean by Vandenburg AFB. Petroleum extraction took place with and contributed to social and cultural orientations in the county. In areas of the county dependent on tourism and other ""intact"" qualities, such as the South Coast, the need to control oil has been paramount, as has the desire to control development generally. Residents have allowed oil (and gas activities) on both land and offshore, but made efforts to limit the precise locations and conditions of its development"" (MMS 1996b). The North County has been the center of agriculture, petroleum extraction, and has been more receptive to development in general. The differences between the two portions of the County reflect two different traditions  Table 4.10.2.2-1. Selected indicators of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo tourism (1999).

Furthermore, these traditions are reflected in view of the effect of offshore development on tourism among local leaders (MMS 1998). For much of the period of 1970 to 1995, the extract/intact ratio, using aggregate income for Santa Barbara County's South Coast area, increased from just under 20 percent in 1970 to a high of 33 percent in 1980, returning to just over 20 percent in 1995. This trend illustrates the importance of tourism-related industries to that of the extractive industries to the county's economy. Molotch and other researchers (MMS 1998) note that tourism represents a traditional specialization of the Santa Barbara economy. Tourism does not readily diffuse to other locations that do not have aesthetic and recreation amenities already in place. As such, it constitutes a competitive economic asset for those localities, such as Santa Barbara, where it is strong. A common local concern is that tourism and offshore energy are contradictory industries, where growth of one potentially forecloses growth in another. The researchers find that the county's economy has consistently remained more dependent on tourism, which employs greater numbers (albeit at much lower wages) and produces greater income wealth than on onshore and offshore petroleum extraction. However, the study does not conclude that the two sectors are mutually exclusive, essentially incompatible, or that one forecloses the other. Only the Gato Canyon Unit is sited near a major tourist-serving facility, the Bacara Resort and Spa in Goleta. Tourism and hospitality have a long association with Santa Barbara, both as an important economic activity and as a symbol of the area (MMS 1996b). As noted above, allocation of the value to ""tourism"" from the various standard categories of economic activity presents methodological problems. Arguably, while few tourism activities are coastal-dependent (that is, cannot occur without access to the coast), the majority are coastal-enhanced, for it is the coastal orientation of the city that greatly contributes to the sense of place and the general ambiance so highly prized by visitors to the area (MMS 1996b). 4.10.2.3 SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY The UCSB Economic Forecast Project (1999) quantifies the importance of tourism to San Luis Obispo County and the county's southern (coastal) area. Table 4.10.2.2-1 summarizes these statistics, that indicate tourism and lodging is a very valuable sector the County's economy. Given that vacancy rates are lower in San Luis Obispo than neighboring Santa Barbara or Monterey County, and that attraction in SLO can attract tourists, this sector will continue to 4-133 4.10.3 EFFECTS OF PAST OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS ACTIVITY R esearchers have searched for a negative link between onshore tourism and offshore oil and gas activities. If tourists select destination based on visual characteristics of the destination to the exclusion other characteristics such as cost, type of recreation available, other amenities and the ambiance of the destination, the it is possible that the presence of offshore succeed. While tourism is most strongly associated with coastal communities and San Luis Obispo city, the activity is becoming more important for many communities in the county (MMS 1996c). Early petroleum extraction activity in San Luis Obispo County took form as a transportation center with development of pipeline and shipping infrastructure. Agriculture was another important activity (MMS 1996c). However, over time the County, and especially its principal city, shifted toward becoming a significant center of higher education, and the County developed without an integration of oil extraction into the local area, especially compared to Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. While petroleum transportation was a small industrial presence in the San Luis Obispo County, oil and gas extraction has been limited. Most production and transportation infrastructure has recently or is presently undergoing decommissioning with environmental consequences, especially at Avila Beach and Guadalupe Dunes, that translate into a resistance to further petroleum development (MMS 1998c). Although extensive remediation of the Avila Beach spill and restoration has been accomplished, many fear that the activity has changed the unique character of the beach (Beyeller 2000). For much of the period of 1970 to 1995, the extract/intact ratio, using aggregate income for San Luis Obispo County, fluctuated from 10 to 20 before slipping to approximately less than five percent from 1985 to 1995. This trend illustrates the overwhelming importance of tourism sector to the county's economy for much of the period. San Luis Obispo coastal cities (Cambria, Cayucos, Morro Bay in the north, Pismo Beach to the south) contemporarily developed as retirement communities and tourist towns with an opposition to industrialization to the coast. San Luis Obispo County has not experienced offshore energy development from State or Federal leases (a small portion of the onshore Guadalupe Field extends offshore). Strident local opposition to offshore development, often expressed as concern over the activity's perceived consequences on quality of life and sense of place, has evolved throughout the County with the trend less prevalent in the northern inland section (MMS 1996c, 1998c).   Delineation Drilling Activities Offshore Santa Barbara County  platforms would reduce the amount of tourism. Studies relating to this issue include Minerals Management Service (1987). While various surveys and other efforts were used to identify the often negative feelings about the presence of offshore oil and gas activity, little quantitative evidence exists about whether or not the presence of offshore oil and gas activities lead to a decline in tourism. A 1993 assessment of the effectiveness of mitigation measures for Santa Ynez Unit by Santa Barbara County included an examination of the project and cumulative effects on environmentally sensitive resources, tourism, recreation, and aesthetics. Specifically, projects make payments to a Coastal R esources Enhancement Fund, which provides enhancement projects that will compensate for residual impacts to coastal resources that are not otherwise mitigated. The analysis suggests that while the mitigation is effective, CREF expenditures tended to be more heavily weighted towards recreation, despite oil development impacts being as great or greater on environmentally sensitive resources, aesthetics, and tourism. In other words, while payments were sufficient to mitigate cumulative impacts, allocation of the Fund by the County may have caused an imbalance in mitigation across categories. Use of hotel and campgrounds by construction workers employed to build onshore processing plants has been identified as a potential tourism-related impact. However, a study of socioeconomic impacts of offshore development conducted by the County for MMS indicated that use of hotels and campgrounds alleviates demand for and is a viable alternative to more conventional and permanent housing (MMS 2000). Furthermore, under a socioeconomic monitoring and mitigation project separate from CREF, project operators made mitigation payments to the County to mitigate the impact from worker-occupied campsites in County parks. 4.11 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT  This section presents information on the social and economic environment of the study area composed primarily of Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties, California. This information includes employment and population, housing, infrastructure, and public services and finance. The socioeconomic effects of past oil and gas activities, both onshore and offshore, have been well documented in a series of studies conducted by MMS and others (MMS 1996 abc, 1998 abc, 2000). Separate sections present information regarding recreation, community characteristics and tourism, and visual resources. Starting early in Ventura County's history and until very recently, the petroleum industry and agriculture have been the major industries. Many cities 4-134  in the coastal western portion of the county such as Ventura and Oxnard and the inland cities of Fillmore and Santa Paula developed around these two activities. The petroleum extraction industry was integral to the social, cultural, and economic development of the area. The County has largely been very amenable to both onshore and offshore development. The County was a production and service center for the regional petroleum industry, a role that moderated in the 1980s and has begun to decline, albeit one that remains very important but is no longer dominant as the industry has declined and the economy diversified (MMS 1996a, 1998a). Historically, property taxes generated by the value of petroleum deposits and onshore oil and gas infrastructure have been an important source of property tax revenues. For purposes of analysis and description, Santa Barbara County can be subdivided into the coastal area of the County or so-called ""South Coast"" which borders the Santa Barbara Channel and the inland North County, separated from the Pacific Ocean by Vandenburg AFB. Petroleum extraction took place with and contributed to social and cultural orientations in the county. In the Channel coast area of the County, the need to control oil has been paramount, as has the desire to control development generally. R esidents have allowed oil and gas activities on land and offshore, but made efforts to limit the precise locations and conditions of development (MMS 1996b). The North County has been the center of agriculture, petroleum extraction, and has been more receptive to development in general. The differences between the two portions of the County reflect two different traditions about how development should take place, economies constructed and communities built (MMS 1996b, 1998b). Historically, property taxes generated by the value of petroleum deposits and onshore oil and gas infrastructure have been an important source of property tax revenues. Early petroleum extraction activity in San Luis Obispo County took form as a transportation center with development of pipeline and shipping infrastructure. Agriculture was another important activity (MMS 1996c). However, over time the County, and especially its principal city, shifted toward becoming a significant center of higher education, and the County developed without an integration of oil extraction into the local area, especially compared to Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. While petroleum transportation was a small industrial presence in the San Luis Obispo County, oil and gas extraction has been limited. Most production and transportation infrastructure has recently or is presently undergoing decommissioning with environmentally undesired consequences, especially at Avila Beach and Guadalupe Dunes (MMS 1998c). In the 1980s, a number of offshore development projects and other large onshore non-petroleum de-   Description of the Affected Environment: Social and Economic Environment velopment projects had the potential to affect the social and economic conditions in the three counties. Permit conditions imposed by the Counties, especially Santa Barbara, successfully ameliorated the range of socioeconomic impacts from offshore development projects, from transportation to public services (SBC 1993). Santa Barbara County and Ventura County undertook a socioeconomic monitoring and mitigation program for offshore development projects. The program identified annual public facility and services impacts, caused primarily by the in-migration of project workers to the area, and estimated the mitigation payments for these impacts to counties, cities, school districts, and special service districts. The program mitigated impacts to several communities for public services (such as public safety), water supply and sewage treatment, schools, and housing. For the period of 1986 to 1994, governments in Santa Barbara and Ventura County received total mitigation payments of $7.4 million and $3.4 million, respectively. (San Luis Obispo County declined participation (MMS 2000-0019). In addition to the direct effect of mitigation payments, permit fees, and property taxes, the oil and gas industry contributes to the social and economic environment of the study area through higher wages, local purchases, and philanthropic giving. Typically the average worker in the oil and gas industry worker in the study area earns approximately eighty-seven percent more than the average worker. In 1999 the oil and gas extraction industry had the highest average wage except in Ventura County where it was second to non-durable manufacturing. Average wages for the oil and gas industry and selected other industries in the study area are shown in table 4.11-1. The generally higher wages earned by oil and gas industry workers is likely to result in higher sales and property taxes for their local communities. The UCSB Economic Forecast Project estimated the economic contribution of the oil and gas industry from direct, indirect, and induced sources to be exceed $1 billion in both total expenditures and total output. Total income was estimated to be in excess of $727 million. The offshore oil and gas contributes to the total economic effect described in ""The Economic Contribution of the Oil & Gas Industry in the TriCounties."" The methodologies sand the explanation of the methodologies used to derive the total economic contribution of the oil and gas industry can be found in the report. Local philanthropy in the study area has generally been disproportionate to the number of employees in the study area. In 1996 the oil and gas industry accounted for between 2 and 5 percent of contributions received in the United Way Branches of Camarillo, Santa Barbara, Santa Maria, and San Luis Obispo (MMS 98a). The percentage of these contributions is in contrast to a total employment in the oil and gas industry of less than  percent in the study area. While philanthropic contributions have not been spread evenly through out the study area, the effect of these activities has been to enhance the social and economic environment of the communities receiving the gifts. A somewhat more comprehensive look at charitable giving by the oil industry can be found in the MMS series of studies done on the Petroleum Extraction Industry, (MMS 1998 abc).

A major indirect result of offshore oil and gas development is the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The Land and Water Conservation Fund has been a source for the acquisition of a recreational lands in the study area. While the level of development offshore a specific coastal segment is not directly related to Land and Water Conservation Fund, if Federal OCS development ends no funds would be available to fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Disbursements to California from OC S funds from 1968 to 1996, which coincides with the period of historic production have totaled more than $1.7 billion. These funds from federal OCS production are augmented at  the state-level by legislation which disburses revenues from state tideland and submerged land production to local communities under the Coastal R esource and Energy Assistance Act which directed a total of $35 million dollars to local counties in 1985 and which has recently been reauthorized with the passage of AB 1431 in 1996. Table 4.11-3 shows the use of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Projects funded in the study area includes: Los Padres National Forest, California Condor, Santa Monica Mountain National Recreation Area, Channel Islands National Park, Montana De Oro State Park, and Pismo State Beach.

The largest employment sectors in the three counties are trade, services and government. Services are the largest source of employment in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, and only slight smaller than trade in San Luis Obispo County (24.40% and 24.77%, respectively). State and Local Government is the third largest source of employment in the three counties. The share of employment varies considerably in the three counties and ranges from approximately 13% in Ventura County to more than 22% in San Luis Obispo County. The gap in overall Government employment narrows somewhat because Ventura County has more than 3 times the share of Federal Employment than does San Luis Obispo County (3.12% to 0.77%.) Direct oil and gas employment includes not only extraction but also manufacturing or processing. Examples of processing activities can be found in all three counties and included such employers as Tosco's Santa Maria Refinery in San Luis Obispo County, Exxon's Las Flores Canyon Plant in southern Santa Barbara County, and Signal Hill Service's La Conchita Plant in Ventura County. Most if not all of the mining em-  ployment in the three counties is oil and gas extraction. Direct employment in offshore oil and gas is estimated at 1,028 jobs in the three counties. Total employment that is attributable to Federal offshore oil and gas in the three counties is estimated to be 2,670. Population: Since the 1990 U.S. Census the three county study area has increased its population by more than 116,941 or 9.31 percent. Table 4.11.1-2. shows the 1999 population for each county and the rate of change from 1980 to 1999. Only Ventura County matched the overall California rate of population growth of 11.37% during the between 1990 and 1999. However, the fastest growing city in Santa Barbara County grew only slightly faster than the State of California. Outside of the City of Moorpark in eastern Ventura County the fastest growing city in the three county study area was Paso R obles (18.3%) which only slightly outpaced Camarillo in the growth race (16.53%). The largest gross population change in the study area was in Oxnard (14,840). Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley also increase their populations by more than 14,000 people. The combined growth in these three cities was more than the population of all but 10 of the 18 incorporated cities with populations over 10,000 people in the study area.

Despite the growth in housing, housing lagged population growth by 24 percent. The failure of housing supply to keep pace with population growth led to increases in the median housing prices. Median housing prices continued to be higher than the National average in each county. San Luis Obispo rose relative to the State median housing price and is now 95 percent of the State median housing price. Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties continued to rise faster than the statewide median housing prices and therefore increased their premium over the statewide median housing prices. Table 4.11.2-1. shows the median housing prices for the study area. Affordable housing is a major problem in each county and is expected to continue to be a problem as population growth is anticipated to be faster than new housing will become available. The quest for affordable housing has resulted in long commutes into southern Santa Barbara County from Orcutt and other parts of the Santa Maria Valley and Ventura County. Santa Barbara County housing prices show a strong bi-modal structure as median housing prices in the Santa Maria Valley are 30% of the median price in the south Coast of Santa Barbara (The UC SB Economic Forecast Project 1999, 2000). 4.11.3 INFRASTRUCTURE Infrastructure supporting offshore oil and gas production in the study area is generally of two types, infrastructure that directly supports offshore oil and gas production and infrastructure that supports offshore oil and gas production because the infrastructure exists. Direct support infrastructure includes dedicated onshore processing facilities and pipelines and some port or pier space. With the exception of some port and/or piers, facilities solely dedicated to the use of Federal offshore oil and gas production are unlikely to be used to support the proposed action. Table 4.11.3-1. identifies onshore facilities that provide direct support to the Federal offshore oil and gas industry. A more comprehensive discussion about the facilities can be found in the COOGER Report (MMS 1999). Typically roads and highways, ports and harbors, and the broad sweep of public and private infrastructure such as utilities, schools, police are infrastructure that supports offshore oil and gas development and production because they exist. Table 4.11.3-2. identifies highways used to support Federal offshore oil and gas activity. Table 4.11.3-3. list streets and roads used to support Federal offshore oil and gas activity. In addition to the transport of products, offshore oil activities place demands on public transportation infrastructure associated with the transportation of materials, supplies, and solid wastes associated with offshore exploration, development drilling, and routine operations of offshore and onshore facilities. Employment associated with these activities also generates commuter traffic on public roadways. Table 4.11.3-4. shows traffic volumes on selected highways in the study area. A more comprehensive discussion of the use of highways and roads to support oil and gas activity can be found in the COOGER R eport (MMS 1999). Offshore oil and gas development contributes approximately 900 weekly vehicle trips to the total demand on roads in the study area. The total contribution of the offshore oil and gas industry to traffic in the study area is less than percent of the average weekly volumes (COOGER R eport MMS 1999). Study area oil is typically processed at local onshore facilities. Current onshore processing facilities prepare crude oil for shipment to major refining centers and produce natural gas for delivery to local consumer's via existing utilities. Natural gas liquids and liquefied petroleum gases are also produced, and are either blended with crude oil for transport or delivered to local markets via truck. Some of the processing facilities also produce sulfur which is transported to market by truck. In addition, the Santa Maria Refinery refines some offshore oil and produces asphalt, petroleum coke, and sulfur, which are transported to market by truck and rail. The volume of oil, which may be processed at each onshore facility, may be affected by the characteristics of the incoming crude oil feedstock which alter the proportion of different products produced. Other characteristics, such as the amount of water in the incoming crude oil, presence of contaminants (sand, heavy metals, etc.), or chemical characteristics of the crude oil may affect the capacity of a specific facility with respect to a specific oil production source.

Direct services can be found in the form of utilities such as water and electricity. In direct services include service used by employees and their families, suppliers, and others affected by Federal Offshore oil and gas operations. Public Finance: Local government revenues are limited both by tax assessment restrictions and limitations on tax collections and disbursements. Because of the limitations on tax collections many local governments rely on applicant fees to offset other wise non-recoverable costs. While property taxes remain the largest source of revenue for schools from these taxes revenues are now transferred to the State, which then returns fund to the appropriate jurisdiction. Some special districts and cities are not eligible to receive a share of property tax revenues and rely on sales taxes and user fees. Offshore oil and gas development generates direct revenue for local governments through property taxes, intergovernmental transfers, and direct payments (mitigation fees). Of these revenues, only property taxes are predictably linked to specific offshore development projects. The revenues associated with 4-144 intergovernmental transfers are influenced by several factors beyond the level of local offshore development and are not clearly correlated to the level of local development. The percentage of total direct revenue resulting from Federal offshore oil and gas development in the three counties range from almost nonexistent in San Luis Obispo to approximately 3 percent of the revenue generated by Santa Barbara County. Table 4.11.4-1. shows the major property tax payers in each County. A discussion of the revenue effects of offshore oil and gas development in the three county study area can be found in the COOGER Study (MMS 1999).   Description of the Affected Environment: Commercial Fishing  Table 4.11.4-1.

Mi nerals Managem ent Servic e 4.11.5 NON-RESIDENTIAL LAND USE In addition to housing and the land uses supporting offshore oil and gas development the three counties have maintained a significant percentage of land devoted to agriculture. Over the past three decades development pressures have resulted in increased demand for conversion of agricultural lands to other uses. In addition to the pressure to convert agriculture lands to urban uses additional pressure has been brought by the conversion from non-irrigated crops to irrigated crops, such as wine grapes. The call for preserving agricultural lands and open space in the three counties has resulted in a class of land use protections collectively referred to as SOAR (Save  Tax Contribution (x $1,000) 7,960 5,427 4,806 2,747 2,051 1,768 1,660 5,490 2,258 2,093 1,618 1,444 1,198 1,018 37,194 2,439 1,622 551 340  Open Space and Agriculture Resources.) Table 4.11.51. shows agriculture land uses and total land area for each county. In addition to Agriculture a large part of each of County is devoted to public ownership and use. Major examples of public land use in the counties are the Los Padres National Forest, Santa Monica Mountain National Recreation Area, Montana de Oro State Park. Military uses include Point Mugu Naval Weapons Station and Vandenberg AFB. Conversion of agricultural land, open space, or other land uses will be required to house, educate, and employ the projected population increase.  Table 4.11.5-11. Agricultural land use.

Since the November 2000 presidential controversy in Florida, a spotlight has been placed on the conduct and administration of elections across the country. Fortunately for Californians, we looked ahead for the changes that needed to be made and our united efforts have turned California into a model for all other states to emulate. In fact, recent federal election reform legislation requires other states to carry out many of the critically important procedures we pioneered in California as a prerequisite to their obtaining federal funds for election modernization. Whether it's the publication of this detailed voter information guide, which helps you make informed decisions, or the development of America's premier on-line campaign finance tracking system or the nation's most extensive and respected voter outreach efforts, you can be proud that California is blazing the trail for other states to follow. To ensure the integrity of the elections process, we re-tooled the voting infrastructure to make sure that voters who have died or moved away no longer remain on the voter rolls and implemented a top-notch election fraud investigation unit so that individuals who violate election laws will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Our innovative use of technology, like California's computerized statewide voter file and the live, up-to-the-minute reporting of election results on the Internet, provides us with invaluable tools that continue to improve the way we administer elections. And the recent adoption of Proposition 41, the Voting Modernization Bond Act, will help us move closer toward helping counties replace their outdated voting systems with newer, more modern technology for you to use when you cast your ballot. It has been an honor to work side by side with the dedicated Secretary of State's Office to build a better elections system for all will never have to question the integrity of the democratic Americans have sacrificed their lives for during the history of our men and women of the Californians. Californians process, which so many great nation.  We hope you will respect their sacrifice and honor their memory and support our country by casting a ballot on November 5, 2002.   CONTENTS  Quick Reference Pull-Out Guide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Bond Act Put on the Ballot by the Legislature  Bond Act Put on the Ballot by the Legislature  Summary This act provides for the Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2002. For the purpose of providing shelters for battered women, clean and safe housing for low-income senior citizens, emergency shelters for homeless families with children, housing with social services for the homeless and mentally ill, repairs and accessibility improvements to apartments for families and handicapped citizens, homeownership assistance for military veterans, and security improvements and repairs to existing emergency shelters, shall the state create a housing trust fund by issuing bonds totaling two billion one hundred million dollars ($2,100,000,000), paid from existing state funds at an average annual cost of one hundred fifty seven million dollars ($157,000,000) per year over the 30-year life of the bonds, with the requirement that every city and county is eligible to receive funds as specified in the measure and with all expenditures subject to an independent audit?  Summary This thirteen billion fifty million dollar ($13,050,000,000) bond issue will provide funding for necessary education facilities to relieve overcrowding and to repair older schools. Funds will be targeted to areas of the greatest need and must be spent according to strict accountability measures. Funds will also be used to upgrade and build new classrooms in the California Community Colleges, the California State University, and the University of California, to provide adequate higher education facilities to accommodate the growing student enrollment. These bonds may be used only for eligible projects. Fiscal Impact: State cost of about $26.2 billion over 30 years to pay off both the principal ($13.05 billion) and interest ($13.15 billion) costs on the bonds. Payments of about $873 million per year.  What Your Vote Means Yes A YES vote on this measure means: The state could sell $2.1 billion in general obligation bonds to support various housing programs.  What Your Vote Means No A NO vote on this measure means: The state could not sell $2.1 billion in general obligation bonds for these purposes.  Yes A YES vote on this measure means: The state could sell $13.05 billion in general obligation bonds for the construction and renovation of public education facilities (kindergarten through 12th grade and higher education).  No A NO vote on this measure means: The state could not sell $13.05 billion in general obligation bonds for these purposes.  Arguments Pro Proposition 46 provides emergency shelters for battered women, affordable housing for seniors, lowincome families, homeless shelters with social services; paid out of existing state resources without raising taxes; endorsed by AARP, Congress of California Seniors, League of Women Voters of California, California Chamber of Commerce, California State Sheriffs Association.  Arguments Con This bond will provide $2.1 billion for housing projects, but will cost taxpayers approximately $3.36 billion to pay off. It will provide only miniscule benefits to firsttime homebuyers and will do NOTHING to remove the bureaucratic and regulatory barriers to affordable housing throughout California.  Pro MO RE CLASSROOMS and BETTER SCHOOLS, WITHOUT RAISING TAXES. We need 13,000+ new classrooms! 47 ensures CRITICALLY OVERCROWDED districts get their FAIR SHARE to build classrooms, REPAIR old ones and improve SAFETY. Strict ACCOUNTABILITY and AUDITS required. California PTA, California Teachers Association, California Taxpayers' Association, Chamber of Commerce: ""YES on 47""  Con Under Prop 47, the most needed schools aren't required to begin construction for 6 1/2 years. This bond favors LAUSD over every other district in the state. Proposition 47 is the wrong solution to our school facilities crisis, poorly written, patently unfair and will raise your taxes.

Initiative Statute.  Put on the Ballot by the Legislature  Put on the Ballot by Petition Signatures  Summary Amends Constitution to which references are now and municipal trial courts additional cost to state or delete references to the municipal courts, obsolete due to the consolidation of superior into unified superior courts. Fiscal Impact: No local government.  Summary Increases state grant funds available for before/after school programs, providing tutoring, homework assistance, and educational enrichment. Requires that, beginning 200405, new grants will not be taken from education funds guaranteed by Proposition 98. Fiscal Impact: Additional annual state costs for before and after school programs of up to $455 million, beginning in 200405.  What Your Vote Means Yes A YES vote on this measure means: The California Constitution would be amended to remove obsolete references to the municipal courts, and to make conforming changes relating to the membership of the California Judicial Council and the membership of the Commission on Judicial Performance.  What Your Vote Means No A NO vote on this measure means: The California Constitution would not be amended to remove obsolete references to the municipal courts, and would not be amended to make conforming changes to the membership of the California Judicial Council and the membership of the Commission on Judicial Performance.  Yes A YES vote on this measure means: The state would provide additional funding of up to $455 million to before and after school programs.  No A NO vote on this measure means: Funding for before and after school programs would continue to depend on annual legislative action.  Arguments Pro Four years ago the voters authorized the elimination of municipal courts. Municipal courts no longer exist. Their function has been merged into the superior court, for an estimated annual savings of $23,000,000. Proposition 48 cleans up the California Constitution by eliminating obsolete references to the former municipal courts.  Arguments Con Proposition 48 would unwisely prohibit the re-establishment of ""municipal courts"" in any of California's 58 counties. The elimination of municipal courts in favor of a single ""superior court"" in each county has created at least the appearance of unfairness and has made local courts more insular and less accountable.  Pro Major university studies show after-school programs reduce gang activity, drugs and juvenile incarceration while protecting kids, improving grades, saving taxpayers $3 for every $1 invested through reduced costs for juvenile crime, grade repetition, and remedial education. Proposition 49 endorsements: California Taxpayers' Association, Teachers Association, PTA, Sheriffs, AARP, Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Con Proposition 49 would unfairly take one program with a powerful sponsor and guarantee its funding every year. It would fall outside the budget process--even in tough economic times when it might take money away from more critical needs like environmental protection, health care, public safety and other children's programs.

Put on the Ballot by Petition Signatures  Put on the Ballot by Petition Signatures  Summary Authorizes $3,440,000,000 general obligation bonds to fund a variety of specified water and wetlands projects. Fiscal Impact: State cost of up to $6.9 billion over 30 years to repay bonds. Reduction in local property tax revenues, up to roughly $10 million annually; partially offset by state funds. Unknown state and local operation and maintenance costs. .  Summary Redistributes portion of existing state motor vehicle sales/lease revenues from General Fund to Trust Fund for transportation, environmental, and highway and school bus safety programs. Fiscal Impact: Redirects specified General Fund revenues to transportation-related purposes, totaling about $420 million in 200203, $910 million in 200304, and increasing amounts annually thereafter, depending on increases in motor vehicle sales and leasing.  What Your Vote Means Yes No A YES vote on this measure A NO vote on this measure means: means: The state could sell $3.44 The state could not sell $3.44 billion in bonds for water quality, billion in bonds for these purposes. water supply reliability, and safe drinking water projects and for coastal land acquisition and protection.  What Your Vote Means Yes A YES vote on this measure means: Thirty percent of the General Fund revenues generated from the sales tax on the lease and sale of motor vehicles could be used only for state and local transportation-related purposes, instead of being available for programs funded by the General Fund.  No A NO vote on this measure means: These revenues would continue to be available for General Fund supported programs rather than only for state and local transportation-related purposes.  Arguments Pro YES on 50 keeps clean drinking water flowing for California's rapidly-growing population. Prop 50 is a cost-effective approach to protecting vital water supplies and our coast. That's why YES on 50 is endorsed by public health and safety groups, local water agencies, businesses and conservation groups thoughout California.  Arguments Con Proposition 50 does virtually nothing to complete the California Water Project, or provide us with new water supplies. It actually prohibits using bond funds for building new dams or reservoirs. It will cost you $5.7 Billion over the next 25 years. Don't be fooled by this misleading initiative.  Pro YES on 51 dedicates EXISTING vehicle sales taxes to repair unsafe roads and highways, replace unsafe school buses, and make walk paths to school safer for children. Includes tough audit requirements. Endorsed by California Transit Association, Lung Association, Nurses Association, Safe Kids Network, firefighters, and Police Chief Arturo Venegas.  Con In a time of continuing budget deficits, Proposition 51 adds $1 billion to the deficit every year for special interest projects. It gives your tax dollars to campaign contributors, not California's priorities. Don't force cuts in vital services or require tax increases. Vote NO ON 51!

Voter Fraud Penalties. Initiative Statute.  Put on the Ballot by Petition Signatures  Summary Allows legally eligible persons to register to vote on election day. Increases criminal penalties for voter and voter registration fraud. Criminalizes conspiracy to commit voter fraud. Fiscal Impact: Annual state costs of about $6 million to fund counties for election day voter registration activities. No anticipated net county costs. Minor state administrative costs and unknown, but probably minor, state costs to enforce new election fraud offense.  VOTE! Tuesday, November 5, 2002  What Your Vote Means Yes A YES vote on this measure means: Eligible citizens could register to vote up to and including election day. Penalties would be increased for fraudulent registration or voting activity, and a new crime of conspiracy to commit election fraud would be created.  No A NO vote on this measure means: Eligible citizens could not register to vote up to and including election day. Current law would remain in place requiring citizens to register to vote at least 15 days before an election. Penalties would not be increased for fraudulent registration or voting activity, and a new crime of conspiracy to commit election fraud would not be created.  Arguments Pro Proposition 52 allows eligible Californians to register and vote on election day at their polling place after showing a drivers license or two forms of valid ID. It will increase voter turnout while increasing penalties for voter fraud. Join the League of Women Voters of California and vote Yes.  Con District Attorneys and Sheriffs say ""NO on 52""! Prop. 52 makes it easy for CRIMINALS and NONCITIZENS to vote without providing official ID to prove who they are. That's not fair to citizens who are properly registered.

Whenever a bond measure is on a statewide ballot, an overview of California's bond debt is included in the ballot pamphlet.  Initiatives Often referred to as ""direct democracy,"" the initiative process is the power of the people to place measures on the ballot. These measures can either create or change statutes (including general obligation bonds) and amend the California Constitution. If the initiative proposes to amend California statute, signatures of registered voters gathered must equal in number to 5% of the votes cast for all candidates for Governor in the previous gubernatorial election. If the initiative proposes to amend the California Constitution, signatures of registered voters gathered must equal in number to 8% of the votes cast for all candidates for Governor in the previous gubernatorial election. An initiative requires a simple majority of the public's vote to be enacted.  Legislative Constitutional Amendment Whenever the Legislature proposes an amendment to the California Constitution, it is known as a legislative constitutional amendment. It must be adopted in the Senate and the Assembly by a two-thirds vote before it can be placed on the ballot. A legislative constitutional amendment does not require the Governor's signature. This type of amendment requires a simple majority of the public's vote to be enacted.  Referendum Referendum is the power of the people to approve or reject statutes adopted by the Legislature. However, referenda can not be used to approve or reject urgency measures or statutes that call for elections or provide for tax levies or appropriations for current expenses of the state. Voters wishing to block implementation of a legislatively-adopted statute must gather signatures of registered voters equal in number to 5% of the votes cast for all candidates for Governor in the previous gubernatorial election within 90 days of enactment of the bill. Once on the ballot, the law is defeated if voters cast more NO votes than YES votes on the referendum question.  Legislative Initiative Amendment Whenever the Legislature proposes to amend a law that was previously enacted through the initiative process, the Legislature is required to present the amendment to the voters for passage. The Legislature may amend the previously-adopted initiative measure if the measure permits legislative amendment or repeal without voter approval. This type of amendment requires a simple majority of the public's vote to be enacted.  3   PROPOSITION  Section Title  46 46  Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2002.  Official Title and Summ ary Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2002.  Prepared by the Attorney General  Creates trust fund to: provide shelters for battered women; clean and safe housing for low-income senior citizens; emergency shelters for homeless families with children; housing with social services for homeless and mentally ill; repairs/accessibility improvements to apartments for families and handicapped citizens; military veteran homeownership assistance; and security improvements/repairs to existing emergency shelters.  Funded by bond issue of two billion one hundred million dollars ($2,100,000,000). Makes cities and counties eligible to receive specified funds.  Subjects expenditures to independent audit. Appropriates money from state General Fund to repay bonds. Summary of Legislative Analyst's Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact:  State cost of about $4.7 billion over 30 years to pay off both the principal ($2.1 billion) and interest ($2.6 billion) costs on the bonds. Payments of about $157 million per year.  Final Votes Cast by the Legislature on SB 1227 (Proposition 46) Assembly: Senate: Ayes 54 Ayes 27 Noes 21 Noes 11  Analysis by the Legisl ative Analyst Background About 150,000 houses and apartments are built in California each year. Most of these units are built entirely with private dollars. Some, however, receive subsidies from federal, state, and local governments. For some of the units that receive state funds, the state provides low-interest loans or grants to developers (private, nonprofit, and local governments). Typically, there is a requirement that the housing built be sold or rented to Californians with low incomes. Other state programs provide homebuyers with direct financial assistance to help with the costs of a down payment. The amount of funds that the state has provided to these types of housing programs has varied considerably over time. In 1988 and 1990, voters approved a total of $600 million of general obligation bonds to fund state housing programs (these funds have been spent). Since that time, the state typically has spent less than $20 million annually in General Fund revenues on state housing programs. On a one-time basis, however, the state recently provided more than $350 million in General Fund revenues for these purposes. bonds are backed by the state, meaning that the state is required to pay the principal and interest on these bonds. General Fund revenues would be used to pay these costs over about 30 years. Figure 1 describes the programs and the amount of funding that each would receive under the measure. Most of the funds would go to existing state housing programs. A number of the programs, however, are new, with details to be established by subsequent legislation. The major allocations of the bond proceeds are as follows:  Multifamily Housing Programs ($1.11 Billion). This measure would fund a variety of housing programs aimed at the construction of rental housing projects, such as apartment buildings. These programs generally provide local governments, nonprofit organizations, and private developers with low-interest (3 percent) loans to fund part of the construction cost. In exchange, a project must reserve a portion of its units for lowincome households for a period of 55 years. This measure gives funding priority to projects in already developed areas and near existing public services (such as public transportation).  Homeownership Programs ($405 Million). A number of the programs funded by this measure would encourage homeownership for low- and moderate-income homebuyers. Most of the funds would be used to provide down payment  Proposal This measure allows the state to sell $2.1 billion of general obligation bonds to fund 21 housing programs. General obligation  4  Title and Summary/Analysis   PROP  Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2002.  46  Analysis by the Legisl ative Analyst assistance to homebuyers through low-interest loans or grants. Typically, eligibility for this assistance would be based on the household's income, the cost of the home being purchased, and whether it is the household's first home purchase.  Farmworker Housing ($200 Million). These funds would be used to provide loans and grants to the developers of housing for farmworkers. Program funds would be used for both rental and owner-occupied housing.  Other Programs ($385 Million). Additional funds would be allocated for the construction of homeless shelters, payments to cities and counties based on their approval of housing units, provision of mortgage insurance for high-risk homebuyers, and capital needs of local code enforcement departments. Most of the program funds probably would be allocated over a three- to five-year period. For many of the programs, the measure limits the length of time available for the funds to be spent. If after a specified length of time--between 18 and 48 months--a program's funds are unspent, they would be reallocated to a different housing program. The measure provides the Legislature broad authority to make future changes to the programs funded by the measure. The measure also requires the State Auditor to perform periodic audits of the agencies administering the funds and the recipients of the funds. Impact of Funds. The funds from this measure typically would be used together with other government monies to provide housing assistance. In total, the bond funds would provide annual subsidies for about 25,000 multifamily and 10,000 farmworker households. The funds would also provide down payment assistance to about 60,000 homebuyers and help provide space for 30,000 homeless shelter beds. Figure 1  (cont.)

The cost of these bonds would depend on their interest rates and the time period over which they are repaid. Generally, the interest on bonds issued by the state is exempt from both state and federal income taxes--lowering the payment amounts for the state. Historically, the type of bonds proposed by this measure have not received the federal tax exemption-- resulting in a higher interest rate for the bonds. If the bonds were sold at an average interest rate of 6.25 percent (the current rate for this type of bond) and repaid over 30 years, the cost would be about $4.7 billion to pay off both the principal ($2.1 billion) and interest ($2.6 billion). The average payment would be about $157 million per year. Administrative Costs. Several agencies would experience increased costs to administer the various housing programs funded by this measure. Under existing law, a portion of the programs' allocations from the bond funds--up to about $100 million--could be used for these administrative costs. The measure also authorizes some recipients to be charged for administrative costs, thus increasing funds available for this purpose.  50.0 25.0 $405.0  Other Programs Emergency Housing Assistance Jobs-Housing Improvementa Housing Loan Insurance Code Enforcement Grants for the construction of homeless shelters.

ARGUMENT in Favor of Proposition 46 YES on Proposition 46 will provide emergency shelters for battered women, affordable housing for seniors and lowincome families, and shelters with social services for the homeless. That is why the Congress of California Seniors, the League of Women Voters of California, and the Association to Aid Victims of Domestic Violence strongly urge a YES vote on Proposition 46. Importantly, this bond measure will be funded out of existing state resources without raising taxes. In our communities, the problems of housing affordability, homelessness, and domestic violence have gotten progressively worse. According to the State Department of Housing, over 360,000 Californians are homeless and the numbers are rising. Last year, 23,000 women and children were turned away from domestic violence shelters because they were full. Housing affordability for working families in California is at historic lows. Safe shelter is fundamental to a decent life. YES on Proposition 46 will:  Double the number of emergency shelter beds.  Expand the number of shelter beds for battered women.  Provide security improvements and repairs to existing shelters.  Provide clean and safe housing for senior citizens and low-income families. Additionally, Proposition 46 provides affordable housing for working people, accessibility improvements to apartments for disabled Californians, and loan assistance for military veterans, teachers, police and firefighters. Proposition 46 also creates 276,000 jobs and helps improve the state's economy. Allows Seniors to Live Independently: ""This measure allows seniors to live in an apartment or home without the fear of being institutionalized in a nursing home. We strongly urge a YES on 46.""--Congress of California Seniors Helps Battered Women: ""Most cities in California don't have adequate shelters for women and children who have been beaten and abused. Proposition 46 begins to fix this bad situation.""--Statewide California Coalition for Battered Women and California State Sheriffs Association Keeps Kids in School: ""Proposition 46 provides shelter for thousands of homeless children, allowing them to attend neighborhood schools without having to worry about a roof over their head.""--California Teachers Association Independent Audits and Accountability: ""This measure requires independent audits and contains strict accountability provisions to ensure the funds are used as promised. Every city and county will be eligible to receive housing funds.""--California Chamber of Commerce Loan Assistance for Veterans: ""Our veterans have protected American interests at home and around the world. This measure makes available low-interest loans so they can purchase their first home.""--Vietnam Veterans of California, Inc. Critical Need For Housing and Emergency Shelters: ""Proposition 46 provides shelter for those who need help the most--battered women, homeless mothers with children and disabled seniors.""--Habitat For Humanity, Orange County Yes on 46 provides emergency shelter and housing relief without raising taxes. It will help the 23,000 women and children turned away from domestic violence centers because they were full. It requires independent audits to ensure the funds are spent correctly. We urge you to vote YES on Proposition 46. Visit our website prop46yes.org. PETE MAJOR, Executive Director Habitat For Humanity, Orange County BARBARA INATSUGU, President League of Women Voters of California DR. KATHIE MATHIS, Executive Director Association to Aid Victims of Domestic Violence  46  REBUTTAL to Argument in Favor of Proposition 46  Supporters say the interest--hundreds of millions of dollars annually--for this bond can be paid out of existing resources. WHAT EXISTING RESOURCES? California faces multi-billion dollar deficits as far as the eye can see. The reality is, we are going to have to cut programs or raise taxes, or both, to pay back this bond.  Supporters claim this bond will support battered women's shelters. But there is NO GUARANTEE that passing this bond will provide ONE SINGLE BED for a battered woman or her child. There's no mention of battered women's shelters in this bond, IT IS SIMPLY A POLITICAL PLOY. Those shelters will have to compete with everyone else in the same bureaucratic process!  Supporters also say this bond will help provide affordable housing. But areas with the most critical housing shortages in our state--places like suburbs of Los Angeles, San Diego, and the Bay Area-- won't qualify for these monies because the bond is written to favor urban downtowns. Proposition 46 is a classic government boondoggle. Higher fees, taxes, and strict regulations have made housing unaffordable in California. Now the same folks who created the problem want you to let them ""solve"" it, using YOUR TAX DOLLARS! It is time for us to attack the real problem, not just to subsidize a failing, costly system. Proposition 46 is no solution. We encourage you to vote NO.

They all collapse when they have too much debt. California is already on the brink of bankruptcy and now is not the time to be going further into debt. Passing bonds only adds to the state's debts. Here is a snapshot of California's current situation:  A $24 billion budget deficit this year.  $26.9 billion in current general obligation bonds outstanding.  $11 billion in energy bonds that have yet to be sold.  A $13 billion school bond on this ballot. In the past two years, California has borrowed or approved more than $12.9 billion in 27 different bonds. Paying it back, however, will cost you a whole lot more. Bonds are the government's equivalent of a high-interest credit card. Government borrows money and then taxpayers pay back that debt, meaning increased taxes, rates and fees. Even worse, your children will be paying off this bond long after the money has been spent. With every pile of debt California takes on, our credit rating drops, and our interest rates go up--forcing you to pay even more for government's mistakes and whims. So why is this particular housing bond not a good idea? Unfortunately it does little to truly address housing issues in California. This bond has a $2.1 billion face value. It will cost you at least $3.5 billion to pay it off. Of this $2.1 billion, only $290 million, about 15%, is put into the ""Self-Help"" fund that is supposed to help low-income, first-time homebuyers with down payments, supposedly a major selling point for this bond. Of that, only $12.5 million is actually going to be used to help with down payments. To make matters worse, to get a part of the $12.5 million (one half of one percent of the bond) first-time homebuyers have to purchase their houses in government approved locations. None of these areas are the high-income areas where it is so hard to purchase a home. This program only applies to major urban centers and many of the least desirable places to live and raise children. So-- the very small piece of this bond that is supposed to help you buy a house has so many strings that you will probably never qualify. If we want to improve housing availability in California, we first need to make it easier to construct new homes. We need to reduce the red tape that homebuilders have to go through to build new housing and make it easier to build condominiums. This bond does NOTHING to address the barriers that exist to providing affordable, abundant housing in California. Sacramento politicians hope you will overlook their fiscal mismanagement and allow California to go further into debt without forcing them to confront the true reasons we do not have adequate housing. Do not allow this. Vote no and force Sacramento to set priorities and address this crisis in a responsible way. SENATOR RAY HAYNES, Chair State Senate Constitutional Amendments Committee ASSEMBLYMAN ANTHONY PESCETTI, Vice-Chair Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee JON COUPAL, President Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association  REBUTTAL to Argument Against Proposition 46 Our opponents want you to believe that the solution to our emergency shelter and affordable housing problem for seniors, low-income families and battered women is to ignore the problem while the cost and consequences get even more severe. Let's set the record straight: Proposition 46 will NOT require a tax increase and will be paid for by existing state funds. Additionally, taxpayers are protected by independent audits to ensure that the programs are carried out as promised. The emergency shelter and affordable housing problems are getting worse. ""Last year, 23,000 women and children were turned away from domestic violence centers due to inadequate space. More and more senior citizens are homeless or forced into nursing homes, because they cannot afford rent increases. Our homeless shelters are overflowing and most don't have special facilities for families with children.""--Dallas Jones, Director, California Office of Emergency Services We represent a broad cross section of Californians who believe that Proposition 46 is a prudent and measured response to an emergency shelter and affordable housing situation that is in crisis. That is why Proposition 46 is endorsed by these diverse groups:  AARP  California State Sheriffs Association  California Chamber of Commerce  League of Women Voters of California  Statewide California Coalition for Battered Women  California Nurses Association  California Teachers Association  California Professional Firefighters  Congress of California Seniors Proposition 46 provides shelter for our most vulnerable Californians: the elderly, disabled, homeless families, battered women and children. Please vote YES on 46.

Official Title and Summ ary 47 8  Prepared by the Attor ney General  KindergartenUniversity Public Education Facilities Bond Act of 2002. This act provides for a bond issue of thirteen billion fifty million dollars ($13,050,000,000) to fund necessary education facilities to relieve overcrowding and to repair older schools.  Funds will be targeted to areas of greatest need and must be spent according to strict accountability measures.  Funds will also be used to upgrade and build new classrooms in the California Community Colleges, the California State University, and the University of California, to provide adequate higher education facilities to accommodate growing student enrollment. Appropriates money from state General Fund to pay off bonds. Summary of Legislative Analyst's Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact:  State cost of about $26.2 billion over 30 years to pay off both the principal ($13.05 billion) and interest ($13.15 billion) costs on the bonds. Payments of about $873 million per year.  Final Votes Cast by the Legislature on AB 16 (Proposition 47) Assembly: Senate: Ayes 71 Ayes 27 Noes 8 Noes 11  Title and Summary   PROP  KindergartenUniversity Public Education Facilities Bond Act of 2002.  47  Analysis by the Legisl ative Analyst Background Public education in California consists of two distinct systems. One system includes local school districts that provide elementary and secondary (kindergarten through 12th grade, or ""K12"") education to about 6.1 million pupils. The other system (commonly referred to as ""higher education"") includes local community colleges, the California State University (CSU), and the University of California (UC). The three segments of higher education provide education programs beyond the 12th grade to about 2.3 million students. K12 Schools School Facilities Funding. The K12 schools receive funding for construction and renovation of facilities from two main sources--the state and local general obligation bonds.  State Funding. The state, through the School Facility Program (SFP), provides money for school districts to buy land and to construct, renovate, and modernize K12 school buildings. Districts receive funding for construction and renovation based on the number of pupils who meet the eligibility criteria of the program. The cost of school construction projects is shared between the state and local school districts. The state pays 50 percent of the cost of new construction projects and 60 percent of the cost for approved modernization projects. (Local matches are not necessary in so-called ""hardship"" cases.) The state has funded the SFP by issuing general obligation bonds. Over the past decade, voters have approved a total of $11.5 billion in state bonds for K12 school construction. About $550 million of these funds remain available for expenditure.  Local General Obligation Bonds. School districts are authorized to sell general obligation bonds to finance school construction projects with the approval of 55 percent of the voters in the district. These bonds are paid off by taxes on real property located within the district. Over the last ten years, school districts have received voter approval to issue more than $23 billion of general obligation bonds. Although school facilities have been funded primarily from state and local general obligation bonds, school districts also receive significant funds from:  Developer Fees. State law authorizes local governments to impose developer fees on new construction. These fees are levied on new residential, commercial, and industrial developments. Statewide, school districts report having received an For text of Proposition 47 see page 68.  average of over $300 million a year in developer fees over the last ten years.  Special Local Bonds (Known as ""Mello-Roos"" Bonds). School districts may form special districts in order to sell bonds for school construction projects. (These special districts generally do not encompass the entire school district.) The bonds, which require two-thirds voter approval, are paid off by charges assessed to property owners in the special district. Statewide, school districts have received on average about $150 million a year in special local bond proceeds over the past decade. K12 School Building Needs. Under the SFP, K12 school districts must demonstrate the need for new or modernized facilities. Through May 2002, the districts have identified a need to construct new schools to house 1.2 million pupils and modernize schools for an additional 1.2 million pupils. We estimate the state cost to address all of these needs to be roughly $20 billion. Higher Education California's system of public higher education includes 140 campuses in the three segments listed below, serving about 2.3 million students:  The California Community Colleges provide instruction to 1.7 million students at 108 campuses operated by 72 locally governed districts throughout the state. The community colleges grant associate degrees and also offer a variety of vocational skill courses.  The CSU system has 23 campuses, with an enrollment of about 395,000 students. The system grants bachelor and master degrees, and a small number of joint doctoral degrees with UC. The UC has eight general campuses and one health sciences campus with a total enrollment of about 184,000 students. This system offers bachelor, master, and doctoral degrees, and is the primary statesupported agency for research. Over the past decade, the voters have approved nearly $4.4 billion in general obligation bonds for capital improvements at public higher education campuses. The state also has provided almost $1.5 billion in lease revenue bonds for this same purpose. In addition to these state bonds, the higher education segments have other sources of funding for capital projects.  Local General Obligation Bonds. Community college districts are authorized to sell general Analysis  9  47   PROP  47  KindergartenUniversity Public Education Facilities Bond Act of 2002.  Analysis by the Legisl ative Analyst obligation bonds to finance school construction projects with the approval of 55 percent of the voters in the district. These bonds are paid off by taxes on real property located within the district. Over the last decade, community college districts have received local voter approval to issue about $5 billion of bonds for construction and renovation of facilities.  Gifts and Grants. The CSU and UC in recent years together have received on average over $100 million annually in gifts and grants for construction of facilities.  UC Research Revenue. The UC finances the construction of new research facilities by selling bonds and pledging future research revenue for their repayment. Currently, UC uses about $125 million a year of research revenue to pay off these bonds. Higher Education Building Plans. Each year the institutions of higher education prepare capital outlay plans in which they identify project priorities over the next few years. Higher education capital outlay projects in the most recent plans total $4.4 billion for the period 200304 through 200607. Figure 1  (cOnt.)

Proposal This measure allows the state to issue $13.05 billion of general obligation bonds for construction and renovation of K12 school facilities ($11.4 billion) and higher education facilities ($1.65 billion). General obligation bonds are backed by the state, meaning that the state is obligated to pay the principal and interest costs on these bonds. General Fund revenues would be used to pay these costs. These revenues come primarily from state income and sales taxes. Figure 1 shows how these bond funds would be allocated to K12 and higher education. K12 School Facilities Figure 1 describes generally how the $11.4 billion for K12 school projects would be allocated. However, the measure would permit changes in this allocation with the approval of the Legislature and Governor. New Construction. A total of $6.35 billion would be available to buy land and construct new school buildings. Of this amount, $2.9 billion would be set aside for ""backlog"" projects--that is, projects for which districts had submitted applications on or before February 1, 2002, but that have not yet been funded. The remaining funds--$3.45 billion--would be available for new construction projects submitted after February 1, 2002. Districts would be required to pay for 10 Analysis  50 percent of costs with local resources. The measure also provides that up to $100 million of the $3.45 billion in new construction funds is available for charter school facilities. (Charter schools are public schools that operate independently of many of the requirements of regular public schools.) Modernization. The proposition makes $3.3 billion available for the reconstruction or modernization of existing school facilities. Of this amount, $1.9 billion would be available for backlog projects and $1.4 billion for new proposals. Districts would be required to pay 40 percent of project costs from local resources. Critically Overcrowded Schools. This proposition directs a total of $1.7 billion to districts with schools which are considered critically overcrowded. These funds would go to schools that have a large number of pupils relative to the size of the school site. Joint-Use Projects. The measure makes a total of $50 million available to fund joint-use projects. (An example of a joint-use project is a facility constructed for use by both a K12 school district and a local library district.) Higher Education Facilities The measure includes $1.65 billion to construct new buildings and related infrastructure, alter existing buildings, and purchase equipment for use in these buildings for California's public higher education For text of Proposition 47 see page 68.   KindergartenUniversity Public Education Facilities Bond Act of 2002  PROP  47  Analysis by the Legisl ative Analyst systems. The Governor and the Legislature would select the specific projects to be funded by the bond monies. Related Bond Funding. The legislation which placed this proposition on the ballot provides $651.3 million in lease revenue bonds to fund specific projects. Lease revenue bonds are similar to state general obligation bonds except they do not require voter approval and are not backed by the full faith and credit of the state. This would fund $279 million for UC (7 projects), $191.3 million for CSU (4 projects), $170.5 million for the community colleges (11 projects), and $10.5 million for the California State Library (1 project). Future Education Bond Act The legislation which placed this proposition on the ballot authorizes a $12.3 billion bond measure to be placed on the 2004 primary election ballot. (If the voters do not approve this measure, the same bond  (cOnt.)  issue would be placed on the November 2004 ballot.) The bond measure would provide:  $10 billion for K12 school facilities (with roughly half for new construction and a fourth each for modernization and critically overcrowded schools).  $2.3 billion for higher education (with $920 million for community colleges and $690 million each for UC and CSU). Fiscal Effect The cost of these bonds would depend on their interest rates and the time period over which they are repaid. If the $13.05 billion in bonds authorized by this proposition are sold at an interest rate of 5.25 percent (the current rate for this type of bond) and repaid over 30 years, the cost over the period would be about $26.2 billion to pay off both the principal ($13.05 billion) and interest ($13.15 billion). The average payment for principal and interest would be about $873 million per year.  For text of Proposition 47 see page 68.  Analysis  11  47   PROP  47  KindergartenUniversity Public Education Facilities Bond Act of 2002.  ARGUMENT in Favor of Proposition 47 California's public schools used to be among the best in the nation. But years of neglect and inadequate funding have taken their toll. Students can't learn and teachers can't teach in overcrowded and rundown classrooms. Proposition 47 will help fix our schools...and help our students succeed. PARENTS SUPPORT Proposition 47 because it BUILDS NEW SCHOOLS. Prop. 47:  BUILDS THE NEW SCHOOLS we need for the hundreds of thousands of new students entering California classrooms in the coming years.  BUILDS NEW CLASSROOMS to keep class sizes small. Our kids can't learn with 45 kids in their class! LOCAL TEACHERS SUPPORT Proposition 47 because it REPAIRS AND RENOVATES OLD AND OUTDATED SCHOOLS. Prop. 47:  FIXES LEAKY ROOFS, REPAIRS BATHROOMS that don't work and PUTS HEATING AND AIR CONDITIONING in our classrooms.  GUARANTEES that our kids go to school in SAFE BUILDINGS THAT MEET EARTHQUAKE AND FIRE STANDARDS. PARENTS AND TEACHERS SUPPORT Proposition 47 because it MAKES SURE THE MONEY IS SPENT WHERE IT IS NEEDED MOST. Prop. 47:  GUARANTEES that new schools will be built where classes are already severely overcrowded.  MAKES SURE that new and growing communities get their fair share of the funds to build the schools they need. The CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE and the LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA SUPPORT Proposition 47 because it INVESTS IN THE FUTURE OF OUR ECONOMY AND OUR WORKFORCE. Prop. 47:  Provides money to WIRE OUR CLASSROOMS for the technology and computers our kids need to compete in college or career.  Gives our students ACCESS TO the right TECHNOLOGY today to be prepared for the workforce and society of tomorrow. The CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS' ASSOCIATION SUPPORTS Proposition 47 because it PROTECTS TAXPAYERS AND SENIORS by holding schools accountable for how they spend our hard-earned dollars. Prop. 47:  PROVIDES for AUDITS, COST CONTROLS and other ACCOUNTABILITY requirements to guard against waste and mismanagement.  ASSURES that taxpayer funds CANNOT BE SPENT ON BUREAUCRACY or wasteful overhead--funds can only be spent to build or renovate schools. The CALIFORNIA BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE SUPPORTS Proposition 47 because it also provides funds for California's colleges and universities. Prop. 47:  BUILDS NEW COLLEGE CLASSROOMS to accommodate the tens of thousands of new students who will enter our campuses in the next few years.  Upgrades aging college laboratories, libraries and research facilities so that they can continue to pave the way for NEW TECHNOLOGIES and INDUSTRIES. Proposition 47 will provide $13 billion for school construction and renovation for our public schools, colleges and universities-- WITHOUT RAISING YOUR TAXES. CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS ARE TURNING THE CORNER. Test scores are up and more students are meeting high standards. BUT THERE IS STILL MUCH MORE WE CAN DO. Join Republicans, Democrats and Independents--taxpayers and business leaders--the California Teachers Association and the California State PTA--seniors and women's groups and millions of Californians who all support our schools. Invest in California's children and California's future. VOTE YES on PROPOSITION 47. ALLAN ZAREMBERG, President California Chamber of Commerce JAN HARP DOMENE, President California State PTA (PTA) LARRY MCCARTHY, President California Taxpayers' Association (CAL TAX)  47  REBUTTAL to Argument in Favor of Proposition 47 Recently, a group of 30 Taxpayer Organizations from various parts of the State held a convention under the name California Taxpayers Coalition and unanimously voted to oppose Proposition 47 for one main reason--California currently has too much debt on the books. As California voting taxpayers, we must come to grips with the massive amount of debt we're all on the hook for. Since 1985, California and its political subdivisions have sold over $500,000,000,000 in various debt instruments. That's $500 billion in debt! (For a complete list, go to www.peoplesadvocate.org) It's time for California voters to put a stop to this bondselling binge. Vote ""No"" on Proposition 47, and send Governor Davis and his cronies in the Legislature a real message. Neither the Governor, the Treasurer, nor the Controller can tell us how much debt we currently have or how much of our tax money goes toward the interest school districts, cities, and counties pay each year. They simply don't keep those kinds of records. This is far worse than the Enron or WorldCom scandals. Both Moody's and Standard and Poor's have downgraded California's credit rating as a result of the erosion of the State's fiscal health. California's credit rating matters. Furthermore, it's outrageous that our Governor, Treasurer, or Controller can't tell us how much outstanding debt we have in California. As taxpayers, we should not approve any new debt until our Governor tells us exactly how much debt we currently have on the books. Vote ""No"" on Proposition 47. EDWARD J. (TED) COSTA, Chairman California Taxpayers Coalition RALPH MORRELL, President Northern California Committee for Limited Government KEN STEADMAN, President Waste Watchers, Inc.  12  Arguments  Arguments printed on this page are the opinions of the authors and have not been checked for accuracy by any official agency.   PROP  KindergartenUniversity Public Education Facilities Bond Act of 2002.  47  ARGUMENT Against Proposition 47 California currently has tens of billions of dollars in outstanding bonds that we are paying interest on. Because we've passed so many bonds in recent years, California has been assigned the third lowest credit rating in the country. As such, we should be extremely careful whenever we consider taking on more debt. There is no doubt that the school facilities shortage in our state is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. But Proposition 47 is the wrong solution. This bond is poorly written and patently unfair. Prop 47 does not encourage immediate school construction. In fact, under this new scheme, the schools with the neediest kids aren't even obligated to begin building a single school for 6 1/2 years. School districts can reserve bond money by simply stating an ""intent"" to build a school in a general location. They don't need to have plans drawn up, complete an environmental impact study, or even identify an approvable site. Schools built with the bond funds made available in 2004 would not have to break ground until 2011! In short, Prop 47 will allow these districts to tie up money while other ready-to-build sites go unfunded and projects are delayed. Additionally, Prop 47 favors the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) over every other district in the state. According to numbers from the Office of Public School Construction, LAUSD is eligible for over 24% of the new construction funds, even though it accounts for only 12% of the state's student population. Tax dollars from across the state shouldn't be used to service a bond that so heavily favors a single school district. Say ""No"" to LAUSD's greed. Vote ""No"" on Prop 47. WM. J. ""PETE"" KNIGHT, Senator 17th District, California State Senate JON COUPAL, President Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association LEWIS K. UHLER, President National Tax Limitation Committee  REBUTTAL to Argument Against Proposition 47 The opponents are right about one thing: CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS are CRITICALLY OVERCROWDED. We need more than 13,000 NEW CLASSROOMS to ACCOMMODATE NEW STUDENTS and KEEP CLASS SIZE SMALL. Here are some facts the opponents didn't get right: Fact: Every CRITICALLY OVERCROWDED district is eligible only for its FAIR SHARE of Prop. 47 funds to build new classrooms. Every Central Valley school in line will be funded and no district, in Los Angeles or anywhere else, will get more than its fair share. Fact: CLASSROOM CONSTRUCTION, REPAIR and SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS can BEGIN IMMEDIATELY if Prop. 47 passes. More than 2000 UNFUNDED PROJECTS are WAITING and READY TO BREAK GROUND--new classroom construction, moving kids out of portable trailers, earthquake safety improvements, wiring old classrooms to the Internet, upgrading electrical and fire alarm systems, repairing leaky roofs and installing heating and air conditioning. Fact: California does not have a poor credit rating. On the contrary, the State Treasurer and respected bond rating services report CALIFORNIA'S BOND CREDIT RATING is HEALTHY and STRONG. Fact: The California Taxpayers' Association supports Prop. 47 because school construction projects must comply with STRICT ACCOUNTABILITY requirements, including mandatory AUDITS, to SAFEGUARD AGAINST WASTE and MISMANAGEMENT. Fact: Prop. 47 is part of a state/local partnership. WITHOUT PROP. 47's MATCHING FUNDS, MOST LOCAL SCHOOL BOND PROJECTS CANNOT BE COMPLETED. Our children deserve a safe classroom and the individual attention they need to succeed. Prop. 47 means...MORE CLASSROOMS and BETTER SCHOOLS...WITHOUT RAISING TAXES! VOTE YES on 47!

Under consolidation, the superior court assumes jurisdiction over all matters handled previously by superior and municipal courts; municipal court judges become superior court judges and the municipal courts are abolished. All 58 California counties have since voted to consolidate their trial court operations. At the request of the Legislature, the California Law Revision Commission has made recommendations on repealing statutes that are obsolete because of trial court reforms, including those resulting from court consolidation. California Law Revision Commission related to court consolidation. Specifically, the measure deletes obsolete provisions relating to the creation of municipal courts, eligibility requirements for municipal court judges, and the consolidation of municipal and superior courts. As regards the consolidation of municipal and superior courts, constitutional provisions relating specifically to the transition period will be repealed effective January 1, 2007. Finally, the measure makes conforming changes to the Constitution with respect to the membership of superior court judges on the California Judicial Council and the membership of the Commission on Judicial Performance. The California Judicial Council oversees and administers the trial courts. The Commission on Judicial Performance handles complaints against judges.  Proposal This measure makes technical and conforming changes to the Constitution recommended by the  Fiscal Effects This measure would not result in additional costs to state or local government.

ARGUMENT in Favor of Proposition 48 This is a non-controversial change that updates the California Constitution. It passed each house of the Legislature unanimously. Currently the state Constitution provides for two types of trial courts, superior and municipal courts, in each county. But due to unification of the trial courts, there are no longer any municipal courts in California. However, the California Constitution still contains provisions dealing with municipal courts. These provisions are obsolete and need to be removed. This proposition deletes these obsolete municipal court references from the California Constitution. The proposition implements recommendations of the California Law Revision Commission, which was directed by law to recommend repeal of provisions that have become obsolete because of trial court unification. HOWARD WAYNE, Assembly Member 78th District  48  REBUTTAL to Argument in Favor of Proposition 48 LOST ""CHECKS AND BALANCES"" As we explain in our main ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION 48 on the next page, removing all references in the California Constitution to ""municipal courts"" removes the possibility that the State Legislature or individual counties will ever re-establish a two-tier trial court system with its ""checks and balances."" UN-ELECTED JUDGES Not many years ago, many ""justice court"" and ""municipal court"" judges were elected by districts within counties. Under consolidation, all local judges are elected on a county-wide basis and are seldom challenged. As a result, the incumbents routinely win by default, and their names do not even appear on the ballot. Under consolidation, the local judiciary has become more insular. WHAT KEEPS JUDGES IN LINE? Without the prospect of an election challenge, judges are restricted only by (1) their own integrity and diligence, (2) some chance of reversal by an appellate court in individual cases, (3) the workings or nonworkings of something called the ""Commission on Judicial Performance,"" and (4) if a crime is involved, the vigilance of prosecutors--especially the elected California Attorney General. Based on our experience, we think the vast majority of California trial court judges are great; however, we need a system that makes every trial court judge accountable for following the law. Eliminating any chance of reestablishing municipal courts is a step in the wrong direction. For more information, please see www.VoterInformationAlliance.org. GARY B. WESLEY Attorney at Law MELVIN L.

Legislative Constitutional Amendment.  PROP  48  ARGUMENT Against Proposition 48 In this measure, the State Legislature is proposing that we permanently delete from the California Constitution any provision for ""municipal courts."" The main drawback to the proposal is that it would preclude the re-establishment of municipal courts in any of California's 58 counties. Why might a county want to re-establish a ""municipal court"" below its ""superior court""? One reason might be to save money. Superior Court Judges are paid more. An even more important reason, though, is that some counties (or even the State Legislature sometime in the future) may realize that having all of the trial court judges in a county part of the same ""superior court"" creates at least the appearance of unfairness. Allow us to explain. Trial courts handle two kinds of cases that have been particularly affected by the ""consolidation"" of the municipal and superior courts in the 58 counties. The first kind of case involves a criminal charge lodged by a local or state prosecutor. A criminal charge may be a ""felony"" or a less-serious ""misdemeanor."" Both kinds of criminal charges potentially call for examination of the case by two or more judges. A felony case is initiated by the filing of a charge which is presented either to a local criminal grand jury or, in over 95% of the cases, to a local judge sitting as a ""magistrate."" If the grand jury or magistrate decides that the prosecutor has presented enough evidence of guilt (i.e., probable cause) to justify a trial, the prosecutor is authorized to proceed to trial. At that point, the decision to allow the prosecutor to proceed may be challenged by the accused. Here we encounter a problem created by court consolidation. The judge who will hear the challenge will almost always be a judge in the very same court as the judge whose decision is being challenged! A misdemeanor case is ordinarily set for trial without any hearing to determine whether a trial appears justified. If you are convicted in a misdemeanor trial, you may appeal; however, the appeal is decided by a panel of 3 judges from the very same ""superior court"" in which you would have already been convicted! Finally, a civil case which seeks $25,000 or less is called a ""limited jurisdiction case."" An appeal from a judgment in such a case, once again, is decided by a panel of 3 judges from the very same ""superior court"" in which you would have lost the case! The basis for seeking review of what a judge has done in a case is that the judge ruled or acted wrongly. A one-court system which asks judges of the very same court to correct or rebuke their colleagues creates at least the appearance of unfairness. Separate municipal and superior courts in the counties offered more ""checks and balances"" than the consolidated superior courts which have now been established. Some counties (or the State Legislature) may wish, in the future, to return to the former system. For these reasons, we recommend that voters not permanently delete ""municipal courts"" from the California Constitution. GARY B. WESLEY, Co-Chair Voter Information Alliance (VIA) MELVIN L. EMERICH, Co-Chair Voter Information Alliance (VIA)  REBUTTAL to Argument Against Proposition 48 In 1998 the voters of California overwhelmingly approved Proposition 220 to authorize the elimination of the municipal courts. Municipal courts have been eliminated in every county, for estimated savings of $23,000,000 a year for the taxpayers. What remains to be done is the removal of obsolete language in the state constitution that references the no longer existing municipal courts. Proposition 48 accomplishes that goal. The argument against Proposition 48 ignores what is before the voters. Instead, it argues for the advantages of having municipal courts. The voters already decided that issue four years ago by passing Proposition 220. It was approved because eliminating municipal courts allows more efficient use of judicial resources and eliminates administrative costs necessary to maintain two separate trial court systems. The ONLY issue before us is, should obsolete provisions of the Constitution be eliminated? The answer is clearly YES. Leaving obsolete references to municipal courts on the books would only clutter the law, while serving no useful purpose. Any necessary improvements to the law regarding review of magistrate decisions that there is sufficient evidence to try a defendant for a crime, or for appeals in misdemeanor and smaller civil cases can be made to the existing appeals court system. It should not be accomplished by re-creating another level of courts that the public has already voted to eliminate. Proposition 48 would prune deadwood from the California Constitution. Obsolete language unnecessarily complicates the law. Vote YES on Proposition 48.

Summary of Legislative Analyst's Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact: Additional annual state costs for before and after school programs of up to $455 million, beginning in 200405.  49 18  Title and Summary   PROP  Before and After School Programs. State Grants. Initiative Statute.  49  Analysis by the Legisl ative Analyst Background The state currently funds a before and after school program for pupils in public elementary, middle, and junior high schools. The program (officially known as the Before and After School Learning and Safe Neighborhoods Partnership Program) provides competitive grants for schools to offer educational enrichment and either tutoring or homework assistance before and/or after ""regular"" school hours. The program requires a local match and gives priority to serving pupils from schools with at least 50 percent of pupils eligible for federally subsidized meals. Under existing law, after school grants generally do not exceed $75,000 for elementary schools and $100,000 for middle and junior high schools for each regular school year, and before school grants generally do not exceed $25,000 for elementary schools and $33,000 for middle and junior high schools. However, large schools can receive higher grant amounts. Participating schools are also eligible to receive a supplemental grant to operate a program during summer or other vacation periods. The state spent $95.3 million for the program in 200102. Similar to the state's program, the federal government also provides academic and recreational activities before and after regular school hours to students at many sites in California. The state will receive $41.5 million in federal funds in 200203 to administer and provide new grants to local education agencies and community-based organizations for these activities. Resources Available for Similar Services. In addition to the above before and after school programs, the state and federal governments provide potential sources of funds for before and after school services.  The state provides a total of $475 million annually for supplemental instruction outside the regular classroom (before or after school, summer, or other vacation periods) in order to improve the academic skills of pupils in various subjects.  Both the state and federal government provide a combined $215 million annually for numerous programs that can provide before and after school services such as: (1) after school child care, (2) college outreach programs, (3) mentor programs, and (4) crime prevention activities. Before and after school programs are also offered to students in local communities through many private organizations, religious institutions, and local parks and recreation centers. Many students also participate in extracurricular activities, including school sports, after regular school hours.  Proposal This proposition makes various funding changes to the state's Before and After School Learning and Safe Neighborhoods Partnership Program. The measure also renames the program to the After School Education and Safety Program (funds would still be available for before school programs) and makes other technical programmatic changes. Funding Provisions The measure's funding changes are summarized below. Increased Before and After School Funding. Under Proposition 98, approved by the voters in 1988, the State Constitution requires appropriation of a minimum annual amount for public schools and community colleges (K14 education) from the state General Fund and local property tax revenues. Generally, this annual amount is based on prior-year spending adjusted for growth in the number of students attending public schools and growth in the state's economy. Beginning in 200405, this measure requires a specific spending level each year for the renamed After School Education and Safety Program. The annual amount would be up to $550 million, and would depend on the growth in General Fund spending outside of Proposition 98. The measure specifies that funding for the program would be ""continuously appropriated"" (that is, appropriated automatically each year without further legislative action) and that the statutes authorizing the continuous appropriation may not be amended by the Legislature. New Funding Priorities Within Before and After School Program. Beginning in fiscal year 200405, the measure establishes new funding priorities. First, schools that received a state before or after school grant in 200304 would continue to receive an equivalent grant amount in 200405  For text of Proposition 49 see page 73.  Analysis  19  49   PROP  49  Before and After School Programs. State Grants. Initiative Statute.  Analysis by the Legisl ative Analyst and each subsequent year. The second priority under the measure is to make every elementary, middle, and junior high school eligible to receive a new After School Education and Safety Universal Grant to operate after school programs during the regular school year. However, if available funding were insufficient to provide after school funding to all schools, priority for the new grants would be consistent with current law, targeting schools with at least 50 percent of its pupils eligible for federally subsidized meals. If the first and second priorities are fully funded, any additional funds would be distributed for both before and after school programs based on current priorities and funding rules. The measure allows schools receiving a grant under the first two priorities to apply for these additional funds. Funding Rules for New After School Universal Grants. Under this measure, schools awarded a universal after school grant would be reimbursed up to $5 per participating pupil per day. This funding rate is the same as the after school component of the current state program. However, the measure caps the new universal grants at lower amounts-- $50,000 for elementary schools and $75,000 for middle and junior high schools--for each regular school year. In addition, these grant amounts would not be adjusted upward for large schools. As with existing law, schools receiving a grant would need $1 in local matching funds for each $2 of universal grant funds. Funds for Training, Evaluation, and State Administration. Beginning in 200405, this measure allows the State Department of Education (SDE) to spend up to 1.5 percent of the funds for the After School Education and Safety Program on program evaluations and training, and support for program implementation and development. The department may also use program funds to cover the costs of awarding and monitoring program grants. Program Provisions With regard to programmatic changes, the proposition:  Provides flexibility to conduct before and after school programs away from school sites, but requires that offsite locations be approved by SDE.  Adds computer training as an additional subject area for permissible tutoring or homework assistance and adds fine arts and physical fitness activities as types of permissible activities for educational enrichment.  (cOnt.)   Requires local law enforcement agencies to be included in the planning process of every program.  Directs SDE to annually notify all schools of the availability of before and after school grants.  Fiscal Effects Impact on Before and After School Spending. Based on the measure's funding formula and our projections of future state spending, we estimate that the maximum amount required by the proposition--$550 million--would be available in 200405 for the After School Education and Safety Program. (The Legislature could appropriate additional funds above this amount at its discretion.) This is about $455 million above the program's funding level in 200102. (The actual level of future funding for this program absent this measure would depend on future legislative action.) Impact on Overall State Spending. While the measure would increase spending on before and after school programs, its overall impact on state spending would range from no additional cost to $455 million beginning in 200405. The actual impact would depend on future legislative actions, as follows:  Allocate Funds Within Proposition 98 Minimum Guarantee. If the Legislature were to increase funding for the After School Education and Safety Program in 200304 (the year prior to the effective date of the measure's funding requirements), the additional funding could come from available funds allocated within the Proposition 98 minimum funding guarantee. (Since the guarantee generally grows faster than enrollment growth and increases in cost of living, additional funding could be provided for this program without affecting existing programs.) By providing some or all of the required program expansion in 200304, the state could reduce-- or even eliminate--additional costs in 200405 and each subsequent year. Under this scenario, additional funds would be awarded to schools in 200304 based on priorities and funding rules set by the Legislature.  Allocate Funds Above Proposition 98 Minimum Guarantee. If, on the other hand, additional funds were provided to the program in 200405 (the first year of the measure's funding requirements), these funds would be on top of the state's minimum funding requirement for  49  20  Analysis  For text of Proposition 49 see page 73.   Before and After School Programs. State Grants. Initiative Statute.  PROP  49  Analysis by the Legisl ative Analyst Proposition 98 for that year. In effect, this would cause the state to ""over-appropriate"" Proposition 98's minimum requirement. This would result in a permanent increase in the annual level of state appropriations for K14 education and make less money available for other General Fund supported programs. The additional funds provided to the program in 200405--which could be as much as $455 million--would be awarded to schools  (cOnt.)  based on the funding priorities established by this proposition. These additional funds would first be used to provide schools with a universal after school grant. Administrative Costs. We estimate that the amount of funds needed from the $550 million appropriation for SDE to provide technical assistance, evaluation, and state administration would total in the low millions of dollars annually.  For text of Proposition 49 see page 73.  Analysis  21  49   PROP  49  Before and After School Programs. State Grants. Initiative Statute.  ARGUMENT in Favor of Proposition 49 Proposition 49 will:  Make our neighborhoods safe  Give our children a safe, educational, and recreational place to go after school  Save taxpayers money  Help working families Proposition 49 is funded out of future growth in state revenues, but only after our economy has recovered. IT WILL NOT REQUIRE AN INCREASE IN TAXES OR AFFECT THE CURRENT BUDGET. The prestigious Rose Institute says Proposition 49 saves society approximately $9 for every $1 invested. THE RETURN TO TAXPAYERS ALONE IS APPROXIMATELY 3 DOLLARS FOR EVERY 1 TAX DOLLAR INVESTED. That's why it's endorsed by taxpayer watchdog groups such as the California Taxpayers' Association, the National Tax Limitation Committee and the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association. Proposition 49 provides over $400 million in direct grants to elementary and junior high schools. These funds can ONLY be used for after school programs. Recent studies of existing after school programs by major universities and think tanks such as UCLA, UC Irvine, USC, and the Rand Institute are unanimous--after school programs change lives by improving grades and reducing crime. POLICE STATISTICS SHOW THAT VIOLENT JUVENILE CRIME--HOMICIDE, RAPE, ROBBERY, AND ASSAULT-- INCREASES DRAMATICALLY DURING THE AFTER SCHOOL HOURS BETWEEN 3PM AND 6PM, creating a ""danger zone"" for our kids and our neighborhoods. 3PM to 6PM is the time when up to 1 million California kids under the age of 15 may be left unsupervised. These are the hours when kids are most likely to join gangs, use alcohol and tobacco, and become addicted to drugs. A study of the most crime-ridden schools in Los Angeles showed CRIME RATES DROPPED 40% WHEN THOSE SCHOOLS OFFERED AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. In another study, vandalism and stealing plummeted 66%, while violent acts, carrying concealed weapons, and arrests were reduced 50% among program participants. PROPOSITION 49 IMPROVES GRADES AND TEST SCORES. Studies show that after school programs increase scores on standardized math and reading tests and improve grades, while decreasing the incidence of grade repetition, dropping out of school, and remedial education. Proposition 49 was put on the ballot by nearly 800,000 Californians. IT IS SUPPORTED BY THE WIDEST COALITION OF CALIFORNIANS OF ANY BALLOT MEASURE IN RECENT MEMORY. PROPOSITION 49 IS ENDORSED BY: LAW ENFORCEMENT: Attorney General Bill Lockyer, California State Sheriffs' Association, California District Attorneys Association, California Narcotic Officers' Association, California Peace Officers' Association, California Police Activities League, Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, and almost 60 individual police chiefs.

ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER WAYNE JOHNSON, President California Teachers Association WARREN RUPF, President California State Sheriffs' Association  49  REBUTTAL to Argument in Favor of Proposition 49 The decision to oppose Prop 49 was not easy, because we knew that most organizations with serious concerns about the measure would choose to remain silent. But the League of Women Voters of California is not intimidated by the popularity and economic strength of a ballot measure's proponent. Our obligation is informing voters of responsible approaches to the critical issues facing Californians. We actively support quality after school programs that change lives by improving academic performance and reducing crime. The League believes it is our collective responsibility to promote the well being of children and encourage them to reach their full potential. But this requires more than just after school programs. It requires programs that provide child protection, family advocacy, medical care, dental care, mental health care and assistance in meeting such basic human needs...food, clothing and housing. Maybe you support all these children's programs, but other priorities are also important to you--like environmental protection, public health care, senior assistance and trauma centers. None of these important programs has guaranteed funding. But Prop 49 fully funds one after school program, year after year, in good budget times and bad. Is that fair? Is that good public policy? We ask you to go beyond the rhetoric. Study the issues. Look at the larger picture. Don't be fooled into thinking Prop 49 can solve all of society's problems. Don't allow $550,000,000 of your tax dollars to be isolated from the budget process each year. Stop Prop 49.

State Grants. Initiative Statute.  49  ARGUMENT Against Proposition 49 Proposition 49 is a bad approach to a good cause. Prop 49 looks good, but in reality it disregards principles of good government by reducing government's flexibility to respond to changing needs and priorities. It takes a specific after school program, which many people will see as worthwhile, and sets it apart from all other needs funded by your tax dollars. Read carefully. Look beyond rhetoric. See the larger picture. This program will:  be entitled to guaranteed funding every year, in good budget times and bad.  get a free pass through the budget process every year.  receive special protection not afforded to other priorities like public safety, health care, environmental protection, transportation, social service programs, tax cuts and even other after school programs. And because this program receives special protection from budget cuts, it means that in times of economic downturn other programs may be cut to fund it--even those with potentially greater impact on children. INADEQUATE PROVISIONS FOR RISING COSTS AND AN ONGOING BUDGET CRISIS. The drafters of this initiative say that other programs won't be cut to pay for it, because they have included a provision that would only expand after school spending when spending on other programs has also significantly expanded. Their assumption is that if there is money to expand programs like health care or public safety, there should be money to expand after school programs too. The problem is that their trigger is too small. Inflation and population growth alone will require twice the amount they've calculated. In tough budget times like these, that will mean other programs will have to be cut, or taxes raised. A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT. Proposition 98, passed by voters in 1988, sets aside a portion of the state budget for K14 education programs. But the amount spent on specific programs is still decided during the budget process, every year. No program, regardless of how worthy, gets a free ride--yet. Prop 49 is the first attempt to earmark money for one particular program within the Proposition 98 guarantee. Prop 49 would increase the Proposition 98 guarantee level without raising additional revenues, so that programs funded outside the guarantee would be more vulnerable during economic downturns. If Prop 49 passes, other special interests will try similar measures in future elections. The result?  Less flexibility to address future and changing education needs.  Less money available in the non-Prop 98 part of the budget for other programs that directly impact the lives of our children, such as certain childcare programs, environmental programs, health care and social services.  Less discretionary money available for local school districts. Look at the bigger picture. VOTE NO ON PROP 49. BARBARA INATSUGU, President League of Women Voters of California  REBUTTAL to Argument Against Proposition 49 The League of Women Voters is nearly alone in their opposition to Proposition 49. And even they say 49 is ""a good cause."" Here's why: Studies by major universities prove that AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS REDUCE GANG ACTIVITY, REDUCE ALCOHOL AND DRUG USE, IMPROVE GRADES AND TEST SCO RES AND MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER FOR EVERYONE. AND PROPOSITION 49 WILL SAVE TAXPAYERS MONEY. FOR EVERY $1 INVESTED, TAXPAYERS SAVE $3 BY REDUCING THE COSTS OF JUVENILE CRIME, REMEDIAL EDUCATION AND GRADE REPETITION. The League's counter arguments are primarily technical budgeting arguments and, according to state budget experts and taxpayer organizations, they are simply mistaken. SECTION 10D OF PROPOSITION 49 SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS ARE NOT GUARANTEED ANNUAL FUNDING. Funds can be cut in bad budget years in exactly the same way other education programs are cut. PROPOSITION 49 WILL BE FUNDED ONLY AFTER OUR ECONOMY RECOVERS. STATE REVENUES FOR NON-EDUCATION PROGRAMS MUST GROW BY AT LEAST $1.5 BILLION BEFORE PROPOSITION 49 GETS A DIME. Budget experts and taxpayer organizations agree that $1.5 billion is enough to protect vital programs such as HEALTH CARE, PUBLIC SAFETY and EDUCATION-- WITHOUT RAISING TAXES. Proposition 49 allows intergenerational mentoring through use of seniors and saves money by using existing school facilities.

The state administers a number of programs to acquire and protect coastal wetlands and watersheds, conserve and protect water resources, and develop and improve the reliability of water supplies. The state also provides grants and loans to local agencies and nonprofit organizations for similar purposes. These programs are for a variety of specific purposes, including:  Coastal Wetlands and Watersheds. The state has provided funds to acquire and restore coastal wetlands and watersheds.

The state has also funded the restoration and improvement of fish and wildlife habitat in the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary (the Bay-Delta). Additionally, the state has funded water quality and supply projects in the Bay-Delta region which supplies a substantial portion of the water used in the state for domestic, industrial, agricultural, and environmental purposes. These funds have been provided through the CALFED Bay-Delta Program which is a joint state and federal effort to better manage water resources in this region.  Other Water Quality and Water Supply Projects. The state has also provided funds for various other projects throughout the state that improve water quality and/or supply. For example, the state has provided loans and   PROP  Water Quality, Supply and Safe Drinking Water Projects. Coastal Wetlands Purchase and Protection. Bonds.

Also, the state has provided funds to line canals to conserve Colorado River water. Funding for Coastal Protection and Water Resources Programs. Funding for these programs has come from various sources, including the state General Fund, federal funds, and general obligation bonds. Since 1990, voters have approved about $3 billion in bonds that are primarily for water-related purposes. It is estimated that about $1.9 billion of the bonds authorized by these previous bond acts will have been spent or committed to specific projects as of June 2002, leaving a balance of about $1.1 billion for future projects. In addition, in March 2002, voters approved a $2.6 billion resources bond measure. A majority of the funds from that bond are for park-related projects, although some funds are available for water conservation and water quality projects. Figure 1  (cont.)

The cost of these bonds would depend on their interest rates and the time period over which they are repaid. If the bonds were sold at an interest rate of 5.25 percent (the current rate for this type of bond) and repaid over 30 years, the cost would be about $6.9 billion to pay off both the principal ($3.44 billion) and interest ($3.46 billion). The average payment would be about $230 million per year. However, total costs to the state will be somewhat less. This is because the measure requires that loans made for coastal nonpoint source pollution control (up to $100 million) be repaid to the General Fund. The repayment of these loans could reduce the General Fund costs by up to $100 million (not including interest payments) over the life of the bonds. Property Tax-Related Impacts. The measure provides funds for land acquisition by governments and nonprofit organizations, for various purposes including coastal protection. Under state law, property owned by government entities, and by nonprofit organizations under specified conditions, is exempt from property taxation. To the extent that this measure results in property being exempted from  Desalination and Water Treatment Project  Desalination projects, treatment/removal of specified contaminants, drinking water disinfecting projects Colorado River Management  Ecosystem restoration  Canal lining Water Security  Protection of drinking water systems from terrorist attacks and other deliberate acts of destruction or degradation Total  $70 50 20 $50  $3,440  taxation due to acquisitions by governments and nonprofit organizations, local governments would receive reduced property tax revenues. We estimate these reduced property tax revenues would range from a few million dollars to roughly $10 million annually. Because existing law requires the state to make up for any property tax losses experienced by schools, we estimate about one-half of any losses resulting from this change would be offset by the state. Operational Costs. State and local governments may incur additional costs to operate or maintain a property or project that is purchased or developed with the bond funds. The amount of these additional costs is unknown.  For text of Proposition 50 see page 75.  Analysis  25  50  500   PROP  50  Water Quality, Supply and Safe Drinking Water Projects. Coastal Wetlands Purchase and Protection. Bonds. Initiative Statute.  ARGUMENT in Favor of Proposition 50 YES ON 50. PROTECT OUR DRINKING WATER SUPPLY AND COASTLINE. Our water supply is threatened by pollution, recurring drought, population growth, and inadequate security. Proposition 50 will help overcome these threats and provide every California family a safe, reliable supply of clean drinking water by:  Removing dangerous, cancer causing pollutants from our drinking water.  Creating new water supplies to keep up with population growth.  Keeping raw sewage and pollution out of our coastal waters and cleaning up beaches and bays.  Protecting rivers, lakes and streams and preserving coastal wetlands.  Protecting our reservoirs, dams, pumping stations and pipelines from terrorist threats and intentional contamination. YES ON 50 KEEPS OUR WATER FLOWING California's population is expected to nearly double in the next forty years. Proposition 50 funds state and local water system improvements needed to keep up with population growth by providing new water supplies and supporting water conservation programs. YES ON 50 KEEPS OUR WATER CLEAN Proposition 50 funds improved drinking water treatment to remove dangerous cancer causing chemicals, including arsenic, chromium and MTBE from our drinking water. YES ON 50 KEEPS OUR WATER SAFE Many of California's reservoirs, dams and pumping stations are protected by little more than a chain link fence. Proposition 50 protects local water delivery systems from terrorist threats and intentional contamination by funding early warning systems, alarms, fences, security systems, testing equipment and upgraded communications systems. YES ON 50 PROTECTS OUR BEACHES, BAYS AND COASTLINE Many of California's most beautiful beaches are unsafe for swimming because of pollution and raw sewage. Proposition 50 will fix aging local sewer and storm water systems that dump urban runoff into coastal waters. Proposition 50 also provides for protection and restoration of coastal wetlands vital to restoring the water quality, fisheries and wildlife of the San Francisco, Santa Monica and San Diego bays and of the coastal waters of the state. YES ON 50 WILL NOT RAISE TAXES Proposition 50 will use existing tax revenue where it is needed now--to protect our water supply and ensure safe drinking water for all Californians.

Just read Section 79560 of the initiative, it strictly prohibits bond funds from being spent for building new dams or reservoirs. To say it ""will not raise taxes"" is another lie. Proposition 50 will cost California Taxpayers a total of $5.7 billion--that's $227 million each year for the next 25 years. Furthermore, this initiative does nothing to complete the California Water Project sponsored by Gov. Pat Brown to meet our long range water needs. Millions of acre-feet of water flow down the Sacramento, through the Golden Gate, into the ocean each year. A canal is desperately needed to divert water around the Delta so it can flow down the California Aqueduct to drought stricken areas of our State. Proposition 50 does nothing to address this badly needed source of new water. Proposition 50 is more about money than water. The proponents solicited various special interests and apparently traded bond monies for campaign cash. It's called quid pro quo and under normal circumstances, it's illegal. However, in the arena of initiative politics, it's not illegal. Some of the largest real estate developers in California are big investors in this scheme to extract $3.44 billion from the taxpayers. The principals of the San Juan Company put up $50,000 for the effort at the same time they are trying to get approval to build 14,000 houses in an environmentally sensitive southern Orange County.

Coastal Wetlands Purchase and Protection. Bonds. Initiative Statute.  50  ARGUMENT Against Proposition 50 It seems like every time we have a general election, someone asks for a few billion dollars for safe drinking water. This time we are being asked to pass the largest water bond in history. A whopping $5.7 billion--when you consider the principal ($3.44 billion) and the interest ($2.24 billion). In spite of all the water bonds California taxpayers have approved in the last 30 years, our Governor and Legislature have taken no action to develop new water storage facilities. In fact, the construction of dams and reservoirs has been at a virtual standstill for many years in California. Most of water bond monies California voters have been approving have gone for endless studies of the problem, and to pander to unrealistic environmental demands. It's time for all good taxpayers to say ""no dice"" to these bond schemes that do nothing to improve our long range water supply. Yes, we are fast approaching a big water shortage crisis in California, the likes of which we have never seen before. Proposition 50 provides virtually no money to alleviate that crisis. We need new dams on the American River at Auburn and on the upper San Joaquin River at Friant. $3.44 billion will build both of them and provide us with a much needed new water supply. We need to build the Sites Reservoir in Colusa County, and the Los Banos Grande Reservoir in Merced County to store an additional 6 million acre feet of new water for drought protection and to accommodate all the new construction of the last 30 years. $3.44 billion would go a long way to build these worthwhile new reservoirs. All of California desperately needs a diversion channel around the Delta so that excess water that now flows out the Golden Gate into the ocean can be sent to drought stricken areas of our State. $3.44 billion would substantially fund that project. Proposition 50 does nothing to start, or plan for completion of any of the projects listed above. Proposition 50 has been described as the ""stealth bond issue."" Proponents are trying to sell it as a clean drinking water initiative. However, all California taxpayers should know it was drafted by a Sacramento lobbyist for several environmental groups and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. Supporters then hired professional signature gatherers and paid as much as $2.50 a signature to qualify this deceptive initiative for the ballot. What Proposition 50 really does is dole out bond funds to the pet projects of those environmental groups that paid to put it on the ballot. And, you and your children will have to come up with $227 million each year for the next 25 years to pay for it. Recently, a group of 30 taxpayer organizations from around the State met in Convention under the name California Taxpayer's Coalition and voted unanimously to oppose Proposition 50. Vote no on Proposition 50. For more information tedcosta@tedcosta.com or peoplesadvocate.org 1-800-501-8222. ERNIE DYNDA, President United Organizations of Taxpayers EDWARD J.

ROGERS, Chairman Citizens Against Unfair Taxation  REBUTTAL to Argument Against Proposition 50 PROP 50 IS NEEDED NOW TO PROVIDE A CLEAN, RELIABLE AND SAFE WATER SUPPLY FO R OUR FAMILIES AND OUR FUTURE. We've made progress in improving water quality and reliability, but there's a lot more that needs to be done now. Prop 50 supports vitally needed water projects critical to ensuring clean drinking water and a reliable water supply. Even the small groups opposing Prop 50 agree that OUR LOOMING WATER CRISIS MUST BE RESOLVED. But their approach, coming from people claiming to represent taxpayers, would cost drastically more than Prop 50's costeffective approach. PROPOSITION 50 WILL:  Keep our drinking water clean by removing toxic substances and protecting our rivers, lakes and streams.  Keep our water flowing by providing new water supplies, improving local water systems, and supporting water efficiency and conservation programs.  Protect our beaches, bays and coastline by repairing aging sewer and storm water systems.  Keep our water system safe and secure by protecting against terrorist threats and intentional contamination. ""Local water agencies responsible for providing Californians with safe drinking water agree: Prop 50 is vitally needed to provide a reliable supply of clean drinking water.""--James Pretti, President of the Board, Contra Costa Water District ""Nothing is more important than secure water supplies.

Distribution of Existing Motor Vehicle Sales and Use Tax. Initiative Statute.  Official Title and Summ ary  Prepared by the Attor ney General  Transportation. Distribution of Existing Motor Vehicle Sales and Use Tax. Initiative Statute. Creates ""Traffic Congestion Relief and Safe School Bus Trust Fund."" Redistributes portion of existing state revenues from motor vehicle sales/leases from General Fund to Trust Fund for transportation, environmental, and safety programs. Allocates portion of these funds for: school bus safety; clean air programs; highway improvements; mass transit improvements including bus purchase, commuter and light rail expansion.  Provides funds for environmental enhancement programs and traffic mitigation programs. Allocates money to 45 specific projects. For remainder of Trust Fund, specifies distribution percentages, restricts fund uses, requires accountability mechanisms. Summary of Legislative Analyst's Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact: Redirects specified General Fund revenues to state and local transportation-related purposes of about $420 million in 200203, $910 million in 200304, and increasing amounts annually thereafter, depending on the increase in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles. 51  28  Title and Summary   PROP  Transportation. Distribution of Existing Motor Vehicle Sales and Use Tax. Initiative Statute.  51  Analysis by the Legisl ative Analyst Background California levies a state sales tax of 6 percent on most goods sold in the state. (Local governments levy additional sales taxes, which are used for local purposes.) In 200001, California collected about $27 billion in state sales tax revenues, including about $3.4 billion from the sale and lease of new and used motor vehicles. Most of the revenues from the state sales tax go to the state General Fund, and are available for a variety of programs, including education, health, social services, and corrections. Less than 1 percent of the state sales tax revenue is dedicated to transportation purposes. Beginning in 200304, most of the state sales tax revenue generated from the sale of gasoline also will be used exclusively for transportation. As a result, about 4.5 percent of state sales tax revenues will be dedicated for transportation purposes. California spends about $16.5 billion a year to maintain, operate, and improve its highways, streets and roads, rail and transit systems. This money comes primarily from federal and state taxes (including state sales tax) on gasoline and diesel fuel, truck weight fees, and local taxes.

Under the measure, these revenues would continue to be deposited in the General Fund and then transferred to a new Traffic Congestion Relief and Safe School Bus Trust Fund. The money in this new fund would be used for the purposes shown in Figure 1. These purposes include mass transit and highway improvements, replacement of certain existing school buses, local street and road repairs, public facilities for transit riders, senior and disabled transportation services, environmental mitigation, and bicycle and pedestrian improvements. The measure also identifies 45 transportation and environmental projects around the state that would receive specified amounts of money each year. These projects would receive a total of about $210 million in 200304, decreasing over time. The measure requires money in the new fund to be transferred back to the General Fund in any year in which total General Fund revenues are less than those in the previous year. Additionally, the measure requires the transfer of a smaller amount from the General Fund to the new fund if the growth in General Fund revenues over the previous year is smaller than the amount to be transferred. Agencies that are allocated money from the new fund can spend up to 2 percent of the money for administrative costs.  The measure also requires an audit of expenditures from the fund, to be conducted by a new, independent commission.  Fiscal Effects This measure dedicates specified General Fund revenues to state and local transportation-related purposes of about $420 million in 200203, $910 million in 200304, and increasing amounts annually thereafter, depending on the increase in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles. This would result in a corresponding reduction in funds available for General Fund supported programs. This measure would also result in additional unknown administrative costs to various state and local agencies. These costs would likely be covered by the amounts that the measure allows each entity to spend for administrative purposes.  For text of Proposition 51 see page 79.

LIEUTENANT ED GRAY, President California Organization of Police and Sheriffs (COPS) KIRK HUNTER, Co-Chair School Transportation Coalition PAUL BURRIS, President Partners for Highway Safety  51  REBUTTAL to Argument in Favor of Proposition 51 Does anyone still believe there is a free lunch? The proponents of Proposition 51 apparently think so. Their list of pork barrel, special interest projects totaling billions of dollars apparently will come from ""existing funds."" Well, Proposition 51 will add about $1 billion yearly to a significant state deficit predicted by the Legislative Analyst for years to come. So, ""use of existing funds"" means one of two things: either critical spending, like public safety or higher education, is cut. Or, taxes will have to be raised. There is no free lunch. Ask yourself these questions before you vote on Proposition 51: With ongoing budget deficits, should your tax dollars be spent to build paths for golf carts at Leisure World? That spending is LOCKED into Prop. 51. With ongoing budget deficits, should the state fund freeway interchanges for developers who paid to put Prop. 51 on the ballot? A freeway interchange for a campaign contributor proposing a large development in LA County is LOCKED into Prop. 51. Do you think taxes should be raised or programs cut to build and maintain museums and a music concourse? Or should private funds pay for these luxury projects? Prop. 51 REQUIRES taxpayer spending on these projects. Do you think priorities for your tax dollars should be determined by special interests which receive your tax dollars? Prop. 51 has numerous projects which benefit specific contributors. Say no to this ""pay to play"" scheme. Don't add $1 billion yearly to the deficit. Vote NO on 51!

Distribution of Existing Motor Vehicle Sales and Use Tax. Initiative Statute.  51  ARGUMENT Against Proposition 51 Why do taxpayer and government reform groups in California oppose Proposition 51? Because it violates the principles of sound tax and spending policy, and key principles of good government. In the midst of a multi-billion dollar state budget problem, Proposition 51 ties up the state budget forever with 17 new categories of required spending. This initiative does not provide any new funds, but earmarks nearly $1 billion of your tax dollars each year for a long list of programs and projects. Without consideration of other budgetary priorities, Proposition 51 locks in spending even on nonessential projects which in tough times may have to take a back seat to other needs. Accountability? The public and its elected representatives will have no voice if priorities need to be changed in future years. Health and social services, local government, higher education, or public safety might have to be cut or taxes raised to deal with budgetary pressures such as inflation, growth, or changes in federal funding. But Proposition 51 programs would be exempt from scrutiny. The proponents claim that the measure won't take effect during bad budget times. But according to the California Budget Project, if Proposition 51 were the law now, it would be in effect for 200203, when the budget was nearly $24 billion in debt. It would have made this year's budget crisis much worse. So much for budget protections. There are 45 specific projects written into this initiative with little accountability, many of which benefit contributors to Proposition 51. Example: A powerful Texas developer gets $30 million in grade crossings constructed to serve their development. The developer contributed $120,000 to get Proposition 51 on the ballot. This project was not a priority for a local transportation program. (Source: Riverside Press Enterprise). In all, these special projects add up to a whopping $1.2 billion while a dozen others receive millions in funding every year, forever. Still worse, the state is obligated to spend this money even if it means raising taxes or cutting vital services, such as children's health care and fire protection, during tough budget times. For example, this initiative requires spending for projects, such as $40 million for improvements to a music concourse area and funding for a vintage rail line, that would likely go unfunded by the Legislature during a budget crisis. Those of us who oppose Proposition 51 have very diverse views about state spending and taxes. But all of us agree that Proposition 51 is bad tax and budget policy. We all agree that as times change, or in a budget crisis, spending priorities have to be changed. But instead, Proposition 51 ties up your tax dollars so that the ability to make the right choices is impossible. Don't allow $1 billion of your tax dollars to be isolated from the democratic budget process every year. We urge you to reject Proposition 51. BARBARA INATSUGU, President League of Women Voters of California LENNY GOLDBERG, Executive Director California Tax Reform Association LEWIS K. UHLER, President National Tax Limitation Committee  REBUTTAL to Argument Against Proposition 51 YES ON 51 lets you--the voter--take immediate action to address critical safety problems with California's roads, school buses, and walk paths to school. The Legislature has refused to dedicate these funds to highway safety and congestion relief. The problems keep getting worse. We can't afford to wait. PROPOSITION 51 DOES NOT RAISE TAXES. It dedicates EXISTING automobile sales taxes to immediate road and highway safety improvements, safety for children going to school, safe transportation for seniors and the disabled, and traffic congestion relief.

Allows persons who are legally eligible to vote and have valid identification to register to vote on election day at their polling place.  Increases criminal penalty for voter and voter registration fraud. Criminalizes conspiracy to commit voter fraud. Requires trained staff at polling places to manage election day registration, creates fund to implement measure, including training and providing personnel for election day registration. Allows persons to register or reregister during 28 days preceding election day at local election offices.  Provides more time to county election officials to prepare voter registration lists. Summary of Legislative Analyst's Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact: 52 32 Annual state costs of about $6 million to fund counties for election day voter registration activities, thereby resulting in no anticipated net county cost. Minor state administrative costs and unknown, but probably minor, state costs to enforce a new election fraud offense.  Title and Summary   Election Day Voter Registration. Voter Fraud Penalties. Initiative Statute.  PROP  52  Analysis by the Legisl ative Analyst Background Under current law, Californians who want to vote in an upcoming election must register with county elections officials by the 15th day before the election. of election day voter registration including hiring and training additional personnel, providing voter registration materials, and expanding voter outreach programs. Counties receiving money from the fund would be required to submit an annual report identifying their expenditures. Increased Penalties for Voter Fraud. This measure increases the penalties for fraudulent registration or voting activity. It also creates a new crime of conspiracy of two or more people who commit specified election fraud, punishable by imprisonment in state prison.  Proposal Election Day Registration. This measure allows eligible citizens, upon presenting proof of current residence, to register up to and including election day. Under the measure, citizens registering on or after the 28th day before an election must do so at the county elections office, or at a polling place on election day. Local elections officials must provide a separate area and at least one trained staff member at each polling place for election day voter registration. Additionally, the Secretary of State must include information about election day voter registration as part of all voter education efforts. Election Day Registration Fund. This measure establishes the ""Election Day Registration Fund"" within the State Treasury. Each year, approximately $6 million would be deposited into this fund from the state's General Fund and distributed to counties for their costs  Fiscal Effects This measure annually appropriates $6 million (adjusted for cost-of-living increases) from the state's General Fund for the county costs of election day voter registration activities. As a result, no net costs to counties are anticipated. The Secretary of State would incur minor costs to carry out the requirements of this measure. The state also would incur, unknown, but probably minor, criminal justice costs for individuals who commit a newly established election fraud offense.  For text of Proposition 52 see page 98.  Analysis  33  52   PROP  52  Election Day Voter Registration. Voter Fraud Penalties. Initiative Statute.  ARGUMENT in Favor of Proposition 52 PROP 52 PROTECTS YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE AND PROTECTS AGAINST VOTER FRAUD. Every California citizen who is legally eligible should be able to vote on election day. Anyone who tries to vote illegally should be stopped and prosecuted. Presently, California law makes it nearly impossible for some citizens to vote--and too easy for others to commit voter fraud. Prop 52 ensures that every eligible citizen has the opportunity to vote, and increases penalties for voter fraud. Prop 52 will:  Give all legally eligible citizens the right to vote on election day.  Allow legally eligible citizens to register and vote on election day only with a valid California driver's license or two required forms of identification proving they are California residents voting at the right polling place.  Double the penalties for voting illegally or for voter fraud.  Provide training to election day poll workers on processing voter registrations and preventing voter fraud. PROP 52 PREVENTS VOTER FRAUD. Under current state law, there's no requirement to show identification when registering to vote. Voter fraud laws are too weak and need to be strengthened. Currently county elections officials aren't required to report voter fraud to law enforcement officials. The existing system has loopholes that have even allowed pets to be registered as voters! Vote Yes on 52. Prop 52 protects against voter fraud by:  Making conspiracy to commit voter fraud a felony, punishable by a long jail sentence.  Requiring county elections officials to report fraudulent voting activities to the District Attorney.  Requiring unregistered voters who want to vote on election day to prove they are eligible by showing a valid California driver's license or two required forms of identification proving they are California residents voting at the right polling place.  Requiring all polling places to clearly display both the rights of voters and the new penalties for voter fraud. ""Prop 52 will give law enforcement the vital new tools we need to deter and prevent voter fraud.""--Grover Trask, Riverside County District Attorney PROP 52 PROTECTS YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE. Today in the U.S., only 49% of eligible voters vote. For the world's greatest democracy, that's pitiful. We should do everything possible to get more eligible citizens to the polls. The League of Women Voters of California, the California Professional Firefighters, and the California Nurses Association have all endorsed Prop 52 because they understand the importance of increasing voter turnout. Currently, outdated quirks in state law prevent many eligible citizens from voting on election day. For example, those who turn 18 or move a few weeks before an election could be deprived of the right to vote. States with laws like Prop 52 lead the nation in voter turnout. The anti-fraud provisions in Prop 52 provide vitally needed new protections against voter fraud. ""Our study shows that election day registration holds enormous promise. It is an easier way to vote. In California, Prop 52 should produce substantially higher voter turnout.""--Mike Alvarez, Ph.D., Caltech LEE BACA Los Angeles County Sheriff MARCH FONG EU Former Secretary of State  52  REBUTTAL to Argument in Favor of Proposition 52 Don't be fooled. Prop. 52 is full of loopholes that corrupt our election process and will lead to widespread voter fraud. That's why Law Enforcement leaders like Contra Costa County District Attorney Gary Yancey, Ventura County District Attorney Mike Bradbury, Shasta County District Attorney McGregor Scott and Santa Barbara County Sheriff Jim Thomas all say NO on 52. FACT: Prop. 52 makes it easier for CRIMINALS and NON-CITIZENS to vote. That's not fair to qualified voters who follow the rules. FACT: Prop. 52 does not require a drivers license or other government identification to register and vote on Election Day. Under Prop. 52, a piece of junk mail is considered one of the valid forms of ID! FACT: Hidden in the fine print is a change in the law that makes proving FRAUD almost impossible. The authors of Proposition 52 are trying to fool you with talk of tough penalties. Tough penalties mean nothing if it's impossible to prove the crime was committed. FACT: 44 other states wisely DO NOT ALLOW Election Day registration. ""Prop. 52 would bilk taxpayers $6 million yearly for a program that allows dishonest politicians to steal elections.""-- Richard Gann, President, Gann Taxpayer Organization Remember Florida?

Voter Fraud Penalties. Initiative Statute.  PROP  52  ARGUMENT Against Proposition 52 Proposition 52 makes it easier for CRIMINALS, DISHONEST POLITICIANS and NON-CITIZENS to commit ELECTION FRAUD. That's why District Attorneys, Sheriffs, Cops, and Elections Officials across California urge you to VOTE NO on 52. Prop. 52 appears well intentioned, until you read the fine print. This poorly drafted measure is full of LOOPHOLES and HIDDEN AGENDAS that will lead to MASSIVE ELECTION FRAUD in California. It's a classic example of a cure that is worse than the disease. PROP. 52 DOES NOT REQUIRE PHOTO IDENTIFICATION. California already has one of the most liberal elections laws in the nation. Registration forms are widely available and county elections officials have only 15 days to check for fraud and prepare voter rolls. But under Prop. 52, a person could register and cast a ballot on Election Day with ""identification"" that is nothing more than any piece of mail addressed to them and a student lease agreement, credit card bill, or other unofficial identification. No photo ID would be required. If Proposition 52 passes, elections officials will have no way of knowing if the person suddenly registering on Election Day is entitled to vote, or, for that matter, even a citizen of the United States. And they will have no time to check the validity of the registration before the ballot is cast. PROP. 52 MAKES IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DETECT FRAUD AND OVERTURN ELECTIONS WON WITH PHONY VOTES. Under Prop. 52, ballots cast by those registering on Election Day will be mixed together with all other ballots. There will be no way for law enforcement and elections officials to go back after Election Day and determine if an election was won by fraud. The penalties against election fraud contained in Prop. 52 are useless, because the measure makes it impossible to ever prove the crime! District Attorneys, Sheriffs, Cops and Elections Officials OPPOSE Prop. 52. So do Republicans, Democrats, Labor and Taxpayer Groups. Working Californians OPPOSE Prop. 52. Our right to have our vote counted in fair elections will no longer exist in California if this measure passes. Forty-four other states wisely do not allow Election Day registration. The six small states with laws similar to Prop. 52 are not like California. Our state is too big, and the potential for abuse too high, to enact a law that makes it easier to commit fraud. In a typical election, almost half of legally registered voters choose not to vote. Making it easier for FELONS, NONCITIZENS AND OTHERS NOT QUALIFIED TO VOTE TO COMMIT FRAUD, will not solve the problem of low turn out. In the wake of the controversy and chaos surrounding the 2000 Election in Florida, other states are looking to improve election laws and crack down on vote fraud. California must not go in the other direction by opening the door to fraud and election abuse.  PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY of our election system  PROTECT YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE in fair elections  STOP ELECTION FRAUD  Vote NO on PROP. 52! HONORABLE JAN SCULLY District Attorney of Sacramento County HONORABLE MIKE CARONA Sheriff of Orange County SHARON RUNNER, Co-Chair Citizens & Law Enforcement Against Election Fraud  REBUTTAL to Argument Against Proposition 52 After the 2000 Presidential election people understood--""One vote can make a difference."" Politics aside, one thing is clear--we need to protect our right to vote and ensure everyone who is eligible to vote--CAN VOTE! That's what Election Day Voter Registration does. States with election day registration lead the nation in turnout. A Cal-Tech/MIT election study found, ""California will experience an even larger increase in turnout...as much as one million new voters."" A bipartisan group of elections experts wrote this law with protections making the process fair and convenient; with stiff penalties for politicians who try to steal elections. Prop 52 requires training for poll workers, requires allegations of fraud be reported to prosecutors and doubles the fines for fraud. Misleading claims that Prop 52 will cause rampant fraud and allow unscrupulous individuals to cast several ballots just don't ring true. Opponents neglect to remind you that currently, you don't have to show ID when registering to vote or voting. Prop 52 adds new, strict identification requirements for election day registration: a photo ID, or two forms of legally valid ID showing that the voter is voting in the correct precinct. Politicians and bureaucrats claim that any reform will crash the system--the same arguments made about Motor Voter, Absentee Voting, and Campaign Finance Reform. But they all work. We can complain about California's low voter turnout or we can pass Prop 52--reform that will make a difference. Vote YES on Prop 52.

It also discusses the impact that the bond measures on this ballot would, if approved, have on this debt level and the costs associated with paying them off.  This cost, however, is spread over the entire 30-year period, so the cost after adjusting for inflation is less--about $1.25 for each $1 borrowed.  The State's Current Debt Situation Background What Is Bond Financing? Bond financing is a type of long-term borrowing that the state uses to raise money to finance major capital outlay projects. The state gets money for these projects by selling bonds to investors. In exchange, the state agrees to repay this money, with interest. Why Are Bonds Used? The money raised from selling bonds primarily pays for the purchase of property and construction of facilities--such as parks, prisons, schools, and colleges. The state uses bond financing mainly because these facilities provide services for many years and their large dollar costs can be difficult to pay for all at once. The use of bonds can allow such facilities to be put in place earlier than otherwise and/or enable the state to use available tax dollars for other purposes. Types of Bonds. The bonds the state issues are generally tax exempt and fall into two main categories--general obligation bonds and revenue bonds.  General obligation bonds require approval by a majority of California's voters and account for most of the bonds the state sells. The state's debt service payments on nearly 90 percent of these bonds come directly from the state's General Fund, which supports a wide variety of programs and is funded primarily from the state's personal and corporate income taxes and the sales tax. The remainder of the general obligation bonds (such as veterans' housing bonds) are self-supporting and, therefore, do not require General Fund support.  Revenue bonds generally do not require voter approval and most are supported by revenues generated from the projects they finance, such as bridges. These also include lease revenue bonds, which are financed through General Fund lease payments made by state departments and agencies occupying the facilities. The state pays higher interest rates on these lease revenue bonds than it does on general obligation bonds, mainly because--unlike general obligation bonds--interest and principal payments on them are not guaranteed by the California Constitution. The state has used these lease revenue bonds to build higher education facilities, prisons, veterans' homes, and state offices. What Are the Direct Costs of Bond Financing? The state's cost for using bonds depends primarily on their interest rates and the time period over which they are repaid. Most general obligation bonds currently being issued are paid off over a 30-year period. Assuming current tax-exempt interest rates for such bonds (about 5.25 percent), the cost of paying them off over 30 years is about $2 for each dollar borrowed--$1 for the dollar borrowed and $1 for interest. Amount of State Debt. As of July 2002, the state had about $28 billion of General Fund bond debt outstanding-- about $22 billion of general obligation bonds and $6 billion of lease revenue bonds. Also, the state has not yet sold about $11 billion of authorized bonds, either because the projects involved have not yet been started or those in progress have not yet reached their major construction phase. Debt Payments. We estimate that payments on the state's General Fund bond debt totaled about $2.9 billion in 200102. Debt service payments are expected to fall temporarily in 200203 and 200304 because of the deferral of certain bond payments during these two years to help deal with the General Fund's budget shortfall. Debt payments should increase to about $3.6 billion in 200405, as previously authorized but currently unsold bonds are marketed. Thereafter, outstanding bond debt would slowly decline absent additional authorizations. If all of the $18.6 billion in bonds on the November ballot are approved and eventually sold, annual debt service payments would rise to about $4.7 billion by 200708, before declining in subsequent years. Debt Service Ratio. The level of debt payments for principal and interest stated as a percentage of state General Fund revenues is referred to as the state's debt service ratio. This ratio increased in the early 1990s and peaked at slightly over 5 percent in the middle of the decade. It has since declined and stood at 4.3 percent in 200102. Based on current bond authorizations, the ratio will remain near current levels through 200405 and slowly decline thereafter. If all of the $18.6 billion in bonds on this ballot are approved and eventually sold, the ratio would increase to about 4.9 percent in 200405 and decline thereafter.  Bond Propositions on This Ballot There are three bond propositions on this ballot:  Proposition 46. This measure would authorize the state to sell $2.1 billion of general obligation bonds to fund various housing programs, including those that assist rental housing projects, homeownership, and farmworker housing.  Proposition 47. This measure would authorize the state to issue $13.05 billion of general obligation bonds for construction and renovation of K12 school facilities and higher education facilities.  Proposition 50. This measure would authorize the state to sell $3.44 billion of general obligation bonds for various water-related programs. These include coastal protection, the CALFED Bay-Delta program, regional water management, and various safe drinking water programs.  36  State Bond Debt   C  AND IDATE  S  TATEMENTS  BY O  FFI CE  Governor   As the state's chief executive officer, oversees most state departments and agencies and appoints judges.  Proposes new laws and approves or vetoes legislation.  Prepares and submits the annual state budget.  Mobilizes and directs state resources during emergencies.  I'm running for Governor because California needs new leadership for a brighter future. We need to restore accountability and bring a new vision to the Governor's office. California remains in the grips of an unprecedented power crisis. Our electricity bills are near the highest in the nation, and we've already suffered more power alerts this year. We face the largest budget deficit in history. Our schools rank near last in reading and math, and dead last in science. Children don't feel safe in their schools. One million Californians who want to work can't find a job. Our roads are rated the worst in the nation, access to health care is near last, and we face a water shortage that will make the energy crisis look minor. I have the background to take on these challenges: I was a federal prosecutor with Rudy Giuliani, taking on mafia bosses, drug dealers, and corporate criminals. We prosecuted tough environmental laws and punished those who harmed our air and water. I help dozens of small businesses create and protect thousands of jobs. I've always conducted my business with the highest ethical standards. I devote my time to helping those in need by providing thousands of scholarships to underprivileged youth, assisting battered women, cleaning up schools and providing job training to the unemployed. I want to make sure the California Dream is available to all people regardless of background. My record proves I can do the job. I'd be honored to earn your vote. Bill Simon Republican Party 320 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 300 Santa Monica, CA 90403 866-VOTE-SIMON www.simonforgovernor.com  Every Californian knows there is something wrong in California. Our families are being pressed from all sides, higher electricity costs, water bills, gasoline, rising insurance costs, and higher taxation. It takes both Dad and Mom working just to buy the essentials. The issues that are important to Californians are God, Family and Country. I believe in a California where families come first. As Governor I will restore the value of families in our state by doubling the places where they can go hiking, camping, swimming, fishing and picnicking, and by returning more money to the family by tax reduction. California could have been well on its way to eliminating all vehicle license fees, and other taxes if we had held the budget to a modest increase in years past. Our recent budget crisis will be small in comparison to our water concerns. We must increase water storage capacities by building new dams and pipelines in our state. These dams will also produce lowcost hydro electricity. California can return to affordable energy for business and household use, with better management and a new energy proposal. I am pro-life! When a society protects the unborn and the elderly from harm, that society will benefit greatly from the respect citizens show each other.

There's 9911 West Pico Blvd., Suite 980 more to do, but we've increased funding by 30% and student achievement Los Angeles, CA 90035 scores are up three years in a row. I've expanded tenfold the Healthy 310-201-0344 Families Program for uninsured children, provided one million kids with health insurance and established the first agency in America to help www.gray-davis.com patients fight their HMO--and win. I've signed the nation's toughest gun governor@gray-davis.com laws, banning assault weapons and requiring trigger locks. To preserve our environment, I've signed tough new laws cleaning up our beaches, signed the nation's first law reducing greenhouse gas emissions and sued the federal government to block more offshore drilling. As a strongly pro-choice Governor, I've signed seven new laws further protecting a woman's right to choose. As a Vietnam veteran, I'm pleased we've improved our veterans' homes and are building five more. To keep you safe, I've blocked the early release of murderers and deployed the National Guard after the attacks of Sept. 11. I'm privileged to be endorsed by nearly every major public safety organization representing cops on the beat, County Sheriffs, Police Chiefs and firefighters, as well as many District Attorneys. I'm proud California's economy has grown from the 7th to the 5th largest in the world over the last four years. I would be honored to continue working with you to keep the Golden State moving forward.  Seeking a better alternative? Do we ignore Milton Friedman, Herbert Spencer, Gene Roddenberry--some of my favorite philosophers--at our peril? I've seen big party politicians burden California with costly boondoggles and corrupt social engineering: a ""drug war"" that erodes the bill of rights and promotes crime; a public school monopoly with declining quality and increasing costs; electricity ""reforms"" that raise prices, reduce profits, and endanger supply; ""managed"" health care more like the DMV every day. My goal is to make it easier to follow our dreams: Lessen tax loads. Honor parents' rights and responsibilities. Care for poor families with vouchers--not long lines for government rationed state services. Respect property rights and personal freedoms. I am a husband, father, man of faith, and CEO of a bio-information firm. I want my children to enjoy the free and diverse society envisioned by Jefferson, Paine, and Adams.

Because I accept no special interest money, I represent the voters, freeing me to implement innovative forwardlooking programs to solve critical problems, ensure a strong economy, and improve the quality of life for everyone.

The time has come to bring common sense kprism99@aol.com solutions to California that resemble true democratic ideals, restoring www.natural-law.com human dignity and personal sovereignty as endowed to us by our creator. As an activist and grassroots organizer for over fifteen years, I have fought for environmental protection, the reduction of nuclear weapons and women's reproductive rights. I am dedicated to the growth of third party politics through fair and independent grassroots movements that bring together the best ideas collectively and give voice to real concerns of California citizens. As Lt. Governor of California I will strongly work towards creating programs that will streamline government waste and mismanagement of taxpayers' funds, reduce violence and societal stress through programs designed to teach peace through social harmony and tolerance, reform California schools' curriculum through innovative methods of teaching designed to stimulate creativity, critical thinking and intelligence, promote preventative health care alternatives, and investigate the possibility of sustainable methods of farming and renewable sources of natural energy.

Libertarianism is the pursuit of justice. Peace is not the absence of war; it is the absence of coercion. I have spent many years working for justice and against coercion. I worked with the United Farm Workers to guarantee the right of agricultural workers to organize a labor union. I organized a campaign to convince the Malaysian government to stop the execution of a Californian who entered that country with marijuana. I helped overturn an illegal sales tax in San Diego County where government officials were found guilty of circumventing Prop 13--and then wanted to keep the money! My most rewarding work has been building the Libertarian Party, because the Libertarian Party consistently helps individuals take more control over their lives. While other parties/politicians debate what areas of a person's life should be regulated/taxed/banned/prohibited/licensed, etc., Libertarians work to maximize your freedom and respect your responsibility. My most recent crusade is the legalization of the domestic ferret in California, one of two states to ban them. For being visible and outspoken, I've had one ferret confiscated at his vet and euthanized, and armed agents broke down my door to seize my other ferrets. While ferrets are not an important issue to most Californians, how government works should be. This has been an education for me--one that will serve me, and you, well in Sacramento.

As a former newspaper editor, I spoke out on the issues facing California. As a California State Senator, I actively participated in policy debates and helped shape laws that have increased school funding, improved public safety, created jobs, reduced taxes and protected our environment. For example, I wrote California's ""Son of Sam"" law to prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes. I cast the deciding vote to ban offshore oil drilling. And I co-sponsored the largest tax cut in state history. This is the problem-solving experience I'll put to work as your Lt. Governor. If the Governor's energy, budget or other policies are hurting California, I'll speak out and offer positive alternatives. If the Legislature ignores problems, I'll speak up and propose solutions. I'll champion schools and public safety, economic growth and efficient government. I will take this job seriously and work hard to make a difference for the people of California.

Corporations like Enron fuel our elections with huge campaign contributions. This corruption led to electrical deregulation, costing us billions. Moreover, corruption degrades our democratic rights as citizens. I am running for Secretary of State because California needs an elections officer not beholden to corporations and political machines, an independent watchdog who will defend our democracy. To make politicians accountable, I will investigate and recommend prosecution of anyone who has given or accepted a bribe in exchange for political influence. I accept no corporate campaign contributions and will fight to replace the undemocratic system of private funding with voluntary public financing of elections, already successfully used in several states. I will institute corporate charter reform to prevent corporations from trampling on citizen rights, worker rights, and our environment. For fairness, maximum participation, and full democracy in our elections, I will fight for Instant Runoff Voting and Proportional Representation. I was educated in California's public schools and earned a doctorate in American history from Northwestern University. I am a small business owner, former Peace Corps Volunteer, author, and member of the National Writers Union Local 3, Oakland Tenants Union and Sierra Club. Over fifty Greens already hold elective office in California. Join with us on November 5. Together we can take a decisive step toward clean elections, social justice, and authentic democracy.

Perhaps they all serve the same corporations that fund their campaigns. Don't waste your vote on the one who only appears to be the lesser of two evils. If the major campaign contributors are getting their money's worth, where does that put you? We Californians have experienced the impact of big money in politics--hence: deregulation of a monopoly resulting in higher electric bills. Is water next? Electioneering 2000--only Florida? We want less money in the political process, that's why year after year we vote for campaign finance reform, but to no avail. Proposition 208 (which I helped pass in 1996) was on the verge of passing constitutional muster when Proposition 34 was sneaked onto the 2000 ballot by opponents of real campaign finance reform. According to the League of Women Voters, ""Proposition 34 is full of loopholes and is designed to fool the voters into thinking they are getting reform."" It also canceled much of P208. Money rules? Who benefits from the prohibition of U.S. Congress candidate statements in this pamphlet--perhaps only well-financed candidates? If elected I will: Support ballot statements for all elected offices. Not repeat the abuse of power of this office to meddle with the democratic process. Make sure interested parties like the League of Women Voters, Common Cause and AARP are informed in time to respond to sneak attacks like Proposition 34.

Valli Sharpe-Geisler Reform Party 4718 Meridian Avenue #228 San Jose, CA 95118 408-997-9267 valli4reform@earthlink.net www.siliconv.com  United States Senator Dianne Feinstein supports me for Secretary of State because of my work modernizing voting systems, cutting paperwork to vote-by-mail, raising penalties for voter fraud and pushing stronger protections for voters' privacy rights. I am pleased that my record has earned me the support of so many California leaders. As Assembly Majority Leader, I pushed for more campaign finance disclosure and more local voter outreach. The Secretary of State administers an important program, ""Safe at Home,"" to protect victims of domestic violence. Women who need to get away from their abuser can use the Secretary of State's office to keep the location of their home secret. This year, I worked to expand the program to protect women who were being harassed for seeking family planning services, including abortion. Did you know that extremists proposed a law that would have denied any woman who had an abortion the right to vote? I am proud to be supported by Planned Parenthood of California and the California Nurses Association. As Secretary of State, I will protect every citizen's right to vote as well as the privacy of their voter records. I will fight for campaign finance reform and to ensure that all Californians have the opportunity to cast a vote that counts. I will make sure my Voting Modernization Act is implemented to upgrade voting technology so that ""chads"" are no longer a part of our electoral system. I respectfully request your vote for Secretary of State. Kevin Shelley Democratic Party 243 Golden Gate Avenue San Francisco, CA 94102 415-255-8587 www.shelley2002.com  California's Secretary of State is the person responsible for making sure our elections are fair and free of fraud. With a Ph.D. in constitutional law and experience as a businessman, educator and California legislator, I will passionately defend your right to vote and protect the integrity of our election system. I wrote California's law requiring students to learn about America's Declaration of Independence and our U.S. Constitution--a love for democracy that will guide my work as your Secretary of State. I will be a steady and responsible guardian of California's election system and dedicate myself to 100% participation and 0% fraud. I will aggressively prosecute voter fraud and work to modernize California's voting technology--so every vote is accurately counted. I will use the Internet and other technologies to make it easier for you to obtain information about candidates, ballot initiatives and campaign contributors--so you can make informed decisions when you vote. I will work to increase the number of citizens who vote in California by making it easier and more convenient for people to register--so every person who is eligible to vote can participate in our democracy. And to make sure your vote matters in presidential elections, I will petition network television news programs so they no longer project the ""winner"" before our polls close in California. I have prepared a plan called ""Government for the People"" that details what I'll do as your Secretary of State. For a copy, please call 916-498-1499 or visit www.olberg2002.com.

I have well over 40 years of direct patient care in hospitals, offices, clinics and Home Health Care plus medical service evaluation, research and recommendations using medical records and Utilization Review procedures. I know how to quickly assess situations, take instant remedial action and teach individuals and families to cope with illness under extreme stress. I have served as Secretary for a statewide organization. As your Secretary of State, I would increase eligible voter participation through easy to understand election pamphlets (and candidate guidelines). By including a detailed explanation of political party positions and principles along with photos and statements from all candidates, I would empower voters to make voting decisions using the election pamphlet ignoring media coverage (favoring incumbents and major party candidates) and expensive advertising beyond the reach of the average person concerned about their country. I support the ""None of the Above"" option in all elections, same day (honor system) voter registration and permanent absentee voting status and a vastly strengthened local library system through the State Library. Local libraries need increased support to have fully informed voters. Individuals, political parties or clearly and openly acknowledged special interest membership groups (but not corporations or unions) should be free to give personal financial contributions to any candidate without limits, (provided such contributions and expenditures are noted and listed in the voter pamphlet). Gail K. Lightfoot Libertarian Party P.O. Box 598 Pismo Beach, CA 93448 805-481-3434 www.ca.lp.org  There is nothing more fundamental to freedom than fair elections. Citizens of the United States should not accept less than what our government demands of emerging democracies around the world, the highest standards of equality, fairness, and accuracy in the election process. In the last state primary election only 25% of eligible voters voted, demonstrating a lack of faith and interest in present-day politics. My priority is to create long-overdue election/campaign reforms to guarantee every vote counts and every candidate's voice is heard. This includes: implementing by January 2004 the most accurate, up-to-date voting equipment in all communities; mandatory election holidays; elimination of special interest (PAC) campaign contributions; designated equal time over the public airwaves for all candidates on the ballot; and a shift toward public sponsorship of campaigns and proportional representation. I would also institute a youth education program to teach students about the importance of participating in the political process and inspire them to do so. I am proud to represent the Natural Law Party's profound principles and solution-based platform, which have their roots in the scientific understanding that all the rich diversity of culture, religion, race and gender are expressions of an underlying field of unity. As California Secretary of State I will be a true civil servant, not a career politician, and I will openly and justly serve all the people of California.

Administers the state payroll system and unclaimed property laws.  Serves on numerous boards and commissions including the Board of Equalization and the Board of Control.  Conducts audits and reviews of state operations.  I will be an independent fiscal watchdog fighting to strengthen California's economy and make government more efficient. I am the only candidate for Controller with over twenty years experience in business, government, and education. I taught at Stanford's Graduate School of Business and led economic development for the City of San Jose. I demonstrated my financial management skills helping build eBay, a true California neweconomy success story. Our success was built on creativity, sound business practices, and honesty. As your Controller, I will follow these same fundamental values. I will vigorously protect California's retirement funds from bad investments and unscrupulous businesses. I will make certain that every corporation doing business in California honors its responsibility to investors and the public. I want to move California into the 21st Century by creating jobs and streamlining government. I will use the power of the audit to cut government waste and eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy so that we can spend more money reducing class size and improving infrastructure. As the only candidate with business experience, I will improve customer service so that taxpayers get fast and accurate refunds. I'm also the only candidate for Controller who will protect a woman's right to choose, support public schools, oppose vouchers, oppose off-shore oil drilling, and fight for clean air and water. Please join US Senator Dianne Feinstein, California's nurses, teachers, firefighters and police as well as religious and business leaders--from both parties--in supporting my campaign. Steve Westly Democratic Party 703 Woodside Road Redwood City, CA 94061 650-365-4222 steve@westly2002.com www.westly2002.com  Women and people of color have proved they deserve to be at the decision-making table. In the Green Party, respect for diversity is a key value. Unlike the business-as-usual parties, our statewide slate puts this value into practice. As Controller, I pledge to Follow The Money. I will report my findings to the people so we can regain control of our finances. Californians want great schools. Instead we've seen our wealthy state become a low spender on education while the very wealthy get richer through big contracts for prisons. In 25 years, despite the values of the people, California built 21 new prisons and only 2 new universities. When people voted for Proposition 13 in 1978, they wanted to reduce their taxes, especially so fixed-income seniors would not be forced out of their homes. Since then a large share of the benefit has gone to commercial properties. This is not how the proposition was promoted, and not what voters intended. First-time homebuyers have been hurt, while giant corporations have profited. As Controller I will apply Green Party values of social justice and community-based economics and audit these betrayals so the public can correct the situation. With 25 years experience in administration and financial systems, I'm ready to be Controller. We can unite and make our efforts count, while living happier lives. To understand what's going on, Follow The Money. To know what to do, ask critical questions and Follow Your Heart. Laura Wells Green Party P.O.

My education consists of: a B.A. in Psychology, a M.A. in Education, and a Ph.D. in Pastoral Psychology. One of the main jobs of Controller is issuing warrants that are paid by the Treasurer and that these warrants are legal and constitutional. I will attempt to do this job as defined by law. I support the proposed State Grand Jury Initiative. I am treasurer of three organizations: the Sacramento County A.I.P., the SCNRA Members Council, and of my local church.

Box 5065 Irvine, CA 92616 iaakos@yahoo.com www.natural-law.org  As California's Controller, I will use my expertise garnered over several decades as a business owner/entrepreneur to hold our state government accountable by auditing state agencies and cutting wasteful spending. In general, government is lax and inefficient compared to most private industry when it comes to fiscal accountability and responsibility to the stakeholders, in this case you, the taxpayers. I will use my extensive experience to uncover any improprieties such as financial fraud, while wielding the considerable power of the Controller to influence the state's spending policy towards areas such as education, infrastructure and public safety. I am a 3rd generation California native, Vietnam veteran and concerned father who understands the importance of honest government and is deeply committed to working for and representing every California citizen.  This election is a referendum on California's wasteful spending. The Controller is the watchdog of the state treasury--with legal authority to root out corruption, fraud and waste. As Controller, I will not only audit the state's wasteful bureaucracies, but I'll also target the special interests who try to use government to line their own pockets. This new breed of get-rich-quick corporate schemers give free enterprise a bad name by seeking lucrative government contracts in return for their campaign contributions. That's wrong, and it needs to stop now. I'm an experienced waste cutter, with a proven record of defending taxpayers, ratepayers and shareholders. As Controller, I'll take on wasteful government bureaucrats, corrupt politicians and big-dollar contributors, through regular performance audits and true across-the-board competitive bidding. Am I up to the job? You bet. I led the drive to abolish California's car tax. I sued to stop the $14 Billion rip-off of California ratepayers by the energy monopolies. I authored the Bureaucracy Reduction and Closure Commission Act. I've fought against waste and fraud in both Republican and Democratic administrations. And I'm endorsed by every major taxpayer organization. Our local schools suffer, our taxes rise, and we spend hours each day stuck in traffic, because our tax dollars are being plundered and wasted. As your State Controller, I will bring the full force of the law to the fight against waste, fraud and corruption. Because it's your money, not theirs.

Administers the sale of state bonds and notes and is the investment officer for most state funds.  Chairs or serves on several commissions, most of which relate to the marketing of bonds.  Pays out state funds when spent by the Controller and other state agencies.  If we don't change direction, we'll end up where we are going. And that's scary. California is a great state. We have the fifth largest economy in the world. The people of California are energetic, diverse, innovative and...well...great! I think we deserve better government than what we have. A vote for me is a vote for a sea change, a vote for a party that doesn't sit in the pocket of big contributors. The Green Party has a proven record of foresight, while other parties let California's pockets be picked over and over. The Green Party stood alone to oppose electricity deregulation from the beginning, long before blackouts and billions of dollars lost on foolish long-term contracts. Long before California's taxpayers and retirees lost millions due to criminal corporations such as Enron and Worldcom, the Green Party advocated using our investment clout to make corporations behave. Only the Green Party respects California's diverse people enough to include women and people of color in our slate. Only the Green Party has new ideas for addressing California's core concerns: corporate charter reform, instant runoff voting, funding schools not prisons, single payer health care; all to save money. The Green Party is the only party to present a balanced state budget which makes our state better, not worse! For more on the budget plan and other issues, see www.jeanne2002.org or www.cagreens.org. Vote for the only party which is not beholden to big contributors. Vote clean. Vote Green.

Our credit rating must be protected in these tense times. I am 59 years old and have lived in the San Diego area since 1959. Living there has made me familiar with international border problems. I graduated from Southwestern Jr. College in 1971. My employer since 1972 is San Diego Transit. I am a member of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1309 and serve on the Executive Board. I am pro-life. California taxpayer dollars should never be invested in a manner protecting or promoting abortion. We should protect lives of the unborn innocents, not execute them. I am pro-Second Amendment and believe that right should not be infringed. Those who use firearms to commit crimes should be dealt with firmly including capital punishment. Transportation in California is an everyday concern for all of us. Experience has taught me the need of public scrutiny to see if taxpayers are getting the most service for their transportation tax dollars. The Treasurer should aggressively pursue such an investigation. Nathan E.

I oppose the issuing of government bonds for any purpose, as this financing method almost doubles the cost of any government project and forces debt on our children and grandchildren. Voters should turn down Propositions 46, 47 and 50 on the November ballot, since these wasteful bonds will cost taxpayers $30.7 billion over 25 years if passed. The state must either pay for projects when they come up, or preferably, encourage private investment and development. I would have fought the plan last year to squander our state's $9 billion budget surplus on energy purchases. The subsequent politician-negotiated energy contracts border on the criminal, and continue to keep our electric rates high. The courts should overturn them. Libertarians favor less government across the board and are dedicated to protecting your personal freedom and economic liberty. You've seen how Democrats and Republicans act in public office.

Marian Smithson Libertarian Party 1677 Aspen Village Way West Covina, CA 91791 626-919-1593 mariansway@earthlink.net  My goal is to make California financially strong. I will be a watchdog for taxpayers and will lead the effort to cut government waste. California's credit rating has been downgraded multiple times in the last three years, now ranking second or third to last in the U.S. We need fiscal responsibility to restore a better credit rating for the state. California is faced with a mounting state deficit and with no clear vision or strategic plan for future capital expenditures. Without careful planning, our infrastructure--roads, schools, and public works--will further deteriorate. I will apply my in-depth public and private sector experience to streamline management and develop a strategic plan to finance California's growth without tax increases. Millions of taxpayer dollars are being wasted on higher interest payments instead of using the dollars towards improving California's quality of life. My qualifications and experience ideally match the requirements for Treasurer. I have over three decades of financial experience in business as a CPA and a senior partner in a CPA firm. I have excellent experience in controlling expenses and improving financial management. I gained hands-on experience serving on two of California's most critical agencies--the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) for six years, two years as President, and the California Transportation Commission for three years. My education includes a business degree, University of Utah, and a law degree, University of San Francisco. I was a U.S. Air Force captain and pilot. Greg Conlon Republican Party 2764 Spring Street, Suite 1A Redwood City, CA 94063 650-474-2688 www.GregConlonForStateTreasurer.com  The Treasurer's responsibility is to invest the taxpayers' money (your money) safely and wisely. My experience as an administrator with nonprofit organizations and for-profit businesses has given me insight and knowledge about investing in a positive, socially conscious manner, while still maximizing return. I will make intelligent, careful, forward-looking decisions today that will reap profits in the near future. The economy of California is larger than that of most foreign countries. With sound, practical, smart investing, devoid of political game playing and special interest influence, all the citizens of California should be able to count on a budget that can afford to accomplish those goals so vital to our state. Particularly important are the following: well-financed schools at every level of education including the junior college system; a continually maintained and improving infrastructure of roads, bridges, and public transportation; and enhanced public safety through crime prevention and the assurance of competitive salaries for police, firefighters, and emergency personnel. My first choice will always be to invest our state money in Californians and our communities. I will keep the economy growing and strong, while making life-supporting investments that will provide jobs and secure our future and that of our children. Sylvia Valentine Natural Law Party P.O.

I have worked hard to secure your trust by investing taxpayer funds smartly and prudently--earning solid returns while safeguarding the State's treasury. I led the charge to adopt first-in-the-nation policies to safeguard California's investment funds--establishing zero-tolerance standards for irresponsible corporations that engage in unethical and fraudulent practices like those of Enron and Arthur Andersen. By flexing California's financial muscle, I have sent a clear signal that corporations must behave responsibly or suffer the consequence of being banned from doing business with the State of California. I have cracked down on illegal bond deals and fraudulent investment schemes; saved taxpayers over $1 billion by refinancing bonds, taking advantage of historically low interest rates; and eliminated pension fund investments in risky, unstable foreign countries, while putting more of our money in sound investments here in California. Finally, as a husband and a father of three daughters, I know that we must invest in California's future to protect our quality of life. That's why, using my 15 years of private sector financial management experience, I created a prudent investment plan--earning over $7 billion in investment returns for taxpayers, while creating economic opportunity and jobs in California. I financed the construction and repair of over 1,000 California schools; created tax-free college savings accounts for California families; and provided loans and grants to over 300 community health clinics serving families and the elderly.

As Attorney General I would take the War on Drugs out of the criminal justice system and put it in the health care system where it belongs. I would end laws restricting the right to bear arms; establish a statewide system of police officer discipline run by the Attorney General's office, rather than local government; assure that the threestrikes law is applied only to violent felons; end the restriction on doctors practicing only ""conventional medicine"" and finally, I would encourage reform of D.M.V.'s hopeless bureaucracy. Finally, I would encourage businesses to put full walls and doors on public restroom stalls. Don't laugh, as I understand it Barbara Boxer made banning pay toilets a major theme of her campaign.

We're catching more rapists and child molesters because I kept my promise to build America's largest criminal DNA databank. I am honored that the California Association of Highway Patrolmen supports me for Attorney General. I prosecuted California's first-ever criminal case against abusive nursing homes. I'm honored to receive California AARP's top award for the work we're doing to prevent elder abuse. The California Police Chiefs' Association supports my reelection as Attorney General. Our Spousal Abuser Prosecution Program attacks domestic violence. Our Safe Schools Task Force helps protect children from violence. We've established the nation's first statewide counter-terrorist law enforcement network. And our narcotics agents shut down over 3,000 meth labs in 3 years.

I'm fighting for stronger privacy laws and helping victims of identity theft restore their good name. The California Coalition of Law Enforcement Associations has endorsed my record as Attorney General. I've protected Lake Tahoe and the Coast. I've strengthened Civil Rights Enforcement, and attacked hate crimes like no other Attorney General. The Peace Officers Research Association of California--representing 52,000 law enforcement/public safety officers--are asking their friends and families to vote for me.

My first priority will always be to protect you and your family at home, school and work. With your vote, I will: Defend California's laws, including the death penalty, from meddling, liberal federal judges. Weed-out corruption in state government, right up to and including, the Governor's office. Aggressively prosecute violent criminals and gangs. Strongly support President Bush in the war on terrorism. Work closely with Police and Sheriffs to protect local communities. I have the wide-ranging experience needed to be an effective Attorney General. I've practiced law for thirtyfour years, operated a business, served as a City Mayor, been elected to the State Legislature and served as a Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. As a State Lawmaker, I helped enact California's 10-20-Life law against gun-toting criminals. The author of the 3-Strikes-You're-Out law supports me for Attorney General. The state crime rate has risen almost six percent since 2000. Counties such as Fresno, San Joaquin, San Diego, and cities such as Los Angeles, Sacramento, Bakersfield, have all seen a dramatic rise in violent crime. The Attorney General's office can and must do a better job. Prosecutors, Police Officers and Crime Victims support me to turn things around and make California a safer place.

With more than 45,000 people in California prisons on drug charges we have proven the futility of the ""war on drugs."" It is a time for a war on inhumanity to our fellows. While thousands of people serve life sentences for minor thefts, multi-national businesses rip off vastly more with no accountability. It is a time for us to rethink who the enemy is. Too much is done out of fear. We are all victims of the repression that such fear is used to justify. It is time to fight for justice and equity by creating a criminal justice system that reflects the best values of our society, not the meanest; by treating all our people in a decent and ethical manner, respecting their potential as contributing and valued members of our community. The Attorney General must seek a justice recognizable to all the people of California, not just those who pay for it. For 24 years I served as Public Defender of Santa Barbara County. The past two years I have done pro bono work for the homeless. Thus, I know one overriding truth about the criminal justice system: it isn't nearly as just for the poor as it is for the wealthy and for corporations. Elect me as Attorney General and I guarantee to represent you, not the special interests. Thank you.

Licenses, regulates, and examines insurance companies.  Answers public questions and complaints regarding the insurance industry.  Enforces the laws of the California Insurance Code and adopts regulations to implement the laws.  It's time to insist on the benefit of good government and stop giving a corrupt system the benefit of the doubt. I stand for values not fund-raising. I stand for serving the people of California, not corporate interests. I stand for universal health coverage and for a workers' compensation system that focuses on returning workers to health before returning them to work. I stand for not allowing insurance companies to use their records about you in their marketing schemes without your permission. I stand for regulating the industry, not rubber stamping it. I will make sure the Department of Insurance responds to consumer complaints quickly and efficiently. I have broad management experience in the area of risk underwriting, including setting premiums for the State's Aid for Infants and Mothers (AIM) program and county run health systems. As a financial services executive, I direct the development of more efficient underwriting systems to help small businesses grow. I do not accept contributions from any corporate interests and neither does my party. Our only obligation is to serve the people of this State. A vote for me is a vote to reject the way the government is currently run and to restore the government to serving the people. David I. Sheidlower Green Party 4096 Piedmont Avenue #267 Oakland, CA 94611 510-428-9176 www.votesheidlower.org  In 1991 I became California's first elected Insurance Commissioner. I built an agency that protected consumers. Consumer groups called it America's best. My successor, Republican Chuck Quackenbush, was involved in a scandal and resigned in disgrace, destroying what I built. I ask for your vote so that I can rebuild and restore the integrity of the Insurance Department. This job requires a proven, committed fighter for consumers, not someone who works for the industry. I will not accept insurance company contributions. I fought the insurance companies, returning to consumers nearly $1 billion in rebates. We lowered auto, homeowner, and worker compensation premiums. I forced insurance companies to pay an additional $350 million to Oakland Hills Fire victims. Northridge earthquake victims, Laguna fire and Malibu fire victims also received my help. I led a statewide crackdown on insurance fraud. I will force insurance companies to serve all Californians by ending discrimination against the elderly, women, and minorities. I will fight for real Medicare prescription drug benefits, improvements in health insurance, long-term care and medi-gap insurance, and for lower auto insurance rates. I grew up on a cattle ranch, played college football, graduated from UC Berkeley and Harvard Business School. Patti and I were Peace Corps Volunteers in Africa. We have six children and six grandchildren. I served in the California State Senate and Assembly. In 1995, I served as Deputy Secretary of Interior in Washington DC, working to protect our National Parks and natural resources. I will fight for you, the consumer.

Ogden, am qualified to be California Insurance Commissioner by a lifetime of experience. I am founder of an insurance-oriented consulting firm in Los Angeles (established 1987) and have 28 years of diversified insurance and regulatory-related experience. I am an actuary with professional credentials for life-health and property-casualty insurance and have experience in virtually all areas of insurance. Among my hundreds of clients, I have consulted with and provided expert testimony for state insurance commissioners, executive agencies of the federal government, executive and legislative branches of state governments, and state-created automobile and workers compensation insurers and guaranty funds. Insurance is very competitive; literally hundreds of insurers compete for your business. I've helped improve insurance regulation by drafting laws and regulations and designing policies that streamline regulatory processes, eliminate dead weight, and let competition work. The budget of the Insurance Department has increased from $28,000,000 in 1988 to more than $150,000,000. Vast resources (taxpayer money) are wasted on redundant and useless regulation. I can reduce that bloated budget by at least $100 million without eliminating any meaningful services. Through my experience with insurance regulation throughout most of the fifty states, I've seen what works and what doesn't work; I've seen the harm done by both excessive zeal and abuse by elected and appointed politicians for their personal and political benefit. I would not make those mistakes nor commit those abuses. I have never held political office and, if elected, would never seek another political office. Dale F. Ogden Libertarian Party 3620 Almeria Street San Pedro, CA 90731 310-547-1595 dfo@dalefogden.org www.dalefogden.org  I will honestly and fairly supervise and regulate the insurance industry. It is time for the Insurance Commissioner and the department to focus on working for the people of California, not lining the pockets of large insurance companies. I will not accept special interest (PAC) money or donations from businesses of any kind for my campaign, and will serve only you, the citizens, who have every right to expect your elected officials to act in your best interest. There is no reason, other than ""politics as usual"", to not implement common sense solutions to problems such as the high cost of medical insurance, availability of cost-effective earthquake insurance, and uninsured drivers. My community-based work as an administrator/researcher in health psychology and social health has shown me that quality health care, emphasizing prevention and screening, would both improve an individual's health and cut costs, thereby lowering the skyrocketing expense of health insurance premiums. Insurance provides a vital safety net, our last line of protection when disaster hits. Health, automobile, homeowners, earthquake, and flood insurance should be available and affordable to everyone. I will be an honest, intelligent, nonpartisan, innovative Insurance Commissioner--not a politician. Ral Caldern, Jr. Natural Law Party P.O. Box 16854 Stanford, CA 94309 raulnlp@yahoo.com www.natural-law.org  During the last twelve years, the California Department of Insurance has been plagued by over-politicization, gross mismanagement and scandal. I will change that. I have a proven record of successfully fighting for California's consumers. To preserve my independence from special interests, I have not accepted contributions from insurance companies. As California's Commissioner of Corporations, I was responsible for leading a 425-person regulatory department with jurisdiction over HMOs, securities offerings, credit unions and mortgage bankers. As Commissioner, I created an 800 phone number program to respond to consumer complaints about their HMOs. I levied a landmark $500,000 fine against an HMO that denied necessary care to a 9-year-old girl suffering from cancer. I helped senior citizens and other small investors recover an additional $100 million after they were defrauded by a major brokerage firm. When Blue Cross of California wanted to convert from a non-profit organization to a for-profit corporation, I made certain that conversion resulted in the creation of two charitable foundations with more than $4 billion of assets. These foundations have improved the lives of tens of thousands of people throughout the State and increased access to health care for the uninsured. As Insurance Commissioner, I will fight to control auto insurance premiums and health care costs, preserve and strengthen the workers' compensation system, increase the availability of homeowners insurance and make the California Department of Insurance the effective watchdog that Californians expect and deserve.

Directs all functions of the Department of Education and executes policies set by the State Board of Education.  Serves as an ex-officio member of governing boards of the state's higher education system.  Works with the educational community to improve academic performance.  I am not a career politician trying to find a way to stay on the public payroll. Rather, I am a businesswoman, school board president, educator, civic volunteer and mother, who can no longer stand by and watch Sacramento politicians drive our schools into the ground. The first rule in choosing elected officials is to watch what they do, not what they promise. I'll take what I've accomplished in our large, diverse Anaheim Union High School District and extend those accomplishments statewide. The key to improving our schools has been to teach the basics. We also teach patriotism, civility and respect. Insisting that students wear appropriate academic attire has fostered less violence and vandalism and has raised academic achievement. A daily ""Moment of Silence"" has helped students focus. We have created an environment where children can learn and teachers can teach. Teachers must be role models: professional attire for teachers will set an example for their students to follow. Clean restrooms and school campuses are now a reality as well. Greater emphasis must be placed upon trade and technology courses so that all of our students are prepared to become productive members of society. Career politicians have not fixed our schools. We, the teachers, students and parents of California, will. I ask for your vote so we can take a failing school system away from the politicians and put parents back in charge of their children's education. We can build a better future for our children and for our country. Katherine H. Smith Nonpartisan 2166 W. Broadway Ave. #200 Anaheim, CA 92804 760-594-2090 smithforspi@pacbell.net www.kathysmith2002.com  Our schools can and must do even better. The future of our kids depends on it. We've got great teachers. They need real parental involvement and top quality training. As a teacher, I know the importance of involvement and good training. We have made some progress. As State Senator, I wrote the law that began to reduce class size and provided up-to-date textbooks. But we can't stop now. I won't rest until we reduce class size in every classroom. Smaller classes mean more personal attention from teachers. Sadly, I'm the only candidate committed to reducing class size. I will restore accountability by conducting performance audits of our schools. I'm a taxpayer who supports our schools, but I hate to see our money wasted. I will use these performance audits to ensure schools are accountable for how they spend our money; tax dollars should be spent in the classroom. These audits will ensure that every child has a certified teacher, modern textbooks and can attend a clean, safe school. I'm fighting to increase per-pupil spending, and I am the only candidate who has always opposed vouchers. We should increase funding for our public schools, not spend our tax dollars on voucher schools. I'm delighted to have the support of California's school teachers and education groups. California's leading newspapers say that I have been ""highly effective in bringing people together for the cause of education."" I would be honored to have your support so together, we can create quality public schools. Jack O'Connell Nonpartisan P.O.

THE ELECTORAL PROCEDURE Under the California Constitution, justices of the Supreme Court and the courts of appeal are subject to confirmation by the voters. The public votes ""yes"" or ""no"" on whether to retain each justice. These judicial offices are nonpartisan. Before a person can become an appellate justice, the Governor must submit the candidate's name to the Judicial Nominees Evaluation Commission, which is comprised of public members and lawyers. The commission conducts a thorough review of the candidate's background and qualifications, with community input, and then forwards its evaluation of the candidate to the Governor. The Governor then reviews the commission's evaluation and officially nominates the candidate, whose qualifications are subject to public comment before examination and review by the Commission on Judicial Appointments. That commission consists of the Chief Justice of California, the Attorney General of California, and a senior Presiding Justice of the Courts of Appeal. The Commission on Judicial Appointments must then confirm or reject the nomination. Only if confirmed does the nominee become a justice. Following confirmation, the justice is sworn into office and is subject to voter approval at the next gubernatorial election, and thereafter at the conclusion of each term. The term prescribed by the California Constitution for justices of the Supreme Court and courts of appeal is 12 years. Justices are confirmed by the Commission on Judicial Appointments only until the next gubernatorial election, at which time they run for retention of the remainder of the term, if any, of their predecessor, which will be either four or eight years.

The initiative democracy,"" is a propose change through their government. process, often referred to tool which citizens can use to California law instead legislative representatives as ""direct to directly of going in state  How to Qualify an Initiative for the Ballot The first step in the process is drafting the text of the proposed law (or measure). The proponent(s) or author(s) of the measure can write the text themselves, seek assistance from private counsel, or request assistance from the Office of the Legislative Counsel.  Proponent(s) must collect signatures equal to 5% of the total number of votes cast for all candidates for Governor at the last gubernatorial election to qualify an initiative proposing to change California statutes. If an initiative proposes to amend the California Constitution, proponent(s) must collect signatures equal to 8% of the total number of votes cast for all candidates for Governor at the last gubernatorial election.  Filing and Circulation Once the required number of signatures has been collected, the proponent(s) must file the petitions with the appropriate county elections official for signature verification. The initiative is considered qualified once the Secretary of State receives notification from the county elections officials certifying the petitions have been signed by the requisite number of registered voters.  Title and Summary Once the text has been drafted, the proponent(s) must submit a written request to the Attorney General, along with the text of the measure and $200, for an official title and summary of the measure.

GX016-22-11531791	"U.S. Department of the Interior       Office of the Secretary       For Immediate Release: October 12, 2000          Contact: Joan Moody 202/208-6416      SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR BRUCE BABBITT     PULLS DOWN FIRST SLAB OF     200-FOOT MATILIJA DAM IN CALIFORNIA    Ventura County, CA - Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt led a demonstration project today to help determine the best way to remove the looming Matilija Dam on the Ventura River in southern California. The dam is the largest ever proposed for removal.     Before climbing into a crane to pull away the first 16,000-pound slab of concrete from the face of the 200-foot dam, Babbitt noted, ""My previous dam-busting journeys were called 'sledgehammer tours,' but it's time to bring on the heavy equipment."" Secretary Babbitt previously has helped take down smaller dams in California and seven other states, including the Saeltzer Dam in northern California on October 6.    ""The Matilija Dam is symbolic not only because it could become the largest dam to be taken down anywhere in the world, but also because it is a prime example of dams that are environmentally harmful as well as useless. This ceremony marks a new era in America,"" said Babbitt.    Local, state and federal officials all support removal of the aging Matilija Dam. Built in 1947 to store drinking water and agricultural water for Ojai Valley, the dam is now full of silt, provides little water or flood protection, and is crumbling. Removal of the dam would restore runs of endangered southern California steelhead in the Ventura River system, re-establish natural beach sand supplies to Ventura County's eroding beaches, and provide recreational opportunities within Matilija Wilderness of the Los Padres National Forest.    ""The removal of some dams is more an act of creation than destruction,"" the Secretary has noted. ""Here in Ventura County a local-state-federal-private partnership is working to restore a watershed and create new recreational and economic opportunities.   What could be more American than restoration? It shows an optimism that the future will be better for both people and wildlife.""    Babbitt  joined California Assembly Member Hannah-Beth Jackson, Ventura County Board Chair Kathy Long, Ventura County Supervisor John Flynn and representatives of Secretary of Resources Mary Nichols, Rep. Elton Gallegly, Senator Barbara Boxer, and Senator Dianne Feinstein at the event.     The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, an Interior Department agency, participated in a broad-based task force comprised of a number of federal agencies, state and local governments, and private and nonprofit organizations.  The result was an appraisal study for the possible removal the Matilija Dam.     ""This day will be historic because we are charting a new course for the department and the nation,"" Babbitt said. ""The study of whether and how to take down such a huge structure is a new challenge for the Bureau of Reclamation. The Interior Department supervised the most intensive flurry of dam-building in world history, but with Matilija,  we are proving that we can meet the changing needs of communities by building coalitions as well as we can build dams.""    Babbitt said there are 75,000 dams in America six feet high and over. Some dams still meet community needs while others no longer provide water supply or flood control and endanger fish, wildlife, and related economic values.    ""The citizens of this area should be extremely proud of their community spirit and aware that the efforts of their neighbors as well as local, state and federal officials put Ventura County at the forefront of a new era in America,"" Babbitt says.      -DOI-        You can get to the Department of the Interior from here   You can also view the index of press releases   U.S. Department of the Interior, Washington, DC, USA"

In September 1876 it                                        was tapped to a depth of 617 feet by driller                                        Alex Mentry; the well was capped in September                                        1990.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           8.

The bill now goes to the Senate.   AB 2313 is sponsored by the California Association for the Gifted.  The bill is designed to improve the quality of Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) programs by simplifying the funding process and updating and restructuring the state criteria for reviewing local GATE applications.     ""Current policies and provisions for GATE programs have not been substantially reviewed for many years,"" Correa said.  ""AB 2313 introduces critical reforms to ensure that quality GATE programs are designed to enhance the educational opportunities for gifted and talented children in my district and throughout California.""    Current funding for GATE programs is based on a complex formula that provides varying amounts per student depending on the number of students enrolled in a given district.  AB 2313 streamlines the funding formula for GATE programs to allow each participating school district to receive the same amount per student and establishes a minimum funding amount for districts with fewer than 1,500 students.     In addition, AB 2313 requires the State Board of Education to adopt criteria for the evaluation and approval of GATE applications.    ""AB 2313 focuses GATE programs on those issues which are most important to quality education,"" Correa said.  ""They are the quality of staff development and teacher instruction, the quality of instructional materials, alignment with standards in the core curriculum, parental involvement, and assessment of student performance.""    ####     Capitol Office: P.O.

The researchers developed separate,         stand-alone reports on each of the three counties include an analysis of the oil         industry’s evolution and projected future, its relationships with the surrounding         communities, and its role in a complex economy. They also investigated the regulatory         context in which oil does business, and to the kinds of innovations developed to operate         in the Santa Barbara Channel’s natural and social environment. In addition to these         reports, they produced an inventory of all firms operating in the tri-counties during         these years, and which oil fields they operated (OCS Study MMS 98-0061).            This summary was developed by the researchers.           OBJECTIVES: Our goal is to provide an historical analysis of the evolution of the         petroleum extraction industry in Ventura County, including its changing business         structure, economic impacts, technological advances, local social contexts, and         governmental effects. We attempt to depict a comprehensive view of what an industry means         as it operates in a given locale, documenting a wide variety of both direct and indirect         consequences and relationships.           DESCRIPTION: Our methods are diverse, tailored to the specific research issue and         available data. We interviewed or consulted over 100 persons with relevant views or         information drawn from a wide variety of business, government, and civic groups. We         scrutinized government statistics from state, federal, and local agencies. We used         multivariate regression analysis to determine economic effects; we examined tax documents         to specify industry dollars contributed to the county tax base. Through interviews, phone         inquiries, and document searches, we derived estimates of the industry’s local         philanthropic contributions. We reconstruct, using state of California archives, a record         of company activities in terms of which firms operated in which fields at which time         points. We also provide information regarding oil firm adaptation and the role of         environmental consulting companies as part of the industry.           We provide information regarding local support and opposition to the industry,         including oil’s history in many communities. We indicate the nature of the         industry’s labor supply, including the wage levels of personnel. We analyze the kind         of regulations and local oversight faced by the industry and the way permitting         activities, regulations, and controversies impacted local government operations. We also         discuss technological advances stimulated by local drilling and production. Finally, we         offer scenarios of potential future local operations.           SIGNIFICANT CONCLUSIONS: The petroleum industry’s long presence in Ventura County         has had important impacts both on the industry and the region, but not always of the         expected kind. In economic terms, the effects have primarily been significant in terms of         contributions to the county tax base (especially in certain earlier periods), as opposed         to significantly stimulating growth in the private economy. In terms of business         structure, the Ventura County oil industry has consistently allowed room for small         operators and independent producers, despite dominance by major companies. In terms of         social context, the industry has been minimally controversial, probably due to its long         history in the county and popular recollections of the industry’s economic benefits.         New migrants to Ventura County are increasingly environmentalist and decreasingly aware of         oil’s local history, thus changing the context under which oil producers operate.           Unlike Santa Barbara County, Ventura County’s neighbor to the north, oil         regulation here was relatively lenient until the 1980s. Many oil projects operate under         permits issued in the 1950s, which include few conditions. The county’s revision of         oil permit conditions has coincided with a drop in new oil activity, meaning that while         the county is now as stringent as other coastal areas in terms of oil oversight, few         projects are subject to this scrutiny. Any new projects proposed for Ventura County,         including new offshore projects requiring onshore support (or onshore drilling apparatus),         would be carefully scrutinized.           STUDY RESULTS: The decline in volume of oil produced onshore in Ventura County was         compensated by offshore development, at least through the early 1980s. Based on our         econometric analysis, it appears that although oil activity has been a steady part of the         local economies over the period of our study, the region would have been equally as well         off economically had there been no such activity. We could not find, using our regression         analyses, any statistical pattern of positive impacts of the industry’s presence on         the overall scale of economic activity. In terms of property tax payments, the industry         paid over half of the county’s property taxes during the 1950s, but now contributes         just over one percent, or approximately $6,000,000 dollars in 1997-8.           The industry structure was remarkable in the degree that opportunities for new entrants         continued over time, rather than the tendency toward monopolization often characteristic         of industrial maturation. While major oil companies predominated until very recently,         large independents and smaller operators have constantly been a significant part of the         industry, keeping over 100 different producers in the fields of Ventura County across the         years. Turnover among producers (except, until recently, the major companies) has been a         regular feature of the county’s industry, with successive waves of operators finding         opportunity in the declining fields that no longer seemed as promising to previous         producers. That is true of OCS activity, where a significant shift continues of major         operators leaving the area, turning their investments over to smaller independents. Some         oil-related firms diversified beyond petroleum operations, including a significant sector         of environmental consulting which is strong in Ventura County and the tri-county region.           Ventura County differs from other central coast oil extraction regions in its limited         degree of organizing around oil as an environmental issue. Some local residents and         organizations have opposed or oil installations or worked for mitigations, but anti-oil         measures have not been put before county voters (as they have successfully been in Santa         Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties). The particulars of drilling offshore in the Santa         Barbara Channel, including regional resistance and characteristics of the physical         environment have motivated some technological innovations, including pollution abatement         systems and enhanced capacity to drill at great water depths. State and federal         regulations shape the context in which oil’s labor force operates in the Channel         region, and many offshore platform workers make Ventura County their home.           Current proposals for additional oil activities (and likely scenarios for the         near-term) involve one or two slant-drilling initiatives. Given the modest impacts of the         industry’s current production regime, it is doubtful that such operations will have         important aggregate impacts on the county’s economy, social make-up, or governmental         structure (although site-specific impacts will be scrutinized).

The Sonoma County District Attorney's office said search                      warrants were served in Marin, Sonoma and Napa counties. Two                      were served in San Rafael, one in Sebastopol and one in unincorporated                      Napa County.                      The targets of the probe are ""women's gifting clubs,''                      which operate under many names including ""Women Empowering                      Women,'' ""Female Philanthropy Circle,'' ""Prosper                      Forever,'' and variations of ""dinner'' and ""garden''                      clubs or circles.                     Offenders face charges of conspiracy, securities fraud, theft                      and tax evasion, according to the California Department of                      Corporations which said the scheme has surfaced in Sacramento,                      San Diego and other parts of the state recently.                     ""It's the same old beast dressed up in different ways,''                      a spokeswoman for the Department of Corporations said.                     Sonoma County authorities said the scams they are investigating                      are variations of one known in Sacramento as ""Women Helping                      Women.'' Eight women were arrested there last month. There                      were no arrests today in the North Bay, said Sonoma County                      Deputy District Attorney Dani Jo Handell.                     The scams depend on a tight regime of secrecy, phone conferences                      and e-mail and Internet involvement, Sonoma County authorities                      said.                     Women victims are lured into the scheme by promises of reaping                      $40,000 by bringing eight other women into the club or circle,                      each of whom contributes $5,000 then recruits eight more women.                     At the center of the circle is the ""bouquet'' who stands                      to make $40,000 through the recruitment of ""buds'' ""blooms''                      and ""blossoms'' as the circle divides. The Sebastopol                      ""garden circle'' employed this method, Handell said.                     Only a few players at the top of the pyramid, or center of                      the circle, receive a $40,000 payout before the scheme collapses,                      authorities said.                     Handell said the current variation of the age-old scheme                      is ""alarming'' because it is very regimented and holds                      training seminars on recruitment methods and uses the Internet                      to maintain its structure. Hundreds of women in the North                      Bay are involved, Handell said.                     Women who recognized the scheme for what it was when they                      were approached about it tipped off authorities, Handell said.                     The investigation in the North Bay has been going on for                      months, Handell said.                     ""This gets more sophisticated as time goes by,'' she                      said.                                                                                                                                                    • Securities   • Franchises  •  Off-Exchange Commodities  • Investment and Financial Services •  • Independent Escrows  • Consumer and Commercial Finance Lending  • Residential Mortgage Lending •         Back to Top of Page                © 2003 State of California.

Gore, Special Agent in Charge, San Diego Division of the Federal       Bureau of Investigation, announced the arrest today of a 28-year-old       computer hacker, BRET MCDANEL, in San Diego based on an indictment       obtained from the Federal Grand Jury in Los Angeles on July 10,       2001. MCDANEL was arrested without incident by FBI Agents at       his place of employment in Rancho Bernardo at approximately 12:30       p.m. today.         MCDANEL was indicted for hacking       into and causing damage to the computer system of MCDANEL's former       employer, TORNADO DEVELOPMENT, in August and September 2000,       in violation of Title 18, Section 1030, Unauthorized Intrusion       into a Federal Interest Computer. TORNADO DEVELOPMENT provides       unified email, voice mail, and paging services for several large       Fortune 500 companies, some with international offices, in addition       to their smaller customers. Losses were estimated in excess of       $325,000.         The U.S. Attorney's Office in       Los Angeles is handling this prosecution, and Assistant U.S.       Attorney (AUSA) Pamela Johnston has been assigned to this matter.         As an ex-employee of Tornado,       BRET MCDANEL spammed Tornado's system by sending disparaging       email to thousands of Tornado's customers, causing a denial-of-service       attack and forcing Tornado to shut down its system. MCDANEL accessed       Tornado's system five times between August 17, 2000, and September       5, 2000, twice gaining unauthorized access to Tornado's mail       server, then spamming approximately 11,000 of Tornado's customers       on three occasions.         These intrusions into Tornado's       system resulted in a loss of approximately $325,000 to Tornado.       Three search warrants were issued and executed in October, 2000.       Agents seized computers and conducted interviews pursuant to       these warrants which contributed to the indictment of MCDANEL.

GX029-57-12491431	DATE:               May 16, 2000                                        TO:                 Board of Supervisors                                        SUBJECT:               Providing Incentives To Use Mass Transit                                 SUMMARY            Overview:            Every day in San Diego County, more than 1.1 million people travel to            and from work. The vast majority            of these commuters travel by themselves in a car. It is estimated that            only two percent of those traveling to             and from work use mass transit. Fortunately, San Diego has some mass            transit options - like our Trolley,             the Coaster, and our bus system. The trick is getting San Diego County            residents who might not use or even            think of these options to give them a try. That is why the San Diego            Regional Chamber of Commerce has worked            with State Senator Dave Kelley to develop legislation that provides            a financial incentive in the form of tax credits for employers and employees            to encourage use of mass transit. The recommended actions ask the Board            to support Senate Bill 1754. In addition, to further encourage and facilitate            County employees' use of mass transit, the Chief Administrative Officer            will be directed to examine the feasibility of providing County pool            cars that can be used in case of emergency by County employees who commute            via mass transit. The Chief Administrative Officer will also be directed            to examine the feasibility of establishing incentive programs for companies            within the County to offer pool cars to their employees who use mass            transit.            Recommendations:             SUPERVISOR RON ROBERTS:           Direct the Chief Administrative Officer to do the following:                                                 1. Direct the County's Sacramento representative to convey the Board's              support for Senate Bill 1754 to all appropriate State legislative              members and committees.             2. Examine the feasibility of providing County pool cars for County              employees who use mass transit to commute to and from work to access              in case of emergency.                          3. Examine the feasibility of establishing incentive programs for              companies within San Diego County to offer pool cars to their employees              who use mass transit to commute to and from work.                                     Fiscal Impact:            There is no fiscal impact associated with this action.           BACKGROUND            While finding solutions to our growing traffic problem presents a complex            challenge, figuring out where this problem comes from is not very difficult.            Every day in San Diego County, more than 1.1 million people travel to            and from work.* The vast majority of these commuters travel by themselves            in a car. It is estimated that only 2 percent of residents in the San            Diego region use mass transit to get to and from work.           Fortunately, San Diego has some mass transit options - like our Trolley,            the Coaster, and our bus system. The trick is getting San Diego County            residents who might not use or even think of these options to give them            a try. That is why the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce has been            working diligently with State Senator Dave Kelley to develop incentives            to use mass transit in San Diego County.            Senate Bill 1754, authored by Senator Kelley and supported by the Chamber,            would create a five-year pilot project to provide incentives in the            form of tax credits for employers and employees to use mass transit            in San Diego County. Specifically, AB 1754 would allow a tax credit            for an employer in redevelopment areas and areas of high employment            density for 40 percent of the amount sold or incurred for providing            subsidized public transit passes to an employee. For employees, this            measure would allow for a tax credit of up to 40 percent of the transit            pass cost for using any of a variety of transit programs, depending            on the number of days they use public transit. The idea is to give a            bigger incentive for more frequent ridership. An employee will receive            a credit of 20 percent of the transit pass cost if they use mass transit            at least 40 days per year. If an employee uses mass transit at least            80 days per year, they will receive a 40 percent tax credit.            The recommended actions ask the Board to support Senate Bill 1754.            In order to further encourage and facilitate County employees' use of            mass transit, the Chief Administrative Officer will be directed to examine            the feasibility of providing County pool cars that can be used in case            of emergency by County employees who commute via mass transit. The Chief            Administrative Officer will also be directed to examine the feasibility            of establishing incentive programs for companies within the County to            offer pool cars to their employees who use mass transit.            In developing this legislation, the San Diego Chamber of Commerce and            Senator Kelley have found that many people simply do not think of mass            transit. In addition, many people never try commuting via mass transit            because they have simply never been presented with enough of an incentive            to break the habit of using their car. It is hoped that a well-publicized            financial incentive in the form of a tax credit will provide sufficient            encouragement for some San Diego County residents to try mass transit.                     Additionally, for some who might be willing and able to use mass transit,            one of the reasons for not doing so is concern about being able to leave            the job site during the workday to attend meetings or in case of emergency.            For example, let's say a working mom with two children in school lives            in Carlsbad and works in Sorrento Valley is willing to try the Coaster            to get to and from work in order to avoid the I-5 commute. If an emergency            were to happen and she needed to get to her children during the day            when no Coasters are running, she would have to have another option.            In such cases, a car provides more flexibility than mass transit. That            is why an essential part of this pilot program is encouraging employers            to provide pool cars for employees to use while at the office, so that            they have a range of options in case of emergency or meetings outside            the office.            Mass transit is by no means the only solution to traffic in San Diego.            Furthermore, it will not work for everyone. The fact is that many San            Diegans will continue to rely on their cars and that increased road            capacity must be a major part of any long-term plan to alleviate traffic            congestion. However, mass transit certainly can be part of the solution.           By providing people with a financial incentive to get out of their            cars and give mass transit a try, we may be able to have a favorable            impact on traffic and show some San Diego County residents a workable            alternative to daily gridlock. By providing pool cars to employees who            use mass transit, we can make it that much more attractive for those            who want to give public transportation a try, but are concerned about            getting stranded in case of an emergency.           I urge your support.           RON ROBERTS            Supervisor, Fourth District           * Statistics Source: San Diego Association of Governments

""I said, 'I need to get                                a commitment from you guys that you're serious about                                the Bolsa Chica mesa,' "" Harman said he replied.                                The mesa is a 212-acre chunk of land overlooking                                the Bolsa Chica wetlands in Huntington Beach that                                is currently slated for homes. For at least 30 years,                                the area has been coveted by environmentalists eager                                to preserve some of California's last remaining                                wetlands. Harman said Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson                                and Peace gave their word that the sale would go                                through, along with the purchase of a separate,                                smaller section of the Bolsa Chica mesa where Indian                                burial artifacts had been found.

In farmed salmon, they are about 27 parts per billion,                                far below the FDA levels of 2,000 parts per billion.

So, taking advantage of the same process,                                Dianne Wassenich the only paid employee of the San                                Marcos River Foundation, applied for a permit for                                control of 40 billion gallons of water each year.                                Her goal, however, was to leave it where it was,                                coursing through South Texas' Guadalupe and San                                Marcos rivers before spilling into the bays and                                estuaries that form the northern rim of the Gulf                                of Mexico. The permit application marked an attempt                                to turn a law designed specifically for economic                                development into a tool for conservation. Wassenich                                is quick to point out that her campaign is not just                                an exercise in tree-hugging. In addition to wildlife,                                the shores of the Gulf support 30,000 commercial                                fishermen, who run a $575-million-a-year business,                                and a thriving tourism industry.                                     Texas officials denied                                Wassenich's application this spring, prompting the                                organization to file a lawsuit now seen by some                                analysts as a bellwether for the West. And the support                                she has received from an unusual coalition of sportsmen,                                shrimpers, kayakers and innkeepers has forced Texas                                to join a growing list of states struggling with                                the notion that the best use of water, in some cases,                                might be to do nothing with it at all. Wassenich's                                foundation is part of an emerging movement to turn                                Western environmental policy on its ear by labeling                                conservation a ""beneficial"" purpose for                                river water. The result of their efforts could play                                a significant role in determining how Western states                                will weigh increasing demand on a limited water                                supply if the population continues to balloon as                                predicted over the next 50 years.

A high-end collection of one-acre                                and half-acre lots with homes of 3,000-plus square                                feet, had been built on the site of an old Union                                Oil Co. tank farm torn down in 1952. Today, years                                after purchasing that lot and 23 surrounding properties,                                Unocal is tearing down the homes and digging out                                the dirt and replacing it with fresh fill. Bill                                Almas, Unocal's spokesman said, ""What we are                                doing now at is entirely voluntary.

When a massive oil                                leak was detected under the town of Avila Beach                                Unocal was ordered to pay $16 million in government                                fines. The company spent what experts believe was                                more than an additional $100 million to buy up the                                waterfront businesses, tear them down and reconstruct                                the area. Another project for Unocal involves the                                cleanup of 9 million gallons of a chemical diluent                                at Guadalupe Dunes, an environmentally sensitive                                area 12 miles west of Santa Maria at the mouth of                                the river. Three hundred former oil sump sites are                                being monitored by the company, most in the outlying                                agricultural areas that soon may be overrun by housing.                                And at four locations around Santa Maria, where                                there once were sumps and oil wells, individual                                homes have been purchased and torn down and the                                earth has been dug out.

Because the nearest fire                                hydrant is six miles away, the Riverside County                                Fire Department had for years allowed trash fires                                at the dump to burn themselves out.

Weiss, Times Staff Writer                                     Before the onslaught                                of commercial whaling whales were far more plentiful                                in the North Atlantic than previously thought, according                                to new genetic analysis. The population figures                                matter because a ban on commercial whaling that                                began in 1986 is to remain in effect until whale                                populations rebound to more than half of those pre-hunting                                levels. Until now, the best evidence for calculating                                historic whale populations came from painstaking                                efforts to sift through the logbooks of old whaling                                ships from the 17th through most of the 20th century.                                     The new study appears                                in today's issue of the journal Science. Tiny mutations                                in mitochondrial DNA accumulate slowly over time.                                As a result, how much the mitochondrial DNA in one                                whale differs from that of another indicates how                                many generations have passed since the two had a                                common ancestor. That, in turn, lets scientists                                estimate the size of the ancestral population. The                                estimates from the genetic study are much higher                                than those derived from the logbooks. ""Whaling                                logbooks provide clues, but may be incomplete, intentionally                                underreported, or fail to consider whales that were                                struck and lost,"" Roman and Palumbi wrote in                                their article.

The deal, under a pact                                signed in 2002, would have exchanged 135,000 acres                                of federal land for 108,000 acres of state parcels.

That vision includes filling the                                downtown with more homes and shops to further energize                                the city's core, while limiting construction in                                the hillsides to ensure the natural border between                                Brea and Los Angeles County remains.

The ruling by a three-judge                                panel of the state Court of Appeal found in March                                that Los Angeles County officials relied on overly                                optimistic water projections in approving the West                                Creek project. The ruling was hailed by slow-growth                                activists who warn that residents of future subdivisions                                throughout Southern California could be relying                                on water that the State Water Project cannot deliver                                from Northern California even in the wettest years.                                                                                             Happy Off-Road Trails for All?                                 Monday, July 21, 2003, Los Angeles Times, By                                Janet Wilson, Times Staff Writer                                     Environmentalists                                and off-roaders have joined forces to back an unusual                                park in Riverside County. The $30-million state                                off-road vehicle park envisioned for 2,600 acres                                east of Moreno Valley would be the first created                                in California in two decades, officials said. There                                are currently seven state off-road vehicle recreation                                areas,. The plan would create an off-road vehicle                                recreational area in the so-called Badlands, a region                                of bone-dry, undulating hills south of California                                60 between Moreno Valley and Beaumont. About $7                                million in state and county funds would buy and                                lay out the park, and $27 million from the state's                                off-road vehicle trust fund would go toward buying                                a 4,000- to 6,000-acre buffer zone to protect wildlife                                and forestall development. The theory is that setting                                aside a place to ride legally will curb illegal                                ridership elsewhere — and the environmental                                damage that goes with it.                                                                                             Hairy Problem Arises as Bear Population Grows                                 Monday, July 21, 2003, Los Angeles Times, By                                Hilda Muñoz, Times Staff Writer                                     The number of California                                black bears has nearly tripled, to about 30,000,                                since the 1980s, said Doug Updike, a senior wildlife                                biologist with the Fish and Game Department. As                                their population grows, the bears are moving beyond                                their normal terrain in Northern California into                                the Central Coast and Southern California, Updike                                said. As the number of bears increases, so do their                                encounters with people. Most are sightings, but                                others involve bears trespassing on private property.                                Black bears can significantly damage homes, cars                                and other property, Updike said. That's when Fish                                and Game might issue a disgruntled landowner a depredation                                permit, giving permission for the bear's elimination.                                As a result of 241 permits issued in 2002, 111 bears                                were put to death.                                                                                             Battle                                looms over Sutter Buttes                                 Monday, July 21, 2003, Pasadena Star News, By                                Brian Melley, Associated Press                                     The Sutter Buttes,                                50 miles north of Sacramento, may be known as the                                world's smallest mountain range. The Buttes are                                the only bump in the 450-mile long plain that lies                                between the Coast Ranges and the Sierra Nevada.                                Joe Hughes, a rice and walnut farmer who owns Peace                                Valley with other investors, wants to remove some                                of the mystique surrounding the 50,000-acre mountain                                range. He thinks a park is the best way to save                                the land forever. They plan to keep about 200 acres                                and sell the rest of their 2,000-acres to the state                                at market value. With housing gobbling up land for                                an additional 500,000 state residents a year, now                                is the time to set land aside for future generations,                                said parks spokesman Steve Capps. The state Department                                of Parks and Recreation is preparing to negotiate                                buying the 1,785-acre Peace Valley under a voter-approved                                $2.6 billion bond package that includes $225 million                                for buying new park land.                                     On the Net: Middle                                Mountain Foundation:  http://www.middlemountain.org/                                                                                           'Green'                                buildings to save greenbacks                                 Monday, July 21, 2003, Los Angeles Daily News,                                By Lisa M.

In the nine-campus district, officials                                plan more than 40 ""green"" buildings that                                will feature everything from solar panels to wind-harnessing                                generators that will heat swimming pools and chill                                water for campus air-conditioning systems. The planned                                buildings will meet a new voluntary national standard                                for leadership in energy and environmental design.

Huntington Harbour                                has long been a symbol of the good life. But serious                                environmental problems are threatening the community's                                quality of life, and years of unchecked silt deposits                                have left some places so shallow that boats sit                                in the mud or cannot pass at low tide. Once in the                                canals and main channel, polluted water and debris                                become trapped in a harbor that lacks the surf and                                ocean currents needed to flush out the runoff. Last                                month, the federal government added the harbor to                                its list of impaired bodies of water after the Environmental                                Protection Agency found unacceptable levels of polychlorinated                                biphenyls, better known as PCBs, and dieldrin, a                                pesticide similar to DDT, that was banned in 1973.                                     Now in the works are                                two proposals that would divert dry-season runoff                                from county flood-control channels into artificial                                wetlands that would filter the water before release                                into Huntington Harbour. The projects, however,                                would not be able to handle the enormous flows of                                runoff during the rainy season.

The proposal                                is the brainchild of Councilman Brian Brennan, Ventura                                County Supervisor Steve Bennett and Marc Beyler,                                an official with the California Coastal Conservancy.

The proposals                                focus on recycling, conservation and desalination,                                avoiding controversial projects such as dams. The                                bill would provide $28 million in federal funding                                to help pay for 22 feasibility studies, with state                                and local agencies providing an equal sum.

Those claims are                                disputed by the Pentagon and its defense contractors,                                whose scientists say perchlorate is only dangerous                                in higher concentrations.

The project is estimated to cost                                $4.5 million. County officials say the dams would                                save up to 3,600 acre-feet of water a year; storm                                water runoff that usually ends up in the ocean.

The property lies in the middle                                of the Puente-Chino Hills Wildlife Corridor, about                                40,000 acres of mostly undeveloped hillside that                                run about 30 miles from the Riverside Freeway toward                                the San Gabriel River Freeway near Whittier. For                                two decades, public agencies, with help from local                                conservation groups, have been buying land in the                                corridor. The Aera property, environmentalists say,                                is critical to their preservation plans.                                     The Aera property                                became even more important for preservation efforts                                after the city of Industry bought 2,525 acres in                                Tonner Canyon, east of the oil field, and announced                                plans to build a dam and reservoir interrupting                                a portion of the corridor. To the south of Industry's                                property and Aera's project are 500 additional undeveloped                                acres that Brea hopes to purchase and add to the                                corridor by linking the Aera property to the east                                with Carbon Canyon Regional Park and the state park.

According to the                                report, former employees said Wyle pumped excessive                                amounts of dangerous chemicals from rocket fuels                                into the air, and that dumping solvents and oils                                in the fields surrounding test sites was standard                                practice.

But thanks to a dedicated                                cadre of supporters, the precious resource will                                be returned to a reasonable facsimile of the lush                                coastal estuary that existed more than 100 years                                ago -- before hunters walled off Bolsa Chica from                                the sea, creating ponds to draw more ducks into                                their gun sights.

The county has also joined its cities                                in creating three farmland buffer zones —                                totaling about 45,000 acres — meant to separate                                the communities from each other with fields of crops.                                                                     As Yolo County's population                                has doubled since 1970, the number of residents                                in each of its cities has about tripled.

The board                                vote pleased neither farmers nor environmentalists,                                who have been battling over farm runoff pollution                                for years.

The vote was based primarily on a desire to learn                                more about the Long Beach Water Department's high-tech                                research project,.

The commissioners were set to vote on the pilot                                project's permit, but a couple filed an appeal,                                citing concerns about potential negative impacts                                on marine life.

Los Angeles County has operated the state-owned                                park for more than three decades, but earlier this                                year county officials — facing a $4-million                                hole in their parks budget — decided to turn                                operations over to the state. A similar decision                                was made for a smaller state-owned park, the Placerita                                Canyon Natural Area, just east of Santa Clarita.                                The county park system's budget problems are the                                result of rising utility and workers' compensation                                costs, and of the nearly $2-million annual operating                                losses at Castaic Lake, said county parks spokeswoman                                Sheila Ortega. State officials, facing a $38-billion                                budget shortfall, were surprised by the county's                                decision and say they may not be able to keep the                                two parks running.

Assistant City Manager Ann Negendank said                                the city would most likely lease the land from the                                Army Corps of Engineers. The new course would go                                in at the old Pico Rivera Campgrounds, near the                                Pico Rivera Sports Arena -- land that is owned by                                the Corps of Engineers.

The trio recently won a $331,000 grant from the                                Rivers and Mountains Conservancy. The city is working                                on several projects to showcase native plants in                                local parks, including the new Eaton Wash park,                                said Todd Holmes, landscape architect for the city.

The Bureau of Land Management's proposed West Mojave                                Plan is already drawing criticism from all directions.                                The largest habitat conservation plan ever developed                                in the United States, the West Mojave Plan encompasses                                9.3 million acres from Lancaster and Palmdale to                                Twentynine Palms and out into San Bernardino and                                Inyo counties. But the plan also proposes measures                                to protect more than 100 other desert animals, reptiles,                                birds and plants. It includes regulating well-water                                pumping in the Mojave River basin, protecting the                                Mojave River vole and adding insulation or perches                                on electric poles to protect ferruginous hawks.

The Bush                                administration is raising such collisions to a new                                level. One recent example was deletion of a section                                on global warming in a broad study of the state                                of the U.S. environment. Another was the brushoff                                given scientific findings in repealing a ban on                                snowmobiles in Yellowstone National Park. Now comes                                the cheerful scrubbing of a report to the United                                Nations on environmental dangers to Yellowstone                                National Park, established in 1872 as the world's                                first national park and designated in 1978 as a                                world heritage site. The original Park Service draft                                listed all the remaining problems, many of which                                are worse now than they were in 1995.

The conservation groups oppose the BLM's                                decision to abandon a 3-year-old policy that set                                aside about 50% of the dunes to protect the Pierson's                                milk vetch plant and the desert tortoise.

But it's moving in the opposite direction double-checking                                studies, making research cash tight, and now, reportedly,                                even imposing a gag order on Environmental Protection                                Agency comments until a new federal study is done                                in six or 12 months.                                      Two new studies involved                                testing of leafy vegetables and raise fresh concerns                                that this isn't just a question of the water residents                                of inland areas of California are drinking. All                                19 samples in a Press-Enterprise project revealed                                perchlorate, most in a range of 7-12 parts per billion.                                The Environmental Working Group tested 22 samples.                                Four samples showed more than 30 parts per billion                                of perchlorate.

In an order handed down                                late Tuesday after a Sacramento hearing, U.S. District                                Judge Morrison C. England Jr. found that environmental                                groups challenging the sale had made a strong case                                that timber debris left from the project would stoke                                future blazes and that logging would harm wildlife                                habitat. Though it involves a small area, the case                                touches on the much larger issue of how the Bush                                administration is reacting to wildfire threats in                                the West. The administration is trying to increase                                logging on federal land, arguing that public forests                                must be thinned of dense growth that can fuel destructive                                wildfires.

The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously                                voted to consider fees of between $859 and $1,651                                per new home, and $5,620 per acre for new commercial                                and industrial development. The conservation fees                                are expected to generate more than $600 million                                in the next 25 years and would be used to acquire                                56,000 acres of habitat for nearly 150 species.                                In exchange, developers could be granted sweeping                                exemptions to the cumbersome permit process required                                under environmental laws.                                     Borre Winckel of the                                Building Industry Assn.'s Riverside County chapter                                said that state and federal funds were originally                                supposed to pay for two-thirds of the habitat acquisition,                                and the local share was to be one-third. That has                                changed to two-thirds coming from local fees, after                                federal officials said that county planners needed                                to increase their share to qualify for the permit                                exemptions.

Walnut Creek Wilderness                                Park is a sliver of green amid a sea of red-tile                                roofs, concrete roads and fast-food restaurants.                                Walnut Creek's bigger sister, Frank G. Bonelli Park,                                another Valley gem, is the source of the creek which                                winds through the 170-acre park. Now two housing                                developments propose adding 118 homes to rim the                                creek, and environmentalists are concerned about                                the irreversible effects on this natural resource.                                We ask that any impact report for slated development                                carefully consider the effect on the wilderness                                park, not just the immediate surroundings.

Breast-feeding infants and fetuses are                                at risk of behavior disorders and cancer if they                                are exposed to high levels of dioxins. Limiting                                dioxins years before women become pregnant would                                reduce the risk of passing the chemicals to babies                                through the placenta and breast milk. Dioxins, or                                dioxin-like compounds can be released when industrial                                waste is burned.

Releases during 2001, the most recent reporting                                year, have been cut by more than half since 1988,                                the EPA said. But the data show an upswing in the                                release of at least one highly toxic substance,                                dioxin, which rose to 148,759 grams, although the                                EPA says the long-term trend is toward reduced dioxin.                                                                     Because of a change                                in reporting rules, more companies were obligated                                to disclose their lead releases. Much of the lead                                found in the environment today comes from mining                                tailings, fertilizers and from smokestacks at fossil                                fuel power plants. At very high levels it can cause                                anemia and kidney damage, but recent studies show                                that at low levels it can impair learning development                                in children.

The proposed train system, running                                from the Bay Area to San Diego, also would consume                                less land than expanding existing transportation                                modes.

Irvine's Plan to Annex El Toro Is Challenged                                 Tuesday, July 1, 2003, Los Angeles Times, By                                Jean O. Pasco, Times Staff Writer                                     Irvine's plan to annex                                the former El Toro Marine base has been challenged                                in a lawsuit that, if successful, would dash the                                Navy's hopes of auctioning the base land by year's                                end. The suit was filed Friday in Orange County                                Superior Court by the Airport Working Group of Orange                                County and the Orange County Regional Airport Authority,                                two groups that support building an airport at the                                site. The groups criticize the city for failing                                to properly address the noise, traffic and air pollution                                that would accompany private development of about                                2,400 acres of the former base. They also contend                                that Irvine dramatically understated the amount                                of building allowed by its zoning. What Irvine calls                                its Great Park is a defunct blueprint for spacious                                parkland, meadows and open space that cannot and                                won't be built because of the Navy's desire to sell                                the land for top dollar, the lawsuit contends.

GX016-56-16261250	"6/28/01   ( print version )           Two International Energy Firms Held In Contempt             Morrow Makes Formal Contempt Motion, Votes ""Aye""             For Immediate Release Contact: Wade Teasdale 916-445-3731    This afternoon Senator Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside) made the formal motion and then voted to hold two giant energy firms in contempt of legislative subpoenas.    The contempt finding against Enron and Mirant was made by the California Senate’s Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market.  The committee is charged with determining whether and how market participants acted improperly to drive up the Golden State’s electricity prices during the past year.    “This finding is based solely on the failure of these firms to provide any documents in response to months-old subpoenas issued by the Senate for documents,” said Morrow, whose 38th Senate District encompasses northwest San Diego County and southern Orange County.  “Prior to today, no firm had provided any document requested by the committee.”    “It is not an indication of the culpability of these firms in the state’s ongoing energy crisis.  However, it is an indication that these firms have refused to help the committee determine their degree of culpability,” added the senator.    Six energy firms just escaped being included in the contempt citation.  Duke, Reliant, Williams, NRG and AES were exempted by amendment from the original motion as the committee hearing progressed.  Two firms avoided being held in contempt by delivering thousands of documents to the committee’s offices even as the committee worked publicly in a hearing room elsewhere in the State Capitol Building.  Several others agreed to immediately begin establishing a document depository near the Capitol.    Morrow said, “On July 10th the committee will meet again.  We’ll vote on whether or not to send the finding to the full Senate on how to sanction the firms for noncompliance with the subpoenas.”"

GX035-03-2304596	"The Santa Clara Depot today is                      a museum devoted to the history of railroads in California                       Photograph by Judith Silva, courtesy of the City of Santa                      Clara                                                   The Santa Clara passenger depot, the oldest operating railroad                  depot in California, was constructed by the San Francisco & San                  Jose Railroad Company in 1863. The 24'x50' board and batten depot                  was one of the two ""way stations"" built between San Francisco                  and San Jose. Plans for a railroad linking San Francisco and San                  Jose began as early as 1851. Though this scheme ultimately failed,                  the incorporation of the San Francisco and San Jose Railroad in                  1859 met with success. Most of the financing for the project came                  from county government in San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara                  counties, with the University of Santa Clara and local industry                  also playing a significant role in both stock acquisition and                  choice of placement of the depot in Santa Clara. The first passenger                  service to San Francisco started in January 1864. The Southern                  Pacific Railroad acquired the San Francisco & San Jose Railroad                  in 1868. The depot, originally erected on the east side of the                  railroad tracks, was moved to its present location in 1877 and                  attached to the existing 32'x50' freight house constructed several                  years earlier. Also, because of the large volume of agricultural                  freight shipped from the depot, the freight house was increased                  in size at that time to its present dimensions of 32'x160'.                                                                                                  The Santa Clara Depot is the                      oldest passenger depot in California                        Photograph by Judith Silva, courtesy of the City of Santa                      Clara                                                                                          On November 1, 1877, the  San Jose Mercury  reported the facility                nearing completion. Following construction of the railroad, farming                and fruit-related industries developed in the Santa Clara area,                with the depot serving as a focal point for shipping. Rail service                provided the fast, direct link to San Francisco and, in the later                1870s, to Southern California. Typical of these efforts were those                of James A. Dawson, who pioneered the area's fruit-canning industry                in 1871. By the turn of the century, the Pratt-Low Preserving Company,                the largest fruit packing plant in central California, was located                just south of the depot. Caltrans acquired the depot from Southern                Pacific in 1980. In cooperation with California Department of Transportation,                the South Bay Historical Railroad Society, a nonprofit group founded                in 1985, began renovation work in 1986 on the depot, by then badly                in need of repair. A group of dedicated volunteers spent over 25,000                hours hauling away debris, replacing support timbers, siding, exterior                decking and interior flooring, scraping peeling paint, painting                and many other repairs. With the major renovation now complete,                this 139-year-old building hosts a railroad library and museum while                still serving its original function as a passenger depot.                   The museum is located in the restored Depot where model railroads                  are on display and school groups are offered courses which emphasize                  the influence of the railroad on California's history. Museum                  hours are Tuesday from 6:00 - 9:00pm and Saturdays from 10:00am.                  - 4:00pm. The Santa Clara Railroad Depot is located at 1005 Railroad                  Ave. in Santa Clara.

When any labor union activity occurs in the Sheriff's Department's jurisdiction, the Labor unit is the first to be notified. The unit was involved with two major strikes during the past year. One of these strikes involved Overnite Trucking, located in Fontana. This company is currently on strike and has been since October 24, 2000. The other major strike was Philips Products, located in Rancho Cucamonga. This strike lasted from May 5, 2001, until the plant closed on October 17, 2001.      Prior to any labor strike, job action, jurisdictional dispute or any attempt to organize taking place in San Bernardino County, the Sheriff's Labor unit is notified. The unit meets with management and union representatives prior to any dispute and informs them of the Sheriff""s Department guidelines as to how the strike should be conducted. The unit also coordinates the Department's response to any labor union activity. The unit keeps in contact with management and labor union officials throughout Southern California. Some of the unions the unit deals with on a constant basis are: the Teamsters, Carpenters, Iron Workers, Operating Engineers, Cement Masons, United and Food Commercial Workers, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Communication Workers of America, the Central Labor Council, and the Building Trades.  The last two operate throughout both San Bernardino and Riverside counties.       The unit is notified many days prior to a labor dispute or job action by either union officials or by management. This notification serves to provide the department with updated and current labor union activity. The unit also participates in and is a member of the California Association of Labor Relations Officers (CALRO).  CALPRO keeps all California law enforcement officers informed about union activity throughout the state and provides updated yearly training for dealing with strikes and demonstrations.        © Copyright 2002 San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department.

GX016-43-7818969	5/16/02   ( print version )           Get Shorty and Fat Boy Meet The Blind Pig             David Freeman Calls For The State To Get Its Money Back From Out-Of-State Energy Producers But Is Silent On LADWP             For Immediate Release “We want our money back.”  That’s the message that State Senator Ross Johnson (R-Irvine) sent to David Freeman, California’s Energy Czar, in reference to overcharges by Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.    Freeman testified at a hearing yesterday in Washington, D. C. that California should receive immediate refunds from Enron for overcharges during the energy crisis.  Freeman told the Senate Energy Subcommittee on Water and Power:  “We want our money back.”    Johnson criticized Freeman’s double standard.  “Enron was not the only entity who may have been responsible for market manipulation,” the lawmaker commented.  “The LADWP under David Freeman was a major player in California’s energy market and their skirts are far from clean.    “As former head of LADWP, Freeman was personally responsible for gouging the public and ripping off the taxpayers to an even greater extent than Enron.”    “In all the talk about Enron’s infamous memos entitled ‘Fat Boy’, ‘Death Star’ and ‘Get Shorty’, let’s not forget Mr. Freeman’s equally repugnant boast during the height of the energy crisis, ‘A blind pig could make money in this market.’  He even went so far as to have t-shirts made with that slogan.”    David Freeman is currently awaiting Senate confirmation to head the Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Board.  He was appointed to that position by Governor Davis last August after negotiating the disastrous long-term energy contracts for the state.  “Governor Davis has been critical of Enron, but did he criticize David Freeman?  No, Governor Davis put the biggest fox of all in charge of the henhouse,” Johnson concluded.
GX008-74-7400593	"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE        April 11, 2001        CONTACT:  Phil Garcia        (916) 445-8994          Lt. Gov. Bustamante Applauds Signing of Energy    Conservation Bill    Bustamante also praises federal court ruling ensuring delivery of lower-cost    electricity to UC, CSU         SACRAMENTO  - Lt. Governor Cruz M. Bustamante today praised the signing    of an $850 million energy conservation package by Gov. Gray Davis, and also    hailed a federal judge's ruling that orders Enron Energy to keep its agreement    to sell lower-cost power to the California State University and the University    of California.   ""Today brings a double dose of good news on the energy front: We now have    a vigorous energy conservation plan in place, and a federal judge has stepped    up and held Enron accountable for meeting its contractual obligations to the    CSU and UC,"" Bustamante said.   ""The legislative package will not fully solve our current energy crisis,    but it is a key step in our efforts to keep the lights on in California,""    added Bustamante, a sponsor of one of the energy conservation bills, SB 5x by    state Sen. Byron Sher, D-Palo Alto.   ""The bills provide incentives to residential, commercial and government    consumers in a proactive manner. The package also provides much needed financial    assistance for our low-income consumers in California -- who are struggling    with exorbitant energy bills.""   The Sher legislation, and AB 29x by Assemblymember Christine Kehoe, D-San Diego,    earmark more than $850 million for energy conservation and distributed generation    programs that are designed to save more than 2,000 megawatts of electricity    this summer.   In a separate action today, U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton issued a ruling    in favor of the CSU and UC in a lawsuit they filed to force Enron to abide by    contracts that provide lower-cost energy to the universities.   Enron was seeking to get out of the last year of a four-year contract, but    the judge issued a temporary injunction that forces Enron to continue providing    power to the universities while the suit proceeds.   ""The energy companies cannot be allowed to walk away from contracts they    are legally bound to fulfill,"" said Bustamante, who is a trustee of the    UC and an ex-officio member of the UC Board of Regents. ""It is time to    get tough with the energy generators and to end their price-gouging of California    ratepayers and taxpayers.""   Last week, Bustamante proposed legislation that would make it a felony for    energy companies to charge unjust or unreasonable rates.   The law would set the standard that any regulatory finding of unreasonable    and unjust rates would be presumption for the filing of charges by state prosecutors.    Violations would possibly be punishable by fines, full restitution and jail    time.   Bustamante said today that two lawmakers already have indicated a strong interest    in authoring the proposed legislation and that a decision is pending.   ###"

The original                              trail has been closed to the public for more than                              a decade because a rock quarry blocks the trailhead.                              It is open to the public only once a year—on                              Wilderness Day, April 20 this year. The company may                              escort visitors through the quarry every month. The                              company also plans to restore the area to its natural                              state once the quarry is retired and to allow unlimited                              public access to the trail.

Housing developments                              not only invade coyote habitat, but contribute to                              the growing coyote population.

GX240-05-12885433	"Appendix B. Revised Draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E   Appendix B. Revised Draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E Introduction This appendix provides detailed information supporting the analysis presented in Chapter 5, ""Public Health"". Part 1 describes the potential pathogenic microorganisms that have been known to be present in sewage sludges and provides data on the incidence of reportable diseases in California on a county-by-county basis and for each year for the past 6 to 8 9 years. Part 2 describes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) development of the national sewage sludge regulations (Part 503 regulations). Part 3 provides information on endocrine disruptors, an issue of increasing concern with regard to long-term impacts of chemicals in the environment.  Part 1. Diseases of Interest This section discusses each of the groups of potential pathogens of concern or specific potential pathogens of concern that may be found in biosolids and summarizes available information on the incidence of diseases they cause in California. This discussion is intended to provide background information for the impact analysis presented in Chapter 5. The information on disease incidence reflects the data collected by the existing statewide voluntary public health reporting system, in which local health departments (two three city and all county health departments) participate. The diseases that are reported are those that are diagnosed by a physician or at a hospital or clinic and represent only a small percentage of the actual cases which go largely unreported (for example the flu or an attack of gastroenteritis). For many diseases (amebiasis, campylbacteriosis, giardiasis, salmonellosis [other than typhoid fever], only summary counts of cases are reported to DHS and a thorough investigation by the local health department into each case of these diseases is not always conducted. Disease data is only reported for those whose illness results in a visit to a physician or local clinic or hospital, thus represents only a small percentage of the actual cases of illness that may occur. The true incidence of disease from pathogens causing gastroenteritis and other general symptoms that are normally treated with over-the-counter drugs will be underestimated and thus greatly affect any conclusions drawn from the disease incidence data reported herein.  California State Water Resources Control Board General Waste Discharge Requirements for Biosolids Land Application Final Statewide Program EIR  B-1  June 30, 2000 Appendix B. Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E   Appendix B The EIR reports only those cases reported and has contacted local health department personnel who might be knowledgeable about specific cases which might involve biosolids to obtain potential reports of interest to the GO evaluation of impacts. NOTE: Many statistical tables previously presented (Numbered E1 through E16 in the text have been revised and corrected to include all available data are now at the end of the appendix in order. There are revised tables (E-1a through E-16a ) for all reported diseases which include data for the years 1990-1998 (provisional statistics for the years 1996, 1997 and 1998 are included since minor adjustments to the records are still occurring). Each disease type has two tables. The first designated by a number and an ""a"" shows the number of reported disease cases by county or local health department. The second designated by a ""b"" (numbered E-1b through E-16b) shows the same information converted to an incidence rate based on the population of the city of county in which the disease was reported. This information was added at the request of the California Department of Health. Note that these numbers were calculated based on population estimates from the California Department of Finance. The disease statistics were provided by the California Department of Health Services. The data base they provided has been sorted and tabulated. Minor adjustments were made to the 1990 data to account for changes in the combined Humboldt/Del Norte County separation of reporting in subsequent years.  Bacterial Diseases Enterotoxic E. coli O0157 This mutant form of E. coli first appeared in the United States in 1982 and is one of hundreds of varieties of E. coli found in the guts intestinal tract of mammals (Padhye and Doyle 1992). It is mainly an infection in cattle that can be passed to humans who eat foods contaminated by cattle manure (even in organic gardens using uncomposted manure) or who eat inadequately cooked meat (Cieslak et al. 1992, Centers for Disease Control 1993, Nelson 1997). This particular variety, according to Wells et al. (1991), can be found in 1%3% of all cattle in the United States but causes them no harm. The infection can be serious for a human host, however, causing severe, often bloody diarrhea. In the worst cases, particularly in young children, E. coli can kill. Most often, E. coli illnesses are associated with eating undercooked hamburger or uncooked fruits (apples and cantalopes) and vegetables (lettuce in particular) or with person-to-person contact (Belongia et al. 1993, Nelson 1997). Contaminated water supplies are also of growing concern (Jones and Roworth 1996). This particular bacterial strain is of growing concern as more outbreaks occur (Koutkia 1997). The most well-publicized recent case of illness from E. coli is that of three children who died in Washington in 1993 after eating contaminated hamburgers at a fast-food restaurant (Centers for Disease Control 1993). In summer 1997, 25 million pounds of hamburger,  California State Water Resources Control Board General Waste Discharge Requirements for Biosolids Land Application Final Statewide Program EIR  B-2  March 2000 Appendix B. Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E   Appendix B potentially tainted with E. coli 0O157:H7, were recalled by Hudson Foods in Columbus, Nebraska, after consumer illnesses were reported. Illness caused by E. coli 0O157:H7 has been a reportable disease in California since 1993 after the first case was reported in San Diego County in 1992; the annual number of cases has ranged from 0 1 to 33 264, and occasional outbreaks have occurred in major urban areas throughout California (Table E1a). Table E-1b shows the incidence rates for the various reporting entities. [Note: draft EIR Table E-1 has been deleted and is being replaced by Tables E-1a and E-1b at the end of document.] Like other pathogens of concern, the enterotoxic form of E. coli has a low infectious dose (estimated to be as low as 10 bacteria). The present detection method for E. coli 0O157:H7 requires growing the bacteria in laboratory cultures, which takes days. A group of Montana researchers led by Dr. Gordon McFeters has developed a new method using an antibody test kit. The test takes only 4 hours; is highly sensitive; and works in food, feces, and water. The method could be adapted to detect other foodborne pathogens, such as Salmonella, and could be used at various points in beef supply processing to check for contamination.  Campylobacteriosis Campylobacter jejuni, like E. coli, can cause severe cases of gastroenteritis (campylobacteriosis) and has been consistently listed as a pathogen of concern in relation to sludge management (U. S. Environmental Protection Agency 1985) despite a lack of information on its densities in sludges. This pathogen has at times outranked Salmonella as a leading cause of bacterial diarrhea (as in 1996), particularly in infants (Table E-2a). The reported incidence of gastroenteritis attributable to C. jejuni in California has ranged from 864 6296 to 2,477 8220 cases annually since 1993 1990 (Table E-2a). Most of A large percentage of the cases (81%) were reported to have occurred in Los Angeles County. No Several hundred cases were reported in the three counties of the Central Valley where most of the biosolids land application occurs (see Chapter 5). Table E-1b shows the incidence rates for the various reporting entities. Little has been reported in scientific literature about the levels of this pathogen in feces shed by ill people, its removal in treatment, levels in biosolids, infectious dose, or longevity in the environment (Feachem et al. 1980, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1985) as indicated in (Table 5-1 of Chapter 5). [Note: draft EIR Table E-2 has been deleted and is being replaced by Tables E-2a and E-2b at the end of document.]  California State Water Resources Control Board General Waste Discharge Requirements for Biosolids Land Application Final Statewide Program EIR  B-3  June 30, 2000 Appendix B. Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E   Appendix B  Salmonellosis and Typhoid Fever The bacterial genus Salmonella consists of more than 2,000 known serotypes found in different reservoirs and locations, many of which are pathogenic to humans and other animals (Argent et al. 1977, 1981; Ayanwale 1980; Mishu et al. 1994). Ingestion of an infectious dose of Salmonella (usually a large number of bacteria is required, as shown in Table 5-1 in Chapter 5) can result in gastroenteritis, enteric fever, and/or septicemia. The two major disease syndromes associated with Salmonella are salmonellosis (gastroenteritis) and typhoid fever (enteric fever).  Salmonellosis. The major vehicle of salmonellosis is food (St. Louis et al. 1988, Mishu et al. 1994), although waterborne outbreaks have occurred. There are many zoonotic reservoirs for salmonellosis, including such domestic and wild animals as poultry, swine, cattle, rodents, dogs, cats, turtles, and tortoises reptiles. Waterborne outbreaks of salmonellosis occur worldwide and are associated primarily with fresh water. Salmonellosis is characterized by acute abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, fever, and dehydration and is sometimes accompanied by vomiting. The illness can lead to complications and more serious infections. Death is not common except in the very young, the very old, or the debilitated. It has been estimated that 400,000 to 3.7 million cases (17.3 cases per 100,000) of salmonellosis (including foodborne and waterborne transmission) occur every year in the United States (EOA 1995), with as many as 70% of the cases being imported from foreign travelers. Between 1,010 4739 and 1,894 6544 cases have been reported yearly in California over the past six nine years (Table E-3a), with over 90 25% of the total being reported in Los Angeles County. No cases were reported to have occurred in those counties in the Central Valley where the highest amounts of biosolids are being land applied. Table E-1b shows the incidence rates for the various reporting entities. The incidence rates for California counties are typical of those reported nationwide ranging from 0 - 151.7 cases/100,000 with the highest rates being found the rural counties with low populations where a single case makes a big difference. Central valley counties were biosolids use is extensive do not appear to have any higher rates in recent years than other localities. Recent research on the causes of a Salmonella outbreak among chickens has raised concern about the importance of Salmonella in wastewater management and indicates the need for constant vigilance and monitoring of the effectiveness of management techniques and disinfection methods (Kinde et al. 1996, 1997). Concern also exists regarding the transmission of Salmonella from biosolids to animals (Jones et al. 1980; Argent et al. 1977, 1981) and the ability of the pathogen to survive under hostile environmental conditions (Droffner and Brinton 1995); this ability makes them the indicator of choice for monitoring the effectiveness of biosolids pathogen reduction (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1992). In developing the Part 503 regulations, the EPA based its requirements for pathogen  California State Water Resources Control Board General Waste Discharge Requirements for Biosolids Land Application Final Statewide Program EIR  B-4  March 2000 Appendix B. Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E   Appendix B reduction and its risk assessments for protection of public health on Salmonella because of its high incidence rates, its ability to regrow, and its correlation with coliform bacteria (about 1.4 S. typhi per million 100,0000 coliforms based on a morbidity rate of 0.18/million 0.0018/100,0000 persons).  Typhoid Fever. Typhoid is transmitted via water or food contaminated by the feces or urine of a carrier. Fruits, vegetables, and milk contaminated by sewage or by the hands of carriers are also modes of transmission. The case-fatality rate for typhoid fever can reach 10% if symptoms go untreated; there are approximately 500 fatalities per year (0.2 per 100,000 deaths per year) in the United States. [Note: draft EIR Table E-3 has been deleted and is being replaced by Tables E-3a and E-3b at the end of document.]  Shigellosis The genus Shigella is made up of four species of rod-shaped bacteria that are all pathogenic in humans and other primates. The four species are characterized as groups or types: Group A, S. dysenteriae (10 serovars); Group B, S. flexneri (17 serovars); Group C, S. boydii (15 serovars); and Group D, S. sonnei (1 serovar). Shigellosis, an acute bacterial disease caused by Shigella, occurs worldwide, with outbreaks common under conditions of crowding and poor sanitation (i.e., jails, institutions for children, mental hospitals, crowded camps and ships). The reporting for the disease distinguishes between the four groups to help identify the sources and potential severity of the infection. From 1967 to 1988, annual isolation rates of Shigella reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) varied between about 5 and 10 per 100,000 persons. It has been estimated that 5% of all symptomatic cases of shigellosis are reported to the national surveillance system. Shigella is considered the most highly communicable of the bacterial diarrheas; as few as 10 organisms have been reported to cause clinical illness (U. S. Environmental Protection Agency 1985). For S. dysenteriae (Shiga bacillus) infection, case-fatality rates approach 20%; for S. sonnei infection, the infection is short-lived and the fatality rate is almost negligible, except in immunocompromised persons. Few cases are reported in California. The annual number of cases reported in the state ranges from 0 24 to 17 110 cases a year for Group A, 196 770 to 796 1957 for Group B, 2 87 to 45 232 for Group C, and 388 1522 to 873 3144 for Group D (Tables E-4a, E-5a, E-6a, and E-7a, respectively). Some 62178 572 - 817 cases a year were unidentified as to type (Table E-8a). Overall, some 701 to 1,530 cases per year have been reported from 1993 to 1998. Incidence rates for the counties in which cases were reported for the various types are shown in Tables E-4b, E-5b, E-6b, and E-7b. Reported incidence rates are low except for a few counties in urban areas or where remote outbreaks occur in the rural counties. None of these cases has been associated with biosolids. Shigella spp. has in the past been the most common bacterial pathogen implicated in waterborne outbreaks in the United States, but its occurrence has declined over time (Moore et al. 1993). Shigellosis also has been implicated in outbreaks associated with recreational swimming (Blostein 1991, Sorvillo et al. 1988). California State Water Resources Control Board General Waste Discharge Requirements for Biosolids Land Application Final Statewide Program EIR June 30, 2000 Appendix B. Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E  B-5   Appendix B Shigellosis is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, directly or indirectly, primarily from person to person via contaminated food and water. In areas of poor sanitation, food and water may play a greater role in transmission. Flies have been shown to be a vector in the transmission of the disease (Dunaway et al. 1983). The survival of Shigella in water, soils, and plants depends on and the concentration of other bacteria, nutrients, and oxygen. has been shown to survive for up to 22 days in well water temperatures (47 days) and up to 135 days in permafrost soils factors such as temperature In various studies, Shigella and even longer in colder of Siberia (EOA 1995).  One detailed review of the scientific literature performed by EOA (1995) found no Shigella outbreaks associated with water where the source met the coliform standards at the time of exposure.

All sets of tables appear at the end of document.]  Protozoan Diseases Amoebiasis Amoebiasis, an infection caused by the environmentally resistant pathogen Entamoeba histolytica, is acquired by mouth contact. Symptoms can vary from minor abdominal cramps to severe diarrhea alternating with constipation. The incidence of disease from this protozoan is low; between 127 698 and 237 1646 cases per year have been reported in California over the past six nine years (Table E-9a) with a general decline in the rate over time.. None of the reported cases have been associated with biosolids or wastewater management, however, most cases are not investigated t the extent to make a definitive association. Over 94% A majority of the reported cases in California were in Los Angeles County (including Long Beach and Pasadena), San Francisco and Santa Clara counties reflecting the size of the population and high number of travelers from these areas. This disease is associated often with travel in other countries, particularly in areas of Mexico. Incidence rates are shown in Table E-9b which show that San Francisco and Santa Barbara have experienced the highest reported rates in recent years. [Note: draft EIR Table E-9 has been deleted and is being replaced by Tables E-9a and E-9b at the end of document.]  Crytosporidiosis Cryptosporidiosis is a gastrointestinal infection that is caused by the protozoan Cryptosporidium spp. Cryptosporidium oocysts are shed by humans and animals in feces. California State Water Resources Control Board General Waste Discharge Requirements for Biosolids Land Application Final Statewide Program EIR March 2000 Appendix B. Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E  B-6   Appendix B The infectious dose in humans is thought to be small; it is 10400 oocysts in species other than humans. Little is known about the concentrations of viable oocysts in biosolids (Gerba pers. comm.) and the viability of oocysts in the environment, but oocysts are known to have the potential to survive months following their excretion (EOA 1995) and have the potential to survive more than a month following sludge treatment and land application (Whitmore and Robertson 1995). However, it has been found that conventional treatment and anaerboic digestion are effective in reducing the numbers of oocsysts in biosolids (Whitmore and Robertson 1995). Modes of transmission for cryptosporidiosis include person-to-person contact, zoonotic transmission, and contaminated food and water. Person-to-person transmission is probably the most important mode and has been documented among family/household members, sexual partners, health workers and their patients, and children in day care centers. Cryptosporidium readily crosses host-species barriers as well, though, and human infections are often the result of zoonotic transmission. Cryptosporidium is harbored by more than 40 mammals. Reservoir hosts include calves, dogs, cats and rodents (Tzipori 1988). Several waterborne outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis have been reported in the United States where the filtration component of water treatment was suboptimal (Milwaukee, for example - see below) (McKenzie et al. 1994). Cryptosporidiosis also has been associated with recreational use of swimming pools (Joce et al. 1991). Disease incidence in England associated with chlorinated water supplies and swimming pools indicates cryptosporidiosis resistance to chlorination (Furtado et al. 1998). During a waterborne outbreak of cryptosporidiosis resulting from contamination of a public water supply that affected an estimated 13,000 people in Georgia, routine samples from the water system were found to meet EPA and State of Georgia standards for coliform bacteria (Robertson and Smith 1992). During another cryptosporidiosis outbreak associated with public water supply that led to an estimated 403,000 cases of diarrhea in Milwaukee, coliforms were not detected in samples of treated water (McKenzie et al. 1994). It should be noted that it is generally recognized that Cryptosporidium oocysts are removed or inactivated by effective and reliable water treatment practices where the water supply is not contaminated by dairy or pasture runoff (most often from flooding). Cryptosporidium is found worldwide. Human cryptosporidiosis has been reported in at least 60 countries on six continents, with widely varying prevalence among those seeking medical care for diarrhea (EOA 1995). The prevalence is highest in non-industrialized regions: Europe,1% to 2%; North America, 0.6% to 4.3%; and Asia, Australia, Africa, and Central and South America, 3% to 20%. Seroprevalence rates in immunocompetent individuals are between 25% and 35% in the United States and are well over 50% in Latin America. Children generally have a significantly higher prevalence than adults, and infections are often seasonal, with a higher prevalence during warmer, wetter months. No outbreaks associated with biosolids use have been reported in scientific literature or with the health agencies consulted during the preparation of this EIR. This disease is rare, with 31 311 to 212 6141 cases a year reported in California for both types of Cryptosporidiosis, none few of which are from areas where biosolids have been land applied (Tables E-10a and California State Water Resources Control Board General Waste Discharge Requirements for Biosolids Land Application Final Statewide Program EIR June 30, 2000 Appendix B. Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E  B-7   Appendix B E-11a). Tables E-10b and E-11b show the incidence rates fo the two types of Cryptosporidiosis which have been their highest in remote Sierra County and in the San Francisco area and otherwise are quite low. [Note: draft EIR Tables E-10 and E-11 have been deleted and are being replaced, respectively, by Tables E-10a and E-10b, and E-11a and E-11b at the end of document.]  Giardiasis Giardia lamblia is a protozoan that principally infects the upper small intestine in humans, who can often be asymptomatic. Giardia infection, or giardiasis, manifests itself in the form of chronic diarrhea, abdominal cramps, weight loss, and fatigue that can last for months with relapses. It can progress to cause malabsorption syndrome, in which digestion is impaired and weight loss occurs. Certain immunodeficiency syndromes also may be associated with Giardia infection, and the infection is particularly devastating in immunocompromised persons. Carriers can shed Giardia for years, but a self-cure usually occurs within 2 to 3 months. The numbers of Giardia cysts shed in feces are highly variable but have been measured to be as high as 900 million per day (Feachem et al. 1983). Before leaving the intestine, Giardia generally forms a resistant cyst, which is highly resistant to traditional disinfection techniques (EOA 1995). The cysts can remain viable in water for several months and can remain viable in soils as well, but cannot tolerate freezing (EOA 1995). It has been found that the presence of traditional bacterial indicators does not correlate with the presence of cysts, particularly in unfiltered but disinfected drinking water (EOA 1995). Negative coliform tests do not provide assurance that water is free of Giardia cysts; however, positive coliform results often correlate with Giardia outbreaks (EOA 1995). The major reservoir of Giardia is humans, but there is evidence that humans may acquire infections from other animals. Beavers may be a reservoir and have been implicated in waterborne outbreaks (EOA 1995). Dogs, gerbils, guinea pigs, beavers, raccoons, bighorn sheep, and muskrats have all been shown to be carriers of Giardia (EOA 1995). Giardia infection is transmitted through contaminated water supplies, foodborne outbreaks, and person-to-person contact, with the later being the most prevalent means of transmission. Individuals with impaired immune function appear to have increased susceptibility to Giardia infection. The numbers of Giardia cysts in biosolids have been estimated to range from 10 to 103 per gram with no removal via treatment. However, significant viability reduction occurs during digestion, estimated in laboratory studies to be as high as 99.9% inactivation (Straub et al. 1993, Cravaghan et al. 1993). Class A treatment requires that treated biosolids contain less than one protozoan cyst per gram. For Class B sludge generated in Australia, it has been found that anaerobically digested and mechanically dewatered sludge had cysts present at  California State Water Resources Control Board General Waste Discharge Requirements for Biosolids Land Application Final Statewide Program EIR  B-8  March 2000 Appendix B. Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E   Appendix B levels of public health concern after 1 year, but that cysts were destroyed after only 12 weeks following soil amendment (Hu et al. 1996). Giardia is found worldwide. The prevalence of Giardia infection worldwide has been estimated to be about 7%, and infection is more common in children than adults. Prevalence rates vary between less than 1% and 50% and depend on the population sampled, infection rates being highly dependent upon sanitation and the quality of drinking water. Areas of the United States known to be associated with increased risk of infection are usually mountainous and include New England, the Pacific Northwest, and the Rocky Mountains. The number of cases reported in California is variable, ranging from 510 4029 to 1,335 7850 per year (Table 5-6 in Chapter 5) and Table E-12a. The incidence in California is the highest in Los Angeles County., where more than 88% of the cases were reported. The number of No cases were reported in Kern, Merced, and Kings Counties, where the majority of the biosolids application currently occurs (Table E-12a) have shown a slight declining trend and moderate incidence rates. No cases of the illness associated with biosolids operations have been reported (Cook and Shaw pers. comms.). Overall incidence rates are highly variable as shown in Table E-12b. [Note: draft EIR Table E-12 has been deleted and is being replaced by Tables E-12a and E-12b at the end of document.]  Viruses Hepatitis A The hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a virus physically resembling an enterovirus that causes hepatitis A, an illness with the symptoms of fever, nausea, malaise, anorexia, and abdominal discomfort, followed by jaundice. The disease can be mild, lasting 1 to 2 weeks, or severe, with disabling effects lasting months in rare cases. The recovery period is usually prolonged. The case-fatality rate has been reported to range from 0.04% in children 514 years old to 2.7% in adults over 49 years old, with typical case-fatality rates of 0.10.5%. Relapse rates can be as high as 20%. Hepatitis A can be diagnosed by the detection of virus in the stool or the presence of IgM antibodies against HAV in the serum of persons who are acutely ill. There is currently no specific treatment for HAV. The normal reservoir of HAV is acute-phase humans; there is no known carrier state. Mode of transmission is via the fecal-oral route, with person-to-person transmission being the most frequent means of transmission, usually via water or food. HAV can survive for long periods on inanimate objects and on human hands; therefore, food contamination by infected persons is a major area of concern. In the United States, waterborne outbreaks have been estimated to contribute 0.4%8% of all HAV incidence, and no waterborne disease outbreaks have been shown to have been directly associated with biosolids. The majority of waterborne outbreaks in the United States involve small private or semiprivate water supplies with or without chlorination; these outbreaks are usually attributable to plumbingCalifornia State Water Resources Control Board General Waste Discharge Requirements for Biosolids Land Application Final Statewide Program EIR June 30, 2000 Appendix B. Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E  B-9   Appendix B sewage cross-contamination or to a raw-water source being so grossly polluted with sewage that virus levels cannot be eliminated by treatment of the water using conventional methods. The infectious dose is estimated to be in the range of 1 to 10 plaque-forming units (PFUs). Little is known about persistence of hepatitis A in the environment. Survival in water has been recorded for as long as 40 days in surface waters and 70 days in groundwaters (EOA 1995). Levels in biosolids have not been reported in anaerobically digested sludge. There is no known direct correlation between HAV and indicator organisms such as coliform bacteria, fecal streptococci, acid-fast bacteria, or coliphage. Hepatitis A has a worldwide distribution. Since 1920 in the United States, there have been about 15 reported outbreaks of HAV associated with drinking water, most of which are reported from areas with poor sanitation or contaminated water supplies (Singh et al. 1998). In California, the number of Hepatitis A cases has ranged from 474 4197 to 1,4 1 5 6 773 annually over the past eight nine years (Table E-13a) with a relatively variable incidence rates (Table E-13b) in individual areas with only a few cases contributing to high rates in the smaller counties (Del Norte, Sierra, and Humbolt counties). Incidences in counties where biosolids are being land applied have not increased since land application was intensified in recent years, and no cases have been reported in most instances in the past seven nine years. None of the cases reported can be related to the handling or use of biosolids. [Note: draft EIR Table E-13 has been deleted and is being replaced by Tables E-13a and E-13b at the end of document.]  Viral Meningitis ""Viral meningitis"" is the general term that refers to all serious viral diseases (not gastroenteritis of unknown origin) that have been reported. Included as causative agents and reportable as viral meningitis are the Coxsackievirus A and B, Echovirus, and new enteroviruses (acquired orally). It is unknown how many viruses cause gastroenteristis and flu-like symptoms that are unreported. The reportable cases of viral infections have ranged from 119 1146 to 485 3648 per year (Table E-14a). Most of the cases are reported in the more urbanized counties and the numbers of reported cases are largely proportional to population. Only two Recent years have shown a decline in the number of reported cases in Kern County where large-scale land application is presently practiced. cases have been reported in the three largest land application areas, both in Kern County. There is no reported information indicating evidence that any of the cases are associated with biosolids land application operations. Incidence rates over time have been highly variable in most areas and generally moderate as shown in Table E-14b.

Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E  B-10   Appendix B  Gastroenteritis Gastroenteritis is a widespread disease that can be caused by numerous known and unknown viral agents. Person-to-person transmission is the principal mechanism for the spread of many infections; therefore, the most important element in preventing and controlling outbreaks is improved environmental hygiene (i.e., food, water, and sanitation). When foods other than shellfish are implicated in viral gastroenteritis outbreaks, the contamination has usually taken place near the point of consumption (shellfish are not discussed in this EIR because of the nature of the project). Ill food handlers were identified in nine of the 15 documented Norwalk outbreaks reported to the CDC from 1985 to 1988 for which adequate epidemiologic data were available (Centers for Disease Control unpublished data). Foods that require handling and no subsequent cooking (e.g., salads) constitute the greatest risk. Among Norwalk-confirmed foodborne outbreaks from 1976 to 1980 that were not attributable to shellfish, salad was the most commonly implicated food (Centers for Disease Control 1999). The long list of foods implicated in outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis reflects the variety of foods handled by food-service personnel and the low infectious dose (10100 particles) of most viral agents of gastroenteritis. In contrast to the factors important in amplifying bacterial contamination, practices such as leaving foods unrefrigerated or warming them for prolonged periods are not direct risk factors for increased viral transmission because the viruses do not multiply outside the human host. The Norwalk agent can remain infective even if frozen for years or heated to 60EC for 30 minutes. Cooking temperatures at 100EC or above are probably adequate to inactivate Norwalk and most other enteric viral pathogens. Outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis have been associated with various sources of contaminated water, including municipal water, well water, stream water, commercial ice, lake water, and pool water (Centers for Disease Control 1999). Disinfection of municipal supplies may not be adequate to kill the Norwalk agent, which can remain highly infective despite 30-minute exposure to concentrations of chlorine as high as 6.25 milligrams per liter (mg/l) and levels of 10 mg/l (Centers for Disease Control 1999); this helps explain why this virus is predominant in waterborne disease outbreaks. Rotavirus, for which only one waterborne outbreak has been documented in the United States, is more sensitive to chlorine than the Norwalk agent. Because rotaviruses can survive for several days on nonporous materials in conditions of low temperature and humidity, objects may contribute to their transmission. A recent study of a Norwalk viral outbreak on a cruise ship implicated toilets shared between staterooms as a risk factor for infection, suggesting that surfaces contaminated by Norwalk particles from spattered or aerosolized material may play a role in transmission of Norwalk-like viruses causing gastroenteritis.  California State Water Resources Control Board General Waste Discharge Requirements for Biosolids Land Application Final Statewide Program EIR  B-11  June 30, 2000 Appendix B. Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E   Appendix B Aerosolized rotavirus has also been observed to caused diarrheal illness in experimental mice. Studies are needed to address the efficacy of barrier precautions (e.g., face shields, respirators) in interrupting transmission of these agents (Centers for Disease Control 1999). Contaminated hands (hands contaminated directly or through contact with contaminated surfaces) may be the most important means by which enteric viruses are transmitted; thus, any people involved with biosolids should avail themselves of handwashing with soap on a routine basis to control the spread of all enteric pathogens. Nearly all the agents of viral gastroenteritis in humans have related strains that can cause diarrhea in animal species. These strains appear to be highly host-specific, however, and zoonotic transmission has not been documented as having an important role in human disease, either endemically or in outbreaks.  Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS/HIV Virus) No discussion of viruses would be complete without a discussion of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is caused by HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). It is noteworthy that HIV has never been recovered from wastewater samples into which it has not been artificially introduced (Ansari et al. 1992, Casson et al. 1992, Moore 1993). Researchers have recovered viral nucleic acid fragments in wastewater but none in biosolids (Preston et al. 1991). However, the detection of nucleic acid sequences does not represent the presence of viable HIV. No intact HIV has been recovered from either raw sewage or biosolids. The CDC contends that wastewater treatment professionals, as well as members of the public who may contact wastewater or biosolids, are not at risk of contracting AIDS as a result of this contact (Centers for Disease Control 1999).  Parasitic Worms Several parasitic intestinal worms are found in wastewater (Straub et al. 1993, ABT Associates 1993). These parasites are a potential hazard to the public health in general and to treatment plant and biosolids workers in particular. The beef tapeworm (Taenia saginata) can cause taeniasis if ingested with poorly cooked meat. Tapeworm eggs are detectable in biosolids, but there is no evidence that they have contributed to distribution of the disease except in one reported case discussed below.  Toxoplasmosis Toxoplasmosis is a very rare disease that affects only unborn fetuses. The disease is derived from cat feces. As shown in Table E-15a, between 9 and 42 192 cases per year have been reported in California, none one of which were in areas (Merced County) where biosolids are being extensively land applied. All cases but one A majority of the cases were in Los Angeles County except for an outbreak in San Francisco in 1990 where 148 cases were California State Water Resources Control Board General Waste Discharge Requirements for Biosolids Land Application Final Statewide Program EIR March 2000 Appendix B. Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E  B-12   Appendix B reported that year; the exception was in San Diego County. Incidence rates for this disease are very low as shown in Table E-15b. [Note: draft EIR Table E-15 has been deleted and is being replaced by Tables E-15a and E-15b at the end of document.]  Roundworms Ascariasis is caused by the presence of roundworms (Ascaris lambricoides) in the intestinal tract. The disease results from the ingestion of roundworm eggs, which survive for months to years in biosolids (Table 5-1 in Chapter 5) and were a primary focus of the EPA Part 503 regulation risk management practices. This disease is rare and is not reported. occasionally occurs and is not a reportable disease in California.  Hookworms Hookworm disease, rare in California but still present in the southeastern United States, is generally acquired when the larvae of Necator americanus enter through the bare skin, usually the feet. Infections also have occurred following ingestion of foods contaminated by wastewater. No cases of transmission related to biosolids land application have been reported. Symptoms include malnutrition, loss of energy, and anemia. This disease is rare and has not been reported in the past 6 years.  Tapeworms There are two species of tapeworms (Taenia saginata [beef] and T. solium [pork]) that live in the intestinal tract, where they can cause abdominal pain, weight loss, and digestive disturbances (Straub et al. 1993). Humans serve as the definitive host for the adults, and the eggs, which are passed in feces, may not be completely destroyed by all sludge treatment processes (Feachem et al. 1983), thus leading to the potential for their application to land in biosolids. If cattle graze on this land and ingest viable larvae, the disease may be transmitted to cattle. Humans have to become infected from eating incompletely cooked meat containing the larval stage of the tapeworm. A single recorded case of beef tapeworm transmission through the fertilization of land with untreated sludge has been reported in the United States; this case was reported more than 20 years ago, however, before the development of the Part 503 regulations and the improvements in treatment mandated under the Clean Water Act (Hammerberg et al. 1978). Tapeworm infections are relatively rare in California; a maximum of 14 46 cases per year have been reported when an outbreak of 27 cases was reported in Santa Clara County all in Los Angeles County (Table E-16a). A single case was reported in Kern County in 1997. Incidence rates for this diseare are very low as shown in Table E-16b.

Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E   Appendix B [Note: draft EIR Table E-16 has been deleted and is being replaced by Tables E-16a and E-16b at the end of document.]  Fungal Diseases Fungal pathogens include several species that have been identified in biosolids, as listed below. Fungal Species Aspergillus fumigatus Candida albicans Cryptococcus neoformans Epidermophton spp. and Trichophyton spp. Trichosporon spp. Phialophora spp. Disease Aspergillosis Candidiasis Subacute chronic meningitis Ringworm and athlete's foot Infection of hair follicles Deep tissue infections  Most of these fungal species have been found associated with composting operations, where they are enhanced by the favorable conditions created (wood chips and heat). Aspergillosis is illness caused by the Aspergillus fungus, which is found commonly growing on dead leaves, stored grain, compost piles, or other decaying vegetation. The fungus can cause illness in three ways: as an allergic reaction in people with asthma (pulmonary aspergillosis, allergic bronchopulmonary type); as a colonization in an old lung cavity that has healed from previous disease such as tuberculosis or in a lung abscess, where it produces a fungus ball called aspergilloma; and as an invasive infection with pneumonia that is spread to other parts of the body by the blood stream (pulmonary aspergillosis; invasive type). The invasive infection can affect the eye, causing blindness, and any other organ of the body, but especially the heart, lungs, brain, and kidneys. The third form occurs almost exclusively in people whose immune systems are suppressed by high doses of cortisone drugs, chemotherapy, or a disease that reduces the number of normal white blood cells. Those at risk include organ transplant recipients and people with cancer, AIDS, or leukemia (Rosenberg and Minimato 1996). The Aspergillus group of fungi is generally less prevalent than other fungal species, but it can be pathogenic to people under conditions of high exposure. Normal background levels of Aspergillus fumigatus outdoors rarely exceed 150 spores per cubic meter. Composting facilities do represent sites where there occurs a massive culturing of Aspergillus fumigatus organisms in relatively small areas compared with most ""natural"" or background circumstances. Studies have found concentrations of A. fumigatus 10 times higher than background levels in active commercial composting facilities, but the concentrations fell off sharply within 500 feet of the operational site (Clark et al. 1983) If the nearest human receptor is beyond the point at which concentrations fall to background levels, no elevated exposure is occurring. California State Water Resources Control Board General Waste Discharge Requirements for Biosolids Land Application Final Statewide Program EIR March 2000 Appendix B. Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E  B-14   Appendix B The use of bark or wood chips (e.g., as a bulking agent for sewage sludge composting) typically raises the onsite level of airborne A. fumigatus spores (Millner et al. 1977, 1980; Clark et al. 1983). In one study in Maryland, A. fumigatus levels in sewage sludge rose from 102 or 103 colony forming units per gram dry weight (CFU/gm dry wt) to 2.6 x 106 to 6.10 x 107 CFU/gm dry wt when mixed with wood chips that were stockpiled for various lengths of time. The increase appeared to be caused by wood chips being stored in moist piles that were allowed to generate heat (Millner et al. 1977). Increased A. fumigatus spore concentrations have been observed also in screened compost; the concentrations may have been increased as a result of reinoculation by spores as compost passed through contaminated screens multiple times (Olver 1979); others have suggested that multiple screenings may break up spore clusters, causing more spores to be released. Numerous researchers (Raper and Fennel 1965; Sinski 1975; Olver 1979; Epstein and Epstein 1985, 1989; Maritato et al. 1992; Epstein 1993) have presented persuasive arguments regarding the lack of health risk from A. fumigatus for certain outdoor workplace environments. In enclosed compost facilities without dust control, there is an elevated risk of worker exposure to spores. In a worst-case scenario, a respiratory model developed by Boutin et al. (1987) estimated that a completely unprotected worker shoveling mature compost at a highly contaminated site could inhale 25,000 to 30,000 viable spores per hour. However, elevated exposure is not automatically synonymous with an elevated health risk for compost workers (or neighboring communities). Epstein (1993) discusses several composting facilities in the United States in which health monitoring (physical examinations) of compost workers has been conducted; the results of the physical examinations did not reveal any illnesses directly associated with composting. Many public health specialists, scientists, and engineers in North America and Europe believe that properly operated composting and co-composting operations present little health risk to normal compost facility employees and present a negligible risk or no risk to nearby residences (Millner et al. 1977, Clark et al. 1983, Epstein and Epstein 1985, Boutin et al. 1987, Maritato et al. 1992). Diaz et al. (1992) stated: The existence of hazard from the spores of A. fumigatus [at commercial composting facilities] is yet to be demonstrated. The infectivity of the spores is low. Consequently, any danger posed by it would be of significance only to the unusually susceptible individual. Nevertheless, use of respirators by workers and the siting of such facilities in areas remote from residential dwellings and areas where potentially sensitive receptors work of live is warranted as a prudent land use planning practice. Reducing the dispersal of A. fumigatus spores appears to be the best way to reduce exposure and help protect the health of compost workers and the neighboring communities. The following management practices can help reduce the dispersal of spores into the air during commercial aerobic composting operations (whether they involve windrows, aerated static piles, or the various types of in-vessel reactors-- vertical, horizontal, or rotating drum):  California State Water Resources Control Board General Waste Discharge Requirements for Biosolids Land Application Final Statewide Program EIR  B-15  June 30, 2000 Appendix B. Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E   Appendix B g suitable siting, design, and construction (berms, vegetation, etc.) of composting facilities; g implementation of facility operational practices such as dust suppression, modification of time of operation, etc.); g engineering and administrative controls (enclosed cabs, use of amendment materials, health checks for workers); and g use of personal protective equipment (respirators or protective masks). The California Integrated Waste Management Board's current green waste composting regulations require a setback of at least 300 feet of the facility's active compost materials areas from any residence, school, or hospital, excluding onsite residences, unless a variance is granted from the local enforcement agency. More stringent requirements can be applied where there are sensitive receptors; high winds; or other factors related to health risks, such as the health status of the community potentially affected.  Pathogens of Emerging Concern Research techniques continue to be developed for determining the pathogenic microorganisms responsible for human and animal disease outbreaks. New genetic techniques and electron microscopy have improved our ability to detect and identify pathogens, particularly new viruses. Because approximately 50% of all cases of gastroenteritis are of unknown origin, such research is vital to development of our understanding of disease and disease prevention. This section describes the results of a literature review of recent outbreaks of disease (worldwide) undertaken to identify some of the emerging pathogens and their possible modes of transmission. Emerging pathogens are organisms responsible for new, reemerging or drug-resistant infections whose incidence in humans has increased within the past two decades or whose incidence threatens to increase in the near future. Included are such pathogens as E.coli O157:h7 and Cyclospora which have caused several outbreaks in California. The results of this search are summarized in Tables E-17 and E-18 for bacteria and viruses, respectively. Table E-19 provides information on parasites. None of these potential pathogens of concern have yet been identified with the use or handling of biosolids. Most outbreaks are associated with poor sanitation or food preparation and handling or drinking of contaminated water. The patterns of incidence and pathways of spread for various pathogens are poorly understood. Epidemiological studies have revealed some interesting findings with regard to crytposporidiosis that show how incidence of disease and causative factors are difficult to identify: evaluation of health records and water treatment plant records revealed that outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis were occurring in Milwaukee for more than a year before the California State Water Resources Control Board General Waste Discharge Requirements for Biosolids Land Application Final Statewide Program EIR March 2000 Appendix B.

They have only recently been discovered (seven species discovered so far) and identified as potential human pathogens, and only recent research indicates that they can be measured in environmental samples (water and wastewater) (Dowd et al. 1998). They are similar to other protozoan parasites such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium because of their small size, ability to infect different mammals, and spread through the environment; these characteristics, combined with their ability to form spores resistant to heat inactivation and drying, make them a pathogen of emerging concern with a potential to be waterborne (Johnson and Gerba 1997).  Rotaviruses Rotaviruses are small RNA viruses that have been found to be associated with gastroenteritis in humans and a wide range of animal species (De Leon and Gerba 1990). It has yet to be shown that animal rotaviruses are pathogenic for man; furthermore, there is no evidence for species cross-infection in nature (Conklin 1981). The human rotavirus has two serotypes. Rotavirus has been associated with as many as 50% of hospitalized cases of diarrheal illness in infants and young children (EOA 1995). Rotavirus gastroenteritis occurs worldwide both in sporadic and epidemic outbreaks. The primary targets are infants and children, particularly in the 6- to 24-month age group. Cases in adults are relatively infrequent but have been reported, mainly in countries other than the United States (EOA 1995). The most common route of rotavirus transmission is the fecaloral route, with person-to-person transmission being the most frequent. Most individuals have acquired antibodies to both serotypes of rotavirus by the age of 2 and are therefore protected from the disease as they grow older. In the United States, rotavirus infections are responsible for 100,000 hospitalizations per year (EOA 1995). California State Water Resources Control Board General Waste Discharge Requirements for Biosolids Land Application Final Statewide Program EIR June 30, 2000 Appendix B. Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E  B-19   Appendix B Rotavirus has been isolated from untreated drinking water, treated drinking water, and various foods, but the occurrence of infections from these sources has been rare (De Leon and Gerba 1990). There have been only two occurrences in the United States and these have been traced to improperly treated water (EOA 1995). No cases have been attributed to biosolids. Rotavirus is persistent in the environment and can survive for as long as 10 days in raw fresh water and as long as 64 days in municipal treated tap water (free chlorine = 0.05 mg/l) (EOA 1995). Rotavirus has been shown to survive more than 14 days in estuarine and heavily polluted fresh water (EOA 1995). Rotavirus can survive as long as 2 weeks on inanimate surfaces, the length of survival depending on relative humidity and temperature (EOA 1995). The length of survival of rotavirus, together with its low infectious dose, leads to concerns over its possible presence in biosolids (Table 5-2 in Chapter 5). No cases of infection have been attributed to biosolids, however.  Other Viruses Research continues to reveal the presence of previously unknown viruses that may play an important role in the large number of gastroenteritis cases of unknown origin. Among the new discoveries about which little is known are the human toroviruses (Duckmanton et al. 1997, Koopmans et al. 1997, Jamieson et al. 1998), picobirnaviruses (Gallimore et al. 1995a, 1995b; Chandra 1997), coxsachieviruses, small round structured viruses (SRSV) (Dedman et al. 1998), caliciviruses, Norwalk-like viruses (Sugieda et al. 1998), hepatitis E virus (Meng et al. 1998), Berne and Breda virus (also of animal origin), and adenoviruses. Table E-18 summarizes information on these viruses, their potential sources, and their reporting in scientific literature. Little is known about their transmission, epidemiology, environmental fate, or presence in biosolids or wastewater. However, their reporting is noted here as an indication that new pathogens continue to be discovered and that constant assessment of existing management practices is needed to ensure that biosolids are not contributing to the spread of disease. To date, no evidence indicates that they are. Picobirnaviruses are a novel group of viruses recently found in the feces of several species of vertebrates. They have been detected in the feces of humans suffering from cryptosporidiosis and, although they have not been associated with any outbreaks attributable to water or food, are a pathogen of emerging concern. The prevalence of picnovirus in those studied in the United Kingdom was found to be 9%-13% in a wide range of patients (ages 3 to more than 65) in those both with and without the symptom of gastroentiritis (Gallimore et al. 1995b). No outbreaks caused by these viruses have been reported in the United States. Toroviruses alone or in combination with enteroaggregative E. coli may play a pathogenic role in acute and possibly persistent diarrhea in children. Further studies are warranted to determine the etiologic role of toroviruses in gastroenteritis.

Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E   Appendix B  Other Diseases Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy Well-publicized news reports in 1996 suggested that consumption of beef from diseased cattle in Britain may have caused a fatal human brain disease (Floyd 1996, Pattison 1998). The condition in the British cattle, commonly referred to as ""mad cow disease"" in these reports, is a disease called bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE. Cattle with BSE have a degenerative brain condition that develops slowly over a 2- to 8-year period. BSE is similar in its effects on the cattle brain to other spongiform encephalopathy (SE) diseases in the brains of other animals. These include Kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) in humans, scrapie in sheep, transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME), chronic wasting disease of mule deer and elk, feline spongiform encephalopathy (FSE), and a few others. Experimental studies have demonstrated that animals can contract some of the SE diseases by ingesting nervous system tissues (brain, spinal cord, etc.) from affected animals. It is suspected (although there is still much debate) that the causative agent in the SE diseases may be a prion, or a filterable glycoprotein devoid of detectable nucleic acid that is resistant to typical means of sterilization (Pattison 1998). These agents have survived 3 years of burial in outside soil and heating to high temperatures. An unidentified virus is also theorized as a cause. BSE was first seen and diagnosed in Britain in 1986. It may have arisen as a result of rendered sheep byproducts being fed to cattle as protein supplements. Some of these sheep may have been infected with scrapie, an SE disease that has been known for more than 200 years. The number of BSE cases increased to a peak of about 1,000 new cases per weak by January 1993 and then began to decrease. The epidemic may have worsened because initially it was possible for cattle that had been affected with BSE to be rendered into protein supplements for other cattle. The British government banned feeding of ruminant-derived animal proteins to other ruminants in 1989. Because of the 2- to 8-year ""incubation"" period of development of BSE, cases continued to occur after this ban went into effect. In any event, the number of cases has decreased significantly and continues to decrease as a result of regulatory interventions, such as the offal feeding ban, which is now effectively applied. Muscle tissue and milk have not been demonstrated to transmit BSE, but brain and spinal cord tissue have. Therefore, steps taken in Britain to ensure that nervous tissues from cattle do not enter the human food supply should effectively prevent any transmission; it is unknown whether such transmission ever actually occurred. These steps also have been taken in the United States. To prevent the possibility of BSE entering the country, in 1989 the United States banned imports of live cattle and zoo ruminants from the United Kingdom and any country with BSE; imports of sheep and goats from the United Kingdom had already been banned because of scrapie. No case of BSE has been diagnosed in the United States, despite aggressive efforts on the part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other surveillance programs for BSE. California State Water Resources Control Board General Waste Discharge Requirements for Biosolids Land Application Final Statewide Program EIR June 30, 2000 Appendix B. Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E  B-21   Appendix B Included in the search are examinations at the National Services Veterinary Laboratory of the brains of cattle diagnosed with nervous system disease (postmortem microscopic examination of brain tissue) and periodic examinations of all live cattle in the United States that came from the United Kingdom before the import ban was instituted. No research has been conducted to measure the presence of prions in the environment and there are no known means of measurement. Gale (1998) assessed the likelihood of prions being a risk if water from an aquifer were contaminated by a cattle-rendering plant discharging effluent to the aquifer, and found the risk of infection to be in the range of 1 in 100 million to 1 in 1 billion. Because the disease is not present in the United States, such an analysis provides further assurance that this disease represents a minimal threat to public health.  Part 2. EPA Part 503 Risk Assessment for the Land Application of Sewage Sludge The EPA conducted extensive risk assessments for application of sewage sludge onto agricultural land and nonagricultural land (i.e., forest land, reclamation !and, and public contact sites). These assessments, based on a number of different exposure pathways and various ""worst-case"" (highly exposed individual or HEI) exposure assumptions, formed the basis for the sewage sludge pollutant loading limits specified in Section 503.13 of 40 CFR Part 503 Standards for the Use or Disposal of Sewage Sludge and used as minimum requirements in the SWRCB General Order (GO). The risk assessments and all the calculations and assumptions used are described in detail in technical support documents (U. S. Environmental Protection Agency 1992, Volumes 1 and 2). Risk assessments were conducted for 14 exposure pathways for agricultural land and 12 exposure pathways for nonagricultural land. Pathway 2, human toxicity from ingesting plants grown in the home garden, and pathway 11, human exposure through inhalation of particulates resuspended by tilling of sewage sludge, were not analyzed for nonagricultural application because these are not appropriate exposure scenarios for nonagricultural land. These pathways are described in Table E-20. The EPA assembled a national peer review committee of 35 recognized academic, government, and private industry experts in the field of sludge application to land for 10 of the risk assessments (pathways 1-10). This committee critically evaluated the methodology and data used to assess risk as part of developing criteria for land application of potentially toxic chemicals in municipal sewage sludge. The EPA's Office of Water conducted the risk assessment for pathway 11. The risk assessments for pathways 12, 13, and 14 were conducted for the EPA by the consulting firm ABT Associates (ABT Associates 1993). Charles Henry of the University of Washington conducted thc risk assessments for pathways 1 through 10 for nonagricultural land (except for pathway 2 for home gardening). Pathways 12, 13, and 14 are identical for agricultural and nonagricultural land, so ABT Associates' California State Water Resources Control Board General Waste Discharge Requirements for Biosolids Land Application Final Statewide Program EIR March 2000 Appendix B. Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E  B-22   Appendix B assessment of agricultural pathways 12, 13, and 14 was also used for the nonagricultural pathways (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1992). In undertaking the assessments, the EPA relied on numerous assumptions and decisions regarding the data to be used and what the exposure evaluations were to be based on. It was decided to use the concept of the highly exposed individual (HEI) as a target organism to be protected by the limits on individual pollutants. Depending on the pathway of exposure, the HEI could be a human, plant, animal, or environmental end point, such as surface water or groundwater, and is assumed to remain for an extended period at or adjacent to the site where the maximum exposure occurs.

Human breathing volatile pollutants from sewage sludge Human drinking water from wells contaminated with pollutants leaching from sewage sludge-amended soil to groundwater  The risk-based models developed for the Part 503 regulations were designed to limit potential exposure of an HEI. Originally, in the 1989 proposed Part 503 rule, the concept for ""worst-case"" exposure was based on the ""most exposed individual"" (MEI), but the EPA changed this to be consistent with a statement in the rule's legislative history that calls for protecting individuals and populations that are ""highly exposed to reasonably anticipated adverse conditions"". In developing Subpart B of the rule, the EPA used different HEIs in evaluating each pathway of potential exposure. The details for each of the HEIs selected and the assumptions used in the various risk scenario calculations are all contained in the technical support documents, which are voluminous (U. S. Environmental Protection Agency 1992). Examples are given here to provide an illustration of the HEIs for both the agricultural and nonagricultural settings for pathway 1, which was designed to protect consumers who eat food grown in sewage sludgeamended soil. For agricultural land application, the HEI was assumed to live in a region where a relatively high percentage of the available cropland receives sludge applications. To approximate realistic conditions, it was assumed that the HEI eats a mix of crops from land on which sludge was applied and crops from land on which sludge was not applied rather than eating foods that were all grown on sludge-amended soils. For nonagricultural settings for pathway 1, the HEI was a person who regularly harvests edible wild plants (i.e., berries and mushrooms) from forests or rangelands that have been amended with sewage sludge. This food was assumed to be preserved by drying, freezing, or canning and, hence, to be available for consumption throughout the year. It was also assumed that an individual could continue with this practice for a lifetime (70 years). Pathway 2 evaluated the effects on home gardeners of consuming crops grown in residential home gardens amended with sewage sludge. The major difference between pathways 1 and 2 was the fraction of food assumed to be grown on sewage sludge-amended soil. The HEI for pathway 2 was the home gardener who produced and consumed potatoes, leafy vegetables, fresh legumes, root vegetables, garden fruits (e.g., tomatoes, eggplants), sweet corn, and grains. The HEI for pathway 3 was a young person (less than 6 year of age) ingesting sewage sludge from storage piles or from the soil surface. California State Water Resources Control Board General Waste Discharge Requirements for Biosolids Land Application Final Statewide Program EIR March 2000 Appendix B. Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E  B-24   Appendix B For pathway 4, the HEI was an individual consuming foraging animals that consumed feed crops or vegetation grown on sewage sludge-amended soils. The HEI was assumed to consume daily quantities of the various animal tissue foods and to be exposed to background levels of pollutants from sources other than sludge. For the agricultural setting, the affected animal foods evaluated were beef, beef liver, lamb, pork, poultry, dairy, and eggs. In the nonagricultural setting, the HEI was assumed to be a hunter who preserved meat (including liver) for consumption throughout the year. The animals were assumed to have been hunted in the forest and eaten were deer and elk (because of their size and greater possibility of impact on intake through consumption compared with other animals). Pathway 5 involved the application of sewage sludge to the land; the direct ingestion of this sewage sludge by animals; and, finally, the consumption of contaminated animal tissue by humans. The HEI was assumed to consume various animal tissue foods and be exposed to a background intake of pollutants. Pathway 6 evaluated animals that ingest plants grown on sewage sludge-amended soil. The HEI used for both the agricultural and nonagricultural settings is a highly sensitive herbivore that consumed plants grown on sewage sludge-amended soil. Background intake was taken into account by considering background concentration of pollutants in forage crops. In a forest application site, the HEI was two grazing domestic animals and small herbivorous mammals (deer mice) that lived their entire lives in a sewage sludge-amended area feeding on seeds and small plants close to the layer of soil amended with sewage sludge. In the agricultural setting, the HEI was a sheep. The HEI for pathway 7 was an herbivorous animal incidentally consuming sewage sludge adhering to forage crops and/or sewage sludge on the soil surface. Background intake was considered to be from ingesting soil having background levels of pollutant. Because forest animals more typically browse rather than graze, the HEI for agricultural settings was used as a reasonable worst-case surrogate for the nonagricultural HEI. Pathway 8 was the plant phytotoxicity pathway and assumed as the HEI a plant sensitive to the pollutants in sewage sludge. Sensitivity was determined through a literature search including information on nonagronomic species, which were shown to be no more sensitive than agronomic species. Because sensitivity was found to be the same for agronomic and nonagronomic species, the limits set for agricultural species also protect wild species found in nonagricultural settings. The HEI for pathway 9 is a soil organism sensitive to the pollutants in sewage sludge, an earthworm. Because all soil organisms are wild species, the same HEI was used for the nonagricultural and agricultural settings. Pathway 10 assumed that the HEI was a shrew mole that consumed soil organisms that have been feeding on sewage sludge-amended soil. Pathway 9 had the same HEI for both the nonagricultural and agricultural pathways. The HEI for pathway 11, which was designed to protect humans from the effects of airborne dusts containing sewage sludge, was a tractor driver tilling a field. This pathway evaluated California State Water Resources Control Board General Waste Discharge Requirements for Biosolids Land Application Final Statewide Program EIR June 30, 2000 Appendix B. Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E  B-25   Appendix B the impact of particles that have been resuspended by the driver's tilling of dewatered sewage sludge into the soil. This pathway applies only to the agricultural setting because plowing is not normally performed in nonagricultural settings such as forests. Pathway 12, the soil erosion pathway, used as an HEI a human who consumed 2 liters per day of drinking water from surface water contaminated by soil eroded from a site where sewage sludge was land applied. This individual was assumed to ingest 0.04 kilograms per day of fish from surface waters contaminated by sewage sludge pollutants. The HEI was the same for agricultural and nonagricultural practices. Pathway 13 had as an HEI a human who inhaled the vapors of any volatile pollutants that may be in the sewage sludge when it is applied to the land. The HEI was assumed to live on the downwind side of the site with no change in wind direction ever occurring (constant exposure). The same plume air contaminant dispersion model was used for both the agricultural and nonagricultural settings. The HEI for pathway 14 for agricultural and nonagricultural settings was an individual who obtained drinking water from ground water located directly below a field to which sewage sludge has been applied. Consumption was assumed to be 2 liters per day for a lifetime. All the exposure scenarios involving ingestions included what is referred to as an oral reference dose (RfD). The RfD of a pollutant is a threshold below which effects adverse to human health are unlikely to occur. The EPA has a computerized listing of these human health criteria in its Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), which it uses for many different purposes in developing health protection standards based on the latest scientific information. Another key assumption that can change the risk assumption calculations is the recommended dietary allowances (RDAs). These are defined as the levels of intake of essential nutrients that, on the basis of scientific knowledge, are judged by the Food and Nutrition Board to be adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of practically all healthy persons. Although RfDs were generally used to determine the concentrations of inorganic pollutants that are protective of human health, the RDA was used in the case of zinc and copper.  Part 3. Endocrine Disruptors Introduction A wide range of chemicals, including some in common, often unregulated, undisclosed use are now associated with effects on the health, reproduction, and behavior of animals. At present, many of the effects are nonspecific in terms of the link to a particular environmental  California State Water Resources Control Board General Waste Discharge Requirements for Biosolids Land Application Final Statewide Program EIR  B-26  March 2000 Appendix B. Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E   Appendix B chemical, but the trends in research on hormone-affecting diseases indicate that it is probable that endocrine disruptors are contributing to human diseases and dysfunction. The EPA has been directed by Congress to look into the issue of endocrine disruptors, focusing first on transmission in drinking water. An interagency task force of national experts has been assembled and a research plan has been developed. Compounds termed ""endocrine disruptors"" can include both natural compounds and synthetic chemicals. Some, called phytoestrogens, occur naturally in a variety of plants; animals have evolved mechanisms to metabolize these, and they therefore do not accumulate and have adverse effects. A number of compounds that act as synthetic estrogens are now produced either through industrial manufacture (pesticides) or as byproducts of such processes or burning (such as dioxins). Testing for estrogenic activity is conducted in the lab using cultures of breast cancer cells. It has been found that some chemicals can cause effects at levels of parts per trillion--levels at which most chemicals have never been tested. Table E-21 lists a variety of suspected hormone disruptors, which are discussed below.  Table E-21.

Pesticides Many pesticides have been found to be estrogenic. These include the herbicides 2,4-D and 2,4,-T and the boat-fouling paint additive tributyl tin, and the traditional pesticides used widely in the past, such as carbaryl, chlordane, DDT, lindane, malathion, parathion, aldicarb, DBCP, and synthetic pyrethroids. Exposure can occur during application, through consumption of contaminated produce and other foods, through contaminated drinking water, or even from house dust in agricultural areas. Production of DDT for use in the California State Water Resources Control Board General Waste Discharge Requirements for Biosolids Land Application Final Statewide Program EIR March 2000 Appendix B. Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E  B-28   Appendix B United States was banned in 1972. However, other countries, especially tropical countries such as Mexico, still use it for mosquito control to combat malaria. DDT and its metabolites bioaccumulate in wildlife, and humans can be exposed through the food chain.  Soaps, Shampoos, and Hair Colors Many industrial and consumer products contain alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEs), which break down into alkylphenols such as nonylphenol, which has been found in sewage and rivers near outfalls. One of the main uses of these compounds is in liquid detergents. In Europe, these products have been replaced by the more expensive but much safer alcohol ethoxylates. Denmark based its phaseout of alkyphenol exthoxylate on research conducted in the United Kingdom, which found that its breakdown products, alkylphenols, caused male fish to take on female characteristics. Alkylphenols do not biodegrade easily and bioaccumulate and therefore may cause problems when sewage sludge is applied to land.  Plastics and Plasticizers Plastics contain additives, such as phthalates, bisphenol-A, and nonylphenols, usually present as plasticizers to increase flexibility and durability. They can leach out into liquids and foods. Heating speeds up this leaching process, which is why microwaving of foods in plastic is discouraged. Estrogenic butyl benzyl phthalate is found in vinyl floor tiles, adhesives, and synthetic leathers. The related compound di-butyl phthalate is present in some food-contact papers. Bisphenol-A is a breakdown product of polycarbonate plastics, which are used in water bottles, baby bottles, and the linings of some food cans.  Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) PCBs are a family of toxic industrial chemicals commercialized in 1929 by Monsanto. Although their production in the United States stopped in 1977, world production continued. PCBs are still present in the United States in electrical equipment and are frequently found at toxic waste sites and in contaminated sediments. A recent study confirmed that children exposed to low levels of PCBs in the womb because of their mother's fish consumption grow up with low IQs, poor reading comprehension, difficulty paying attention, and memory problems.

Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E   Appendix B  Dioxins Chlorinated dioxins and dibenzofurans are byproducts of the chlorine bleaching of paper; the burning of chlorinated hydrocarbons such as pentachlorophenol, PCBs, and polyvinyl chloride; the incineration of municipal and medical wastes; and natural events, such as forest fires and volcanic eruptions. They often contaminate toxic wastes sites, especially where there have been fires. They bioaccumulate in fish and other wildlife, and the most common human route of exposure is through the food chain.  Spermicides Many spermicides contain nonoxynol-9, a nonylphenol that kills sperm. This compound can be carried into the sewer system and hence into biosolids, although the concentrations are probably not measurable.  Preservatives BHA, butylated hydroxyanisole, is added to foods such as breakfast cereal, or its packaging, to prevent the foods from becoming rancid.  Metals Lead, methyl mercury, and cadmium can disrupt the endocrine system by causing problems in steroid production. In addition, a number of other pollutants with widespread distribution in the environment are reported to bind to hormone receptors and therefore are suspected to have reproductive and endocrine-disrupting effects. These pollutants include the following: g g g g g 2,4-dichlorophenol diethylhexyl adipate benzophenone N-butyl benzene 4-nitrotoluene  The compounds listed above are only suspected of being endocrine disruptors. All of these compounds have had wide uses in the past and are present in the environment, although only a few are likely to be found. Their presence in biosolids, soils, water, food, or animals is  California State Water Resources Control Board General Waste Discharge Requirements for Biosolids Land Application Final Statewide Program EIR  B-30  March 2000 Appendix B. Revised draft EIR Public Health Technical Appendix E   Appendix B variable and depends on the historical use of the chemicals and the means of environmental distribution. At present, there is no evidence that their presence in biosolids would increase health risks.  Citations Printed References ABT Associates, Inc. 1993.

GX250-56-3002409	"County News and Views From the Office of Fifth District Supervisor Jerry Eaves Former County Medical Center Reuse . The San Bernardino City Unified School District is interested in acquiring up to 12 acres of land fronting Gilbert Street at the former San Bernardino County Medical Center. Anton Elementary School is proposed for the site which is on the southeast portion of the property. The prototype school design is intended to serve student enrollment of 700 students and total building square footage of 50,792. The school district's architect has developed a site plan with extensive school playfields designed for community use after school hours. The district is also considering opening the school's proposed media center for community use such as continuing education. Funding for purchase of the land is expected shortly with construction funding to follow later in 2001. I believe the proposed school is a very positive addition to the n eighborhood. The County Medical Center Reuse Committee has worked tirelessly to promote reuse activities that provide a resource for the neighborhood surrounding the former medical center. I look forward to the development of additional uses for the property that provide benefit to the neighborhood.  MAY 2001  Arrowhead Regional Medical Center Pet-Assisted Therapy Program It all began last November when Charles White, Occupational Therapy Supervisor, interviewed a potential employee, Barb ara Haunsen-Reyez. During the process Barbara began to tell him a story that as a burn survivor herself, she adopted a dog that had also suffered burns. The dog, named Sweetheart, eventually recovered thanks to the efforts of veterinarians. Barbara spent many hours in the following months to help the dog recover. Touched by the story, White began to research the possibility of utilizing dogs for therapy at ARMC's Behavioral Health Unit. Conversations with lead psychiatrist, Dr. Randy Bazie, revealed n ot only his interest in pet-assisted therapy but also the support of White's supervisor, ARMC Behavioral Health Clinical Services Director, Deborah Lucas. There was also support from the Medical Director of Behavioral Health, Dr. Keith Gordon. Deborah Lucas is excited about the prospects, ""Not only are we pursuing the latest forms of quality care, but patients, staff and the community will reap the benefits of utilizing pets in patient's recovery."" The pet-assisted therapy program began officially on May 1 with a ribbon cutting ceremony at ARMC's Behavioral Health Unit. Handler/dog teams are evaluated for acceptance into the program by Charlie and Sally Brognola, both Certified Delta Society Evaluators. As soon as the program is established within Arrowhead's Behavioral Health Unit, it will expand to include the main hospital with Barbara Haunsen-Reyez' dog, Sweetheart, as the lead dog for ARMC's Burn Center.

GX017-46-3675847	County News and Views            May 2001                        From the Office of Fifth District Supervisor Jerry Eaves        Former County Medical Center Reuse        The San Bernardino City Unified School District is interested in acquiring up to 12 acres of land fronting Gilbert Street at the former San Bernardino County Medical Center. Anton Elementary School is proposed for the site which is on the southeast portion of the property. The prototype school design is intended to serve student enrollment of 700 students and total building square footage of 50,792.    The school district’s architect has developed a site plan with extensive school playfields designed for community use after school hours. The district is also considering opening the school’s proposed media center for community use such as continuing education. Funding for purchase of the land is expected shortly with construction funding to follow later in 2001.    I believe the proposed school is a very positive addition to the neighborhood. The County Medical Center Reuse Committee has worked tirelessly to promote reuse activities that provide a resource for the neighborhood surrounding the former medical center. I look forward to the development of additional uses for the property that provide benefit to the neighborhood.          Arrowhead Regional Medical Center        Pet-Assisted Therapy Program        It all began last November when Charles White, Occupational Therapy Supervisor, interviewed a potential employee, Barbara Haunsen-Reyez. During the process Barbara began to tell him a story that as a burn survivor herself, she adopted a dog that had also suffered burns. The dog, named Sweetheart, eventually recovered thanks to the efforts of veterinarians. Barbara spent many hours in the following months to help the dog recover. Touched by the story, White began to research the possibility of utilizing dogs for therapy at ARMC’s Behavioral Health Unit.     Conversations with lead psychiatrist, Dr. Randy Bazie, revealed not only his interest in pet-assisted therapy but also the support of White’s supervisor, ARMC Behavioral Health Clinical Services Director, Deborah Lucas. There was also support from the Medical Director of Behavioral Health, Dr. Keith Gordon. Deborah Lucas is excited about the prospects, “Not only are we pursuing the latest forms of quality care, but patients, staff and the community will reap the benefits of utilizing pets in patient’s recovery.”    The pet-assisted therapy program began officially on May 1 with a ribbon cutting ceremony at ARMC’s Behavioral Health Unit.    Handler/dog teams are evaluated for acceptance into the program by Charlie and Sally Brognola, both Certified Delta Society Evaluators. As soon as the program is established within Arrowhead’s Behavioral Health Unit, it will expand to include the main hospital with Barbara Haunsen-Reyez’ dog, Sweetheart, as the lead dog for ARMC’s Burn Center.    Anyone interested in becoming an ARMC Pet- Assisted Therapy volunteer should contact Patricia Redinger or Bonita Pipes in the ARMC Volunteer Management Department at (909) 580-6340                         CALENDAR OF EVENTS    State of the County Address  Delivered by Board of Supervisor’s Chairman Aguiar  June 11, 2001 at 11:30 am  Luncheon - $25 per person  Radisson Hotel in San Bernardino  909-387-5031         COUNTY GOVERNMENT CENTER    385 N.
