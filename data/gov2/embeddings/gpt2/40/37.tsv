GX012-62-9198285	Probes for Gene Markers                  Even before the exact location of a mutation is known, probes can                              sometimes be made for reliable gene markers.                                         Here is an example of a DNA probe. This particular          probe is a length of single-stranded DNA that is linked to a radioactive          molecule and matches an area near the gene. The probe binds to the area.          Radioactive signals from the probe are then made visible on X-ray film,          showing where the probe and the DNA match.
