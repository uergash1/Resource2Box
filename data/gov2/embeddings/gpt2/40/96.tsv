These studies apply new measurements to the benefits of public services in the United States, particularly public transit services. The approach a work in progress, so these are truly working papers, offered in the hope of encouraging more research along these same lines. In recent years the American policy process at all levels of government has become increasingly sophisticated in transportation issues. This is the result of the increasingly evident clashes that transportation problems and policy options generate in our communities. These political and budgetary ""clashes"" are also transactions in which measurable benefits are exchanged for tax revenues. The theory of public choice applied to transit here and in a recent book1 offers a disciplined approach for cataloging the transactions that shape transportation services. Through research such as this, public sector budgets for transit can be illuminated not only for professionals and citizens, but for the decision-makers themselves. It is our hope that local decision-makers will look into our research and see familiar patterns that routinely arise in the budgetary process for transit. They might see for the first time a means by which to weigh quantitatively the competing goals that the process sets for transit services. Public transit is widely supported throughout the United States. Intuitively, policy-makers and citizens recognize or at least suspect that transit generates large benefits. The measurement of these benefits, however, has eluded even the most dedicated students of the subject. In political environments increasingly hungry for benefit measurements with which to compare costs, even the strongest public support falls short. These working papers offer suggestions by which the public's support for transit can be translated into the budgetary process through the influence of benefit measurement that is not only credible and rigorous, but has intuitive appeal as well. As most people suspect, the diversion of motorists onto rapid transit does indeed improve the flow of congested highways. The benefit is demonstrable and its real dollar value is measurable. Similarly, as most people suspect, cities with intensive transit services achieve economies that make their citizens richer--and this effect is measured in these chapters. The magnitudes of benefits uniformly exceed transit costs, whether those costs are paid through fares or taxes.  1  Policy and Planning as Public Choice: Mass Transit in the United States, by David Lewis and Fred Laurence Williams, (Aldershot: Ashgate, 1999).  vii   Acknowledgements This research was conducted by the firm HLB Decision Economics (HLB) under agreements with the Federal Transit Administration and the Federal Highway Administration.

Except for project planning forecasts, the value of transit's ongoing impact on policy goals pertaining to traffic congestion, affordable mobility, and location efficiency has seldom been measured. A recent book, Policy and Planning as Public Choice: Mass Transit in the United States, (1999) reported on extensive new Federally-sponsored research to measure transit benefits in a public choice analytical framework. This departure from the traditional planning framework yielded remarkable new empirical findings on the worth of transit benefits to passengers and taxpayers alike. The present report compiles subsequent FTA research in the same vein. FTA refined its method for calculating transit impacts on auto corridor and network travel times, and this method permits economic valuation. Also, a technique is introduced to facilitate periodical calculations based on changes in corridor traffic volumes. The calculation of transit's location efficiency benefits is extended from residential to commercial properties. We will report on hedonic analysis of commercial property and also the calculation of region-wide agglomeration economies. The Public Choice Transit Benefit Matrix provides the policy-oriented analytical framework for this effort. It is displayed with illustrative measurements in Exec. Table i below. Exec. Table i Public Choice Transit Benefit Matrix Public Choice Transaction Category Transit Policy Function Affordable Basic Mobility Location Efficiency Congestion Management Market Low Fare Save Auto Cost Bypass Traffic Club Social Budget Density Econ. Less Traffic Spillover Labor Market Less VMT Road Budget  The estimated net national benefits of transit for 1995 are presented in Exec. Table ii, indicating that benefits exceed costs and, perhaps more importantly, the net benefit depends on the market niche or policy functions in behalf of which transit services are deployed. Transit's costs, that is, vary according to service profiles that vary with the function transit is performing. Since relatively ""flat"" fares prevail across the transit functions, the resulting subsidies vary according to policy function as well. Moreover, the economic value of trips to passengers also varies by policy function, so that the value of user benefits from a basic mobility trip may be twice that of a congestion bypass trip. However, without a calculation of transit benefits to local, State and Federal taxpayers, the net benefit reported in Exec. Table ii would be misleading. Subsequent chapters report measures for these non-passenger benefits, including travel time benefits to ix   motorists, location benefits for commercial property, and regional efficiency and productivity economies.

Standardized Measurement of Strategic Transit Corridor Performance The Federal Transit Administration conducted door-to-door travel time measures, comparing the travel modes. On the basis of these measures, FTA modeled transit's impact on the other modes in the corridor. The models so derived enable researchers to calculate transit's impacts over time relative to changing travel volumes in the corridor. This procedure equips local planners to calculate transit's highway network benefits for the purposes of periodic transportation planning and budgeting. The network effect of rapid transit in the Washington, D.C. I-270 corridor is illustrated in Exec. Fig. i, where the shaded area represents the time-volume curve if commuters did not have the Washington Metro Red Line as an option to the freeway network. This shaded area translates into person hours the value of which can be calculated from accepted estimates of the value of time. Travel Time Without Transit 150 100 50 0 0 Exec.

Table iii displays summary data on network travel time savings for six transit corridors FTA surveyed in 1998 and 1999. The reader will note that the network benefits x   of transit in Exec. Table iii are arrayed across the same public choice transaction categories used for transit's policy functions earlier. Indeed, taxpayers' stakes in transportation networks parallel their stakes in any public choice budgetary process. The daily travel time savings for transit passengers and motorists in these corridors amounted to over 60,000 hours, worth over $225 million annually. The order of magnitude in these results certainly justify the effort to take similar measurements wherever transit is suspected of influencing highway travel demand. The six corridors summed up in Exec. Table iii represent only the most recently constructed transit systems--only two have rapid rail systems. Further measurements for the major transit corridors in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, San Francisco could prove illuminating. Moreover, this approach might foster periodic updates of transit's local network effects. Exec.

Even though congestion objective of urban transit investment today, there are no indicators effect on the performance of urban highways. traffic volumes and today do not track the management is a key that monitor transit `s  This analysis develops a method by which to extend the Texas Transportation Institute's annual congestion index so as to quantify, on a regular basis, the impact of transit on congestion in urban areas. The paper uses FTA's inter-modal equilibrium model and tracking process to generate an algorithm that, when integrated with the TTI index, permits the index to be expressed both with and without the influence of transit. A test of the method was conducted in two corridors served by urban rail systems. Summarized in Exec. Table iv, the results indicate that the 1999 TTI index for the I-270 corridor in Washington D.C., of 1.72, would have been 1.98 if WMATA's MetroRail had not been in operation. This means that whereas free-flow conditions were exceeded in the corridor by 72 percent during peak periods, free-flow conditions would have been exceeded by 98 percent had MetroRail not been operating. This signifies, as Exec. Table iv reports, that one branch of the MetroRail Red Line saved four million person-hours of delay in 1999. This saving was worth an estimated $62 million in fuel, time and other highway user costs in that year--all at a cost to taxpayers of $25 million. Results are also reported for the Butterfield light rail corridor in Sacramento, California.  xi   Exec.

The 1996 report introduced a methodology to determine the economically justifiable level of subsidy for public transit in the United States. Economically efficient subsidies arise in the absence of congestion pricing on the nation's roadways. The quantitative significance of an efficient subsidy hinges on the extent to which transit reduces the congestion externality. This in turn depends on the cross-price elasticity of demand between transit and auto, the magnitude of the social marginal cost of roadway congestion and a range of other elasticity and cost factors. A total operating subsidy approaching $19.4 billion annually (in constant 1997 dollars) is justified, despite very low reported cross-price elasticities between transit and auto travel. For many congested urban areas, in the absence of road pricing, current transit fares are too high to fully exploit transit's ability to help optimize the economic contribution of highway and transit systems. The changes in the second-best subsidy estimates in Exec. Table v are driven by four principal variables: (i) the change in the demand for auto, bus and rail travel between 1993 and 1997, (ii) the change in traffic conditions on freeways, expressways and principal arterial streets, (iii) the change in operating expenses per passenger mile and (iv) the effect of general inflation. 2  Texas Transportation Institute, 1999  xii   Exec.

Econometric Analysis of Transit and Agglomeration Here we explore the relationship between transit presence, agglomeration economies and the economic efficiency of cities. Agglomeration economies refer to the decline in production costs due to the concentration of economic activity in a specified geographic area. In this context, the presence of a well-functioning transit system is thought to strengthen the impact of agglomeration economies, and thereby, to help cities function even better. This concept helps explain, in particular, why firms and industries located in urban areas tend to be more efficient than firms and industries located in rural areas. By extension, this concept also helps explain why larger cities tend to operate more efficiently than smaller ones. This is the hypothesis that the present analysis proposes to investigate. But, how can transit stimulate urban efficiency? In congested areas, mass transit is often the fastest and most reliable way for people to move from one point to another. As such, transit facilitates meetings and other face-toface communications between members of different firms and industries. In other words, transit promotes the exchange of information, ideas and concepts between firms and industries located within large metropolitan areas. By reducing transportation costs and congestion, mass transit also lowers search costs for would-be employees and recruitment costs for employers. It facilitates the transfer of workers across firms and industries and promotes the efficiency of urban labor markets. Improved public services in general, and mass transit, in particular, also attract more workers to a city. This increase in the number of workers will, through the realization of economies of massed reserves (""economies from selecting workers from a larger pool"") benefit the firms located in a city. Finally, because transit reduces congestion costs, it facilitates the concentration of economic  3  As defined in the 1997 National Transit Database, Federal Transit Administration  xiii   activity. Other things equal, transit enables a higher degree of agglomeration which in turn results in higher productivity and stimulate economic growth. The methodological framework proposed by HLB allows testing for the existence and the magnitude of the postulated impact of transit presence on agglomeration economies and the economic dynamism of cities. To perform the analysis, a sample of one hundred U.S. metropolitan areas has been selected. These metropolitan areas represent about 68% of the U.S. population and produce 73% of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product.4 They are spread over different geographic regions in the U.S. The analysis conducted by HLB consists of estimating the coefficients of a multivariable relationship between urban efficiency on one-hand and city characteristics, including a measure of transit presence, on the other hand. The analysis has led to the conclusion that part of the productivity of large cities is indeed attributable to the presence of mass transit. In other words, it indicated that cities with more transit tend to be more efficient than cities with less transit. This finding has been validated by various statistical tests. The findings of this analysis are summarized in Exec. Table vi. As the table indicates, the estimated impact of transit presence is relatively small. The impact, however, has been validated through various advanced testing procedures. All the tests have led to the conclusion that, indeed transit does help stimulate the economic efficiency and growth of urban areas in the United States. As mentioned above, the technique used by HLB also allows quantifying the extent to which transit presence contributes to urban efficiency. The data indicate, in particular, that a 10 percent increase in transit presence, which represents about 50 extra vehicles (or about 620 extra employees in the transit sector) would raise labor productivity by about 0.4 percent annually. This increase in labor productivity would, for an average metropolitan area5 (which, in 1996, had about 1.7 million habitants and produced about $55.9 billion worth of goods and services), create about $195 million worth of value added per year, which is about $192 per worker6. Furthermore, a simple model of economic growth brought support to the hypothesis that transit promotes economic growth. The analysis indicates that a 10 percent increase in transit presence would raise economic growth by about 0.2 percent. For an average metropolitan area, this would represent about $36 million worth of goods and services created annually, which is about $36 per worker.  4 5 6  Based on 1996 data The universe is about 276 metropolitan areas  The national aggregate effect can be estimated by multiplying the value added per worker with the number of workers, about 127 million worker.  xiv   Exec.

This report provides (1) a detailed review of the existing literature on the topic, (2) a sound methodological framework that can been used to actually measure the impact of transit on commercial properties and (3) an estimate of this impact for a specific area. A careful examination of the literature leads to the conclusion that the hedonic pricing methodology is one of the--if not the--most appropriate methodology for this type of study. A hedonic price model expresses the value of a commodity as a function of its characteristics or attributes. This approach can be applied to the estimation of the impact of transit on commercial property values by regressing a measure of property value on a set of attributes, including the distance to traffic. The estimated coefficient on this variable can be used to derive an estimate for the benefits of transit. The empirical part of this study uses data on 2,830 commercial properties located in Washington D.C. The key findings for the Washington D.C. area include: The distance to the closest Metro Station always enters the model with a negative sign indicating that, other things being equal, the shorter the distance between a commercial property and a Metro Station, the higher the value of the property. This impact is found significant in most of the regressions.  xv   Most of our coefficient estimates are reasonable and confirm the findings of the existing literature. In particular, our measure of the distance to the CBD enters the model with a negative - and significant - coefficient. In our sample, the proximity of a Bus stop does not seem to enhance the value of commercial properties. In some cases, the distance to the closest bus stop even enters the model with a coefficient significantly greater than zero. This counterintuitive result can partly be explained by the way the distance is measured in this particular case study. Exec. Table vii summarizes the key empirical findings of this study. On average, a 1,000 feet reduction in the distance to a Metro station raises the value of commercial properties by $2.3 per square foot. Given an average property size of 30,630 square feet, a 1,000 feet reduction in the distance to transit increases the average value of a commercial property by $70,139 or approximately 2%. Since this estimate is based on a sample of commercial properties observed at a given point in time (a cross-section analysis), it should not be affected by the business cycle. Exec. Table vii Property Value Impacts of Transit Value Increase Per Square-Foot 1 Foot Decrease 1,000 Feet Decrease $0.002 $2.290 Average Value Increase $70.1 $70,138.5  HLB has determined that there are about 11,000 commercial properties in Washington D.C. Therefore, if the average distance to a Metro station were to fall by 100 feet other things equal, the commercial properties located in Washington D.C. would enjoy a total premium of approximately $71 Million.  xvi   Chapter 1. A Brief Review of Historical Transit Policy Analysis The Specter of Transit Costs Historically, policy analysts have examined the performance of transit investments and expenditures in the framework depicted in Figure 1.1. Efficiency is measured as service units per unit of cost or inputs. Effectiveness is measured as the number of ""sales"" per service unit. Costeffectiveness is measured as costs per ""sale"". This straightforward scheme has served to organize the analysis of transit's internal performance. It is a framework that accepts as given the goals (""sales"" or ""patronage"") established by or attributed to policymakers and restricts itself to the economic performance of transit in reaching these legitimate goals.  Efficiency e.g., Cost Per Vehicle Hour  Effectiveness e.g., Passenger Miles Per Vehicle Hour  Cost-Effectiveness e.g., Cost per Passenger Mile Figure 1.1 Framework for Transit Performance Analysis During the 1970s and early 1980s, when large Federal financial aid to transit agencies was growing, this ""performance framework"" was used repeatedly to analyze the merits of transit expenditures at the national aggregate level. Consistently, the studies found that the influx of new funds resulted in lower efficiency and effectiveness. Generally, fare reductions and service expansions were significant. But, just as significant was ""leakage"" of resources into higher labor costs, reduced productivity, and decreased ""sales"" per service unit. These findings were reported regularly in Federal reports, in professional publications, and in the news media. Indeed, the idea that government transit subsidies created as much leakage as passenger benefits became the conventional wisdom throughout the transit industry. As stated by Douglass Lee: The growth in transit operating costs during the 1970s greatly exceeded the rate of inflation, and the reasons for this growth seem to be more closely related to government subsidies than to other facts either external or internal to the industry. (1983) In creating the analytical framework sketched in Figure 1.1, transportation professionals ""operationalized"" the goals they perceived to be coming from transit policymakers. Specifically, the professionals translated economic and social goals into objects that could be measured on the transportation network. Obviously, they reasoned, benefits resided in the passengers of the transit system, and the dollar value of transportation policy goals could be 1   captured in the mileage or time-savings afforded to transit passengers. A 1983 report illustrates this point of view: Most of the goals stated as rationales for federal operating subsidies depend upon increasing transit ridership while reducing auto travel, but because the subsidies had a minor effect on ridership they had even less effect on these indirect goals. (1983) Numerous policy analyses of transit and transit subsidies were conducted in the late 1970s and early 1980s. They were commissioned in response to a widely held perception that transit costs were out of control. Two basic methods were used, both relying on patronage as the ultimate measure of transit performance. One method was known then as an ""accounting approach."" A unit of output or outcome, such as patronage, or average transit labor costs, was measured before and after an increase in revenues. Changes in the ""after"" measures were intepreted as being ""where the money went."" If, in the second measurement, fares were lower and patronage higher, these were considered transportation improvements. Higher labor costs or lower output per person-hour were considered ""leakage"" of the new monies. One accepted version of the accounting framework is presented in Figure 1.2. The circled point in the diagram is the aggregate average fare and ridership for bus and rail transit in the U.S. in 1980. The next horizontal line up is the ""before"" fare, with no federal operating subsidies and only modest local subsidies. Above that is the efficient or base cost per trip, and the highest line gives the actual average cost per trip. Applying an elasticity of -.3 yields the intersection of the demand curve with the higher fare. The following explanation was offered for Figure 1.2:  [Area ""A""] represents the payments to factors of production that were above what was ""needed"" to produce the service, either because the factors were overpaid or because they were underutilized. [Area ""B""] is the subsidy to ""old"" passengers at the efficient cost and the old fare level, while Area D is the additional subsidy to old passengers stemming from reduced fares. Area E is the incremental consumer surplus from ""new"" or induced riders, and Area C + E is the subsidy to induced riders at the efficient cost. Areas F and G indicate the fares paid by the two groups.        An examination of Figure 1.2 reveals no account for changes in service costs associated with service improvements. Rather, the diagram rests on the assumption that the average unit of transit service in 1980 has the same composition of factors of production as in 1970. This assumption rests on a premise that in the absence of Federal and other subsidy increments during the 1970 transit service levels and patronage would have stayed constant. If this accounting method were classified as an experimental design, it would be classed as the ""one-group pretest-posttest design"" wherein one measurement is followed by a second measurement after a period of time. The period of time is selected because it includes the intervention of an explanatory variable, in this case the advent of Federal operating subsidies. Campbell and Stanley (1963) consider this design barely worth doing since it leaves numerous rival hypotheses uncontrolled. In the instance, in Figure 1.2, the introduction of subsidies was only one among a number of events that plausibly could explain large changes in transit's cost  2   structure. Two successive national energy crises, near bankruptcy and bail-out of New York City, sharp inflationary pressures, and major transit service redeployments all affected transit costs during the 1970s. In addition, Figure 1.2 glosses over obvious ongoing historical trends affecting transit patronage and costs, trends well underway before 1970.

Figure 1.2  Partition of Transit Expenditures for Accounting Framework  historical increasing trends in auto ownership and decentralization undermined transit and would naturally undermine the implicit null hypothesis that transit costs and patronage would have stayed the same in the absence of the financial events of the 1970s. In actual fact, as demonstrated in Figure 1.3, during the 1970s transit service and patronage first plunged and then climbed back, thanks in part to the incremental subsidies. To achieve this recovery, the transit industry re-deployed transit services, resulting in a marked shift in the composition and therefore the cost per unit of service. Most importantly, services were redeployed for commuters from the suburbs. Transit patronage in costly peak-period services between suburban residential areas and central cities increased by over 50 percent in the 1970s. Transit planning and marketing employment increased, and maintenance costs increased with the increase in higher quality air-conditioned vehicles. Therefore, rather than signifying ""overpaid""  3   or ""underutilized"" factors, some part of area ""A"" in Figure 1.2 represents improved transit services, a measurable change in the transit's ""production function."" Figure 1.3 plots the 1970-1980 trend line addressed in Figure 1.2--based on two data points-against the annualized trend in transit patronage. Transit's patronage trend, based on average change from 1960 to 1974 is extrapolated to 1985. Figure 1.2's discussion of patronage (and by implication, service) is confined to the area designated as ""A"" in Figure 1.3, premised on the notion that patronage would have remained essentially constant in lieu of subsidies. In fact, the trend was sharply downward, requiring serious change to reverse the actual trend.

Figure 1.3  Historical Transit Patronage and the Two Observation Model  ""B"" in Figure 1.3 reflects the costly transformation from an industry in long term decline to one of growth and, after 1982, stability. The costs of this transformation surely included some ""leakage"" into higher compensation and lower productivity. But the lion's share of the transformation costs were devoted to improvements in equipment and services as measured by longer trips in higher quality services, discussed more fully below. There simply is no category in Figure 1.2 to count these service improvements, so their costs are dismissed as ""overpaid"" or ""underutilized"" factors of production. The story suggested in Figure 1.3 is more subtle than one of misplaced largesse. Rather, it is a story of transformation in which transit efficiency and service qualities improved, winning the financial support of local constituents and restoring equilibrium in transit patronage. Why were these subtleties overlooked? In addition to weaknesses in the design of these studies themselves, there were significant lapses in the comprehension of public policy. Apart from the usual ideological material that influenced some transit research, there were dubious assumptions from research folkways. 4   One important custom was the widespread assumption among researchers that tax dollars held a lower value to transit managers than ""earned"" fare revenues. Tax dollars were often considered ""found money"" that a transit manager, it was assumed, was more likely to squander than fare dollars earned from the transit fare box. On more than one occasion, transit managers were said to be ""addicted"" to Federal subsidies, as if a manager's character was undermined by Federal transit legislation. Seldom considered was the testable proposition that local tax dollars were tied to service constituencies who insisted on more services for more subsidies. Few analysts considered the probability that Federal dollars might be more highly valued and guarded because, apart from Federal guidelines, Federal subsidies carried no constituency strings. Indeed, one researcher found, from multiple regression analysis, that dedicated local tax dollars ""worsened"" performance while Federal subsidies did not.7 He speculated that this was due to uncertainty of the Federal dollars. That the Federal dollars were free from local ""political"" constraints and thus, more importantly, Federal dollars were available for more business-like expenditure, was overlooked. The implications would have been the opposite from those deduced from the ""found money"" theory. The policy conclusions from the transit cost studies conducted between 1975 and 1983 became transit conventional wisdom and so remained. Subsequent Federally-sponsored studies to test logical inferences from those cost studies did not always work out as expected. For instance, studies in the mid-1980s of transit compensation for workers and senior management failed to demonstrate incomes higher than other public employees. An accounting cost study that was expressly designed to capture change in the trends, i.e., with more than two observations in time, demonstrated that transit cost problems were greatest in the period before Federal subsidies. When the accounting approach was used on individual transit systems rather than on pooled data, the pooled cost patterns vanished.  Where Did the Resources Go? Sometimes, it costs money to save money. As Table 1.1 shows, the ""rescue"" of the U.S. transit industry during the period of increased Federal assistance, especially the operating assistance program beginning in 1975, may have been driven by efficiency improvements. Although productivity and cost trends after 1975 were not yet in the black, they were a decided improvement on the same trends before 1975. After 1975, compensation per employee increased (14 percent) at less than a third the rate before 1975 (54 percent). After 1975, expense per passenger increased (20 percent) at the less than a third the rate before 1975 (73 percent).  7  Robert Cervero, ""Cost and Performance Effects of Transit Operating Subsidies in the United States,"" International Journal of Transport Economics, Vol. X, No. 3 (December, 1983).  5   Table 1.1  Transit Cost Analysis Before and After Federal Operating Assistance Percent Change (Adjusted for Inflation) 1965 - 74 1975 - 84  Avg.

In addition to addressing efficiency problems, in the late 1970's, the transit industry was laying down the infrastructure for a seismic shift in its market. This bore fruit in the ensuing decades when the transit patronage balance (in miles) shifted from bus to rail services. Figure 1.4 shows the patronage shift from bus to rail between 1980 and 1997. 24 , 000 Bu s M i llio n 21 , 000 T r a n s it P a sse n g e r Mi l e s 18 , 000  Ra i l  15 , 000 19 80 19 84 19 88 19 92 19 96  Figure 1.4 Source:  Trends in Transit Patronage by Mode, 1980 to 1995 American Public Transit Association, Transit Fact Book, 1980-90 Editions.  6   This transition occurred despite the fact that the total capacity of rail services in 1997 amounted to only 55 percent of comparable bus capacity.8 Noteworthy too is the up-tick in bus patronage in 1997, when the introduction of electronic fare media in New York City suddenly reduced the average fare for short trips. The shift to rail paralleled a shift in average trip length, as shown in Figure 1.5.

During the 1970s and 1980s the number of suburban residents commuting via transit to central city jobs increased at the expense of central city residents commuting to central city jobs (commuting on transit to suburban jobs is negligible). This achievement required competing head to head against auto travel in congested corridors, counting on the travel time advantages of rapid transit services. Owing to their expense, such services required the financial support of motorists who did not use transit, but who would recognize the beneficial effects of competitive rapid transit in lessening traffic congestion. In recent years, public transit has been viewed in many quarters almost exclusively as a means to combat traffic congestion. Transit's value to the economy, however, is not limited to its role in helping to create travel time equilibrium in congested urban corridors. The benefits of transit are just as great--and often greater--in its other economic roles.  8  Defined as total hours operated per vehicle times the number of vehicles, with various vehicle capacities normalized by appropriate weights.

These functions recur and persist in communities throughout the U.S. First, transit provides basic mobility for households that cannot afford a car, for children and elderly people who cannot drive, and for persons with various disabilities that interfere with safe driving. This niche is defined in Table 1.2 as passengers from households with incomes below poverty (less than $6,000 per person) and passengers under 16 or over 74. Working age passengers with above poverty household incomes who choose not to own automobiles are classified as looking to transit for its location efficiency benefits. Finally, working age passengers with above poverty incomes with one or more cars in their possession are classified below as looking to transit for congestion relief. Table 1.2 Operational Definitions of Transit Market Niches Poverty Basic Mobility Location Efficiency Congestion Relief Below Above Above Vehicle Ownership All Categories No Autos Owned One or More Age Not 16 - 74 16 to 74 16 to 74  Using these definitions, Table 1.3 indicates that basic mobility accounted for 2.6 billion passengers (linked trips) in 1995, or 40.1 percent of total transit passengers. Location efficiency accounted for nearly 1.7 billion or 25.3 percent of total patronage. Congestion management accounted for nearly 2.3 billion or 34.7 percent of transit patronage. The different market niches evidence a diverse pattern of transit use, as shown in Table 1.4. Only 20 percent of the transit trips made by the basic mobility group were for worktrips, as contrasted with 38.8 percent of the trips made by the location efficient group and 58.6 percent for the congestion management group. For basic mobility, transit serves a wide variety of mobility purposes. The variety of purposes is less for location efficiency because more of its purposes are served by neighborhood walk trips. Worktrips dominate for congestion management, where non-discretionary travel needs during peak congestion periods make rapid transit an appealing alternative to the private car.  8   The average trip distance for basic mobility, 10.2 miles, is similar to the average distance in the U.S. The average trip distance to bypass congestion is twice as l the appeal of rapid transit particularly for lengthy journeys to work. Transit trips location efficiency, reflecting transit's role of distributing passengers across and neighborhoods and commercial centers.

As a measure of ethnic homogeneity, the share of passengers from households that identify themselves as ""white"" is lowest among the basic mobility niche (30.5 percent) and greatest in the congestion management niche (59.1 percent). The proportion of ""whites"" among the location efficiency group in 1995 was 40.1 percent. Thus, by trip purpose, trip distance, mode choice, and ethnic or racial diversity, each of the three market niches is significantly different from the other two.

As implied by the foregoing information on income and preferences, transit's three different market niches demonstrate different expectations or ""tolerances"" for transit performance. Table 1.5 shows the difference in wait times and reliability across the three niches. The relative ""dependency"" of the basic mobility group is evident in a much higher tolerance for delay (12.1 minutes) and unreliability (13.6 minutes) than is evidenced by the other two groups. People with an auto alternative, using transit to avoid traffic congestion, have average wait times of 7.3 minutes, with 9.3 minutes in variation. Similarly, above poverty households without cars experience wait times that are a little longer than those experienced by households with cars and experience a similar reliability factor. These observations are consistent with the professional  9   literature that indicates that higher income groups attach a higher value to time, especially when waiting for a bus or train.

Source: FTA analysis of 1995 NPTS Database. Table 1.6 presents reflects the degree of crowding in transit vehicles, according to the function transit is performing. As can be seen, transit vehicles are crowded or at least there is insufficient transit seating capacity in all three market niches. Slightly more crowding is experienced by basic mobility passengers, the least by passengers who look to transit as an alternative to their cars. This relative ""equality"" of crowding reflects transit's perennial need with limited resources to maintain a balance among its three constituencies, in this case making ""standees"" of passengers without discrimination. Table 1.6 Transit Performance by Market Niche: Seating Capacity Seat Unavailable Upon Boarding Basic Mobility Location Efficiency Congestion Relief 29.7% 26.3% 25.0%  Source: FTA analysis of 1995 NPTS Database. The following three graphs illustrate transit's cost structure in relation to transit's three market niches. Figure 1.7 arrays transit's three market niches by time of day that each trip originates. The three market niches are shown to demonstrate the cumulative effect of transit travel demand on the deployment of services and their costs. Trips made by the location efficient group, above poverty households without cars, tend to be relatively evenly distributed throughout the day, with a very mild peaking in the morning and afternoon. Trips made by people from below poverty households tend to be a little more peaked during the commuting hours. Transit use by above poverty households with cars contributes the most to the peaking of travel demand. The costs of a transit trip depends on a number of variables. The most important are the time of day (peak or off-peak), vehicle type (bus or rail), and trip distance. Based upon these cost drivers, Figure 1.8 illustrates the relative contribution of each of the three market niches to transit costs in 1995. Transit services for 34.6 percent of trips made by above poverty households with cars account for 47.6 percent of costs. This cost pattern reflects the emphasis that most transit systems place on providing a means for commuters to circumvent congested highways.  10   Million Passenger Boardings per Annum  600 500 400 300 200 100 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  34.6% 40.2% 25.2% Congestion Management  Low Cost Mobility Location Efficiency  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  Time of Day  *5.4 Billion Reported Trips + 1.15 Billion Missing Trips = 6.5 Billion Total Annual Trips  Figure 1.7 Source:  Transit Functions By Time of Day, Boardings, 1995 Author's Analysis of 1995 NPTS Data.

Figure 1.9 shows the costs remaining after the subtraction of fare revenues according to transit policy function. These estimates are equivalent to the subsidies that local, State, and Federal taxpayers provided to local transit operations in 1995. The greatest subsidies are incurred for congestion management, where 56.1 percent of public subsidies paid for 34.6 percent of transit trips in 1995. The 40.2 percent of basic mobility trips accounted for only 28.8 percent of public subsidies. Similarly, 25.2 percent of location efficiency trips incurred 15.1 percent of public subsidies.  11   Annual Operating Subsidies in Millions $800 56.1%  $600 28.8%  $400 $200 $0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  Congestion Management  15.1% Low Cost M obility Location Efficiency  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 Time of Day  Figure 1.9 Source:  Transit Functions by Time of Day: Subsidies, 1995 Author's Analysis of 1995 NPTS Data.  An analysis of transit performance is not complete without an effort to measure benefits. Table 1.7 arrays transit's benefits across the three market niches or policy functions. Using econometric consumer surplus analysis, the benefits of low cost mobility were estimated at $23 billion in 1995 (an amount unlikely to change significantly from year to year). Based on auto ownership cost savings, location efficiency was estimated to be worth $20 billion in 1995. Based on cross elasticities between auto travel on congested freeways and nearby rapid transit, the travel time savings from congestion relief are estimated at $15 billion in 1995. These are imprecise measurements, representing an aggregation of benefits across a variety of circumstances. However, the scale and relative benefit amounts among transit's market niches are consistent with economic theory and with the willingness of local taxpayers to persistently support transit in serving these niches as worthwhile public policy functions.

As a summary of the ground covered, Table 1.8 reports the per trip costs, subsidies, and benefits of transit, according to the public policy functions described earlier. With a per trip benefit of $11.66, location efficiency transit services appear to generate the greatest return for the lowest subsidy ($0.85). The total net benefit of location efficiency in 1995 was $9.82 per passenger. Congestion management generated the least net benefit, $3.07. Basic mobility produced a per trip benefit in the intermediate range of $6.44.  12   Table 1.8  Per Trip Summary of Transit's Economic Performance, 1995 Cost Subsidy $ $ 1.01 2.29 $ $ $ 0.85 Benefit* 8.40 6.37 $ 11.66 Net Benefit $ $ 6.44 3.07 $ 9.82 $ 1.96 $ 1.85 $ 3.29  Basic Mobility Location Efficiency Congestion Relief *Table 1.7.

Much transit policy analysis premised upon a transit cost crisis overlooked the cost to modernize transit organizations, equipment, and deployment. During the 1970s, transit managers wrestled to forge local and fragmented transit services into regional mobility institutions. They not only succeeded in increasing transit's share of suburb to downtown commutes, they did so while simultaneously improving transit's cost structure. This brief analysis points to a pattern of policy preferences that recurs throughout the U.S. transit industry. The greatest focus of large transit systems, both old and new, has been the relief from traffic congestion. This function attracts the financial support of suburban jurisdictions with many residents who must commute in severely congested travel corridors. Owing to a relatively fixed budget since the early 1980s, the expansion of commuter services has been accomplished by squeezing the budgets of services that support pedestrian-oriented neighborhoods and services for affordable mobility.  13    Chapter 2. Standardized Measurement of Strategic Transit Corridor Performance Strategic Transit Corridors The concept of Strategic Transit Corridors (STC) was developed by the Federal Transit Administration to designate travel routes where patronage on rapid transit services measurably affects the travel times of motorists traveling between similar origins and destinations. In such circumstances, ""dynamic travel time equilibrium"" between modes is achieved and is maintained daily by travelers ""queue switching"" between modes. To observe this phenomenon in the U.S., FTA in the early 1990s conducted measurements in 17 corridors that had been screened for their severe levels of traffic congestion. The measurements confirmed the so-called Mogridge-Lewis effect (named for Martin Mogridge who explored these effects in Europe and David Lewis who examined these effects in the U.S.).9 In a second cycle, the FTA office of policy development was charged with finding a means to measure effects between modes and to monitor the effects periodically at a lower cost. The expectation is that local planners will undertake periodically to monitor this intermodal effect. Like many other public sector services, transit infrastructure throughout the U.S. is inadequately supported because analysts have depended on crude, unconvincing, and even irrelevant indices of transit performance. More importantly, the most common measures of transit performance do not furnish discrete benefit values with which to align transit costs. The unsurprising result is an perennial budget cycle in which hard and unpleasing cost numbers are compared against hopelessly ambiguous performance measures. Periodic reports on the dollar value of travel time savings that transit services provide to taxpayers, from a methodology developed by FTA, could enlighten the local budget process for transit agencies. The Equlibrium Model The researchers developed a modeling approach that begins with a baseline travel time survey to empirically establish the travel time equilibrium conditions and between-mode travel behavior effects (elasticities) in a given corridor. Once in place, the resulting analytical model enables subsequent researchers to calculate transit's changing influence as travel volume changes in the corridor. In other words, with known capacity levels and the equilibrium model for the corridor, the hour savings attributable to the Mogridge effect in subsequent readings could be calculated from volume changes in the corridor, which are readily available from the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS). These hour savings could, in turn, be translated into dollar savings based on accepted estimates of the value of time in the relevant urban area or labor market. Such a capability might appeal to local planning agencies to track the performance of transit and other strategies that are designed to manage corridor congestion. Public Choice on the Network  9  Martin J.H. Mogridge, Travel in Towns, (London: Macmillan, 1990).  15   The travel time savings for the baseline studies are subdivided according to three concepts from the literature of public choice theory. Ordinarily, these concepts are applied globally for all functions a given transit system provides to a society. In this particular application, however, we confined our interest to travel time saving on a multiple mode transportation highway-transit network whose capacity is designed for recurring peak period travel. In such networks there are three public choice transactions. First, the fare payment transaction between the transit passenger and the rapid transit service is a market transaction. Second, there is a ""club"" transaction in which travelers to the same destinations as transit passengers willingly support motor fuel taxes dedicated for highway and fungibly for transit capacity. Operationally, that is, recurring ""club"" auto trips are those for which transit offers a competitive travel time. In exchange for this support, ""club"" members who are motorists get quicker drives downtown. Third are the ""spillover"" transactions in which travel time savings on the radial arteries and the transit system spill over to improve conditions on roads and highways not necessarily sharing the same destinations.10 Methodology The study methodology for each corridor consists of four main steps: 1. Collecting highway travel data (traffic volume, distance, travel time, and vehicle occupancy in the corridor); and rail patronage data along the corridor; 2. Conducting door-to-door travel time surveys and deriving the inter-modal travel time convergence; 3. Estimating the ""with transit"" and ""without transit"" model and related curves and estimating the hours of delay saved due to transit; and 4. Quantifying delay savings by user category, namely, (i) rail riders (""market"" benefits); (ii) common segment users (""club"" benefits); and, (iii) parallel highway users (""spillover"" benefits). During the first step, Hickling Lewis Brod Decision Economics (HLB) collected Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) data, local arterial traffic data, and rail patronage data from the local Metropolitan Planning Organization and the principal transit agency. The data were used to estimate the model parameters. For the second step, data was collected on site by a survey team. A corridor, as defined in this study, is a principal transportation artery into the central business district. Multiple transportation services are available to commuters who use this artery. Additionally, during the peak period a large number of commuters utilize this route in their door-to-door commute. A statistical sample of trips was generated in the corridor by identifying random trip end points in the zones at either end of the corridor and joining them so that trips alternated between zones. These zones are catchment zones where travelers converge or diverge from either the transit 10  This conceptual framework for transit is presented in detail in David Lewis and Fred Laurence Williams, Policy and Planning as Public Choice: Mass Transit in the United States, (Aldershot, UK: Ashgate, 1999).  16   station or the principal highway route. In this study these zones are defined as the access segment and the component of the corridor common to all trips for a given mode, regardless of trip end location, is defined as the common segment. Survey crews were instructed to follow specific routes that consisted of an access segment-dependent on the catchment zone considered for the trip--and a common segment. The data collected include start times and arrival times for each segment, by mode, congestion level, seating availability, weather, road conditions, and travel costs for each segment. Data were collected over a period of three or more consecutive weeks. The days of the week were sampled to eliminate fluctuations in traffic patterns and volumes due to the day of week effects. Trips were validated to minimize the effects of unusual or circumstantial conditions. A number of valid trips were selected to ensure a statistically adequate sample size. The study employed the maps and routes connecting several zones within a residential area to several points within the central business district. Step three consisted of estimating the ""with transit"" curve based on the traffic volume and the door-to-door travel time. Using the model discussed below, the contractor derived the ""without transit"" curve and estimated the hours of delay saved due to transit. This performance metric is defined as the vertical difference between the two curves. In step four, the hours of delay saved due to transit are aggregated into three user categories. Savings by common highway-segment users are estimated using the traffic volume on the segment. Savings by transit rail riders are estimated using the ridership data for each station along the corridor. Savings by parallel highway users are estimated using traffic volume on parallel highways and arterials within the corridor. The magnitude of the savings decreases as the distance between the common segment and the arterial increases.  Methodolgy and Model Overview The methodology consists of four steps: 1. 2. 3. 4. Estimating the Corridor Performance Baseline Estimating the Corridor Performance in the Absence of transit Extrapolating Delay Savings Due to Transit Estimation of Corridor Performance without Re-calibration  Estimating the Corridor Performance Baseline The Model This model establishes a functional relationship between the person trip volume all modes--and the average door to door travel time by auto in the corridor. The door to door travel time by auto can be determined using a logistic function which calculates the door to door travel time in terms of travel time at free flow speed, trip time by high capacity rail mode, and the volume of trips in the corridor for all modes. The door to door travel time can be estimated as follows: T = (Tc - Tff) / (1 + e -( +  V1)  ) +T  ff  (1)  17   where Ta1 is auto trip time, Tc is trip time by high-capacity rail mode Tff is auto trip time at free-flow speed, V is person trip volume in the corridor by auto, and ,  are model parameters Equation 1 implies that the door to door auto trip time is equal to the trip time at free-flow speed plus a delay which depends on transit travel time and the person trip volume in the corridor. In other words, when the highway volume is close to zero, travel time is equal to travel time at free flow speed.(T = Tff). As the volume increases, the travel time is equal to Tff plus a delay due to the high volume, but adjusted to the travel time by high capacity transit. That is the high capacity transit alleviates some of the highway trip delay as some trips shift to transit. Equation 1 is transformed into a linear functional form before the parameters  and  can be estimated, the transformed equation will be: U =  +  V1 where U = ln [(Tc - Tff) / (T - Tff ) - 1] Data The data required for the estimation of the above equations are:  person trip volume on the highway which can be calculated by dividing the traffic volume by the average vehicle occupancy (auto and buses). This data are available through HPMS data base and MPO's traffic data. free flow trip time is a constant. high capacity trip time is a constant. Equation 2 is estimated using Ordinary Least Squares regression. (2)     The parameters  and  do not have to be re-estimated each year, they are both specific to the corridor and are relatively stable over the years. So periodically, the person trips volume can be inserted into Equation 1 to estimate the door to door travel time by auto.  Estimating the Corridor Performance in the Absence of transit The Model This model represents the concept to quantify the role of transit in congestion management. In the absence of transit, the travel time Ta is estimated as: Ta = Tff * (1 + A (V*)) where Ta is the door to door travel time in the absence of transit, Tff is the trip travel time at free-flow speed, V* is the volume of person trips by auto in the absence of transit, A is a scalar, and  is a parameter. Equation 3 implies that the door to door travel time in the absence of transit depends on the travel time at free-flow speed and the level of congestion on the road in the absence of transit. 18  (3)   The volume of person trips by auto in the absence of transit, however, depends on several factors:       The existing auto and bus person trips on the highway. The percentage of person transit trips shifting to auto The percentage of person transit trips shifting to bus The number of additional cars in the highway The number of additional buses in the highway The occupancy per vehicle in the absence of transit V* = V1 + 1 Vc + 2 Vb Where V1 is the existing auto volume, Vc is the transit person trips diverted to cars, Vb is the transit person trips diverted to buses, and 1, 2 are the coefficients that incorporate the passenger car equivalent factor, and the occupancy per vehicle (cars and buses). The trips diverted to cars and buses depend mainly on the degree of convergence in the corridor. This degree of convergence reflects the transit user behavior and the composition of these users. The transit users can be divided into 3 categories: Type 1: ""Explorers"" who are casual switchers and who will divert to Single Occupancy Vehicles in the absence of transit. Type 2: Commuters with low elasticity of demand with respect to generalized cost and who will divert to use the bus or carpool. Type 3: Commuters with high elasticity of demand with respect to generalized cost and who will forgoes the trip. The higher the degree of convergence (auto and rail door to door travel times are very close), the higher the shift of transit riders to cars and buses. Therefore, higher degree of convergence will lead to higher delay, which translates into higher savings due to transit. In words, Equation 3 shows that in the absence of transit and in the case of a high degree of convergence, the person trip volume is very high which translates into a high trip time (excessive delay). The relationship between trip time and person trip volume can be expressed as a convex curve (as the volume increases, travel time increases at an increasing rate). Figure 2.1 illustrates the relationship between the volume and travel time both in the presence and in the absence of transit. (4)  The volume of person trips by auto, in the absence of transit, can then be estimated as:  19   Travel Time 125 100 75 50 25 0 0  Without Transit  With Transit  25,000 Highway Traffic Volume  50,000  Figure 2.1 Source:  Washington, D.C.

Data The data required to populate this model consist of:        Highway person trip volume (used in the previous model) Transit ridership data Fleet composition (cars and buses percentages out of the total traffic) Cars and buses vehicle occupancy Passenger car equivalent factor Degree of convergence to determine the percentage person trips shifting to cars and buses Free-flow travel time which is a constant  Equation 3 is specific to the corridor and does not need to be estimated each year. It will only be necessary to re-estimate them with an updated degree of convergence if a major change is made to the transit level of service or the highway structure.  Extrapolating Delay Savings Due to Transit While the MLC hypothesis proves to be valid during the peak period only, the delay savings due to transit can be estimated during off-peak as well. This metric can be estimated as the vertical difference between the ""without transit"" curve and the ""with transit"" curve. That is at a specific person trip volume, the difference in travel times between the two cases can be defined as ""the hours of delay saved due to transit"".  20   The estimated hours of delay savings due to transit are an aggregation of three different user savings: savings by Metro riders (market benefits), savings by highway users (club benefits), and savings by users of parallel highways (spillover benefits).    The market benefits are estimated based on delay saved (which depends on the distance traveled) for each rider within the common segment. The club benefits are estimated based on the volume on the common segment using origin-destination table and the daily trip distribution. The spillover benefits are estimated based on the savings per mile, traffic volume, and the distance traveled on segments parallel to the common segment. The spillover benefits are calculated by multiplying the traffic volume with a percentage of the delay savings. This percentage decreases as the distance between the common segment and the parallel highway increases.  Estimation of Corridor Performance without Re-calibration The framework, presented above, provides an MLC-based approach to making repeated measures of transit-induced savings in corridor delay without the need for repeated MLC surveys. The approach rests on the theoretical proposition that a stable and measurable relationship exists between roadway traffic growth over time and the inter-modal (highwaytransit) equilibrium dynamics that give rise to delay savings in a congested corridor. In the absence of major changes in the level of highway supply or transit service in the corridor, this measured relationship, or model, provides a formula-based performance measurement system in lieu of a survey-based approach. In addition to the obvious cost advantages, this approach provides FTA with (i) an efficient means of measuring and comparing transit performance in strategic corridors; and (ii) a consistent performance assessment tool for transfer to MPOs throughout the country.  The Survey Data Summarized Travel time surveys were conducted on the six transit corridors listed in Table 2.1. The Maryland I-270 corridor was selected to test the current methodology against analogous survey data collected in 1994. The I-270 corridor is very heavily traveled, served by a ten-lane interstate highway, a main arterial (SR-355), and heavy rail transit services. For illustrative purposes, the I-270 results are displayed Figure 2.1 above. Except for the Chicago Midway corridor, served by heavy rail, the remaining corridors are less heavily traveled and are served by light rail transit.  21   Table 2.1  Strategic Transit Corridors, 1998 - 1999 Surveys Butterfield North Hanley Gateway Park Lane Washington I-270 Midway Airport Sacramento, CA St. Louis, MO Portland, OR Dallas, TX Washington, D.C. Chicago, IL  To further illustrate the method, data for the Washington, D.C. I-270 Red Line corridor are arrayed in Table 2.2. Market benefits for transit passengers amounted to 10,095 hours saved in 1998. Motorists traveling between similar origins and destinations in the corridor were saved 8,196 hours daily as a motor ""club"" benefit. Spillover time savings to other motorists on the network were 5,860 hours daily. Translated into dollar values and summed annually, the total network benefit (in time savings alone) amounted to $90 million in 1998. The estimated costs of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Red Line for these trips, at $3.66 per trip (1997), totaled about $60 million. Table 2.2 Washington, D.C.

I-270 Red Line transit corridor. It illustrates how the model produces new outcomes in response to travel volume change over the three-year period. The benefit amounts in the last column would concisely illumine those moments when local budgets are asked to cover Red Line services. Row one in Table 2.4 presents the total daily time saving network benefits across the six corridors. The time savings are arrayed according to public choice transaction. In these six corridors, transit passengers saved 17,443 hours daily. By removing these would-be motorists from highway segments with the same destinations as transit, transit saved motorists an additional 21,981daily hours. Other highways on the local network received spillover savings of 20,691 daily hours.  22   Table 2.3  Summary Table of Delay Savings in the Washington, D.C.

Travel time savings to commuters in these four corridors are over 901,735 per day. Again, most of these savings are to motorists ($329,728 + $310,374 = $640,102) in the six corridors. Based on the typical 250 rush hour days per year (roughly corresponding to 250 work-days), these savings sum to $225 million annually in the six corridors surveyed.

Conclusion FTA research has created a new tool for the efficient measurement of network economies produced by rapid transit in congested urban corridors. Establishment of the corridor specific analytical model requires great care. But once in place, the model can be updated regularly with ongoing Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) travel databases. With widely accepted empirical data, the model results can tell decision-makers the dollar value of transit expenditures for congestion management on a periodic basis. 1. The interaction of transportation network components produces a benefit distribution for the network that corresponds analytically to three perennial public choice budget transactions: generalized costs savings for transit passengers in exchange for their fare payments--market benefits; 2. congestion delay savings for motorists with similar destinations, whose motor fuel taxes for highways are also used for rapid transit--""club"" benefits; and 3. spillover benefits--time savings for motorists, businesses, and households which rely on other portions of the general network. 23   24   Chapter 3. Transit Benefits Based on Standard Congestion Index and Equilibrium Corridor Dynamics: A Conceptual Framework Introduction The finding of an equilibrating effect of rail transit on highway and transit travel times suggests that the effect of rail transit on highway congestion can be predicted, and shaped, by transit policy. However, the quantitative relationship between the equilibrium effect and standard measures of congestion indices, has not been identified. The objective of this paper is to establish a conceptual framework within which the standard congestion index and the equilibrium corridor dynamics are used to develop a Transit Performance Index. This transit performance index will indicate the excess delay savings due to transit. Conceptual Framework The Annual Mobility Report issued by the Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) provides travel conditions, in the form of congestion indices, in major urban areas in the United States. While the report provides several congestion measures, it does not quantify nor mention the contribution of transit in congestion management in these areas. HLB, however, developed for the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), a performance metric which efficiently measures transit effectiveness in congestion management. The current paper builds on the TTI congestion index, mainly the Travel Rate Index (TRI), to derive a TRI in the absence of transit. To derive the modified TRI, the framework calls for the use of the following variables: Peak period travel rate for both freeway and principal arterial street Free flow travel rate for both freeway and principal arterial street Peak Period VMT The Convergence data that are based on door-to-door travel time surveys Using the TTI standard congestion index TRI to derive the TRI, in the absence of transit, provides the following advantages: TRI in the absence of transit will be consistent with the national standard congestion index TRI Since the corridor convergence levels are stable over time, TRI in the absence of transit can be updated yearly based on the standard TRI, therefore providing a transit performance trend. TRI in the absence of transit will be based on the widely accepted HPMS database. Figure 3.1 illustrates the conceptual framework of deriving the TRI in the absence of transit based on the TTI congestion index TRI. Plan of the Chapter This chapter develops the conceptual framework for estimating the delay savings due to transit during peak period in strategic corridors. Following this introductory section, we present the methodology of the index derivation for the corridor both in the presence and in the absence of 25   transit. This includes the calculation mechanism of the congestion index and the process to estimate the index in the absence of transit using the corridor convergence data. The methods material is followed by an example of estimating the transit delay savings. The example shows the index estimation for two corridors, I-270-Washington corridor and Butterfield  Sacramento corridor.

The methodology starts by adjusting the standard TRI for a specific corridor and then uses the corridor convergence, based on the door-to-door travel time survey, to derive the TRI in the absence of transit. TTI Congestion Indices In its annual mobility report, the Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) provides a set of congestion measures for about 68 urban areas in the United States. These measures are categorized as individual, area-wide, and trend measures. Individual measures consist of: Travel Rate Index: which is the extra amount of travel time during peak period compared to free flow travel. Delay per eligible driver and per capita Wasted fuel per eligible driver and per capita Congestion cost per eligible driver and per capita Areawide measures estimate the impact the congestion have on the entire urban area and include: Areawide annual travel delay Areawide wasted fuel Areawide congestion cost Amount of roadway needed each year to address congestion Vehicle occupancy change needed each year to address congestion Trend measures quantify the change in congestion level (measures shown above) for each urban area over the years. The TTI database extends from 1982 to present. To estimate the transit benefit based on congestion index, this study uses the Travel Rate Index as the basis for the calculation of transit congestion management benefits. TRI is used because it relies on HPMS data, it is estimated based on the travel speed and the VMT during peak period, and it measures the excess delay during peak period. The next section provides a definition of the TRI as well as its mathematical derivation The Travel Rate Index (TRI) Definition The Travel Rate Index (TRI) measures the additional travel time that is necessary for an individual to make a trip during the peak period. In other words, TRI measures how much longer it takes to make a trip than would be the case if the trip occurred in free-flow conditions. The TRI equation, shown below, is a weighted average of the peak period travel rates on the freeway and principal arterial streets. The TRI calculation includes an estimate of only the delay due to high traffic volumes that typically occur in the peak period on weekdays. 27   The TRI equation can be written as follows: TRI = ((FPPTR / FFFTR) * FPPVMT + ((PAPPTR / PAFFTR) * PAPPVMT) (FPPVMT + PAPPVMT) Where FPPTR is the freeway peak period travel rate, FFFTR is the freeway free flow travel rate, FPPVMT is the freeway peak period vehicle miles traveled, PAPPTR is the principal arterial peak period travel rate, PAFFTR is the principal arterial free flow travel rate, and PAPPVMT is the principal arterial vehicle miles traveled. Standard TRI Estimation The TRI is defined as the travel rate, in minutes per mile, during the peak period, divided by the rate in the off-peak. A TRI of 1.50 indicates that the average peak trip takes 50 percent longer than a trip in free-flow conditions. For example, a 30 minute trip becomes a 45 minute trip. The freeway and principal arterial peak period VMT is calculated as follows: Peak Period VMT = Daily VMT * Percentage of Travel during Congested Conditions (1) The travel rate is calculated by converting the average speed, in miles per hour, to a travel rate in minutes per mile. Travel Rate = 60 / Average Speed For example, for a region of :       freeway peak period VMT of 10 million, principal arterial street VMT of 5 million (about 50% of daily VMT), a freeway peak period travel rate of 1.3, a freeway free flow travel rate of 1.0, a principal arterial street peak period travel rate of 2.0, and a principal arterial street free flow travel rate of 1.5. (2)  The TRI will be calculated as follows: 1.31 = ((1.3 / 1.0) * 10,000,000) + ((2.0 / 1.5) * 5,000,000)) (10,000,000 + 5,000,000) Modifying TRI From a Region Basis to a Corridor Basis Index TRI uses the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) database compiled by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) using data submitted by State Departments of  28   Transportation (DOTs). The travel speed is estimated for each roadway link using daily traffic volume per lane values. Therefore, it is feasible to select roadways in a specific corridor instead of using the entire region roadways. In fact a TRI will be much more accurate for a specific corridor, than for the entire region, because of the small number of roadways, a much accurate traffic volume number, and a much precise traffic speed level. The TRI estimation function will be similar to the function shown as Equation 1 except that the metrics will be corridor specific.  TRI in the Absence of Transit The TRI in the absence of transit is estimated using the door-to-door travel time survey data and the corridor convergence level. The approach consists of four main steps: 1. Estimate the corridor travel time, in the absence of transit, based on the methodology presented in Chapter 2. 2. Convert travel time to traffic rate in the absence of transit based on the roadways length, traffic volume, and the average speed. 3. Calculate the freeway and principal arterial peak period VMT, in the absence of transit based on the corridor convergence level and the rail passenger diversion into cars and buses. 4. Estimate the TRI, in the absence of transit, using Equation 1 and the variables estimated in Steps 2 and 3. Travel Time in the Absence of Transit Based on the methodology developed in Chapter 2, in the absence of transit, the travel time Ta is estimated as: Ta = Tff * (1 + A (V*)) Where Ta is the door to door travel time in the absence of transit, Tff is the trip travel time at free-flow speed, V* is the volume of person trips by auto in the absence of transit, A is a scalar, and  is a parameter. Equation 3 implies that the door-to-door travel time in the absence of transit depends on the travel time at free-flow speed and the level of congestion on the road in the absence of transit. The volume of person trips by auto in the absence of transit, however, depends on several factors: The existing auto and bus person trips on the highway. The percentage of person transit trips shifting to auto The percentage of person transit trips shifting to bus The number of additional cars in the highway The number of additional buses in the highway The occupancy per vehicle in the absence of transit (3)  29   The volume of person trips by auto, in the absence of transit, can then be estimated as: V* = V1 + 1 Vc + 2 Vb Where V1 is the existing auto volume, Vc is the transit person trips diverted to cars, Vb is the transit person trips diverted to buses, and 1, 2 are the coefficients that incorporate the passenger car equivalent factor and the occupancy per vehicle (cars and buses). The trips diverted to cars and buses depend mainly on the degree of convergence in the corridor. This degree of convergence reflects the transit user behavior and the composition of these users. The transit users can be divided into 3 categories: Type 1: ""Explorers"" who are casual switchers who will divert to Single Occupancy Vehicles in the absence of transit. Type 2: Commuters with low elasticity of demand with respect to generalized cost who will divert to use the bus or carpool. Type 3: Commuters with high elasticity of demand with respect to generalized cost who will forgoes the trip. The higher the degree of convergence (auto and rail door to door travel times are very close), the higher will be the shift of transit riders will be to cars and buses. Therefore, higher degree of convergence will lead to higher delay which translates into higher savings due to transit. Equation 3 shows that in the absence of transit and in the case of a high degree of convergence, the person trip volume is very high. This translates into a high trip time (excessive delay). The relationship between trip time and person trip volume can be expressed as a convex curve. As the volume increases, travel time increases at an increasing rate. The figure below illustrates the relationship between the volume and travel time in the presence and absence of transit. Converting Travel Time in the Absence of Transit to Travel Rate in the Absence of Transit The average travel speed, in the absence of transit, can be derived using the travel time in the absence of transit and the corridor length. The travel speed in the absence of transit (TSAT) is estimated as follows: TSAT = 60 * Corridor length Travel time in the absence of transit The travel rate in the absence of transit can be estimated as shown in Equation 2, that is dividing the free flow travel speed by the travel speed in the absence of transit. Estimation of Peak Period VMT in the Absence of Transit Peak period VMT (obtai transit. The the occupan Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), in the absence of transit, consists of the existing ned from HPMS databases) and the estimated generated VMT in the absence of generated VMT in the absence of transit depends on the rail transit ridership level, cy per vehicle (for cars and buses) and the level of convergence in the corridor. (5) (4)  30   Higher degree of convergence (auto and rail door to door travel times are very close) means a higher shift of transit riders to cars and buses. The peak period VMT in the absence of transit can be estimated as follows: VMT1 = VMT0 + ATL * TP * ( / CVO +  /BVO) Where VMT1 is the overall VMT in the absence of transit, VMT0 is the VMT in the presence of transit, ATL is the corridor average trip length, TP is the transit rail passenger (ridership volume), CVO is the corridor average vehicle occupancy for cars BVO is the corridor average vehicle occupancy for buses  is the percentage of rail passenger diverting to cars in the absence of transit  is the percentage of rail passenger diverting to buses in the absence of transit  and  depend on the convergence level in the corridor, the percentage of diversion to cars and buses is higher when a high convergence level exist between in the rail transit travel time and highway travel time. VMT1 will be estimated for both freeways and principal arterial streets and will replace the VMTs values shown in Equation 1. Similarly, travel rate in the absence of transit will be estimated for both the freeways and principal arterial streets and for both peek and off-peak periods to replace travel rates in Equation 1. Estimation of TRI in the Absence of Transit Estimating travel rate index in the absence of transit consists of updating Equation 1 using the corridor travel rates and VMTs, in the absence of transit, shown above. The TRI in the absence of transit (TRIAT) can be estimated as follows: TRIAT = (FSL / FTSAT) * FVMT1 + (PAFFTSAT / PATSAT) * PAVMT FVMT1 + PAVMT Where FSL is the freeway speed limit, FTSAT is the freeway peak period travel speed in the absence of transit FVMT1 is the freeway peak period VMT in the absence of transit PAFFTSAT is the principal arterial free flow travel speed in the absence of transit PATSAT is the principal arterial peak period travel speed in the absence of transit PAVMT is the principal arterial peal period VMT in the absence of transit Equation 7 will be estimated for a specific corridor instead of the region. The data to populate the model will be gathered from the HPMS databases and through the corridor travel time survey. 1 1  (6)  (7)  31   Transit Benefit Based on the TRI Congestion Index Once the TRI in the presence of transit and in the absence of transit have been calculated, the transit benefit can be estimated as the difference between the two indices. This difference can be interpreted as the percentage of travel time savings solely attributable to transit during peak period. A TRI in the presence of transit of 1.3 and in the absence of transit of 1.4 indicates that the average peak trip takes 10 percent longer in the absence of transit than in the presence of transit in the selected corridor. Using TTI measurements, the travel time percentage savings due to transit can be quantified as the annual total delay savings in the corridor, the delay per driver in the corridor, the delay per capita in the corridor, and/or the fuel consumption savings in the corridor. Example of Transit Benefit Estimation Using TRI We the this the now present an application example of the methodology, using the example of two corridors, I-270  Washington corridor and the Butterfield  Sacramento corridor. Since the purpose of paper is to build a conceptual framework to apply a standard congestion index to measure transit benefits, this example relies on assumptions and proxy data when necessary.  Corridors Characteristics The selected corridors are both listed within congested areas by the TTI. Table 3.1 summarizes HLB findings for these corridors and provides TTI findings on their respective urban areas.

TRI in The Presence of Transit TRI in the presence of transit is estimated for each corridor by estimating the travel rate and the VMT for the corridor roadways only. Table 3.2 shows the data used to estimate the TRI in the presence of transit for each corridor. 11 12  TTI findings are based on the region where the corridor is located Include savings by transit users and highway users throughout the network.  32   Table 3.2  Corridor Data* Used to Estimate the TRI in the Presence of Transit Corridor I-270 - Washington 1,756,387 962,500 60% 29.2 55 21.1 35 30 Butterfield-Sacramento 523,059 416,259 50% 44.3 60 23.2 35 30  Daily Freeway VMT** Daily Principal Arterial VMT Percentage of Travel during Peak Period Freeway Peak Period Travel Speed Freeway Free Flow Travel Speed Principal Arterial Peak Period Travel Speed Principal Arterial Free Flow Travel Speed Principal Arterial off peak Travel Speed  *The figures are based on HPMS data and data from local DOTs and MPOs (see corridor case studies for detail data on each corridor). ** The estimation assumes that the I-270 corridor represents about 5% of the total Washington region VMT. For the I-270 Washington Corridor, the TRI in the presence of transit (TRIPT) can then be estimated as: TRIPT Washington  ={(55/29.2)*(1756,387 * .60)} + {((35/21.1) / (35/30) ) * ( 962,500 * .60)} = 1.72 (1756,387 + 962,500) * .60  This TRI value of 1.72 indicates that it takes 72 percent longer to make a trip in the I-270 corridor during peak period than it would take if the travel occurred at free-flow speeds. Similarly, the TRI in the presence of transit for the Butterfield  Sacramento corridor can be estimated as: TRIPT Sacramento  = {(60/44.3) * (523,059 * .50)} + {((35/23.2)/(35/30)) * (416,259 * .50)} = 1.33 (523,059 + 416,259) * .50  The TRI value of 1.33 indicates that it takes 33 percent longer to make a trip in the Butterfield  Sacramento corridor during peak period than it would be if the travel occurred at free flow speeds. The calculation also shows that there is a higher level of congestion in the I-270 Washington corridor than in the Butterfield  Sacramento corridor, mainly due to higher traffic volume and lower speed in the I-270 corridor. TRI in the Absence of Transit The estimation of the TRI in the absence of transit is conducted by substituting the VMTs and travel speeds in the presence of transit with the values estimated in the absence of transit. Table  33   3.3 shows the data used to estimate the TRI in the absence of transit. The free flow travel speed and the percentage of travel during peak period are similar to the ones listed in Table 3.2.

Using the estimated values, shown in Table 3.3, the I-270 Washington Corridor TRI in the absence of transit (TRIAT) can be estimated as: TRIAT Washington  ={(55/24.51)*(1,826,398*.60)}+{((35/17.9)/(35/15.04))*(1,009,174 * .60)}=1.98 (1,826,398 + 1,009,174) * .60  This TRI value of 1.98 indicates that it would almost twice longer to make a trip in the I-270 corridor during peak period in the absence of transit than it would take if the travel occurred at free-flow speeds. Similarly, the estimation for the TRI in the absence of transit for the Butterfield  Sacramento corridor can be estimated as follows: TRIATSacramento={(60/36.9) * (546,544 * .50)} + {((60/22.64) / (35/30)) * (431,916 * .50)} =1.49 (546,544 + 431,916) * .50 The TRI value of 1.49 indicates that it would take 49 percent longer to make a trip in the Butterfield Sacramento corridor during peak period in the absence of transit than it would be if the travel occurred at free flow speeds.  34   Transit Delay Savings During Peak Period The transit contribution in the reduction of travel time delays during peak period can be estimated by taking the difference between the TRI in the presence of transit and the TRI in the absence of transit. For the I-270  Washington corridor, the transit contribution to congestion management can be estimated as: TCCM Sacramento  = TRIATSacramento  TRIPTSacramento = 1.98 / 1.72 = 0.15%  The value of 0.26 indicates that it would take 15 percent longer to make a trip in the I-270  Washington corridor during peak period in the absence of transit than it would take in the presence of transit. Using the annual person hours of delay estimated by TTI for the Washington region of 216 million, and assuming that the I-270 corridor VMT represents about five percent of the total VMT in the Washington region, the total delay savings attributed to transit in the I-270 Washington corridor will be over 4 million person hours that can be valued at about $62 million per year. Similarly, for the Butterfield  Sacramento corridor, the transit contribution to congestion management (TCCM) as: TCCM Washington  = TRIAT  Washington   TRIPT  Washington  = 1.49 / 1.33 = 0.12%  The value of 0.16 indicates that it would take 12 percent longer to make a trip in the Butterfield  Sacramento corridor during peak period in the absence of transit than it would take in the presence of transit. Using the annual person hours of delay estimated by TTI for the Sacramento region of 35 million, and assuming that the Butterfield  Sacramento corridor VMT represents about five percent of the total VMT in the Sacramento region, the total delay savings attributed to transit in the Butterfield  Sacramento corridor will be around .86 million person hours that can be valued at about $13 million per year.  Conclusion The finding of an equilibrating effect of rail transit on highway and transit travel suggests that the effect of rail transit on highway congestion can be predicted, and shaped, by transit policy. However, the quantitative relationship between the equilibrium effect and standard measures of congestion has not been identified. In fact, while the TTI publications on mobility and the congestion levels in urban areas in the United States provide a quantification of the infrastructure needs to lower congestion, they do not mention the role and the effect of transit on congestion management. This paper develops the conceptual framework within which transit-induced changes in highway travel times (as a result of measured equilibrium effects) translate into reduced congestion, as measured by the TTI indices. The methodology in this paper uses the travel rate index TRI calculation framework to estimate the TRI in the presence of transit for a specific corridor. Then it uses the corridor convergence level to estimate the TRI in the absence of transit. The difference between the two indices measures the percentage of excess delay savings due to rail transit in the corridor. The paper uses data from two corridors to illustrate the estimation mechanism of the transit contribution to congestion management. Using the framework developed in this paper, transit is 35   found to save over 4 million person hours per year in excess delay during peak period in the I270 Washington corridor and about .86 million person hours per year in the ButterfieldSacramento corridor. These delay savings are estimated at about $61 million and $13 million, respectively.  36   Chapter 4. Economically Optimal Transit Subsidies in the United States, An Update for 1999 Introduction Transit and highways together comprise a system of urban transportation. The policy imperative for transportation is to recognize the reality of political and institutional barriers and to achieve efficient use of society's resources subject to those constraints. The lack of road pricing is a significant constraint on consumer sovereignty on the transportation system. Without a pricing mechanism as a means to save their own money or time by prudent use of the road network, motorists generate inefficient levels of highway congestion. Until market-based road and parking pricing become feasible on a significant scale, therefore, the optimal policy response to traffic congestion is to subsidize the transit mode, calculated at $19.4 billion for the U.S. in 1999. Congestion, Road Pricing and Welfare Prospective commuters weigh the benefits and costs that they face when choosing between alternative modes (i.e., transit or highways). The costs not fully borne by the individual, including the congesting effect of an additional private vehicle on the road, do not generally enter his/her calculations. ""Second-best"" policy options are pragmatic responses to the reality that absent marginal cost road pricing the congesting effect of travelers do not enter private calculations. Economic theory then suggests that all travelers, whether car users or not, can be made better off if the new users are charged a special toll. For instance, they could pay a toll to cover the additional social costs they impose (in economic terms, making consumers better off is also expressed as increasing their welfare). Of course, such a ""congestion"" toll (also known as road pricing) is unlikely, owing to institutional and political barriers. In effect, there remains a distortion in the price of road travel created by uncompensated social costs. Failure to address this price distortion leads to inefficient levels of congestion and slower travel times. Attendant negative effects include time and productivity losses for road users, higher costs of production, and possibly higher levels of pollution (NAS, 1994). The Case for Subsidizing Transit In the world as it is, all travelers can still be made better off (if not as well off as in the ""firstbest"" world) if a ""compensating variation"" can be introduced into prices in other, related sectors of the economy (Laffont, 1989). Indeed, the solution may seem paradoxical: if road travel is under-priced (i.e., there exists no road pricing to discourage additional congestion), then it is justified to under-price the cost of travel on other modes. More precisely, fares on public transit would be subsidized, so that transit users would pay less than what it costs to transport them. The reasoning behind this seeming paradox is the following: a subsidy draws potential auto travelers to transit, thus averting additional congestion (this result depends on the fact that mass transit causes less congestion than does road travel). In fact, in the absence of road pricing, subsidizing some travelers not to use roads makes everyone better off, road and transit users alike as long as the subsidy is less than the congestion costs imposed by each additional driver. Subsidies are set such that, for the last prospective auto traveler they attract to transit, they  37   exactly offset the additional congestion costs to all current road users that would have occurred had that person decided to use a car instead. Plan of the Report The next section reviews research on the pricing of public transit. It focuses on how both road and transit users' welfare can be maximized in the absence of road pricing. We then introduce a methodological framework to estimate ""second-best"" transit subsidies in the United States.  Background Studies by Glaister, Lewis (1978) and others in Europe during the 1970s and 80s indicate that subsidizing transit services is an economically efficient response to the political and institutional barriers to road pricing. The authors adapted the general theory of ""second-best"" in a methodology for calculating the optimal subsidy for public transit when roads are systematically under-priced. This methodology combines cross-price elasticities of the various transportation modes with the social marginal costs of each into a model that generates the optimal set of prices for each mode (cross-price elasticities refer to the responsiveness of consumers to price changes on alternative travel modes). The Social Costs of Road Travel The argument in favor of subsidizing public transit follows from the under-pricing of road travel. In the absence of marginal-cost pricing, individual drivers do not take into account the congestion they impose on others when making travel decisions. The theory of second-best says that, when prices deviate from their marginal (social) cost in one sector, then using marginal-cost pricing in other, related sectors will not lead to a social optimum. In the case at hand, road use is under-priced due to lack of tolls and intense congestion levels. Indeed, society would be better off by subsidizing transit fares, thus drawing travelers away from road use and reducing the social costs they previously imposed on other road users. Opponents of subsidies to public transit argue that cross-price elasticities are so small and transit's share of the total transportation market so insignificant that most analysts assume the optimal transit subsidies derived by this approach would also be insignificant. Evidence from Dr. Herbert Mohring and Dr. David Anderson (1996) suggests that, even in lightly congested urban areas such as Minneapolis/St. Paul, the optimal congestion toll on highways may be as high as $0.49 per mile (the study was conducted in 1996). Estimates of this magnitude suggest that the social costs of driving may be higher than previously thought. If the cross-price elasticities between road use and public transit were significant, then the subsidization of public transit would lead to large (social) cost savings. Furthermore, research by HLB Decision Economics Inc. indicates that a certain class of travelers may be especially sensitive to relative prices among transportation modes. These travelers are ""explorers"" who frequently switch modes. They are sensitive to price when choosing travel modes and might switch to transit based on the optimal transit fare. Taken together, the high social costs of congestion, the presence of ""explorers"" and the historically significant cross-price elasticities between road use and public transit argue for a thorough examination of transit subsidy policy. 38   The ""Second-Best"" Alternative Currently, transit operations and capital spending are subsidized by many levels of government. Since the distribution of transit operating funds does not currently account for the economic efficiency of the ""second-best"" optimal subsidy, it is likely that some of these current subsidies are too low or too high to yield the economically efficient fare structure given road underpricing. Subsidies can only be ""efficient"" in an economy operating in what economists have called a ""second-best"" world. The ""first best"" policy response to under-priced of roads would be to price roads at the social marginal costs of driving. Marginal cost pricing is a fundamental indicator of the efficient allocation of resources. The theory of ""second-best"" suggests other outcomes when this ""first best"" outcome is unachievable. The theory of ""second-best"" states, generally, that when a distortion (under-priced roads) exists in one sector, traditional optimality conditions (marginal cost pricing) do not necessarily apply in all other sectors. In essence, the results obtained in a ""second-best"" analysis may contradict the intuition based on a first best analysis. In this case, the optimality of transit subsidies derives from the under-pricing of roads. Since automobile travel creates negative effects in terms of congestion and pollution, reducing auto travel demand will have economic benefits as long as the marginal cost of inducing a driver to take transit is less than the marginal social cost imposed by driving.  Framework for Optimal Transportation Prices In the 1970's, Glaister and Lewis (1978) developed a method for calculating the optimal (i.e., welfare-maximizing) fare structure for public transit when road pricing is not a viable option. The author's method has withstood scrutiny since then and remains a standard reference in the literature on economic welfare and public transit. The argument is that since private vehicle users are charged less than their marginal social cost (the marginal social cost is the social cost associated with newest road user) of driving, particularly during congested conditions, there is an economic rationale for pricing public transport below its marginal cost to induce drivers to switch to public transit. This conclusion rests on the actual marginal social costs of driving and on the ability of reductions in transit fares to attract travelers away from road use. This paper adopts the Glaister and Lewis method and presents a new application of the model using risk analysis techniques. These techniques account for the inherent uncertainty in many of the model's inputs. The model also incorporates recent advances in the ability to determine the marginal social costs of automobile travel. The Framework A detailed derivation of the model is presented in technical form Annex 4.1 ""Second-Best"" Technical Approach. The central element of the ""second-best"" theory is the congestion to all traffic caused by an additional private vehicle during peak-period automobile travel. Under congested conditions, each additional automobile in the transportation network imposes high costs in terms of congestion (lost time and inconvenience) upon all vehicles in the affected  39   transportation network. Because each additional vehicle does not pay for the costs imposed on other transportation network users, it is referred to as an external cost. The theory incorporates this external congestion effect to show that, when the various transportation modes are substitutes for each other, transit subsidies can be an efficient (i.e., welfare-maximizing) policy response to congestion in the absence of correct road pricing. Implications of the ""Second-Best"" Result The degree to which transit subsidization creates net benefits depends on the ability of fare reductions for transit to attract travelers away from road use and, in addition, on volumes and shares on the various modes, and the actual marginal social costs of automobile travel. The ""second-best"" transit subsidy ensures that the price of transit, relative to automobile travel is optimal, or welfare maximizing. This results in the most efficient distribution of traffic across modes and ensures that transit and road users benefit mutually. The theory suggests that the optimal fares on public transit modes are below their marginal costs in both peak and off-peak periods. Subsidies are justified in the peak period because lower fares induce mode switching from auto to public transit, which reduces traffic congestion. Subsidies during off-peak periods are justified because they induce people to travel in the off-peak period, reducing peak-period congestion. Model Structure and Data The second-best solution to the transit subsidy problem uses an analytical method well grounded in economic theory to combine data on (i) the marginal social cost of automobile use; (ii) the marginal social cost of transit (for bus and rail separately); (iii) the responsiveness of the demand for bus and rail service to fare changes; and (iv) the responsiveness of the demand for auto use with respect to bus and rail fares. The complete derivation of the model is presented in the Technical Annex at the end of this chapter. Table 4.1 below presents the elasticities that were used in the analysis. These elasticities were estimated by Glaister and Lewis (1978) and represent conservative estimates compared to many recent studies in the literature (Button, 1993). They measure the responsiveness of travelers using a current mode of transportation (say, a car) to changes in the prices of other modes (say, a bus). For example, an elasticity of demand of 0.025 for auto travel with respect to bus fares would show that an increase of 100% in bus fares would lead to a 2.5% increase in the number of auto travelers. For higher elasticities between transit and auto use, drivers are more responsive to fare reductions, which would relieve congestion more easily. The elasticities used in this model would seem low, and the resulting benefits from congestion relief would be similarly conservative. The responsiveness of automobile drivers to transit fares is estimated to be extremely small. But even small degrees of automobile driver responsiveness to transit fares can translate into significant levels of efficient subsidies (see Table 4.3). The model is calculated using operating costs for seven metropolitan areas. It also includes capital costs in the amount used for current system renovation, maintenance and improvement, omitting all capital spending on new systems and segments.  40   Capital Subsidies Governments typically provide nearly all of the capital improvement budgets for transit agencies. This issue is problematic for the calculation of the optimal subsidies because the portion of the capital budget that is directed toward expanding capacity or extending a transit line will have demand impacts in the future that will not show up in current year data.

This analysis takes the current transportation infrastructure as given. A major portion of capital expenditures represents infrastructure expansions that become usable in the future. This analysis is a tool for determining the optimal transit subsidies, given the current infrastructure, and does not give any guidance regarding the wisdom or impact of new capital expenditures. New investments should be subjected to rigorous cost-benefit analysis to determine whether they yield adequate net benefits. Some portion of capital expenditures is used for general maintenance of the current infrastructure. This amount should be considered part of current operating subsidies since this spending is required to maintain the transportation system in its current state (see Table 4.2). Unfortunately, current data on the precise distribution of capital costs does not exist for most transit agencies.

Data regarding the distribution of capital costs were, in fact, collected by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) up to 1991 only. By calculating the percentage of capital funds applied to existing infrastructure in 1991, and applying this percentage to capital funding levels in 1993, an estimate of the capital funds applied to existing infrastructure has been generated. The implicit assumption in the calculation is that the composition of capital spending in 1993 is approximately the same as 1991. The present report considers that capital spending on existing equipment and infrastructure in 1997 is equal to what it was in 1993. Operating expenses, on the other hand, have been updated with 1997 data.13  Results and Conclusions In order to account for uncertainty in model inputs, the second-best model was applied using risk analysis techniques. Rather than relying on point estimates for model inputs, the risk analysis approach uses ranges for all model inputs to account for uncertainty. The risk analysis results provide policy makers with a quantitative basis to make decisions that fully accounts for uncertainty. Model Results Optimal fares were calculated for seven large U.S. metropolitan areas14 and for the nation as a whole. The simulation results are presented in Table 4.3 below. The table shows the subsidies that should be given to transit authorities in order to enable them to charge a welfare-maximizing or ""second-best"" fare given their current operating costs and capital expenditures on current infrastructure. Since the second-best model developed in this paper assumes that the infrastructure is given, the correct subsidy predicted by this model should be interpreted as an operating and maintenance subsidy. Conclusions The results of our analysis confirm that subsidizing public transportation can be the best public policy approach to utilizing the transportation infrastructure in the absence of road pricing. This analysis suggests the optimal subsidy levels in major metropolitan areas can be large (see Table 4.3) based solely on transit's congestion management benefits (transit costs include many costs not related to congestion management - examples of these are paratransit services and low-cost mobility programs, among others). The optimal subsidy exceeds the current subsidy in many of these systems and the nation as a whole.  13  Capital expenditures on existing equipment and infrastructure represent a relatively small portion of the social costs of operating transit systems. The impact of using 1993 instead of 1997 capital cost estimates is, therefore, likely to be small. As defined in the 1997 National Transit Database, Federal Transit Administration  14  42   The central result of this study is that all travelers on the highways and transit systems could be made better off by increasing transit subsidy levels in several major metropolitan areas. This conclusion is, of course, a ""second-best"" argument where alternative policies toward congestion management, such as road pricing, are deemed not feasible for political or practical reasons. The model presented here would suggest that the optimal subsidy would decline as the fees that drivers face approach the marginal social cost of automobile travel.

The ""second-best"" approach provides a means of improving the allocation of resources among the available transportation modes when the first best approach is unavailable.  Risk Analysis We attached probability density functions to each variable in the second-best model and applied Monte-Carlo simulations in order to gain an appreciation of sensitivity in the results.

The model could benefit from a further refinement, given the conservatism of the elasticities used in this paper. Indeed, the likelihood of drivers switching to transit when fares decrease could be understated. The elasticities, which measure this responsiveness, could be re-estimated based on current data specific to each metropolitan area. Incorporate Environmental Impacts into the Model. This model, in focusing on congestion costs exclusively, does not account for other costs of automobile use. Significant among these are the environmental costs of automobile emissions. Including the social marginal costs of automobile based pollution would improve the analysis and would increase the estimated optimal subsidy level. Research on the costs of pollution could be integrated into the ""second-best"" model in future applications. In concluding, the results of our analysis confirm that subsidizing existing public transportation can cause congestion relief benefits. This conclusion is, of course, in a ""second-best"" world where significant road pricing remains either politically or institutionally infeasible.  44   Annex 4.1 ""Second-Best"" Technical Approach Throughout this paper and in keeping with the original Glaister - Lewis framework, we use the following indices: 1 : Peak hour private vehicle 2 : Off-peak private vehicle 3 : Peak hour bus Elasticities The cross-price elasticity of demand for transportation services on mode i with respect to prices on mode j will be given by the standard equation for price elasticity as follows: 4 : Off-peak bus 5 : Peak hour rail 6 : Off-peak rail  p j X i pj = i = i X ij , i, j = 1, ... ,6 X p j X i j  (1)  Where pi Xi are the prices on mode i in $ per passenger mile, and are the demands on mode i in passenger miles.  If cross-price elasticities of auto travel with respect to public transit fares are estimated to be zero, implying that there is no way of persuading automobile users to switch to buses or rail transit regardless of price, then the Glaister-Lewis model would predict that transit fares should be set at the marginal cost of delivering service. If these elasticities do not equal zero, some level of transit subsidy will be efficient in the absence of road pricing. Deriving the Equation System Glaister-Lewis conceived of the consumer's problem as a maximization of the consumer's expenditure function less the operating costs of the various public transit modes. The maximization, following the Glaister-Lewis paper, can be expressed as follows: 1 3 max {G ( 3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 , X ( 3 , ... ,  6 ), X ( 3 , ... ,  6 ), p, u ) 6  p3 , p 4 , p5 , p  - G ( p3 , p 4 , p5 , p6 , X 1 ( p3 , ... , p6 ), X 3 ( p 3 , ... , p6 ), p, u ) - [C 3 ( X 1 , X 3 ) - p3 X 3 ] - [C 4 ( X 4 ) - p 4 X 4 ] - [C 5 ( X 5 ) - p5 X 5 ] - [C 6 ( X 6 ) - p6 X 6 ]}  45   Where G(p, X1, X3, p,u) Xi (p3,...,p6) p u C i  is the expenditure function aggregated across individuals, is the traffic level for mode i is a vector of transit fares, is a vector of all other prices including p1 and p2., is a vector of constant utility levels, and are the operating costs of the public transit modes.  The expenditure function, representing the long run demand responses to prices, depends on peak car and bus traffic levels because of the negative effects of congestion on consumer utility. This relationship implies that for a given vector of prices, an increase in peak traffic requires a compensating increase in income to maintain the previous level of consumer utility. This relationship is known as the compensating variation and is given by the difference between expenditure function evaluated at the ""reference"" prices i and a lower set of prices pi. The compensating variation is the amount of money that would be required to compensate for an increase from p3,...,p6 to 1,..., 6, where the i's represent higher peak-hour congestion levels than the p's. The other terms within the [ ] are the operating subsidies required for the peak and off-peak bus and rail transit services. The compensating variation and the public transit fare revenues (piXi) represent consumers' total willingness-to-pay from which the transit systems' operating expenses (Ci(Xi)) must be subtracted. Equation 2 is differentiated with respect to p3, p4, p5, and p6. Differentiating Equation 2 with respect to p3 yields one of four first-order conditions for a maximum as follows: -  G G 1 G 3 31 33 X3 - X 3 - C1 X 3 - C 3 X 3 + X - 1 p 3 X X 3 4 3  3 6 3 6 3  3 4 + p3 X 3 - C 4 X  + p4 X  4 3  5 - C5 X  5 3  + p5 X  5 3  6 - C6 X  + p6 X  =0  (2) Similar expressions are obtained from differentiating with respect to p4, p5 and p6. Using the following properties and definitions:  G = p i   h  g h = pi   h  i xh = X i ,  S1 =  G C 3 G C 3 + 1 and S3 = + . X 1 X X 3 X 3  (3)  Where S1 is the marginal social cost of peak automobile travel per passenger mile and S3 represents the marginal social cost of peak bus travel per passenger mile.

Optimal Fares and Subsidies System of Equations The equation system that allows the calculation of the ""second-best"" optimal fare derives from the four first-order conditions for the maximization problem in Equation 2. The first order conditions, after converting to elasticity form, reduce to:  [ [ [ [  4 5 6  3 ( p 3 - S 3 ) X 3 +  3 ( p 4 - C 44 ) X 4 +  3 ( p 5 - C 55 ) X 5 +  3 ( p 6 - C 66 ) X 3  6  ] ] ] 6  1 S1 X 1 S1 X 1 S1 X  1  = = = 1  1 3   3 ( p 3 - S 3 ) X 3 +  4 ( p 4 - C 44 ) X 4 +  5 ( p 5 - C 55 ) X 5 +  6 ( p 6 - C 66 ) X 4 4 4 4 4  3 ( p 3 - S 3 ) X 3 +  5 ( p 4 - C 44 ) X 4 +  5 ( p 5 - C 55 ) X 5 +  6 ( p 6 - C 66 ) X 5 5 5  6  1  1 4  6  1  1 5  4  3 ( p 3 - S 3 ) X 3 +  63 ( p 4 - C 44 ) X 4 +  5 ( p 5 - C 55 ) X 5 +  6 ( p 6 - C 66 ) X 6 6 6  ]  1 S1 X  =  1 6  (5 a-d) This system of equations fully identifies the optimal transit pricing structure in the absence of road pricing. This system can be written in matrix notation as follows:         3 3 3 4 3 5 3 6       4 3 4 4 4 5 4 6       5 3 5 4 5 5 5 6       6 3 6 4 6 5 6 6          ( p3  ( p4  ( p5   ( p 6  - - - -  S3 C4 C5 C6  )X 3 )X 4 )X 5 )X 6       1 =   S1 X 1        1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6         (6)  47   Solving the System The preceding system of equations is a set of four equations with four unknowns, which is solvable using linear algebra techniques. The object of this project is to determine the values of the p's in the equations from which the optimal subsidy levels can be calculated. This model can be applied to transportation systems with automobile, bus and rail modes. When rail is not available, the system of equations reduces to two equations with two unknowns as follows:  [ [  4  3 ( p3 - S3 ) X 3 +  3 ( p 4 - C 44 ) X 3  4  ] ]  1 = S1 X 1 1 = S1 X 1  1 3  (7)   3 ( p3 - S3 ) X 3 +  4 ( p 4 - C 44 ) X 4 4  4  1 4  The difficulty in solving the system increases rapidly with the number of modes and periods under consideration. This system can be expressed as a linear system and solved using matrix inversion. This system does not provide explicit solutions for the optimal fares, but these can be calculated using some assumed functional forms for the demand and cost functions. Applying matrix inversion and solving for the auto-bus-rail system will result in a numerical solution for the column vector (the auto-bus case results in numerical solutions for the first two elements of the following vector):  ( p3  ( p 4 ( p5   ( p 6 - - - - S3 C4 C5 C6 )X )X )X )X 3 4 5 6    1  S1 X     1  (8)  Estimates for Si, Ci, and Xi can be obtained or estimated from secondary sources and using standard functional forms for the cost and demand functions. The pi`s can then be determined by simple algebra.  48   Annex 4.2 Data for the ""Second-Best"" Model Secondary data sources provide a set of parameters with which to calculate the optimal subsidies for a set of transit systems. The original Glaister-Lewis paper relied on a set of secondary sources augmented by sensitivity analysis to account for uncertainty in some of their variables. This application of the methodology is augmented by risk analysis to account for uncertainty surrounding the values chosen to estimate the equation system. Input Requirements In order to estimate pi, the second-best price for each mode on-peak and off, all other variables in the system, presented in Annex 4.1 ""Second-Best"" Technical Approach, must be estimated or identified. The inputs needed to solve this system are presented in Table 4.5. Table 4.5 Variable i j  Input Requirements for Second-Best Model Description Cross-price elasticity of demand* for mode i with respect to prices on mode j for i,j {1,...6}. Marginal social cost of private vehicle travel per passenger mile during peak hour. Marginal social cost of bus travel per passenger mile during peak hour. Operating costs of the off-peak bus transit per passenger mile. Operating costs of the peak rail transit per passenger mile. Operating costs of the off-peak rail transit per passenger mile. Demand for peak auto travel in passenger miles. Demand for peak bus travel in passenger miles. Demand for off-peak bus travel in passenger miles. Demand for peak rail travel in passenger miles. Demand for off-peak rail travel in passenger miles.  S1 S3 C C C 4 5 6  X1 X3 X X X 4 5 6  * The cross-price elasticity of demand for commodity i with respect to the price of commodity j is the responsiveness of the consumers' demand for commodity i (in percentage terms) to a change in the price of commodity j (also in percentage terms).  Data Sources and Tables We have chosen to adopt the Glaister-Lewis estimates for the elasticities, as updated by HLB. These elasticities were derived from the economics literature and from previous work by Lewis (1977). Table 4.1 above displays the adopted elasticity estimates. The marginal social cost variables need to be determined. The marginal social cost of bus service is a combination of congestion costs and system operating costs. The estimates used in this analysis were obtained from Mohring and Anderson (1996) and combined with bus system operating costs as reported in Section 15. The results are shown in Table 4.6 below.  49   Table 4.6  Marginal Social Cost Estimates Variable Marginal Social Cost of Car Travel Marginal Social Cost of Bus Travel Adopted Value $0.57 per passenger mile $0.46 per passenger mile  Source:  Mohring, H. and D. Anderson (1996), TTI 1999 Annual Mobility Report and HLB estimates.  Operating costs for the public transit system are based on available system operating cost data found in the 1997 National Transit Database Transit Profiles (FTA). In the model, there are no congestion costs off-peak. The only justification, according to this modeling structure, for subsidizing off-peak transit service is to shift travelers from peak to off-peak period travel, reducing peak congestion. Demand estimates for 1997 were derived from the National Transit Database Transit Profiles and from the Texas Transportation Institute 1999 Annual Mobility Report (TTI, 1999). A log-linear functional form was assumed for the demand function based on price of service and the elasticity estimates in Table 4.5. Other functional forms can be used in this model depending on the preference of the analyst. The only limitation on the adoption of functional demand equations, is that functional forms must contain variables that are either determined by the model or known values, in order to maintain the solvable ""four equations and four unknowns"" equation system structure presented in Annex 4.1.  50   Table 4.7  Summary Table for Model Inputs BUS RAIL 1.736 1.157 5.068 $0.201 $0.469 1.396 0.931 6.937 $0.223 $0.519 1.865 1.243 5.684 $0.185 $0.431 2.029 1.353 9.212 $0.183 $0.427 3.990 2.660 11.009 $0.166 $0.388 0.644 0.429 9.844 $0.254 $0.592 20.390 13.593 6.644 $0.166 $0.388 34.690 23.126 6.933 $0.177 $0.412 AUTO Free / Expressways 27.250 AUTO Principal Arterials 20.138  BOSTON, MA  PHILADELPHIA, PA-NJ  WASHINGTON, DC-MD-VA  SAN FRANCISCO OAKLAND, CA  CHICAGO, IL NORTHWESTERN, IN LOS ANGELES, CA  NEW YORK, NY NORTHEASTERN, NJ NATION WIDE ESTIMATES  Passenger Miles per Day Passenger Miles per Day Average Trip Length Operating Expense per P Peak Off-Peak Passenger Miles per Day Passenger Miles per Day Average Trip Length Operating Expense per P Peak Off-Peak Passenger Miles per Day Passenger Miles per Day Average Trip Length Operating Expense per P Peak Off-Peak Passenger Miles per Day Passenger Miles per Day Average Trip Length Operating Expense per P Peak Off-Peak Passenger Miles per Day Passenger Miles per Day Average Trip Length Operating Expense per P Peak Off-Peak Passenger Miles per Day Passenger Miles per Day Average Trip Length Operating Expense per P Peak Off-Peak Passenger Miles per Day Passenger Miles per Day Average Trip Length Operating Expense per P Peak Off-Peak Passenger Miles per Day Passenger Miles per Day Average Trip Length Operating Expense per P Peak Off-Peak  - Peak - Off Peak assenger Mile  0.473 0.316 2.717 $0.396 $0.924 0.785 0.524 3.033 $0.378 $0.882 0.812 0.542 3.448 $0.384 $0.896 1.331 0.888 2.955 $0.351 $0.820 1.558 1.038 2.901 $0.370 $0.862 3.018 2.012 3.788 $0.275 $0.641 6.164 4.109 3.817 $0.328 $0.766 28.763 19.175 3.805 $0.324 $0.757  - Peak - Off Peak assenger Mile  29.425  26.988  - Peak - Off Peak assenger Mile  41.675  24.113  - Peak - Off Peak assenger Mile  53.206  17.556  - Peak - Off Peak assenger Mile  58.500  50.375  - Peak - Off Peak assenger Mile  146.150  106.625  - Peak - Off Peak assenger Mile  118.444  73.263  - Peak - Off Peak assenger Mile  1,277.720  802.400  Source:  The 1997 National Transit Database, Federal Transit Administration; The 1999 Annual Mobility Report, Texas Transportation Institute.  51   References Button, Kenneth.

Econometric Analysis of Transit and Agglomeration Introduction This chapter provides an econometric investigation Its purpose is dual: first, it assesses the relevance of between transit presence, agglomeration economies relationship between transit presence and economic about transit and agglomeration economies. the hypothesis of a positive relationship and productivity; second it investigates the growth in metropolitan areas.  The report is organized as follows. The next section introduces a detailed methodology to test the two hypothesized relationships described above. This is followed by the data used in the analysis and then the empirical results with an interpretation. Figure 5.1 below summarizes the methodological framework developed by HLB.  Survey of the Literature  Agglomeration Economies  Transit and Agglomeration Economies  Agglomeration Economies and Urban Efficiency  Data on Urban Productivity, Agglomeration and Transit Presence  Hypothesized Relationship between Transit, Agglomeration and Urban Efficiency  Test on the Coefficient of the Transit Variable Predefined process  Study Element  Data  Results and Policy Implications  Output  Figure 5.1  Overview of the Methodology   Methodological Framework Here we introduce a framework to test the contribution of transit to urban efficiency and economic growth. The first hypothesis under examination is that the presence of an extended and well-functioning mass transit system promotes the realization of agglomeration economies and thereby stimulates economic efficiency (measured by labor productivity) in large urban areas. This relationship is expressed in a convenient analytical form below. The second hypothesis is that transit presence stimulates economic growth. Testing this hypothesis is the object of the succeeding section. Testing the Relationship between Transit and Productivity A simple functional form for the first hypothesis under examination is introduced to explain how the actual test has been implemented, drawing heavily from empirical studies in the economic literature. The framework presented here is an extension of existing models, where the presence of transit is explicitly accounted for. A Testable Hypothesis for the Role of Transit The null hypothesis under analysis can be summarized as follows: ""Transit provides no measurable benefit to regional economic productivity."" To test this hypothesis, one needs to control for the impact of other variables: multiple regression is the most appropriate framework in this case. HLB proposes to estimate the following relationship from a cross-section of U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA): Yi = a + b1 X1i + b2 X2i + b2 X3i + ... + bn Xni (1)  Where Yi is a measure of productivity in region i (e.g. output per employee, per capita income): X1i is a measure of agglomeration in region i (e.g. population, density); X2i is a measure of transit presence in region i, expressed in either a dichotomous form based on a threshold of service, or expressed in terms of normalized continuous output measure, such as transit employees per capita, revenue miles of service per capita, etc.; Xji, j = 3...k are other control variables (e.g. region size, location dummies, industrial composition, capital endowment, labor force quality, etc.) Productivity could be measured for a specific industry or for the whole economy of the region. Industry-level data would allow testing for the extent of localization economies whereas economy-wide data would allow testing for urbanization economies. Evaluating the Coefficient on the Transit Variable Testing the null hypothesis ""Transit provides no measurable benefit to regional economic productivity"" implies the following set of equations: H0: b2 = 0 54  (2)   HA:  b2  0  (3)  The statistic for the test is the t-statistic associated with the coefficient on the transit variable X2. Under the null hypothesis, this statistic follows a t-distribution with (n-k) degrees of freedom, where n is the number of observations used in the regression and k the number of explanatory variables. If the calculated statistic departs significantly from its theoretical counterpart, i.e. from the value read in the t-table, the null hypothesis is unlikely to be ""true"". It can be rejected. Rejection of the null hypothesis would indicate that transit does indeed contribute to urban efficiency. On the other hand, if the calculated statistics lies within a reasonable interval form the tabulated value, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. Failure to reject the null hypothesis would indicate that (i) transit does not contribute to urban efficiency; or (ii) transit does contribute to urban efficiency but this effect is not captured by the data at hand. Comparing Two Regressions The previous section offers a framework to test the impact of transit on productivity holding everything else constant, i.e. independently from any agglomeration effect (this effect being captured by the variable X1). A slightly different hypothesis can also be tested: does transit affect the magnitude of agglomeration economies and, thereby, indirectly promote urban efficiency? Two methods can be used to test this new hypothesis: a Chow test (or test for structural break) and the introduction of a dummy and a slope dummy variable into the estimating equation. In a Chow test, the initial sample is divided into two sub-samples. Then, separate regressions (one for each sub-sample) are run. The Chow test determines whether the quality of the fit is significantly improved by splitting the sample. It allows determining whether the individuals in one sub-sample (the MSA in the present case) are structurally different from the individuals in the other sub-sample. Conducting a Chow test will allow to test whether MSAs with low transit presence are structurally different (with respect to the factors influencing productivity) from MSAs with extended transit presence. The alternative approach consists of introducing a dummy and slope dummy variable in the model to test for a potential interaction between transit presence and agglomeration. If the slope dummy (transit presence dummy times measure of agglomeration) is found positive and significant, this will imply that the impact of agglomeration on productivity is stronger in areas with more extended transit presence.16  Testing the Relationship between Transit and Economic Growth HLB proposes to test the hypothesis that transit affects economic growth in metropolitan areas by estimating the following equation:  16  As long as the transit dummy is 1 for areas with relatively more transit of course.  55   Yi = a + b1 X1i + b2 X2i + b2 X3i + ... + bn Xni Where: Yi is a measure of economic growth in region i between two given years; X1i is a measure of productivity in region i in the initial year (e.g. output per employee, per capita income);  (4)  X2i is a measure of agglomeration in region i in the initial year (e.g. population, density); X3i is a measure of transit presence in region i in the initial year, expressed in either a dichotomous form based on a threshold of service, or expressed in terms of normalized continuous output measure, such as transit employees per capita, revenue miles of service per capita, etc.; Xji, j = 4...k are other control variables (e.g. region size, location dummies, industrial composition, capital endowment, labor force quality, etc.) Again, the t-test will serve as a benchmark to reject (or fail to reject) the null hypothesis.  Data Description Now for a brief description of the data used in the study (additional descriptive statistics are provided in Annex 5.1 through Annex 5.6). First, we focus on data collection, followed by an explanation of how to populate the productivity model and the growth model. Data Sources Most series in the database were bought from the Minnesota IMPLAN group. Information on transit presence was also provided by the National Transit Database. The Minnesota IMPLAN Group The Minnesota IMPLAN Group is a private firm developing software and data sets for use in economic modeling and marketing analysis. Typically, data sets provide information about 528 industrial sectors (generally 3 or 4 digit SIC code) for all states, counties and MSA (Metropolitan Statistical Areas) in the United States. The data were collected in 1996 (most recent available data) and in 1991 to see the impact over time of the presence of transit. Only the 100 densest MSA have been selected in the sample because they are more likely to feature well developed transit systems. The IMPLAN data set used in the report consists of the following five main components and their respective sub-components: 1. General information Population Land area (square miles) Density (population/area)  56   2. Employment (annual average number of jobs) 3. Industry output ($ millions) 4. Value added ($ millions) Employee compensation (wages and benefits) Proprietary income (self-employment income) Other property type income (corporate, rental income, interest income) Indirect business taxes (payments to Government other than end of year income taxes) 5. Final demands ($ millions) State & local government education purchases (expenditures for Public education) Gross private capital formation (purchases of capital goods and services) In order to measure the presence of transit in terms of Value added or Employment, the following sectors are aggregated:   (433) Railroads and related services: ""establishments furnishing transportation by linehaul railroad (interurban railways), and switching and terminal establishments."" (434) Local, Interurban Passenger Transit: ""establishments primarily engaged in furnishing local and suburban passenger transportation, such as those providing passenger transportation within a single municipality, contiguous municipalities, or a municipality and its suburban areas, by bus (intercity bus lines), rail, or subway, either separately or in combination, and establishments engaged in furnishing transportation to local scenic features. Also included are establishments primarily engaged in furnishing highway passenger terminal or maintenance facilities."" (510) Local Government Passenger Transit: portion of Local, Interurban Passenger Transit owned by State and Local Government.    The National Transit Database Transit presence can also be measured by the number of vehicles (typically, buses and trains) directly operated in maximum service in each transit agency. The service that is provided by a transit agency is considered directly operated when the agency is responsible for generating the service to the public. These data are available online at the National Transit Library.17 They are part of the annual report on National Transit Summaries and Trends. Since an MSA usually has more than one agency, the data are aggregated at the MSA level when necessary. Data Selection and Model Specification From this data set, HLB proposes to define the dependent variable and the explanatory variables of each model as follows: 17  http://www.fta.dot.gov/ntl/database.html  57   Productivity model:   Dependent variable (1996) Productivity = Value added / Employment Independent variables (1996) Presence of transit = Number of vehicles directly operated in maximum service in transit agencies; alternatively, Transit employment; Agglomeration = Other variables = Population; Gross private capital formation (investment);  State and local education purchases (labor force quality); Economic region dummies;18 Industrial composition.19 Growth model:   Dependent variable (1991-1996) Economic growth = Productivity = Percentage change in value added between 1991 and 1996. Value added / Employment Independent variables (1991) Presence of transit = Number of vehicles directly operated in maximum service in transit agencies (1996); alternatively, Transit employment; Agglomeration = Other variables = Population; Gross private capital formation (investment);  State and local education purchases (labor force quality); Economic region dummies; Industrial composition. In Figure 5.2, the dependent variable of the productivity model (value added per employee) is related to a measure of transit presence (the number of vehicles directly operated in maximum 18  The regions used in this study are those defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics: Region I  Boston; Region II  New York; Region III  Philadelphia; Region IV  Atlanta; Region V- Chicago; Region VI  Dallas; Region VII  Kansas City; Region VIII  Middle West; Region IX  San Francisco; Region X  Upper Northwest. Ten major sectors (SIC) were considered: Agriculture, forestry and fishing; Mining; Construction; Manufacturing; Transportation and public utilities: Wholesale trade; Retail trade; Finance, insurance, and real estate; Services; Public administration. A subcategory of Transportation was created for Transit (Railroads and related services; Local, interurban passenger transit; and Local government passenger transit).  19  58   service in transit agencies). The scatter diagram clearly shows a positive relationship between the two variables: higher levels of transit presence are associated with higher levels of productivity. 80 , 0 0 0  70 , 0 0 0 P r o d uc t iv ity ( U S $)  60 , 0 0 0  R e gr e s s io n l i ne  50 , 0 0 0  40 , 0 0 0  30 , 0 0 0 0. 000 0  0. 000 2  0. 000 4  0. 000 6  0. 000 8  V e hi cl es d ir e c t l y o p e r a t e d p e r c a p it a  Figure 5.2  Productivity and Transit Presence  Empirical Results and Interpretation Here we report the results of estimating the productivity model and the growth model developed by HLB. First is a summary of various descriptive statistics. Second, the results of testing the role of transit on productivity. Third, the influence of transit on economic growth. Some Descriptive Statistics The sample used to estimate the productivity model is described through basic descriptive statistics in Table 5.1 below.20  20  Since the number of vehicles directly operated (VDO) is missing in 9 M.S.A., the VDO per capita series is completed as follows: the series is sorted by transit employment per capita, then the average of the four VDO per capita values surrounding each M.S.A. is computed.  59   Table 5.1 Variable Name  Descriptive Statistics (1996 Data) Average Std Dev Minimum Value 116,176 MS A Bloomington, IN Oklahoma City, OK Muncie, IN Value 20,175,070 Maximum MS A NYC-Northern New JerseyLong Island NYC-Northern New JerseyLong Island NYC-Northern New JerseyLong Island NYC-Northern New JerseyLong Island NYC-Northern New JerseyLong Island NYC-Northern New JerseyLong Island Detroit-Ann Arbor-Flint, MI Lansing-East Lansing, MI NYC-Northern New JerseyLong Island  Population  1,713,308  2,851,489  Density  465.36  267.26  241.71  1761.25  Employment Value added ($ millions) Value added per capita Productivity GPCF ($ millions) GPCF per capita State and local education purchases ($ millions) State and local education purchases per capita Number of vehicles directly operated VDO per capita  1,012,453  1,586,142  68,471  10,931,743  55,872.6  102,144.5  2,663.5  Muncie, IN McAllenEdinburgMission, TX McAllenEdinburgMission, TX Muncie, IN BrownsvilleHarlingen-San Benito, TX  770,660  29,180  5,921  11,371  49,111  48,385  6,351  32,415  70,497  7,849  12,550  337  76,814  4,528  2,332  1,192  15,930  2,987  5,101  170  Altoona, PA  40,694  1,838  711  949  SarasotaBradenton, FL Fort PiercePort St. Lucie, FL GreenvilleSpartanburgAnderson, SC McAllenEdinburgMission, TX  6,500  Bloomington, IN NYC-Northern New JerseyLong Island SeattleTacomaBremerton, WA Altoona, PA  521  1,427  15  12,374  Transit  0.000198  0.000134  0.00004  0.000729  Transit employment per capita  0.003627  0.002669  0.000505  0.016591  Obviously, the New York  Northern New Jersey  Long Island Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) is predominant. Of course, one can expect this MSA to be far ahead of the others in 60   Employment and Value Added because of its mere size. However, it also ranks in first position in several per capita series, such as Productivity, reflecting its economic dynamism. Compared to 1991, the situation remains broadly unchanged (see Annex 3).  Transit and Productivity Below, the productivity model is estimated with 1996 data. Various tests are performed to determine whether (more) transit contributes to urban efficiency. Regression Results The model has been run using the OLS method with different functional forms (semi-log, double-log) and explanatory variables (population or density; number of vehicles directly operated or transit employment).

However, all remaining explanatory variables have a significant coefficient at the 5 percent level and their respective standard errors are low, which implies the absence of multicollinearity. The only noticeable exception is the variable for Labor force quality LEDUEXPPC. Quite unexpectedly, its coefficient estimate is negative. State and local education purchases may not be the appropriate measure for this variable. As a consequence, it is dropped further in the analysis. Since we are using a log-log model the slope coefficient b2 measures the constant elasticity of Productivity with respect to the number of Vehicles directly operated per capita (VDOPC). For instance, a 10 percent change in VDOPC will result in a 0.4 percent change in Productivity (see Table 5.3). As expected, b2 is positive and its t-statistic (2.58) is significant therefore the null hypothesis can be rejected. The R-squared, measuring the goodness of fit, is rather satisfactory: its value of 0.721408 means that about 72 percent of the total variation in Productivity across the MSA is explained by variations in the explanatory variables. The main conclusion to draw from these results is that the contribution of transit to urban efficiency, though small, is proved. Using Transit employment per capita (EMPTRAPC) as the measure for transit presence, instead of VDOPC, leads to very similar results (b2 has a value of 0.036971 and it is significant at the 5% level, see Appendix 4) and thus confirms this interpretation. Chow Test Results In addition to the efficiency effect, transit may also add weight to the agglomeration effect generated by Population in the regression. To address this issue, a Chow test is performed. First of all, the original sample is divided into two sub-samples: the first sub-sample consists of the MSA with VDOPC above the median level  62   of employment, and the second sub-sample consists of the MSA with VDOPC below the median. Then, separate regressions are run.21 Table 5.3 Change in Transit Presence and Change in Productivity Effect on Productivity 0.04% 0.40% 1.00% Margin of Error  0.02% 0.15% 0.38% Change in Transit Presence Transit presence vs. no transit 10% Increase in Transit presence 25% Increase in Transit presence  To test for a structural change in the productivity model, the F-statistic is computed in the following way: (0.518648 - (0.202401 + 0.252883) / 11 F[11, 78] =  = 0.98687 (0.202401 + 0.252883) / (50 + 50  22) Table 5.4 Summary Statistics for the Restricted and Unrestricted Regressions Restricted Equation C LPOP LVDOPC LGPCFPC AGG_SER Std. error of the regression Sum of squared residuals 9.559663 0.082592 0.033416 0.067053 -0.009400 0.076338 0.518648 Unrestricted Equation Unrestricted Equation (High Transit) (Low Transit) 9.741423 0.085194 0.023770 0.033706 -0.010298 0.072040 0.202401 10.03547 0.066193 0.073967 0.078435 -0.009909 0.080524 0.252883  Since the critical value for an F statistic with 11 and 78 degrees of freedom is approximately 1.90 (at the usual 5 percent risk level), the null hypothesis according to which the sub-samples are not structurally different cannot be rejected. In other words, the Chow test does not seem to support the hypothesis that areas with larger transit presence are structurally different from areas with lower transit presence.  21  There is no MSA in Regions 8 and 10 for the Low Transit presence equation. Therefore their respective dummy variables are removed from all regressions.  63   Slope Dummy Regression Results However, the Chow test applies to the entire model. Another way to test for the null hypothesis is to focus on the agglomeration variable only and insert a dummy and a slope dummy variable into the regression to measure the increase in the agglomeration effect due to transit. Table 5.5 C LPOP LGPCFPC R1 R3 R4 R5 R6 R7 R8 R9 R10 AGG_SER D_VDO D_VDO*LPOP R-Squared Adjusted R-Squared Standard Error of Regression Where: D_VDO = dummy variable for Transit presence, with a value of 1 when Transit presence is above the median and zero otherwise. D_VDO*LPOP = slope dummy variable to account for the combined agglomeration effect of Population and Transit presence. The results show that the total agglomeration effect in MSA with high transit presence is stronger (0.067583 + 0.040483 = 0.108066) than in MSA with low transit presence (0.067583 only). Thus, they validate the hypothesis that transit strengthens the effect of agglomeration on urban efficiency. 64  Regression Results with a Dummy and Slope Dummy Variable Variable Name Coefficient 9.725277 0.067583 0.047101 -0.033181 -0.038853 -0.071501 -0.135559 -0.121286 -0.072653 -0.139697 -0.003618 -0.105723 -0.010938 -0.551886 0.040483 0.727508 0.677313 0.073349 t-Statistic 33.52478 3.679613 1.991721 -0.615634 -0.952268 -1.841619 -3.332609 -2.935082 -1.548613 -2.233720 -0.076052 -1.689656 -3.814205 -1.702329 1.699805 Sum of Squared Residuals F-Statistic Probability (F-Statistic) Probability Value 0.0000 0.0004 0.0500 0.5400 0.3440 0.0694 0.0013 0.0044 0.1256 0.0284 0.9396 0.0952 0.0003 0.0928 0.0933 0.408883 14.49340 0.000000   Transit and Economic Growth The purpose of this section is to show that there exists a positive relationship between transit presence and economic growth. It is commonly accepted that productivity is one of the main factors of growth along with investment and education. The findings of the study indicate that, indirectly, transit is contributing to economic activity via productivity. But, does transit stimulate growth independently from its effect on productivity? The equation to be estimated differs from the initial one in the dependent variable: value added growth, as a measure of economic growth, replaces productivity, which becomes a new explanatory variable. All the other explanatory variables remain the same but they are observed in 1991. The model can be written as follows: Log (Value added growth) = b0 + b1 Log (Productivity) + b2 Log (Population) + b3 Log (Transit Presence) + b4 Log (GPCFPC) + b5 Location Dummies + b6 Services + u 4.1+ The dependent variable represents the increase in value added in each MSA from 1991 to 1996. Since the data for VDOPC were not available in 1991, this variable was replaced by LEMPTRAPC, measured employment in the transit sectors. The testing procedure is based again on the null hypothesis that the coefficient on the transit variable, b2, is equal to zero: H0: b2 = 0 vs. HA: b2  0  As shown in Table 5.6, the model explains about 43% of the variations in growth rate across MSAs. The F-statistic and the associated probability indicate the model's coefficients are jointly different from zero. Contrary to the previous regressions, the coefficient estimates on Location dummies are positive and are all significant at the 5 percent level. In the same way, b2 is positive and significantly different from zero. The coefficient estimate implies that the presence of transit does contribute to economic growth. However, the coefficient on Productivity is quite unexpectedly negative.  65   Table 5.6  Transit and Economic Growth  Regression Results Using Employment in the Transit Sector as a Measure of Transit Presence (1991 and 1996 Data) Variable Name C LPDTY LPOP LEMPTRAPC LGPCFP R1 R3 R4 R5 R6 R7 R8 R9 R10 AGG_SER R-Squared Adjusted RSquared Standard Error of Regression Coefficient 16.62411 -1.486048 0.157273 0.102318 0.149067 0.434140 0.499105 0.658507 0.428978 0.562827 0.523175 0.785211 0.484474 0.675694 -0.027453 0.430256 0.336416 0.289141 t-Statistic 4.499072 -3.544343 3.604159 1.906883 1.153178 2.398879 3.013435 3.898174 2.642363 3.360149 2.835229 3.114393 2.810975 2.613021 -2.898315 Sum of Squared Residuals F-Statistic Probability (FStatistic) Probability Value 0.0000 0.0006 0.0005 0.0599 0.2521 0.0186 0.0034 0.0002 0.0098 0.0012 0.0057 0.0025 0.0061 0.0106 0.0048 7.106199 4.584994 0.000004  Where: LVAGTH, the natural log of Value added growth, is the dependent variable; and LEMPTRAPC is the natural log of Transit employment per capita.  The Economic Impact of Transit Presence It is possible to use the coefficient estimates found in the previous sections to evaluate the average impacts of the presence of transit on productivity and economic growth. Table 5.7 and Table 5.8 summarize the results of this benefits analysis. These numbers are reliable considering the high significance of the coefficient on the Transit variable. Moreover, similar calculations based on other estimates of transit presence lead to the same levels of benefits. 66   The results indicate that, on average, a 25% increase in the presence of transit creates: About $20 million worth of value added through the impact of transit on productivity and; About $18 million worth of value added through the impact of transit on economic growth over a 5-year period. The two tables present benefit estimates for three possible changes in transit presence. Note that a 1% increase in transit presence represents about 5 extra transit vehicles or 62 extra employees in the transit sector in each Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) (evaluated at average). Table 5.7 Impact of Transit on Productivity Percentage Change in Productivity + 0.04% + 0.40% + 0.10% Average Productivity Gains per Employee $19 $192 $480 Total Productivity Gains per M.S.A $19.4 million $194.3 million $485.9 million Change in Transit Presence + 1% + 10% + 25%  Given the data at hand, the coefficient estimate of the transit variable in the growth model measures the impact of transit presence over a 5-year period. The annual impact of transit presence was derived by dividing the 5-year impact by 5. Table 5.8 Impact of Transit on Economic Growth Added Economic Growth (5-year) + 0.10% + 1.02% + 2.56% 5-year Growth Effect per 1-year Growth Effect per MSA MSA $18.0 million $180.3 million $450.8 million $3.6 million $36.1 million $90.2 million Change in Transit Presence + 1% + 10% + 25%  Using the above results, the estimated aggregate effect by multiplying the value added per worker with the number of workers, about 127 million workers. Table 5.9 shows the aggregate effect of transit in the United States for a total of 276 MSAs. Table 5.9 Aggregate Impact of Transit in the United States Value Created Yearly due to Productivity Gains $2.4 billion $24.3 billion $60.9 billion Value Created Yearly Total Annual Economic Benefits due to Added Economic Growth $0.5 billion $5.3 billion $13.2 billion $3 billion $30 billion $75 billion Change in Transit Presence + 1% + 10% + 25%  67   Conclusions This chapter reports on an investigation on the influence of transit on the economic performance of large metropolitan areas. Econometric evidence has provided support to the idea of a positive impact of transit on productivity and economic growth: the hypotheses under consideration have been supported by various testing procedures. This conclusion has been reached under different model specifications. For instance, measuring transit presence by the number of employees in the transit sectors or by the number of operated vehicles has changed neither the direction nor the significance of the results. The results provided in this paper are also consistent with the findings of previous studies of agglomeration economies (see Henderson, 1988 for example).  68   Annex 5.1  Economic and Demographic Characteristics of the Sampled MSA (1996 Data) PRODUCTIVITY ($) 49,246 52,851 41,105 45,108 56,318 48,662 43,411 44,371 42,683 51,351 36,304 56,114 33,087 49,073 42,879 49,972 53,503 45,965 59,848 50,307 50,095 42,474 46,661 49,621 59,591 47,301 37,522 52,947 46,525 57,730 40,313 46,853 43,807 51,873 43,954 V.

Commercial Property Benefits of Transit Introduction This Chapter reports on Commercial Property Benefits of Transit. The goal was ""to research and develop a practical methodology for estimating the effect of the proximity of transit on commercial property value."" Therefore, the objective of this report is to present a detailed review of the literature focusing on methodological issues, to propose a methodology that allows the estimation of the impact of transit on commercial property and to describe the implementation of this methodology on a selected set of data. Methodological Framework Two approaches have been used in the literature to address similar issues: regional scale analyses and property level analyses22. The former focuses on the changes in commercial property values brought about by a change in the transit system (the opening of a new bus line for example) for a particular region; the latter concentrates on the differential impact that public transit has on surrounding properties. This Chapter used the latter approach to estimate the effect of the proximity to transit on commercial properties. The best technique to evaluate this impact consists of estimating a hedonic price model, where the value of selected commercial properties would be regressed on a set of property characteristics. To run these regressions, FTA collected three types of data: real estate, geographical and socioeconomic data. The estimated coefficients of the hedonic price equation were then used to evaluate the impact of transit on commercial property value within the area of study. This impact was then expressed as a dollar increment in property value per foot of proximity to transit. It was then a straightforward task to evaluate the average and the total impact of transit within the area of study. Figure 6.1 illustrates the methodology. After this introduction, the next section presents a review of the literature. This review starts with general considerations about the benefits of transit in increasingly congested urban areas. The nature of commercial property benefits provided by transit is explored. Next, two measurement methods are described that have been commonly used in the literature: hedonic pricing and stated preference methods. Then we discuss more closely the implementation of hedonic models, concentrating on the choice of explanatory variables in existing studies of commercial property values. We will then describe the actual methodology. After an overview of the task, some methodological issues are considered: which type of commercial properties should be included in the analysis? What is the appropriate area of study? Do different forms of public transportation have different impacts on property values? Finally, How should the properties be selected? This discussion then specifies the model; it addresses the choice of the appropriate functional form and the selection of the variables entering the model. The chapter concludes with the empirical implementation of the model, describes the data used in the study and provides estimates of the  22  Alex Anas and Regina Armstrong, ""Land Values and Transit Access: Modeling the relationship in the New-York Metropolitan Area"", Federal Transit Administration, Final Report, September 1993.   impact of transit on commercial properties.

Environmentalists are concerned with the dangerous levels of air pollutants in many cities. The inefficiencies and costs of traffic congestion and the burden it places on the regional economies worry the economists. The reliance on primarily imported oil concerns planners and policy-makers alike. Commuters, who experience the regular extended traffic congestion, complain about the associated stress and unpleasantness. In recent years, residents in hundreds of U.S. suburbs have come to regard traffic congestion as their most serious environmental problem. The statistics suggest that congestion is rising primarily in metropolitan areas that are either very large -those with a population of two million or more- or fast growing. Most strikingly, for a given area, traffic on highways can grow even faster than population and employment (that was the case, for example, for Montgomery County, Maryland, in the 1978-1988 period; see Downs (1992)). The same pattern has been observed also in national highway travel data over recent decades. The causes of rising congestion can be divided into two basic categories: immediate and long term. At least four immediate causes can be mentioned: rapid population and job growth, more intensive use of automotive vehicles, failure to build new roads, failure to make drivers bear the full costs they generate. Long term, or indirect, causes include: concentration of work trips in time, desire to choose where to live and work, desire for low-density neighborhoods, preference for low-density workplaces, and desire to travel in private vehicles.23 Traffic congestion problems as well as the solutions to these problems may vary from one city to another. The next section describes the three types of city that have been identified in the literature: monocentric, polycentric and edge cities. We then introduce transit as a way to solve or at least reduce - congestion problems. Monocentric, Polycentric, and Edge City Models The models of residential location in urban land markets originally developed by Alonso (1964) and Muth (1969) have long since established themselves as the foundations of urban economic theory. The fundamental results of the basic model are that the spatial distribution of land and housing prices, consumption of land (and other housing attributes), and the spatial arrangement of residents are determined by the transportation costs to the Central Business District (CBD). In particular, the principal qualitative hypotheses which the standard model generates are: (1) the price of land declines with distance from the CBD (the negative rent or land price gradient); and (2) the consumption of land per household increases with distance from the CBD (the negative density gradient). The obvious fact that only a small portion of metropolitan area jobs are found in the CBD does not necessarily undermine the predictions of a model that assumes that all jobs are located in the CBD24. Even if the fraction of CBD jobs is small, money wages would have to fall with distance from the CBD to compensate workers for longer commutes and to attract them 23 24  Downs (1992) Richardson, Harry W. (1988)  83   from locally available jobs. Richardson (1988) also points out that the predicted negative gradients are actually observed (in house prices, land rents, output of housing services per unit land, population densities), and their relative rates of change are plausible and internally consistent. In the homogeneous income case, the essential condition of the standard monocentric model is that the marginal decline in housing expenditures with outward movement should exactly compensate the marginal increase in commuting costs so that households are indifferent among locations. Coulson (1991) tests the monocentric model in the framework of a hedonic model, where the selling price of a house is regarded as a function of housing attributes, including distance to the CBD. The empirical results show that housing prices fall at a rate approximately equal to the increase in transportation costs, as predicted by the model. However, most metropolitan areas are not monocentric: they have subcenters where a substantial amount of employment is located. These subcenters are usually a result of decentralization and urban sprawl. Each of them may have rent gradients of their own, which will collide with the CBD's gradient, and with each other's. Thus, while the monocentric model can be relevant within each submarket, it will appear irrelevant for these metropolitan areas as a whole. Both the huge proportion of non-CBD employment and the continued strength of agglomeration economies (as economies of spatial concentration, not centralization) imply the presence of these employment subcenters that pull in workers from their immediate locale (Richardson (1988)). Muth (1985) argues that the existence of substantial non-CBD employment also explains why central vs. suburban income differentials are much narrower than those predicted by the standard monocentric model. In his framework, since local and non-local homogeneous workers have to be offered the same wage, there is no negative wage gradient. Furthermore, the sites close to the subcenter workplace will be at a premium because of the supra-equilibrium wages offered there; in other words, there is no negative land rent gradient either. What is the driving force of the polycentric model? The strength of the CBD relies on the comparison of CBD agglomeration economies with CBD congestion costs, both as a function of city size. As the city becomes very large, the gap between the two functions narrows. By the time the functions intersect, the CBD retains no locational advantage over alternative metropolitan sites. Richardson (1988) points out that there is substantial empirical evidence to support this view. For example, Anjomani and Chimene (1982) test the monocentric density gradient hypothesis with 1950 and 1970 data. They find a significant gradient in 40 out of 46 cities in 1950 but fail to identify such gradient in more than half of the cities in 1970. In another study25, 58 polycentric population density peaks were identified in the five-county Los Angeles area. This study also showed that a polycentric ""density surface"" was more appropriate than the traditional monocentric gradient for the area under examination. Richardson (1988) notes that subcenters can also be identified in terms of: office space, in- and out- commuting, employment, employment density, worker amenities, influence of suburban nodes on housing prices and land values, and significance of a CBD accessibility variable.  25  Gordon, P., Richardson, H., and Wong, H.: The Distribution of Population and Employment in a Policentric City: The Case of Los Angeles, ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING (1986). Cited in Richardson, Harry W. (1988)  84   With respect to commutes, Richardson (1988) mentions several studies suggesting that polycentric spatial structures facilitate commuting economies. In particular, these studies have shown that: (1) residential densities and commuting times are positively associated, which is consistent with the idea that low-density metropolitan areas and their decentralized employment centers facilitate shorter work trips26; (2) people with the shortest commuting times are those who live and work in the suburbs, while the worst-off are those who live in the suburbs but work in the CBD (the typical commuter in monocentric cities); (3) travel speeds do not vary with city size; (4) peak travel speeds improved between 1977 and 1983. This research suggest that firms and households have been relocating and settling close to each other, facilitating shorter trips and relieving core-area congestion. Edge cities provide another perspective on the spatial organization of production in metropolitan areas. Contrary to traditional suburbs, edge cities are not simply bedroom communities or a product of urban decentralization. They are the creation of strategically controlled office development by large-scale land developers. Edge cities are new cities, created since 1965, outside major central or core cities - they are typically based around one of the great American ports (e.g. Boston, Chicago, Houston, New York, and San Francisco) and centered around enormous tracts of mixed-use office space. They are complete cities, offering jobs, residences, shopping facilities and services for their inhabitants. They are planned entities with rules and limits to their growth. Edge city developers make strategic choices in terms of office space capacity, location vis--vis the central city and other edge cities, industry- and job-mix. Their location and capacity choices are strategic because they engage the passive core city and potential competitors in a struggle for the metro area resources. To illustrate this, Henderson and Mitra (1996), present a decision model for an edge city developer who chooses business district capacity and location with a view to maximize profits. Moving closer to the core city enhances production efficiency by increasing the efficiency of the exchange of information between businesses in the core and edge city. On the other hand, it increases typical residential rents and commuting costs (and hence wages demanded by employees) and weakens the developer's local monopsony power. Assessing Transit-Oriented Solutions Given the increasing problems associated with automobile dependence, many planners, policymakers and others are examining potential alternatives to decrease the reliance on automobile travel. Transit-oriented development for residential and mixed-used areas offers one possible solution. Public transit can be expanded through bus, fixed-rail, or light rail systems. Fixed-rail services of all types are feasible only if they converge on relatively large downtown areas. On the other hand, light rail lines cost less to build than full-scale fixed-rail systems with underground segments through downtown areas. However, aside from a few large cities with extensive mass transit systems, public transit is not widely used for work trips. Public transit usage is even lower among workers living in suburbs. According to Downs (1992), it appears that persons most likely to use public transit for work trips are those who (1) have no automotive vehicle available to their household, (2) live in a central city and work in its CBD, and (3) live in a densely settled community. However, in generating transit usage, the residential density of an 26  Downs (1992)  85   area is less significant than its location. The study also shows that the density of nonresidential clusters is much more important in generating public transportation usage than residential density, other things equal. Among the public policies that can be implemented in order to increase public transit ridership we can mention: (1) cutting transit or bus fares, (2) cutting transit or bus running time, (3) cutting transit or bus waiting time by increasing service frequency. Downs (1992) also discusses whether greater use of public transit would be achieved by concentrating more jobs in large clusters outside the CBD. In metropolitan areas dominated by geographically large local governments, such as the county governments around Washington, D.C., additional jobs could be steered into a few major centers. This would convert now sprawling but inefficient offices in these centers into more compact, downtown-like districts and -if these centers were served by rapid transit- would encourage more commuting off the highways. The Nature of Commercial Property Benefits from Transit The urban economics literature has early on established that access to transit, as a positive amenity, will be ""capitalized"" in the value of land and residential - or commercial - property. It is the purpose of this section to explain why the proximity of transit may enhance commercial property value. It turns out that the nature of these benefits is dual: the proximity of transit may not only facilitate the access to customers but also the access to the work force. Before turning to these issues, it is necessary to introduce two important benefit concepts: present value and willingness-to-pay. Benefit Concepts The market value of land equals the present value of the stream of rental income generated by the land. The present value is the maximum amount that an investor is willing to pay for an asset, given an alternative investment. In other words, the market value of land is the present value of the annual rental payments from the land. In contrast with agricultural land, which can deteriorate with use, developed land does not deteriorate. Therefore, the market value of developed land equals the annual rent divided by the interest rate27. This concept can be extended to commercial property value. Income from Commercial Property and Willingness-to-Pay The maximum price a firm is willing to pay for any site is a function of its anticipated future returns when operating at the site28. The annual return can be thought of as the excess of total annual revenue over total annual costs, for all factors of production other than land. It follows that changes in the value of a commercial property (a stock measure) will represent the discounted anticipated changes in the income revenue from the property (a flow measure). In this context, a bid-rent function can be defined. This function indicates how much a firm is willing to pay for different office sites. Assuming perfectly competitive markets, economic profit will be 27  O'Sullivan, Arthur: Urban Economics (1996)  28  Downing, Paul B.: Factors Affecting Commercial Land Values: An Empirical Study of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, LAND ECONOMICS, 49:1, Feb. 1973  86   zero in equilibrium and the amount paid by the firm will equal the excess of total revenue over non-land costs.29 From all that, commercial property value will be affected by the proximity of transit as long as transit affects anticipated future revenues or total costs. Access to Labor Supply The impact of transportation changes on labor markets can be quite extensive and can occur at a number of different levels. In a study about labor markets and high-speed trains, Haynes (1997) divides this impact into supply-side and demand-side effects. On the supply side, transportation affects both the micro level search behavior of job seekers and the meso level tradeoffs between commuting and labor migration. Specifically, the latter implies that transportation improvements that lower the cost of migration increase certainty by reducing information decay (i.e. the decline in information about job availability produced by distance) or search costs, lower the cost of labor market adjustments, and increase the efficiency of labor migration. On the demand side, firms that demand labor will have a broader pool to select from at lower prices (as they will have to pay a lower wage premium for extra commuting) with the potential for a more targeted or specialized fit between jobs and employees. White (1988) examines workers' commuting behavior in an urban model with decentralized employment. This behavior will in turn influence firms in their location choice. The paper shows that in cities with decentralized employment, a ""commuting indifference"" property holds, but only in special cases. In general, households' rent offer curves for housing depend on their workers' job locations. It is also shown that workers' wage offer curves for different job locations vary with their households' residential locations. Specifically, workers having different job locations may segregate into different residential rings. The paper shows a pattern in which workers living in particular residential rings have preferences over where they work. In equilibrium, it is likely that workers' residential and job locations will be non-negatively related to each other. If we consider the case of workers with different skills, the model predicts that firms have stronger incentives to suburbanize as the average skill level and wage rate of their workers rise. Therefore, the composition of a firm's workforce (i.e. the relative mix of high-wage versus low-wage workers) influences the firm's location. And there is no generalized indifference property applying to commuting journey lengths in cities with decentralized employment. Rotemberg and Saloner (1990) argue that firms locate together to commit to compete for labor and not pay monopsony wages. This effective commitment enables firms to attract labor in the first place. Haynes (1997) explores the impact of high-speed train on labor markets for three cases: Japan's Shinkansen, France's TGV, and Germany's ICE. In Japan, station locations generated higher population growth levels when an information exchange industry (business services, banking and real estate development), universities and expressway access were also present. In general, the empirical studies indicate that transportation improvements taken together are often 29  O'Sullivan: op.cit.  87   complementary. Station effects and expressway effects also contributed to a substantial increase in per capita income. On the other hand, a heavy concentration in manufacturing industry and an aged population were growth limiting variables. Access to Consumers Stores and personal businesses will seek to locate close to where potential customers can access their services. First, the accessibility of a site for potential customers will directly affect anticipated future net returns. Second, the knowledge potential customers can have on the firm's location and existence is also likely to affect expected revenues (see Downing (1973)). Glaeser et al. (1992) observe the presence of ""urbanization"" externalities: different industries locate in a city because local demand is high there, and so they can sell some of their output without incurring transport costs. In the same spirit, Krugman (1991) presents a model of city formation based on local demand. The evidence presented in Glaeser et al. (1992) strongly supports the urbanization externalities hypothesis. Additionally, Moses and Williamson (1967) show that firm size must be taken into account when analyzing location patterns, since small firms may be more constrained regarding this issue. In other words, larger firms can move longer distances because they are more independent of suppliers or buyers at a particular location. Property Value and Access Sivitanidou (1996) explains that ""the contemporary land market theory has early on established that differential firm access to business activity clusters must elicit significant effects on commercial land markets"" (page 126). She stresses in particular ""the importance of forward (clientele-related) and backward (input-related) linkages between firms providing or using such support services as advertising, accounting, financial, business, and legal"" (page 127). Finally, she notes that these linkages ""necessitate frequent travel by top-level executives whose time carries significant opportunity costs"" (page 127). In addressing the role that business centers play within polycentric Los Angeles, Sivitanidou (1995) presents a model that builds upon previous urban spatial studies postulating joint household and firm equilibria. In this model, property value per unit land is a function of both property specific traits and location attributes. Property traits include standard building attributes (age, area per floor, elevator, parking, etc.). Location attributes include business centers (main or secondary) accessibility and a set of control locational traits (local service and transportation access, location prestige, worker amenities, and land supply constraints). Center accessibility is measured as the distance to each center, whereas transportation access is measured as the distance to the closest major airport and freeway. The model also allows for different specifications regarding the relative importance and degree of substitutability of secondary business centers. The empirical findings based on this model not only confirm the hypothesis that firms value main center accessibility, but they also show that secondary center accessibility matters too. Both factors generate nontrivial land market effects. The study also shows that distance to airport exhibits the expected (negative) sign, and is statistically significant. Downs (1992) suggests that public transit usage affects nonresidential density. He notes that Washington D.C.'s Metro rail system appears to have encouraged more downtown development than would otherwise have occurred. Metro rail converges on downtown from all directions, with 88   the result that the city center has become a better labor market for employers. He concludes that one way to strengthen the market for office and other space within a business center is to build more off-road transit facilities to serve it. Downing (1973) presents regressions of land sales prices as a function of distance to CBD, distance to shopping center, traffic level on main street, area population, median income, amenities, and area dummies. He concludes that these variables explain a substantial portion of the variations in commercial land value for the study area (the city of Milwaukee). One hypothesis of the paper is that the distance to the CBD might be associated with the firm's cost of obtaining goods and services. Although it is recognized that travel time to CBD would be a more appropriate variable than distance to CBD, the latter is used; the associated coefficients are significant only when the distance is substantial. Therefore, the empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that greater accessibility to transportation increases land values. Nakamura and Ueda (1989) present empirical evidence of a substantial station driven commercial land value increase for the case of Japan's Shinkansen. This increase is even higher than the expressway driven value increase. For the cases of France's TGV and Germany's ICE, there is also empirical evidence of commercial land value and demand increases due to station effects.  The Measurement of Transit's Impact Hedonic Pricing Methodology Many commodities can be viewed as bundles of individual attributes for which no explicit markets exist. Although it would be of interest to estimate structural supply and demand functions for these attributes, the absence of directly observable attribute prices poses a problem for such estimation. A hedonic price equation is a reduced-form equation reflecting both supply and demand influences. The hedonic regression reveals implicit prices of these attributes, and may provide a starting point for recovering underlying supply and demand functions. Unfortunately, the appropriate functional form for the hedonic price equation cannot in general be specified on theoretical grounds. Downing (1973) does not address the issue explicitly. He uses both linear and non-linear forms to evaluate the impact of the distance to the CBD and the distance to the nearest shopping center on land value. His results are unaffected by the choice of the functional form. However, since the non-linear form is more consistent with traditional theory and was found to substantially improve the fit in the residential land value regressions, non-linear form results are generally reported in the literature. Grass (1992) uses a semi-log form while Sivitanidou (1996) uses a log-linear, or double-log, function. Although some earlier writers30 had employed the Box-Cox model, it is since Halvorsen and Pollakowski's (1981) contribution that this model has become widely employed in hedonic studies. The authors stress that the lack of a firm theoretical basis for the choice of functional form is unfortunate since, in their opinion, the results obtained using the hedonic approach 30  Linneman, P.: Some empirical results on the nature of the hedonic price function for the urban housing market, JOURNAL OF URBAN ECONOMICS 8, 1980. Cited in Cheshire and Sheppard (1995)  89   depend critically on the functional form. Therefore, the authors recommend the use of a flexible approach that does not require the specification of a functional form per-se: the Box-Cox model. Graves et al. (1988) address the issues of functional form and error distribution in the context of estimating hedonic prices for urban air quality. The authors point out that the empirical magnitudes of the hedonic prices may vary substantially, depending on how these issues are addressed. In order to make the functional form sufficiently general, they employ the Box-Cox model. They conclude that most of the functional forms encountered in the environmental literature can be rejected for their data set. However, they cannot assess the relative impact of functional form variations on hedonic price estimates. In fact, if the estimated prices are relatively insensitive to functional form, the commonly used forms may provide relatively precise benefit estimates. Finally, the authors want to evaluate the presence of a bias in parameter estimates derived from the assumption of normality. Their estimates from an alternative, robust estimation technique (minimum absolute deviation) do not differ substantially from least squares estimates. They conclude that least square estimation can be relied on. In the specific case of land value, it is important to distinguish between the hedonic price of land and the amount for which vacant land might sell in the actual market. Theories of the urban land market typically focus on the intrinsic usefulness of land, and on the differential accessibility of land at various locations. The combination of these two forces determines an equilibrium price for land and it is this price that Cheshire and Sheppard (1995) define as the hedonic price of land. In normal circumstances such a price will be less than the observed sales price of vacant land since the latter would include the value of local amenities. In Cheshire and Sheppard's (1995) specification of an hedonic model applied to residential land, they group housing characteristics in dwelling-specific and location-specific. The paper outlines a technique which, under appropriate conditions, can provide estimates of the marginal value of neighborhood characteristics: value that will be capitalized into, and is often confused with, the value of land. By successively adding sets of location-specific characteristics to this model, it is possible econometrically to simulate the capitalization of these characteristics into land values. The results suggest that, if location-specific characteristics of housing are appropriately measured, monocentric models can perform well. Concerning the functional form, the authors point out that their results would justify the choice of the Box-Cox transformation. The hedonic approach to benefit evaluation relies on the cross-sectional capitalization hypothesis which assumes mobility of people between different locations. Property prices are higher in an area with better amenities - or better public services - because otherwise many individuals would want to move into the area and would bid up property prices. Perfect mobility between different areas, therefore, ensures that property prices reflect the benefits of amenities. Kanemoto (1988) points out that the use of hedonic prices in benefit estimation tends to result in over-investment in amenities. More precisely, if the costs and the benefits of a project are evaluated at preimprovement prices, the hedonic measure will overestimate the benefits of the project. However, this result requires the assumption that migration between regions is free and cost-less. If mobility is imperfect, capitalization tends to be less than perfect, which creates a counteracting tendency for underestimation, and the net result is uncertain. Similarly, Bartik (1988) shows that the property value increases due to amenity improvements predicted by an hedonic function will generally be overestimated, thus allowing the ex-ante calculation of an upper bound for the benefits associated with these improvements. If consumer marginal willingness to pay for amenities can be estimated, a lower bound for the benefits can be 90   computed as well. But estimating consumer willingness to pay is difficult and the upper bound will often be the best benefit measure available... Stated Preference Methods An alternative to the hedonic methodology is to directly ask households or individuals to state their willingness to pay for public goods using survey techniques. The survey approach for valuing public goods has received considerable theoretical scrutiny. Randall et al.(1974), Bohm (1972), and Brookshire et al. (1976) modeled the survey approach using standard concepts of consumer surplus; in addition, the latter two analyses also focus on the possibility of strategic behavior. Despite arguments that strategic bias will invalidate survey results, there is the need for an alternative to the hedonic approach, as the latter cannot always be applied. The considerable empirical evidence now available suggests that strategic bias may be of little consequence both in survey work31 and in experimental economics32. The hypothetical nature of the questions used in survey analysis may substantially reduce incentives for strategic behavior. However, respondents may also have little incentive to provide accurate answers concerning willingness to pay for public goods. Thus, it has even been suggested that the survey approach produces ""noise"" since responses are purely hypothetical and have no necessary connection to actual budgetary decisions. The results of using the survey approach for estimating the value of public goods appear to be internally consistent, replicable and consistent with demand theory33. Brookshire et al. (1982) report on an experiment designed to externally validate the survey approach by comparing it to a hedonic property value study. The authors provide a theoretical model that predicts that survey responses will be bounded below by zero and above by rent differentials derived from the estimated hedonic rent gradient. The empirical results do not allow the rejection of either of the 31  see the following articles:  Bishop, R., and Heberlein, T.: Measuring Values of Extra-Market Goods: Are Indirect Measures Biased?, AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS, December 1979.

Adapting the Residential Benefits Model to Commercial Property The impact of transit systems on urban property values has been widely studied. Since rapid transit is an important means of travel to the CBD in many cities, Dewees (1976) analyzed the relationship between travel costs by rail and residential property values. He found that replacing a street-car with a subway increased the site rent perpendicular to the facility within a one-third mile walk to the station. Damm et al. (1980) showed that the distance of a parcel to the nearest Metro station was a statistically significant determinant of the transaction price of an urban parcel, while Wolf (1979) similarly showed the positive influence of permanent transportation improvements on parcel values. The methods developed by these authors are applied in Grass (1992). This article analyzes the individual Metro station effects on residential property values, for Washington D.C.. A hedonic price equation is estimated, where the dependent variable is the average property value for each area. The equation includes among its independent variables a dummy for the ""impact area"" (i.e. the area less than one-quarter mile from the station). This study reveals a significant direct relationship between the opening of Metro stations and residential property values.  Implementing Hedonic Models Hedonic price estimation is performed using multiple regression techniques. In the present study, property value would be regressed on a set of explanatory variables including property and location characteristics. This section focuses on the description of the variables that have been previously used in the literature. Variable Selection in the Literature Downing (1973) computes property values in terms of actual purchase price. Sivitanidou (1996) uses assessed property values but mentions that there is a high correlation between assessed and actual market values. Cheshire and Sheppard (1995) use the listed asking price, although they realize that the actual transaction price would be the usual variable to include. Finally, the dependent variable can be expressed in terms of property values per unit - per square foot for example - as opposed to non-normalized property values. Independent variables can be grouped in different ways, but the distinction between location attributes and property-specific traits seems the most fundamental. Additionally, the former may in turn be decomposed into a set of accessibility characteristics and another set of control location traits. FTA compiled a list of explanatory variables used in the literature. This list is summarized in Table 6.1. Note that each class of variables has a reference number (2) to (18). (2) Distance to Central Business District. Moses and Williamson [M&S] (1967) use this variable, as it is inversely correlated with the rent gradient. They find a significant and negative coefficient. According to Downing [D] (1973), this variable is associated with the firm's cost of obtaining goods and services, and also measures access to major transportation links. He uses the straight line distance from the site to the CBD but notes that a more appropriate measure would be the time it takes to travel from the site to the CBD. He finds that this variable is not  92   Table 6.1 (1)  Variable Selection in the Hedonic Measurement Literature Dependent Variable area units Independent Variables Category Variable dCBD dSBD type of street or traffic level dairport dummy bus dummy station or land use rail or dstation [D][G][M&W][S][C&S] [S] Sivitanidou [C&S] Cheshire & Sheppard [D] Downing [S] [C&S] [G] Grass [M&W] Moses & Williamson [M&W] [S] [D] [M&W] [S] [D] [C&S] [D] [C&S] Source See notes on [S], [G] and [C&S] Source Purchase Value of Land [D]  (2) (3) (4) (5) Location Attributes: (6) Accessibility (7)  (8) (9) (10) (11)  dummy freeway or dfreeway Population Population density average income or median income or blue collar or ethnic  (12) Other Location Attributes (13) (14) (15) (16) Property (17) Characteristics (18)  new construction around or [C&S] [G] deteriorated around or [D] prestige %commercial use worker amenities lot size corner building traits [S] [M&W] [C&S] [S] [S] [C&S] [D] [G] [C&S] [D] [G] [C&S] [S] density commercial or [HLB]  land supply constraints [S] [M&W]  93   significant, except for the case of substantial distances. Grass [G] (1992), Cheshire and Sheppard [C&S](1995), and Sivitanidou [S] (1996) also use this variable. In Grass (1992) this variable is not significant. He points out that a possible explanation would be that the spatial pattern of parcels is not smoothly sloping. Sivitanidou (1996) shows that this variable is negative and significant. (3) Distance to Secondary Business District(s). Sivitanidou (1996) provides three alternative specifications of the effect of this variable. Each specification embodies different assumptions on the degree of substitution between the service ""bundles"" offered by the area's centers. This variable is found negative and significant. (4) Type of street. Cheshire and Sheppard (1995) divide roads into five categories from cul-desac to main roads. Each type of street (except one) is assigned a dummy variable. Their aim is to reflect the level of both traffic disturbance and pollution to which a site is subject. They also notice that location on larger roads might provide an increased level of accessibility and -in the case of residential property- the possibility of conversion to commercial use. The actual observed effect would be the net outcome of these two effects. Downing (1973) also mentions the possibility of using distance from the main street as a variable. Downing (1973) includes traffic level on the main street, measured in thousands of vehicles per 24 hours. The variable is significant and has the expected (positive) sign. (5) Sivitanidou (1996) includes distance to closest major airport among the variables. This variable is negative and significant. (6) Cheshire and Sheppard (1995) use a dummy for bus route near the site but this variable is not significant. (7) Grass (1992) uses a dummy for rail station in the area. This variable is significant and positive. Percentage of land used for transportation other than highway in a given area is included by Moses and Williamson (1967). In their study, this variable is not significant. (8) Dummy for freeway. This variable is one if there is a freeway in a given zone, and zero if there is none. It is used by Moses and Williamson (1967). The variable turns out to be not significant. Sivitanidou (1996) includes distance to closest freeway in the model. Contrary to her expectations, the variable is not significant. (9) Population. Downing (1973) notes that a larger population in the area surrounding the site would increase anticipated sales and thus land values. He runs separate regressions for populations living within different radii. He finds that this variable has the expected (positive) sign, but it is significant only for long radii. (10) Population density in a given zone. This variable is a good measure of the availability of labor, sometimes seen as a surrogate for the wage gradient. It is introduced by Moses and Williamson (1967) but is not significant in their study. (11) Sivitanidou (1996) uses a variable measuring per capita income in the census tract each property is located in. This variable is intended to capture the quality of a property's surrounding  94   neighborhood, and is included among ""worker amenities"". The results show that it is positive and significant. Median income reflects the fact that firms expect to draw most of their customers from the area surrounding the site. Downing (1973) uses this variable; his results show that it is significant, but -contrary to what he expects- negative. Cheshire and Sheppard (1995) include a variable representing the proportion of blue collar within total labor force in a given area; the variable is not significant. Racial/Ethnic factors. Downing (1973) uses the percentage of non-white population in an area to measure the effects of racial diversity. He finds that this variable is significant and negative. In their study on two English cities, Cheshire and Sheppard (1995) use the percentage of urban Afro-Caribbean population in an area. The variable turns out to be significant but -contrary to what they expected- positive. (12) A dummy variable for new construction (1 if majority of observations in the area are new) is included in Cheshire and Sheppard (1995). This variable is positive and significant for one case (city of Darlington) and not significant for the other (city of Reading). Grass uses the percentage of new houses around the site to account for this factor. The variable is found significant and positive. Downing (1973) uses the percentage of deteriorating or dilapidated units in the block as a measure of visual amenities. As expected, the variable is significant and negative. Sivitanidou (1996) uses a dummy for area prestige, intended to capture the positive effect of prestigious addresses on commercial property values. This variable is found to be positive and significant. (13) Proportion of land used for commercial purposes. Moses and Williamson (1967) use the percentage of land in manufacturing use. This variable is significant and positive. For the same variable, Cheshire & Sheppard's (1995) results show that it is not significant. Sivitanidou (1996) uses a measure of employment concentration in finance, legal, and business services in the property's immediate environment. This variable is also called ""local service"". It is significant, and it exhibits the expected (positive) sign. (14) Worker amenities. Perceived as important exogenous determinants of worker utility and, as such, residential land values and local wages, worker amenities are proxies in Sivitanidou (1996) by average crime rate in the city, retail and motion picture employment per resident population, and distance from each property to the ocean (the study is about Los Angeles). These variables are positive and significant. Cheshire & Sheppard (1995) use the percent of land in either accessible or inaccessible open space around the site. Although the sign is always positive, significance depends both on the sample and the kind of amenity. (15) Land supply constraints. Moses and Williamson (1967) use the percentage of vacant land zoned for manufacturing and commercial purposes. In their study, this variable is not significant. Sivitanidou (1996) proxies land supply restrictions with the percentage of commercially zoned land measured at the city district level. The variable is significant and negative. (16) Lot size. According to Downing (1973), a trade-off exists between the size of a lot purchased by a firm and the cost of constructing improvements. Increasing the size of a site will reduce improvement costs. However, the greater the increase in site size, the smaller the 95   marginal improvement cost savings. Thus, it is expected that the value of land per square foot decreases as the size of the lot increases. The empirical results show that this variable is significant and negative. This variable is also used in Grass (1992) and Cheshire & Sheppard (1995). (17) Corner influence is measured by determining the last two digits of the site address, subtracting them from the last two digits of the estimated middle-of-the-block address, and squaring the result. Thereby, sites located close to the ends of a block would receive a higher weight than those located close to the center. This procedure is used in Downing (1973): the variable is found significant only for long blocks. (18) Building traits. Grass (1992) uses the number of bathrooms (significant, positive) and the building size (significant, positive). Cheshire and Sheppard (1995) use the number of bedrooms (positive, significant), the number of bathrooms (positive, significant), the number of floors (positive, significant), the size in square feet (positive, significant), the width of the plot (not significant), and dummies for terrace-style (negative, significant), semi-detached (negative, significant), flat (negative, significant), parking (not significant), garage (positive, significant), and central heating (positive, significant). Sivitanidou (1996) uses the age of the building (negative and significant), the average floor area (not significant), the number of elevators (positive and significant), and dummies for metal frame (negative and significant), external glass walls (positive and significant), external wooden walls (negative and significant), and subterranean parking (positive and significant). Additional Comments on the Selection of Variables Area Dummies. Several articles use area dummies in addition to the variables listed above. Downing (1973) takes into account development intensity regulation zoning, and assigns variables to all zones, except the one where development regulations are more strict. Thus, each variable will measure the value of an allowed increase in the intensity of use over the least intense zone. It is expected that each variable will have a positive influence on land value and the value of the regression coefficients should increase with the intensity of use allowed. His results show that these variables are significant. Moses and Williamson (1967) include a dummy variable indicating whether the zone is outside the city (Chicago). It was introduced to catch the effects of zoning policies, property tax rates, etc. between the central city and the surrounding area. This variable is not significant. Finally, in their study of residential property values in two English cities, Cheshire & Sheppard (1995) include area dummies that account for the particular secondary school catchment zone where each house is located. Differences Among Land Markets. According to Downing (1973), there are at least two reasons why residential, industrial, and commercial land uses can be treated as distinct markets for the purposes of determining the factors which affect land value. First, there are certain barriers and institutional restraints to the transfer of land from one use to another. Second, even if the land market were one market, there is every reason to believe that the different possible uses would bid for the land for different reasons. Thus, the relative importance of the different factors will vary among types of land use. In order to test this hypothesis, Downing runs two Chow tests. He rejects the hypothesis that residential and commercial data come from the same population, and reaches a similar conclusion for commercial and industrial data.  96   Framework and Methodology Methodological Framework As stated in the introduction, the purpose of this report was ""to research and develop a practical methodology for estimating the effect of the proximity of transit on commercial property value."" FTA looked at a cross-section, a sample, of commercial properties located in a specific urban area, to evaluate the distance between these properties and the closest transit stop and then, to estimate the impact of the proximity-to-transit attribute on the properties' value. This evaluation was performed through the use of multiple regression techniques. In the present case, the value of commercial properties was regressed on a set of characteristics, including proximity-to-transit. The estimated coefficient on this variable measured either directly or indirectly the marginal effect of a change in the distance-to-transit on property values. The theoretical underpinning of this type of approach is the hedonic model presented in the literature review. Methodological Issues to Consider Several methodological issues need to be addressed before discussing the estimation procedure itself: Which type of commercial properties should be included in the analysis? What is the appropriate area of study and, in particular, what is the shape of the city under examination? Do different forms of public transportation have different impacts on property values? And finally, how should the commercial properties be selected? There are roughly four types of commercial properties: (1) retail stores, (2) personal businesses, (3) offices and (4) industrial properties such as factories or warehouses. As explained in the literature survey, the nature of the benefits of the proximity of transit will vary across property types. Public transit facilitates customer access to retail stores and personal businesses. Other things equal, the shorter the distance between a store and a transit stop, the larger the expected volume of sales generated by that store. This excess volume of sales will be capitalized in the ""value"" of the store. The value of office spaces and industrial properties is enhanced by the proximity of transit because it lowers the cost of accessing the workforce. A firm located near a transit stop will benefit from an implicit, or explicit, reduction in costs. This cost reduction will be capitalized in the value of the firm. From all that, it is preferable to differentiate between stores on the one hand and offices and industrial properties on the other hand. This can be done by either conducting two separate analyses - separate samples - or by using dichotomous dummy--variables in a single ""model"". What is the appropriate area of study? The initial area of study will be a major metropolitan area. It will be either a monocentric city, a polycentric city or an edge city. Should we expect the proximity of transit to have a different impact in different cities? A priori, yes. The impact of transit is likely to be weaker in polycentric or edge cities where economic activity is more dispersed. Besides, the analysis of polycentric cities would require the introduction of additional explanatory variables into the model: the distances to the secondary business districts. Ideally, the analysis should be performed for one city of each type. FTA started with Washington D.C., which can clearly be viewed as a monocentric city.  97   Do different forms of transit have different impacts on property values? Previous studies have shown that the proximity to a metro station had a greater impact on residential property values. Similar findings are expected for commercial property values. Thereby, the data used in this report will include the distance to the closest bus stop and the distance to the closest metro station. Separate regressions can be run to evaluate which mode of transportation has the greater impact on commercial properties. How Should the Commercial Properties Be Selected? In some earlier studies, commercial - or residential - properties have been selected within radiuses around a pre-defined set of transit stops. In other words, in these studies, the researcher first chose a sample of Metro stations or Bus stops and then randomly selected a set of properties located around these stations and stops. An alternative approach consists in randomly selecting a set of properties within the area of study and then, identifying the Metro stations and Bus stops located near these properties. This is the approach followed here. Specification of the Model Specifying a model implies several steps. The first step consists in defining the variable of interest, the variable that will be ""explained"" by the model. In the present study, it is the value of commercial properties located within the study area. The variations in value across properties can be explained by a limited set of characteristics, including the proximity of transit. Therefore, the most general form for the model will be: Y=f(X,d) With Y: the dependent variable, some measure of commercial property value; f: a function to be specified; X: a set of characteristics (building traits, neighborhood characteristics, etc.); d: a variable measuring proximity to transit. The Dependent Variable (Y) The endogenous variable will be the assessment value, the listed asking price, of a commercial property divided by the size of the property. The unit of measurement for this variable will be dollars - or thousands of dollars - per square foot. The actual transaction price would be the appropriate variable for an hedonic study but: (1) the number of transactions is likely to be rather small, (2) the assessment value is generally a good proxy for the actual selling price and (3) the use of actual transactions might create a ""selectivity bias"". If actual transactions were used, the commercial properties in the sample would presumably have characteristics that explain why they have been sold during the particular period under examination. These ""hidden"" characteristics are also likely to influence the value of these properties. Theory shows that in this case, estimating price equations without correcting for the selection process might yield biased estimates of the model coefficients. Explanatory Variable Selection (X and d) The model should include a limited set of variables that account for as much variation in commercial property value as possible. Omitting relevant variables or including irrelevant 98   variables should be avoided. Two important issues must be considered: (1) the existence of substitutes to public transportation, in particular the access to low-cost parking space or the proximity of a large, non-congested road; (2) the homogeneity of the area under examination. As stated in the review of the literature, hedonic prices reflect supply and demand equilibria. The problem is to define the relevant market for the study at hand. The real estate market being a collection of relatively separate sub-markets, a common problem in real estate studies consists in aggregating heterogeneous areas in the same analysis, in committing the aggregation error34. In order to avoid such error, the researcher can either perform separate analyses or control for the areas' attributes through the use of dummy variables. Another concern is the presence of multicollinearity, i.e. collinearity among explanatory variables. A good example here would be the relationship between employment density and proximity to transit. Holding other things constant - with or without transit stop, in particular - a property will be more expensive in a commercially active area. In such areas, we expect to find more transit stops i.e. shorter walking distances for all shops of the sample located in the area. In other words, the employment density and the proximity of transit are likely to be positively correlated. When multicollinearity is severe, it is very difficult to estimate individual regression coefficients precisely35. In other words, the estimation results are not reliable. In the present example, it would be very difficult to isolate the effect of proximity to transit from the pure density effect. What can be done? There are two options: the first consists in suppressing redundant variables, the second in performing factor analyses to ""summarize"" redundant variables into a single ""factor."" From all that, the model will be specified to include a mix of property characteristics (real estate data) and location characteristics (geographical and socioeconomic data). Real Estate Data: Relevant property characteristics will include the size of the property in square feet and a set of building attributes: age of the building, availability of parking space and other items. The value of a commercial property per square foot is likely to decrease as the size of the property increases. In other words, the coefficient associated with the size variable is likely to be negative. Other things equal, retail stores and offices located in more recent buildings are likely to be ""more expensive"". Similarly, the proximity of parking space is likely to enhance the value of commercial properties. Geographical Data: The model will include various location attributes that are thought to affect the value of commercial properties: distance to the CBD, to the closest bus stop or metro station, to the closest airport, and to the closest freeway. The inclusion of ""distance to the CBD"" among the explanatory variables results from the conclusions of basic urban economic models where the spatial distribution of land prices is determined by the transportation costs to the CBD - the negative rent or land price gradient. Since the price of land should decline with distance from the CBD, the corresponding coefficient is expected to be negative. Distances to the closest airport and to the closest freeway account for the value associated with transportation accessibility; both are expected to have a negative coefficient. Type of street, traffic level or distance from the main street can be used to account for access to consumers, but also for the level of traffic disturbance 34  Mahlon Straszheim, ""Hedonic Estimation of Housing Market Prices: A Further Comment"", in The Review of Economics and Statistics, 1973, pp. 404-6 Damodar Gujarati, ""Basic Econometrics"", Second Edition, 1988, pp. 283-315  35  99   to which a site is subject. As the actual observed effect would be the net outcome of these two effects, the expected sign is uncertain. The variable of primary interest is the distance to the closest transit stop. The coefficient associated with this variable is expected to be negative. Socioeconomic Data: Various neighborhood characteristics will be included in the model: population or employment density, median income, density of commercial activities and, if possible, some proxy for the availability of worker amenities. A larger population should positively increase expected sales and labor availability. We expect this variable to have a positive sign. The neighborhood's median income reflects customers' purchasing power and the quality of a property's surrounding neighborhood. Therefore, this variable is likely to have a positive coefficient. The density of commercial activities and the availability of worker amenities are also likely to influence the value of commercial properties. While the former is intended to reflect urbanization externalities, the latter should positively influence workers' location. Both are expected to have a positive effect on commercial properties. Functional Form Selection In the literature, non-linear functional forms have been preferred on theoretical and empirical grounds (see Section 2.3). In particular, log-linear and semi-log models have been used repeatedly in hedonic studies. HLB proposes to try a more flexible approach: the use of a BoxCox transformation. A rapid review of the different forms that could be used in the study is presented below. The Linear Model: Pi =  0 + p   k =1   k x ki + d i + i  With Pi: assessment value of the ith commercial property; xki: kth characteristic of the ith property; di: distance to the closest metro station or bus stop; i: error term, what is left unexplained by the model; 0, k, : coefficients to be estimated. The coefficient of interest is . The value of this coefficient can be interpreted increase in property value brought about by a one-unit change in the proximity assumption of linearity implies that whatever the distance to transit, a one-unit distance to transit produces a constant  dollars per square-foot increase in the The Semi-Log Model: ln Pi =  0 + p  as the average of transit. The reduction in the property's value.   k =1   k x ki + d i +   i  Where ln P is the natural logarithm of P.  can be interpreted here as the relative or percentage change in property value produced by a one-unit change in the distance to transit. This model implies the existence of a linear relationship between the log of the dependent variable P and the explanatory variables (see Figure 6.6 in the Annex).  100   The Log-Linear Model: ln Pi =  0 + In this specification,  is the relative percent change in distance to transit. to as a constant elasticity model: the the elasticity of P with respect to d The Box-Cox Model: Pi =  0 +   k =1  p   k ln x ki +  ln d i +   i  or percentage change in property value produced by a oneThe log-linear, or double-log, model is sometimes referred percentage change in P for a given percentage change in d is constant throughout the range of the variable d.  x li - 1 d i - 1 + +    k D     k x ki +   l C    l  i  With D: set of indices for dichotomous characteristics, dummy variables C: set of indices for continuous variables : transformation parameter to be estimated The Box-Cox model allows for greater flexibility than any of the models presented so far. No functional form36 is chosen a-priori. Instead, the choice of the ""best"" functional form is part of the estimation. From the above formula, it can be shown for example that if  = 1 the model is linear but if  = -1 it is reciprocal in the independent variables. In the estimation,  is treated as an additional unknown parameter. In other words, the estimation procedure consists in determining the parameters and the functional form that best fit the data. This should be contrasted to a typical linear regression where the functional form is set, and where the estimation procedure ""optimizes"" over the parameters of the linear function only. Note from the formula that the dummy variables are not transformed. Finally, the right-hand side variable can also be transformed by the parameter : pi - 1 = 0 +   k D     k x ki +   l C    l   x li - 1 d i - 1 + +    i  In principle, a different transformation parameter (other than ) could be used on the left-hand side variable. But according to Greene (1993), this transformation is often ""more cumbersome than necessary."" Also, it could be possible to allow for different non-linearities on the distance variable. In fact, each regressor could be transformed by a different parameter. But again ""this generality becomes excessively cumbersome in most applications"" Greene (1993). At any rate, the most flexible model that could be estimated for this study is: pi - 1 = 0 +   k D     k x ki +   l C    l   x li - 1 d i - 1 + +    i  Where:  is the transformation parameter for the dependent variable P; 36  Some authors consider the Box-Cox specification as a functional form. For the sake of clarity, we differentiate between the Box-Cox and the (traditional) functional forms: linear, log-linear, s"

The most successful transit systems are those which take people from where they are to where they want to go, when they want to go, at a price they can afford, and do so safely and securely.  These principles are the basis for Federal Transit Administration policies and programs.   At this time, Americans are concerned with a variety of transit issues.  These include providing greater mobility, especially for those with disabilities, the elderly, those in need, and those living in rural areas; improving air quality by such means as use of alternative fuels, clean diesel engines, and such devices as particulate traps or catalytic converters on transit buses; taking advantage of advanced transit technologies in areas such as navigation, information, and communication; and making all transit systems safer and more secure by such means as training, development of regulatory guidelines, and an intensive drug and alcohol information and testing program.  These, and a number of other areas of concern to the public and the transit industry are being treated by the projects listed in this directory of Transit Planning and Research Programs.   The directory will provide you with information on grants and contracts in such areas as advanced public transportation systems, clean air, finance, human resources and productivity, information, policy analysis and evaluation, regional mobility, safety and security, technology development, transit accessibility, planning and project development, and transit cooperative research.  All are aimed at assisting communities and transit operators in their efforts to provide the best possible service to users within available resources.          Gordon J.

Project Title:  Drug and Alcohol Management Information System      Grantee/ Contractor:  Battelle Memorial Institute     Location:  Columbus, Ohio     Funding:  $185,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Judy Meade  Project Number:  OH-26-0001           Description:  The Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 provided the Federal Transit Administration with a mandate that requires its grantees to develop and implement drug and alcohol programs.  The FTA drug and alcohol rules require grantees to submit annual reports on their testing programs.  These reports serve not only as a compliance tool, but will also provide FTA with data necessary to evaluate effectiveness of the regulations and support any future modifications to the program.  In order to analyze the content of the reports, FTA must establish and maintain a computerized management information system capable of generating information in the form of an annual summary to be utilized by the Office of the Secretary of Transportation, FTA, Congress, and the transit industry.  This funding will serve to develop the management information system, process and analyze the first year's reports from grantees, and generate the first annual summary.     Project Title:  Enforcement and Compliance Strategies for Drug and Alcohol   Regulations      Grantee/ Contractor:  Battelle Memorial Institute     Location:  Columbus, Ohio     Funding:  $50,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Judy Meade  Project Number:  OH-26-0001           Description:  The current strategy of the Federal Transit Administration for compliance monitoring of its drug and alcohol regulations has three components:  (1) self-certification, (2) annual reports, and (3) triennial reviews.  However, after three years, the other Department of Transportation operating administrations, which utilize formal and frequent site visits by inspectors to employers, have discovered numerous and serious instances of drug rule compliance failures.  In addition, it has become apparent that collection site and medical review officers are frequently in violation.  Because it has a statutory mandate to withhold funds for failure to comply with the rules, the Federal Transit Administration must be certain that its funds support only those grantees meeting requirements of the rules.  It is recognized that the ability of grantees to comply is related directly to availability of increasingly scarce resources because of Americans with Disabilities and Clean Air requirements.  This think piece project is exploring any additional strategies that FTA may wish to consider for future action.

Grubb  Project Number:  WA-26-9001           Description:  Guidance is being developed on how to incorporate transit facilities and operations into high occupancy vehicle facility design.  For HOVways on freeways, it will consider the number, location, and design of transit centers of stations, the number and location of bus bays and shelters at park-and-ride lots, T-ramps, or other means to provide bus access between the HOVways and transit centers, and buses to move between HOV lanes and other lanes.  The project will also look at signalization options to give buses priority or to allow buses to maneuver across lanes to make turns or pick-ups on arterial HOV facilities.  In conjunction with any HOVway, the study will consider investment in bus fleet expansion to provide new or enhanced service, use of articulated buses, and new or expanded bus maintenance garages to accommodate additional buses.  A guidance manual on these issues is being developed and information from the manual disseminated through conferences, Transportation Research Board papers and journal articles, and other means.        Project Title:  North-South Station Rail Link Feasibility Study      Grantee/Contractor:  KPMG Peat Marwick     Location:  Vienna, Virginia     Funding:  $125,566  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Sheila Cohen  Project Number:  VA-26-9001           and       Grantee/Contractor:  STV/Seelye, Stevenson, Value and Knecht     Location:  New York, New York     Funding:  $77,505  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Sheila Cohen  Project Number:  NY-26-9001           Description:  The feasibility of a rail connection between North Station and South Station in Boston is being analyzed.  Connecting these two stations would better serve commuters to Boston as well as Amtrak riders traveling through the city.  Two tunnel alignments are being studied, one following Congress Street and the other along the Central Artery alignment.     Project Title:  Alternatives Analysis Staff Support      Grantee/Contractor:  S. G. Associates, Inc.     Location:  Annandale, Virginia     Funding:  $115,355  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Ronald Jensen-Fisher  Project Number:  VA-26-9002           Description:  The number of new start projects is far in excess of the ability of the Federal Transit Administration to provide technical oversight in a timely fashion.  Without this oversight, FTA cannot satisfactorily manage the new start program and provide useful cost effectiveness data to top management and the Congress.  Task order contractors are providing technical support to the Office of Grants Management in review of project planning studies.  Areas of review are capital operating and maintenance costing, financial assessment, environmental impact assessment, and ridership forecasting.     Project Title:  Travel Behavioral Research      Grantee/Contractor:  Federal Highway Administration     Location:  Washington, D. C.     Funding:  $200,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Ronald Jensen-Fisher  Project Number:  VA-26-9014           Description:  Conformity requirements of the Clean Air Act and difficulties with past transit projections imply that significant improvements are needed in current model structures.  The objective of this study is to discover travel behavioral correlations which will result in improved travel demand model structures.  The determinants of travel behavior are being studied using data which has been collected from comprehensive travel behavioral surveys conducted recently.  The comprehensive nature of this survey allows for examination of many travel demand issues which have been unresolved due to limited data.    Project Title:  Travel Time Budgets      Grantee/Contractor:  Federal Highway Administration     Location:  Washington, D. C.     Funding:  $150,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Ronald Jensen-Fisher  Project Number:  VA-26-9015           Description:  In the 1970's, the theory was advanced that individuals have a travel time budget and a travel cost budget.  These budgets serve as limits to how much travel individuals are willing to do.  This project is examining available data to determine whether evidence exists to either support or refute this theory.  Information being examined includes panel surveys, recent home interview surveys, the National Personal Transportation Survey, and other sources.  Conclusions will be drawn on the validity of travel budgets and methods of incorporating budgets into the traditional travel forecasting process.  The Federal Highway Administration and Federal Transit Administration are jointly undertaking a major update of the travel forecasting process.  This project ties directly into that effort.  Establishing the travel time budget theory would directly improve the ability to forecast individual response to additional highway capacity, supporting the alternatives analysis process.  Further, the concept has implications for analysis of air quality.      Project Title:  Portland Intermodal Terminal Study      Grantee/Contractor:  Greater Portland Council of Governments.     Location:  Portland, Maine     Funding:  $65,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Judith A. Molloy  Project Number:  ME-26-0002           Description:  The City Manager has requested funding to develop an intermodal terminal for Portland.  The Federal Transit Administration recently awarded a project to the Maine Department of Transportation for a study of commuter rail from Boston to Portland which included selection of a station site from three potential sites in Portland.  This project is for preliminary design work for the station and includes layout, vehicular traffic access, intermodal connections, rail operations assessment, and integration with other existing and potential uses.     Project Title:  Orlando Intermodal Terminal Study      Grantee/Contractor:  Orange-Seminole-Osceola Transportation Authority     Location:  Orlando, Florida     Funding:  $400,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Brian A. Glenn  Project Number:  FL-26-0003           Description:  In 1988, Florida enacted the Maglev Demonstration Act which authorized the granting of a State franchise for private sector development of a demonstration of Maglev technology in Florida.  In June of 1991, the Governor and Florida Cabinet awarded a franchise for this demonstration to MAGLEV Transit, Inc.  MTI is an American company with considerable Japanese and German involvement.  The Bechtel Corporation will build the system.  A preliminary site selection study was completed and now a site planning study for the International Drive Station and support facilities is required.  The private developer has completed conceptual plans for this station, but these do not include capacity and interfaces with local transit, Orlando Airport, and intercity bus and rail services.  There is a need for the State, local governments, and the developer to complete preliminary design studies to accommodate all of these services.  The study will include plans for an interface with local transit providers and hotel shuttles, highway access and parking, and interface with amusement park transportation. The Orlando Airport is planning for the Maglev to enter the airport using AIP funds, and looks on the International Drive Station as an off-site airline.     Project Title:  Chicago Intermodal Terminal Study      Grantee/Contractor:  Illinois Department of Transportation.     Location:  Chicago, Illinois     Funding:  $160,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Carlos Peña  Project Number:  IL-26-0003           Description:  Chicago is a key hub in a midwest high speed rail network of lines linking St. Louis, Detroit, and Milwaukee.  These lines have been designated a high speed rail corridor under Section 1010 of Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act and show great promise for development.  A key element of this high speed rail system is linking downtown areas with the airports.  Routes to St. Louis, Detroit, and Milwaukee will link airports as well as city centers.  Chicago METRA and the city have been discussing the possibility of an intermodal terminal at O'Hare Airport which joins METRA and Amtrak service with local bus service and the airport people mover.  The airport has major ground access problems and is looking for an alternative bus marshaling site.  The terminal would be located on an airport satellite parking lot crossed by a rail line owned by the Wisconsin Central Railroad which, according to the DOT, is in favor of shared use of the line.  A site selection study was done by METRA and a preliminary design for a bus terminal has also been completed.  By combining public transportation providers and tour operators, the resulting enclosed multi-use facility will result which would provide a direct link between O'Hare and the entire midwest rail passenger network.     Project Title:  Milwaukee Intermodal Terminal Study      Grantee/Contractor:  Wisconsin Department of Transportation     Location:  Madison, Wisconsin     Funding:  $100,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Carlos Peña  Project Number:  WI-26-0001           Description:  Milwaukee to Chicago is on one of the high speed rail corridors selected under Section 1010 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act.  It is important that Milwaukee have a well designed, high capacity, downtown passenger terminal which combines public transit with intercity service providers.  The high speed rail line planned to Chicago could connect to General Mitchell Airport outside Milwaukee and would provide an important link in the midwest network and with O'Hare Airport.  This project is preparing a plan to develop an intermodal transportation center in the Milwaukee area with necessary facilities and connections to efficiently link inter- and intra-regional transportation modes serving the area.  Inter-regional modes to be served include existing Amtrak service, potential future high speed rail passenger service linking the Milwaukee and Chicago areas, commercial air passenger service, and intercity bus service operated by private carriers.  A consensus is being developed on the location and development of an intermodal transportation terminal and connections to efficiently link inter- and intra-regional travel modes in the greater Milwaukee area.  Currently, these facilities are located in individual terminals with no connectors.  The implementation of an intermodal transportation terminal after completion of this study is expected to significantly enhance the use of multimodal transportation in southwestern Wisconsin and lessen dependence on the private auto for travel.    Project Title:  Denver Intermodal Terminal Study      Grantee/Contractor:  Denver Regional Council of Governments     Location:  Denver, Colorado     Funding:  $93,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Donald D. Cover  Project Number:  CO-26-0002           Description:  Denver Mayor Webb has requested funding for further study of rail to both Stapleton Airport and the new International Airport from downtown Denver.  Because of its study of airport access improvement alternatives, the Federal Transit Administration has recommended a study with exclusive focus on an airport-CBD rail link.  The Federal Railroad Administration and FTA believe that a study element focusing on improved access to existing intercity rail and bus facilities should also be added to the proposed scope.  FTA and FRA are in agreement that a study of airport access alternatives should be included in the next phase of work.  The City of Denver has informally agreed to this.  The project is part of a draft unified plan work program voted on in November 1992.  The Denver Regional Council of Governments has informally agreed to provide funds to the City for the study.  This project is only for a planning study conditioned on inclusion of a study of airport access options.     Project Title:  Seattle Intermodal Terminal Study      Grantee/Contractor:  Washington State Department of Transportation     Location:  Olympia, Washington     Funding:  $150,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Rita M. Healy  Project Number:  WA-80-X003           Description:  Seattle is one of the high speed rail corridors selected under Section 1010 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act.  The corridor extends from Eugene, Oregon, through Portland and Seattle into Vancouver, British Columbia.  This is Phase II of a study for a downtown intermodal terminal at the southernmost station of Seattle's bus subway.  The impetus for this is growth of traffic and pollution problems.  The city recently completed a study of commuter rail service possibilities for the area and is discussing operating requirements and costs with Amtrak, Burlington Northern, Union Pacific, and others.  The city has also studied a high speed connector to SEATAC airport.  In January 1992, the Federal Railroad Administration gave $500,000 to the State toward a high speed rail feasibility in the Vancouver-Seattle-Portland area.  The funding requested for an intermodal terminal study would connect these rail systems with city transit, Greyhound Bus, tour operators, and other transportation providers at the Burlington Northern downtown station.      Project Title:  San Antonio Intermodal Terminal Study      Grantee/Contractor:  San Antonio-Bexar County Management Planning Organization     Location:  San Antonio, Texas     Funding:  $93,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Margaret J. Crist  Project Number:  TX-26-0008           Description:  The State of Texas submitted an application for a Section 1010 grant for the corridor between San Antonio and Monterrey, Mexico.  This corridor was not selected , but an application by the Metropolitan Planning Organization to study development of an intermodal terminal on San Antonio's east side has strong local, State, and private backing.  The MPO is planning a feasibility study for an intermodal terminal for downtown San Antonio near the current VIA local transit operator-owned rail station to result in a conceptual design for the project, capital and operating cost estimates, and a financial and implementation strategy.  The specific scope of work is being overseen by a public/private steering committee composed of representatives from Amtrak, Greyhound, Kerrville Bus Company of Texas, High Speed Rail, the San Antonio-Laredo-Monterrey operator, the Texas Department of Transportation, VIA Metropolitan Transit, the City of San Antonio, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Southern Pacific and Union Pacific Railroads.     Project Title:  Detroit Intermodal Terminal Study      Grantee/Contractor:  Michigan Department of Transportation     Location:  Lansing, Michigan     Funding:  $150,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Mary J. Campbell  Project Number:  MI-26-0004           Description:  Detroit is one of the high speed rail corridors selected under Section 1010 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act.  The City and State Departments of Transportation have completed a site selection study for an intermodal terminal and have determined it should be at New Center located at the junction of heavily traveled Woodward Avenue and a major rail corridor.  The terminal blends Amtrak, local/regional transit, intercity bus, taxi, airport shuttle, and highway travel modes together in one centralized connecting hub.  The center will also support anticipated new services, including regional rail, VIA Rail Canada, and planned high speed intercity rail operations and serve as an effective mechanism to interface literally all local, regional, and intercity transportation resources with major economic, social, educational, and commercial activities within the City of Detroit and throughout the southeast Michigan region. Funds have been requested for a planning and engineering design study.  This terminal has been designed to serve as a strategic transportation hub to facilitate not only expanded intermodal mobility benefits, but also contribute directly toward a variety of urban development opportunities within the Woodward Corridor area.  The center will link all existing and future rail passenger services directly to this area which is the most heavily traveled transit artery in the region.  This important new rail/transit link is further complemented by intermodal links with airport shuttle service to Detroit Metropolitan and Detroit City Airports and with intercity bus, taxi, and highway services.       Project Title:  Review of Local Planning Processes and Products Staff Support      Grantee/Contractor:  Volpe National Transportation Systems Center     Location:  Cambridge, Massachusetts     Funding:  $150,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Deborah Burns  Project Number:  MA-08-9030           Description:  The number of ongoing urban transportation planning efforts is far in excess of the ability of the Federal Transit Administration to provide technical and administrative oversight in a timely fashion.  Without this oversight, FTA cannot satisfactorily manage the Section 8 planning program to assure compliance with Federal statutes and regulations.  Therefore,  ongoing support for FTA Headquarters and Regional staff in their review of local planning processes and the products derived from them is being provided by the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center.  The Clean Air and Americans with Disabilities Acts focused new attention on transportation improvement programs as well as adopted long range and State implementation plans developed as part of the ongoing transportation planning process.  There is also a need for review of ongoing efforts for compliance with joint Federal Transit Administration/Federal Highway Administration metropolitan planning regulations.      Project Title:  Evaluation of Construction Projects      Grantee/Contractor:  FAI, Inc.     Location:  McLean, Virginia     Funding:  $117,091  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Salvator S. Caruso  Project Number:  VA-26-7003           Description:  Cost overruns typically experienced on major transit capital projects suggest that transit agencies may be using weak contracts.  A study of 13 fixed guideway projects indicates that capital cost variances for these projects range from 26 to 150 percent.  Change orders and claims were major contributing factors.  Several Federal Transit Administration project management oversight contractors indicated that improved contracts may reduce the amount of capital cost variance.  Consistent with the National Transportation Policy and the FTA Strategic Plan, this project is evaluating contracts used by transit agencies for design and construction of capital projects, including new fixed guideway systems and maintenance facilities.  Based on these evaluations, the contractor will make recommendations for elimination of ambiguities and contradictory language in contracts to better define responsibilities and provide more effective incentives to control change orders and avoid claims.  This project will improve productivity and reduce cost of transit construction projects.

GX234-05-9814982	June 13, 1997   For more information contact:  Samil Sermet, 515-237-3309      DOT HONORS TOP IOWA TRANSIT AGENCIES       AMES, IOWA -  Transit systems from Ames and Davenport have been honored by the Iowa Department of Transportation for their accomplishments during the 1996 fiscal year, which ended June 30, 1996.    The Ames Transit Agency (CyRide) won the Transit System of the Year award for urban systems.  For regional systems, the award went to Great River Bend Services Inc. of Davenport.  The awards were based on a combination of ridership increases and decreases in the cost per ride.    Ames Transit Agency, headed by Robert Bourne, director of transportation, posted an 11.6 percent gain in ridership while decreasing the cost per ride 6.3 percent during fiscal year 1996.  Increased marketing, increased ridership on the Iowa State University campus, and containment of operating costs helped the system become the most improved urban transit system.    Ridership on the Great River Bend Services Inc. system increased 13.0 percent while the cost per ride dropped 8.2 percent.  This earned them the Transit System of the Year Award for regional systems.  Ermadel Ludwick, executive director of the system, attributed the 1996 gains to a new contract with the Davenport school system, and to significant increases in ridership in several existing contracts, combined with reduced maintenance and administrative costs.     The awards were announced June 12 at the Iowa Public Transit Conference in Ottumwa.  The conference is a training conference sponsored jointly by the Iowa Public Transit Association and the Iowa DOT.    At the conference, Roger Anderberg, director of the DOT's Office of Local Systems, also recognized other transit agencies which had made improvements.  These included the regional transit systems in Creston (Area XIV Agency on Aging, Southern Iowa Trolley), Ottumwa (Ten-Fifteen Regional Transit Agency), and Sioux City (Siouxland Regional Transit System); and the urban transit systems in Muscatine (City Transit System/MuscaBus), Council Bluffs (City of Council Bluffs), and Marshalltown (Marshalltown Municipal Transit).    There are 16 regional and 19 urban transit systems in Iowa.    #

It is a conception           of the future, proposing the direction for transit in Florida into the           21st Century.                                      Developed           by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) in collaboration           with state and local government agencies, transit providers, community           leaders and the general public,  Transit 2020            articulates a common vision of the future of public transit in           Florida's urban areas.                                                  As the           transit element of the  Florida Transportation Plan ,            Transit 2020  will help provide the policy           framework that links Florida's transportation goals and objectives           with FDOT's annual budget and 5-year work program.                                                  The           primary purpose of  Transit 2020  is to support           the development of a transit system that provides Floridians and           visitors with an effective, efficient and customer-friendly transit           service in a transit-friendly environment. The plan reexamines the           role of transit in the context of a changing transportation           environment. Through an analysis of the strengths, weakness,           opportunities and threats to Florida's transit industry, it defines           the industry's emerging core values, mission and vision.                                                  It           should be noted that because the Florida Commission for the           Transportation Disadvantaged (CTD) is primarily responsible for           paratransit planning in Florida, the scope of  Transit 2020             is limited to those services provided by Florida's 20 fixed-route           urban transit systems.                                                  This           document summarizes the key issues, goals, objectives, strategies and           tasks developed with information gathered over the past 18 months from           members of District and Statewide Transit Strategic Plan Advisory           Committees, stakeholder interviews, focus groups, a statewide transit           survey, FDOT staff, research and analysis by the project team, and           comments from the general public. It also includes a summary           implementation program and guiding principles for  Transit           2020 .                                                                                                    The three key issue areas are: transit service,           funding and planning/policy. For each issue, a goal and a set of           objectives, strategies and tasks have been identified to set the           priority direction for transit in Florida as we move into the 21st           Century. Context           and Vision                                      Florida's exceptional natural           environment and strong economic growth continue to make it a very           attractive place to live and work and one of the world's leaders in           tourism. Between 1990 and 1997, Florida's population grew by about 14           percent to 14.7 million, making it the fourth most populous state in           the nation. This rapid growth and development has placed tremendous           pressures on Florida's transportation system. Heavy volumes of traffic           in most of the state's urbanized areas have created excessive           congestion. Increasing suburbanization of population and employment           has resulted in greater automobile use. Given the continuing dispersal           of jobs and residents, roadway congestion is likely to worsen. In some           metropolitan areas, transportation systems are expected to become           increasingly saturated, even with implementation of roadway           improvements defined in current long-range transportation plans.                                                                                                   In view of the above trends in           Florida's growth and development, members of the Transit Strategic           Plan Advisory Committee recognized that land use patterns have great           implications for transit effectiveness and resoundingly approved the           following vision for transit in Florida:                                                                                                                                                   Excessive                 congestion created by heavy volumes of traffic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Florida's Choice:            User-friendly transit and transit-friendly development             It is a vision of a Florida in which transportation and land           use planning are coordinated; customer-oriented transit services           provide seamless intermodal travel; and residents and visitors view           transit as a realistic and viable alternative to the personal           automobile. Above all, it is a vision of the quality of life in           Florida.                                                 Goal 1:                         Transit Service                                     Implement a transit system that improves and expands           travel choices for Floridians and visitors.                                                 Issue:                                                  The level of transit service for most Floridians is inadequate and will           worsen given current trends.                                        Background:                                                  Existing           levels of transit service make it unattractive as an alternative           travel mode for most Floridians except for those who do not have other           means of travel. Existing transit services can fairly be characterized           as marginal due to limited service hours, infrequent service, and lack           of service to many employment centers, commerce, education and           recreation, particularly in the suburbs. The average transit headway           in Florida is one hour and the average daily span of service is 13           hours. Florida's revenue miles per square mile (a measure of service           supply) is 23 percent lower than the national average.                                                  The Department is committed to expanding travel choices for           Floridians and visitors.    Transportation           needs into the 21st Century cannot be met with highways alone.           Improved public transportation is crucial to expanding travel choices.                                                                           Objective 1.1:                           Improved Core Service                                     Achieve the quantity and quality of local transit (core) service           sufficient to increase transit ridership in Florida at twice the           average rate of population growth through 2020.

Issue:                                                 Current           transit funding levels are inadequate to fund existing as well as           expanded capital, maintenance and operating programs; several funding           sources lack stability and flexibility.                                        Background:                                                 Existing transit funding levels           from all sources are inadequate. A recent study by the University of           South Florida indicated a shortfall of $9 billion (over 20 years) in           12 of the 25 local long-range plans. The remaining long-range plans           did not distinguish shortfalls between modes. Existing funding streams           may not be sufficient to maintain current service. As discussed           earlier, current service is far short of what is needed. Existing           funding levels are not sufficient to provide expanded capital,           maintenance, and operating programs that will be required to improve           overall service quantity and quality.                                                  In addition to the general insufficiency, some existing           funding sources lack stability and flexibility. The lack of stability           makes it difficult for transit agencies to plan service, even in the           short run.                                                                                                                Objective 2.1:                           Adequate Funding                                     Achieve           adequate and stable funding levels to meet transit needs for service           preservation, operating and capital expansion, and technological           innovation.

Background:                                                 Transit performance is ultimately           affected by a number of planning and policy related factors including           land use, institutional practices and public perception. Current land           use and urban design patterns characterized by sprawling low density           developments are not conducive to efficient transit operations. To           improve its performance, transit needs to be better integrated into           the transportation and land use planning process. The institutional           roles and responsibilities of Florida's major transit partners are           sometimes fuzzy and overlapping, creating the potential for           ""passing the buck"" and duplication of effort. Furthermore,           poor coordination among transit partners results in a dissipation of           effort and lack of clear and coherent public communication on the           benefits of transit to the community. As a result, the public is often           unaware of available transit services and the potential benefits of           transit. Lacking information on transit and its benefits, the public           withholds its political support for transit.                                          The success of transit in Florida ultimately requires the           coordinated effort of all levels of government working with the public           to promote transit as a public good.                                                                                                  ""The problems we face today cannot                 be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we                 created them""                                                                                                                                                                                           - Albert Einstein                                                                                               Objective 3.1:                           Transit-Oriented Development                                     Promote           land use planning and urban design practices that facilitate transit           service and access.

There is no doubt that the overall quality and content of  Transit           2020  has been greatly enhanced by the diligent and           dedicated participation of these Floridians in the public meetings,           stakeholder interviews, focus groups and survey. The very effective           citizen participation in the development of  Transit 2020             makes it truly a transit plan for Florida by Floridians.                                                  We           extend special thanks to the men and women who guided the development           of the plan through their service on the District and Statewide           Advisory Committees.

Davenport CitiBus won the award for the most improved urban transit system of the year.  The award for regional systems went to 10-15 Regional Transit Agency of Ottumwa.  The awards were based on a combination of ridership increases and decreases in the cost per ride.     Davenport CitiBus posted a 7.1 percent gain in ridership, which helped reduce the cost per ride by 5.4 percent during fiscal year 1998.  CitiBus is operated under contract by Rock Island County Metropolitan Mass Transit District, headed by Jeff Nelson.  Byron Baxter, director of transportation with the City of Davenport, attributed the 1998 gain to an extension of one route to new business developments on the east side, and to the stability of existing routes and fares.     Ridership on the Ottumwa based 10-15 Transit increased 13.9 percent, while the cost per ride dropped 3.8 percent.  Pam Ward, transit administrator for both the 10-15 Regional Transit Agency and the Ottumwa Transit Authority, explained that a significant portion of the increase occurred in three communities that hosted the Register's Annual Great Bike Ride Across Iowa.  Shuttle service between campgrounds and local attractions for RAGBRAI visitors was provided by 10-15 Transit.  This was the third ""System of the Year"" award for 10-15 Transit, and the second award since Ward has been the administrator. The awards were announced June 10 at the Iowa Public Transit Conference in Fort Dodge.  The conference is sponsored jointly by the Iowa Public Transit Association and the Iowa DOT.     At the conference, Thomas Parham, deputy director of the DOT's Office of Local Systems, also recognized other transit agencies that had made improvements.  These included the regional transit systems in Mason City (North Iowa Area Regional Transit System), Creston (Area XIV Agency on Aging, Southern Iowa Trolley), and Davenport (Great River Bend Services, Inc.); and the urban transit system in Mason City.     There are 16 regional and 19 urban transit systems in Iowa.    #"
GX233-63-11071625	June 23, 1998   For more information contact:  Samil Sermet, 515-237-3309   BURLINGTON, DECORAH TOP TRANSIT AGENCIES FOR 1997    AMES, IOWA - Transit systems from Burlington and Decorah have been honored by the Iowa Department of Transportation for their accomplishments during the 1997 fiscal year which ended June 30, 1997.    Burlington Urban Service (BUS) won the award for the most improved urban transit system of the year.  The award for regional systems went to Northeast Regional Transit System (NERTS) of Decorah.  The awards were based on a combination of ridership increases and decreases in the cost per ride.    Burlington Urban Service, headed by Larry Gantz, posted a 4.8 percent gain in ridership, which helped reduce the cost per ride by 15.3 percent during fiscal year 1997.  New bus purchases improved rider satisfaction and reduced road calls/breakdowns.  These factors and local cost-containment measures helped the staff at BUS make service improvements.    Ridership on the Decorah based NERTS, managed by Northeast Iowa Community Action Inc., increased 13.5 percent during fiscal year 1997.  Marian Peter, NERTS manager, attributed improved ridership to    coordination efforts that focused on meeting local service needs under innovative contracting arrangements that entailed shared use of state and federal funding.  A significant portion of the NERTS ridership increase during 1997 occurred in three communities that hosted the Register's Annual Great Bike Ride Across Iowa.  NERTS provided shuttle services for RAGBRAI visitors between campgrounds and local attractions.  NERTS drivers also attribute much of the 13.6 percent improvement in cost per ride to the more flexible passenger seating of the new vehicles, which improved dispatching efficiency.    The awards were announced June 18 at the Iowa Public Transit Conference in Iowa City.  The conference is sponsored jointly by the Iowa Public Transit Association and the Iowa DOT.    At the conference, Larry Jesse, director of the DOT's Office of Local Systems, also recognized other transit agencies that had made improvements.  These included the regional transit systems in Mason City (North Iowa Area Regional Transit System), Waterloo (Iowa Northland Regional Transit Commission), and Cedar Rapids (East Central Iowa Transit); and the urban transit system in Mason City.    There are 16 regional and 19 urban transit systems in Iowa.    #

City Transit System/MuscaBus of Muscatine won the award for the most improved urban transit system of the year.  The award for regional transit systems went to Northeast Regional Transit System of Decorah.  The awards are based on a combination of ridership increases and decreases in the cost per ride.   MuscaBus, which was headed by Kathy Meier, posted an 8.9 percent gain in ridership that helped reduce the cost per ride by 2.4 percent during fiscal year 1999.  Increased service to the elderly and persons with disabilities, as well as to students and plant workers, helped the system make these improvements.  This is the second ""System of the Year"" award for MuscaBus, which is currently managed by Karen Wilcox.   Ridership on the Decorah-based Northeast Regional Transit System, which is managed by Northeast Iowa Community Action Corp., increased 19.9 percent while the cost per ride dropped 18.2 percent.  Earl Henry, manager for NRTS attributed the 1999 gains to better coordination efforts that resulted in significant increases in ridership in several existing contracts, coupled with reduced maintenance and administrative costs.  This is also the second ""System of the Year"" award for NRTS.   The awards were announced June 15 at the Iowa Public Transit Conference in Dubuque.  The conference is sponsored jointly by the Iowa Public Transit Association and the Iowa DOT.   At the conference, DOT officials recognized other transit agencies that had also made improvements.

Transit-oriented            development is a planning concept that seeks to use mass transit stations            as building blocks for economic revitalization and environmental improvement.            In September 1999, groundbreaking took place on a $100 million mixed-use            development adjacent to the Fruitvale Bay Area Rapid Transit District            (BART) station in Oakland, California. Fruitvale, one of Oakland's seven            community districts, is a low-income, predominantly minority community            experiencing economic stress. This case study focuses on the incorporation            of environmental justice principles into the planning and design of            the Fruitvale Transit Village.                   The            Fruitvale Transit Village is the brainchild of the Unity Council, a            community development corporation formed in 1964 by activists who wanted            to create a forum for working on issues important to Fruitvale's Latino            community. The origins of the project date back to 1991, when BART announced            plans to construct a multi-layered parking facility next to the Fruitvale            station. Although the community agreed that new parking            was necessary, the design and location of the facility did not sit well            with Fruitvale residents and business owners. Members of the community            were concerned that the proposed structure would increase traffic and            pollution and further separate the Fruitvale neighborhood from the BART            station. The Unity Council galvanized neighborhood opposition to the            parking structure design and location, arguing that any development            around the BART station should be guided by a broad-based community            planning process.                   Faced            with this strong community opposition, BART withdrew its proposal and            agreed to work with the Unity Council on a plan for the area. During            the next several years, the Unity Council engaged local stakeholders            in a comprehensive visioning and planning process that laid out the            parameters of the Fruitvale Transit Village. Plans for the Transit Village            include a mixture of housing, shops, offices, a library, a child care            facility, a pedestrian plaza, and other community services all surrounding            the BART station. The project is expected to reduce traffic and pollution            in and around Fruitvale because community residents will have access            to a range of goods and services within easy walking distance of the            transit station.                   The            Fruitvale Transit Village project illustrates a number of key themes            and effective practices that are central to incorporating the principles            of environmental justice into transportation planning and design. First,            it demonstrates an effective use of partnerships to generate funding            and other resources necessary to plan and implement a costly and complex            project. The Unity Council's            success in building relationships with a wide range of key players helped            overcome the formidable legal, regulatory, and financial hurdles the            project initially faced.                   In            addition, the project illustrates a strong commitment to public involvement            by the lead agencies involved. Typically, either city officials or private            developers represent the driving force behind large-scale development            projects such as this. Under the best of circumstances, community residents            are usually in the position of responding to plans that are initiated            by others. In this case, however, the Unity Council's leadership role            in the project helped ensure that the community's            own vision for the transit station and its surrounding area served as            guiding principles for the planning and design process.                   Finally,            the planning effort behind the Fruitvale Transit Village represents            an innovative strategy for using mass transit as a lever for revitalizing            an urban community. While transit-oriented development has been successful            in a growing number of affluent suburban locations, the Fruitvale Transit            Village sets a precedent for such projects in lower-income, inner-city            communities.                                                      ""Transportation            planning should be about more than concrete and steel. It should be            about building communities and we are all looking to Fruitvale as an            example of how that can happen.""                             -- Rodney Slater            U.S. Secretary of Transportation, Fruitvale BART Station,             Formal Launch of the Fruitvale Transit Village, July 9, 1999                                                                                                                   What                  is Transit-Oriented Development?                               Transit-Oriented                  Development (TOD) is a simple concept: moderate and high density                  housing, along with complementing public uses, jobs, retail and                  services, are concentrated in mixed-use developments located at                  strategic points along the regional transit system. Each TOD has                  a centrally located transit stop and core commercial area; accompanying                  residential and/or employment uses are within an average 2,000                  feet walking distance. The location, design, configuration, and                  mix of uses in a TOD provides an alternative to current suburban                  development trends by emphasizing a pedestrian-oriented environment                  and reinforcing the use of public transportation.                               This                  linkage between land use and transit is designed to result in                  an efficient pattern of development that supports the transit                  system and makes significant progress in reducing sprawl, traffic                  congestion, and air pollution. The TOD's mixed-use clustering                  of land uses within a pedestrian-friendly area connected to transit                  provides for growth with a minimum of environmental and social                  costs.

The            Region and the Community         Oakland            is situated on the eastern shore of the San Francisco Bay. With a population            of 395,000, Oakland is California's sixth largest city. A thriving port,            an international airport, and major transit facilities have made Oakland            the major hub for commerce, transportation, and international trade            in the Bay Area.                   Oakland            is a diverse community. African Americans and whites are the largest            racial/ethnic groups, with 43 percent and 28 percent of the city's population,            respectively. The other major groups are Asian Americans and Hispanics.            Seventy-two percent of Oakland's population consists of minorities.            Oakland's Fruitvale neighborhood, by contrast, is over 90 percent minority,            with Hispanics, Asians, and African Americans representing the neighborhood's            largest population groups.                   Fruitvale            earned its name in the 1800s when German settlers immigrated to the            area to plant fruit orchards. The            community developed a significant manufacturing base anchored by canneries            that served local orchards. Fruitvale became a prosperous neighborhood,            its vibrant business activity earning it a reputation as Oakland's ""second            downtown."" This boom continued through World War II, when the area            experienced an influx of war industry workers, bringing the first significant            numbers of African-American and Hispanic residents to the community.                              Fruitvale's            troubles began during the 1950s, when the construction of new freeways            created opportunities for manufacturers to take advantage of cheap land            and labor in suburban areas. Canneries and factories located in Fruitvale            began leaving the area, accompanied by many of the community's white,            middle-class residents. With the erosion of its customer base, the Fruitvale            business district went into decline. By the 1960s, Fruitvale had become            a distressed neighborhood, plagued by joblessness, inadequate housing,            and other problems characteristic of low-income, inner-city communities.                              In            spite of all this, Fruitvale retained a number of significant assets            that represent potential building blocks for community revitalization.            One such asset was the neighborhood's strong network of community-based            organizations, including the Unity Council. Founded in 1964 by Arabella            Martinez, Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health,                   Education            and Welfare under the Jimmy Carter administration, the Unity Council            developed a solid record of success in bringing together residents,            community-based organizations, and businesses to deliver important community            projects. The Unity Council's programs include the development and management            of affordable housing, business assistance, historic preservation, facade            improvements, community festivals, home ownership assistance, job readiness            and employment services, Head Start and Early Head Start child development            programs, the Fruitvale Senior Center, open space development, and environmental            programs.                   The Fruitvale BART Transit    Village is the outgrowth of a growing interest on the part of the Unity Council    in developing a project that would have a large impact on the community of Fruitvale.    According to Arabella Martinez, ""We felt we needed a project of scale,    that a single housing project wasn't going to change the neighborhood.""    The Fruitvale Transit Village presented such an opportunity.

What                  Happened                              When                  BART announced plans in June 1991 to construct a multi-level parking                  facility adjacent to the Fruitvale BART station, the community's                  response was less than enthusiastic. As it was, the area around                  the station was increasingly distressed. The station's crime rate                  was the second highest in the entire BART system. At a public                  meeting organized by BART to present its proposal, community residents                  and business owners complained that the proposed new facility                  would worsen crime and blight, exacerbate existing air quality                  and traffic problems, and cut off pedestrian access from the station                  to the downtown business district.                               The          Unity Council led the opposition to BART's plans. When it became obvious          that the project did not have the support of the Fruitvale community,          BART withdrew its proposal and agreed to work with community leaders on          an alternative plan for the area.                The          vocal and sometimes contentious meetings between BART and community representatives          that followed helped give birth to the idea for the Fruitvale Transit          Village.

In February 1992,                  the City of Oakland awarded the Unity Council $185,000 in Community                  Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds to initiate a community planning                  process for revitalizing the area around the Fruitvale BART station.                  That year, the Unity Council held a series of workshops bringing                  together different stakeholder groups from around the community.                                                Impressed                  with the Unity Council's community involvement strategy and ongoing                  progress, the U.S. DOT awarded the agency a $470,000 FTA planning                  grant for the Fruitvale Transit Village in April 1993. The Unity                  Council used the money to conduct a series of community workshops                  and carry out economic, traffic, and engineering studies about                  the immediate station area.                                                       In            May 1993, the Unity Council partnered with the University of California            at Berkeley's National Transit Access Center (UC NTRAC) to sponsor a            community design symposium at which architects translated ideas of participants            into a plan for the station area. One of the main themes articulated            by participants was the need            for revitalization of existing neighborhood businesses and a plan to            better integrate businesses into transit station development. Some 60            people, including Oakland Mayor Elihu Harris and Oakland BART Director            Margaret Pryor, attended the event. This was followed by a series of            community planning meetings to further develop the plan.                   As            the scale of the Transit Village project continued to grow by leaps            and bounds, the project's three central players decided to formalize            their relationship. In 1994, the Unity Council, BART, and the City of            Oakland signed a Memorandum of Understanding establishing the   Fruitvale            Policy Committee   to guide further planning and development activities            at the station. The Policy Committee was a very different approach to            project development for BART and one of several ways that BART exhibited            flexibility and innovation during the planning and design phase of the            project. The Policy Committee members included two representatives from            the Unity Council, one representative from BART, the Mayor of Oakland,            and the city council member representing the Fruitvale district.                                                                     Meanwhile,                  the Unity Council continued to engage in intensive community planning                  efforts for the Fruitvale BART station area. In the spring and                  summer of 1995, the Council organized a series of community site                  planning workshops to help stakeholders reach a consensus on a                  conceptual site plan. At the first workshop, participants were                  asked to identify both positive and negative qualities of the                  Fruitvale community and to indicate their development preferences                  for the Transit Village. Participants identified crime, lack of                  retail businesses and community services, the area's negative                  image, and the lack of connection between the BART station and                  the community as issues of concern. Positive qualities cited included                  the area's diversity and strong tradition of community involvement.                  This workshop attracted about 30 people.                                                Participants at the second workshop were asked to develop more                  specific goals for the Transit Village. Some                  of the goals identified included job creation, improved public                  safety near the BART station, increased availability of retail                  goods and services in the community, provision of high-quality                  affordable housing, and better local air quality. This workshop,                  attended by nearly 50 individuals, also featured a walking tour                  of the site.                                                                                         The                  9-acre BART parking lot will become the site of the Fruitvale                  Transit Village.                                                       At            the third and final workshop, participants were asked to provide feedback            on two alternative land-use plans prepared by the project design team.            Once consensus had been reached on a site plan, the Unity Council initiated            the technical phase of the project, conducting a final traffic study            and financial feasibility studies.                   By            this time, the project components of the Fruitvale Transit Village were            more or less settled. The Village would be located on the existing BART            parking lot, a nine-acre site adjacent to the station. The centerpiece            of the project would be an elegant, tree-lined pedestrian plaza connecting            the BART station entrance with the 12 th  Street business district            one block away. The plaza would be lined with restaurants and shops            and serve as a venue for neighborhood festivals and concerts. The surrounding            area would include a mixture of retail development, housing, and social            service agencies, all easily accessible by foot from the BART station.                                                                                Project                  Chronology                               1991           BART announces          plans to build a multi-level parking facility at the Fruitvale rapid transit          station. The Fruitvale community opposes the project.                               February 1992                    The Unity Council          receives $185,000 in Community Development Block Grant funds to develop          an alternative plan for the station.                               April 1993           The Unity          Council is awarded a $470,000 Federal Transit Administration (FTA) planning          grant.                May 1993            The National          Transit Access Center at UC Berkeley and the Unity Council hold a community          design symposium.                July 1994            The Unity          Council, BART, and City of Oakland sign a Memorandum of Understanding          to form the Fruitvale Policy Committee.                Spring/Summer          1995            The Unity          Council holds a series of community site planning meetings.                1996            The City of          Oakland passes a zoning ordinance capping parking space construction in          the Transit Village area.                1997            The Unity          Council creates the Fruitvale Development Corporation (FDC).                1998            The Unity          Council gains control of the Village site through a land swap with BART.                         September 1999                     BART receives          $7.3 million from the FTA to build replacement parking near the Fruitvale          station.                September 1999                     Groundbreaking          for construction of the Fruitvale Transit Village project takes place.                                                                           Architects            translated the ideas from community workshops into a plan for the station            area.                   Overcoming            Barriers.  In 1996, the Unity Council established a nonprofit subsidiary corporation            called the Fruitvale Development Corporation (FDC) to serve as the developer            for the Transit Village and manage contracts. Normally, BART uses a            competitive bidding process to identify developers for projects on BART            properties. However, BART policy allows the agency to                   award            sole-source development rights if such an arrangement is deemed to be            in the best interests of the District. Given the Unity Council's stature            in the Fruitvale community, its success in raising funds for the project,            and BART's participation in the Fruitvale Policy Committee, the BART            Board of Directors acted positively on a staff recommendation to award            the Unity Council an exclusive negotiating agreement for the project.                              By            the mid-1990s, considerable progress had been made on the planning and            design of the Transit Village, yet the project still faced a number            of significant hurdles. Chief among these was the issue of ""land            assembly,"" that is, the need to assemble all parcels of land within            the development site under single ownership. BART still owned much of            the development site and, due to a long-standing policy requiring the            agency to retain ownership of land around transit stations for effective            long-term planning, it could not easily part with the property. The            challenge for the Unity Council was to persuade BART to make an exception            to this policy and accept a fair market price for the property.                                            Transit            Village streetscapes are designed to maximize pedestrian comfort, safety,            and access to local businesses.                   Here            once again, BART exhibited considerable flexibility. The land assembly            problem was addressed in 1998 through a complicated ""land swap""            orchestrated by the Fruitvale Policy Committee, which awarded the FDC            a 96-year lease on the property. In return, BART received a parcel behind            the transit station owned by the Unity Council and several nearby vacant            parcels owned by the City of Oakland, enabling BART to maintain the            existing value of its land holdings in the area. The land swap gave            the FDC and the Unity Council proprietary rights to the entire development            site without reducing the value of BART's land assets near the transit            station.                                                                                                  The                Transit Village plaza will serve as a venue for neighborhood festivals                and concerts.                                                A                  second hurdle was posed by the issue of BART parking capacity                  at the station. BART policy required that every parking spot removed                  for a project be replaced elsewhere. According to Unity Council                  Chief Executive Officer Arabella Martinez, ""the parking was                  a critical issue."" Ultimately, the Unity Council helped negotiate                  an agreement allowing BART to construct a parking garage on property                  owned by Union Pacific Railroad west of the station, replacing                  about 500 lost spaces. In addition, the Unity Council helped BART                  secure a $7.3 million grant from the FTA to construct the new                  facility.                               Finally,                  in order to maintain the pedestrian-oriented character of the                  Transit Village site and to support community preferences for                  less traffic congestion and better air quality, the Unity Council                  petitioned the City of Oakland for a zoning ordinance that would                  ban construction of any additional parking spaces within the area                  around the Transit Village. The City passed the ordinance in 1996.                  In addition, the City agreed to abandon half of the East 12th                  Street right-of-way along the southwest border of the Transit                  Village and narrow the street to one lane.                                                       During            the next several years, the Unity Council and its partners were able            to secure two more significant federal grants to financially anchor            the project. In 1999, BART received $780,000 from the FTA in flexible            funds transferred from the FHWA to construct the pedestrian plaza portion            of the Transit Village. BART was also awarded a $2.3 million grant through            the FTA's  Livable Communities Initiative , which uses sustainable            design concepts such as transit-oriented development to strengthen linkages            between transportation services and communities. This grant provided            funding for construction of the project's child care center, which will            be developed by the Unity Council.                   FDC            architects finished the comprehensive plan for the Fruitvale Transit            Village in 1999, and groundbreaking for the project took place later            that year. To date, FDC has secured over $82 million of public and private            financing for the $100 million venture.                                                                                                                                         Components                        of the Fruitvale Transit Village                                                                                               45,000 ft 2  Retail/Restaurant Use                                                                         54,000 ft 2  Nonprofit Health-Care Clinic                                                                         55,000 ft 2  Child Care Facility                                                                         15,000 ft 2  Library                                                                         45,000 ft 2  Executive Offices                                                                         68 Units of HUD Housing                                                                         220 Units of Mixed-Income Housing                                                                         2 Parking Garages for 1,500 Cars                                                                                                                                        Effective                  Environmental Justice Practices                                                The                  Fruitvale Transit Village represents an innovative strategy for                  using public transit to stimulate community development and achieve                  environmental improvements in a low-income, minority neighborhood.                  The project illustrates a number of effective practices for incorporating                  environmental justice principles into project planning and design:                                                Effective                  Partnerships.  All major development projects face certain legal, regulatory, and financial                  hurdles. However, such obstacles tend to be more pronounced in                  built up urban areas, particularly in less prosperous inner-city                  neighborhoods.                                                                                     Difficulties with land assembly, potential for environmental contamination,                and negative perceptions of such areas on the part of private investors                are just some of the obstacles that development projects in lower-income                central city neighborhoods may face. The Unity Council's success                in negotiating the Fruitvale Transit                Village through a formidable series of hurdles is                due, in large part, to the effective partnership that it entered                into with BART and the City of Oakland, institutionalized with the                establishment of the Fruitvale Policy Committee in 1994. Importantly,                both BART and the City of Oakland stood to gain from their participation                in the project. The City of Oakland anticipated rising property                tax revenues and other benefits associated with new investment activity                in a formerly distressed area, such as job creation and reduction                of crime. BART expected the new development would add from 300 to                600 new daily riders at its Fruitvale station.                                                                           The                  plan for the station area incorporates the community's desire                  for a better connection between the community and the transit                  station.                                                        9                  The            Transit Village will feature a mix of uses - including child care and            other community services, retail, and housing - within easy walking            distance of the BART station.                   Flexibility            and Innovation by Project Partners.  Project            partners acted in creative and sometimes unorthodox ways to overcome            key barriers. BART entered into an exclusive negotiating agreement with            the Unity Council, agreed to a land swap and relocation of its parking            facilities at the Fruitvale station, and worked collaboratively  with             a community on a project initiated  by  the community. The City            of Oakland capped parking in the Transit Village and relinquished a            portion of its right-of-way on East 12 th  Street. The Unity            Council provided the vision for the project, demonstrated effective            leadership, and helped to orchestrate the necessary public support.                              Use            of Creative Financing.  The Unity Council and its partners tapped diverse sources of public and            private funds. For example, a housing complex for seniors is being funded            through a combination of grants, loans, and land and equity capital            from seven different entities, including private banks, the City of            Oakland, a federal housing program, and the Unity Council. Project partners            worked effectively to overcome constraints on the use of certain funds.            For instance, since the Unity Council was not an eligible recipient            of FTA grant funds for construction of the project's child care center,            BART agreed to accept the funds and allocate them to the Unity Council.                              Effective            Public Involvement.   It is noteworthy            that the Fruitvale Transit Village began as a proposal for nothing more            than a simple parking facility, an idea opposed by the community. Without            the strong and sustained public involvement effort that followed BART's            proposal, that would have been the end of the story. The Fruitvale Transit            Village is an unusual development project in the sense that a community-based            organization - the Unity Council - eventually served as the lead agency            and developer for the project. The planning process led by the Unity            Council            featured creative public involvement strategies such as community site            planning meetings, workshops, and a community design symposium. This            process helped to articulate a broad set of concerns focused around            traffic congestion, air pollution, and the need for neighborhood revitalization.            Once such concerns were effectively incorporated into the planning process,            the project moved forward with enthusiastic community support.                   Use            of Transportation Assets as a Community Building Tool.             The Fruitvale Transit Village is based on the proposition that public            transit facilities can be used to stimulate economic development and            promote environmental improvement in a low-income, urban community.            Transit-oriented development, a planning concept that has been used            successfully in various suburban locations, is largely untested in the            inner city. Since central city neighborhoods are often better served            by mass transit than suburban areas, the Fruitvale Transit Village may            hold valuable lessons about the potential for using mass transit as            a tool for the revitalization of low- and moderate-income inner-city            communities.                   Challenges            Ahead                   The            planning and design phase of the Fruitvale Transit Village featured            strong community participation, effective leadership by the Unity Council,            and a willingness on the part of BART authorities to participate in            a community-based planning process. As the project moves into the construction            phase and beyond, a number of key challenges lie ahead:                                                                  The concept of the ""transit village"" should serve as a                guiding principle for future planning and development within the                project area. The investment of substantial amounts of public and                private funds in the immediate vicinity of the Fruitvale BART station                will no doubt spark interest in the area on the part of private                developers, many of whom will have no particular                interest in or commitment to environmental justice, transit-oriented                development, or other project goals. Unless the City of Oakland                continues to work closely with BART and Fruitvale community leaders                to manage future development in the area in accordance with the                transit village concept and the community plan for the area, the                original focus of the project may be lost.                                                                    The Fruitvale Transit Village could become the victim of its own                success if redevelopment activity drives up property values and                property taxes in the surrounding area to the point that existing                residents and businesses are forced out of the community. City officials                and community leaders should be on the lookout for signs of gentrification                and be prepared to work together on a plan to minimize displacement                in the event such steps become necessary. Possible actions include                the capping of property tax increases for long-term residents and                businesses in the area.                                                                    The Fruitvale Transit Village could become a model for additional                transit-oriented development projects serving low-income, minority                communities located along the BART system. Whether or not this occurs                depends to a large extent on the commitment of BART and Bay Area                city officials to pursue such opportunities and the presence of                committed and effective community-based organizations like the Unity                Council in neighborhoods where such projects are viable and appropriate.                                                                                                                         The                planning process for the Fruitvale Transit Village included creative                public involvement strategies such as community site planning meetings,                workshops, and a design symposium.                                                                                                   ""The                  collaboration between the Unity Council, BART, and the City of                  Oakland was the key to the success of this project.""                                    -- Patricia Hirota Cohen                  Senior Real Estate Officer, BART                                                                                                            Lessons            Learned                                                                 Community-based organizations are typically well positioned to identify                community preferences, needs, and concerns. They are often better                equipped than government agencies to determine whether or not a                project is appropriate for a given community and how well it is                likely to be received. The idea for the Fruitvale Transit Village                originated within the Fruitvale community, following a proposal                by BART to construct a parking garage at the Fruitvale BART station.                That proposal generated little community support. To BART's credit,                it changed course quickly once it recognized the community's desire                for a different type of project developed through a more inclusive                planning process.                                                                    Partnerships can be an effective tool for overcoming barriers posed                by the expense and complexity                of certain projects. The Fruitvale Transit Village survived various                legal, financial, and regulatory challenges in large part because                of the leadership of the Unity Council and the willingness of key                players like BART and the City of Oakland to actively participate                in the project.                                                                    Public transit facilities are valuable assets for certain low-income,                minority communities in urban locations. Such facilities already                play an important role in providing inner-city residents with access                to jobs, shopping, and other key destinations. To the extent that                projects like the Fruitvale Transit Village prove successful, transit                facilities may also be used increasingly as anchors for neighborhood                revitalization.

Neighborhood residents and businesses will experience less traffic                    and better air quality as a result of planning efforts emphasizing                    alternatives to automobile use.                                                       New investment activity around the transit station will provide                    jobs, increase property values, improve the appearance of the                    area, and, ideally, transform the commercial core of Fruitvale                    into a convenient and healthy place in which to live, work,                    and shop.

New development around the Fruitvale BART station will lead                    to an increase in the number of transit users passing through                    the station each day, boosting BART's ridership.                                                       Both BART and the City of Oakland have learned valuable lessons                    about the planning and design of transit-oriented development                    projects, knowledge that can potentially be applied at other                    transit stations, both in Oakland and throughout the BART system.

This billion-dollar initiative will strengthen the federal government's role as a partner with the growing number of state and local efforts to build ""livable communities"" for the 21st century. Recognizing that our business is about more than concrete, steel, rail, and rubber, the Federal Transit Administration is completely committed to the use of improved transit in the development of livable communities. As we seek to meet the mobility needs of the American public and commit ourselves to what Secretary Slater refers to as the human dimension of transportation, our Livable Communities Initiative, described in this booklet, equips communities with the tools to develop transit facilities and services that meet their needswith intelligent land use planning, pedestrian access, and urban design. Enhancing personal mobility while building stronger, more vibrant communities will both build transit patronage and improve the quality of life. These community-sensitive facilities make customer information readily available, help customers feel safe and secure, ensure sufficient open space, provide pedestrian and bicycle access, and manage parking carefully. Customer-friendly, community-oriented transit facilities and services don't just happen. They are the result of a coordinated and participatory community-based planning process and people-oriented design. I encourage you to review this booklet thoughtfully and carefully. It will help all of us work together to meet the challenges of tomorrow. Gordon J. Linton   P  REFACE  that walking to and from these facilities requires little effort. Better connections between different modes of transportation are making it easier to transfer from one transportation mode to another. Local governments are implementing transit supportive policies such as mixed-use zoning, parking management, and traffic calming. Additionally, special attention is being given to creating accessible transit for people with disabilities and the elderly, and communities are asking for transit stations and stops which are safer and more secure. This booklet presents some of the successesin terms of planning, development, and implementationof the community-sensitive transportation facility development process. Although a comprehensive process is described here, not every project involves the full range of steps. By applying the techniques outlined in this booklet, transportation agencies, metropolitan planning organizations, local governments, and communities can help achieve transportation goals beyond ""asphalt, concrete, and steel""to reap quality-of-life rewards involving the economic, social and environmental benefits of transit investments. States and local governments are implementing transit supportive policies such as smart growth legislation, mixed-use zoning, parking management, and traffic calming.  A  cross the country, communities are becoming actively involved in enhanc-  ing the connections between transit and local quality of life. This is being accomplished by locating development near transit stops and stations so  1   C  ONTENTS  INTRODUCTION . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 M P P P ETROPOLITAN  PLANNING . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8  ROGRAMMING ROJECT  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21  DEVELOPMENT. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14 AND  ROJECT IMPLEMENTATION  OPERATIONS  M  AINTENANCE  APPENDIX . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23  TABLES 1. 2. 3. 4.

Metropolitan growth and resulting sprawl development patterns have led to increasingly longer trips, poor pedestrian access, traffic congestion, and adverse environmental impacts. These factors are diminishing the quality of life in the nation's communities and reducing effective and efficient operation of public transportation systems. Transit-oriented development and community-sensitive transit can help reverse these trends. Transit-oriented development  NTRODUCTION densities, suitable job/housing balance, and effective parking management policies can reduce auto trips as much as 18%. Furthermore, developments which incorporate site design amenities (e.g., sidewalks, lights, seats, intermodal connections, and onsite services) can increase transit ridership by 4% or more. In Corpus Christi, Texas, the Regional Transit Authority RTA has experienced a 6% increase in ridership on the routes served by the transit centers, as well as a 19% increase in the systemwide ridership. Current technologies permit implementation of more innovative, efficient, and responsive transit services.  involves mixed-use development on air rights or near transit stations and stops, safe and secure pedestrian access, parking management, and other transit-supportive traffic management techniques. Transit-oriented developments which involve Federal Transit Administration (FTA) financial assistance are defined as joint development. Transit-oriented development can be enhanced with community-sensitive transit consisting of real-time customer information, innovative transit services, on-site customer services, and other amenities. Research has shown that land use strategies involving mixeduse development with higher  FEDERAL TRANSIT  IMPACTS MEASURES Vehicle Trips  OF TRANSIT ORIENTED RESULTS  DEVELOPMENTS  ADMINISTRATION'S LIVABLE COMMUNITIES INITIATIVE The FTA Livable Communities Initiative is demonstrating ways to improve the link between transit and communities.

The FTA's Strategic Plan specifically envisions a stronger link in the relationship between transit and communities. Under the Livable Communities Initiative, FTA has awarded funding to 21 projects that demonstrate the characteristics of community-sensitive transit. Demonstration projects were chosen using the criteria shown on Table 1. Table 2 lists the projects and the Appendix provides summary descriptions of each of the selected demonstration projects.  The goal of the Livable Communities Initiative is to strengthen the link between transit and communities by improving personal mobility, transportation system performance, and the quality of life in communities by:  strengthening the link between transit planning and community planning, including land use policies and urban design suppor ting the use of transit, and ultimately providing physi cal assets that better meet community needs;  stimulating increased par ticipation in the decisionmaking process by com munity organizations, minority and low-income residents, small and minor ity businesses, persons with disabilities, and the elderly;  increasing access to employment, education facilities, and other com munity destinations through high quality, community-oriented, and tech nologically innovative tran sit services and facilities; and  leveraging resources avail able through other Feder al, State, and local programs.  secure environment; sufficient pedestrian and bicycle access; and architecture that reflects the values of the community. The Initiative recommends that transportation agencies and local governments introduce proposed transportation improvements to communities in the early stages of the planning process. When communities are afforded an opportunity for greater involvement in the decision-making process, the true objectives of a livable community are more likely to be accurately addressed and achieved. Both the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and FTA strategic plans place emphasis on putting people  EFFECTS OF LAND USE AND URBAN DESIGN TRANSIT MODE SHARE Availability of Convenience Services Mix of Land Use Accessibility of Services Areas Perceived as Safe Aesthetically Pleasing Environment  ON  URBAN DESIGN/LAND USE CHARACTERISTIC IMPACT ON TRANSIT 3.7% increase in transit 3.5% increase in transit 3.3% increase in transit 1.8% increase in transit 4.1% increase in transit  Source: The Effects of Land Use and Travel Demand Management Strategies on Commuting Behavior, November 1994, Cambridge Systematics.  4  I  n t ro d u c t i o n   TABLE 1:  EVALUATING COMMUNITY-SENSITIVE TRANSIT FACILITIES CRITERION COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT  AND SERVICES  CHARACTERISTICS Inclusiveness Town Meetings Planning Workshops Design Workshops  R  ESULTS  Supportive of transit Better problem definitions Consensus on alternatives Better project definition  ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT EFFECTS  Transit-Oriented Comprehensive Plan Catalyst for revitalization Employment Creation Job increase Local Property Tax Base Increased property values Additional Indirect Effects Source of non-farebox revenues Transit-Oriented Development Increased transit ridership Efficient land use management Reduced auto trips Improved transit operations Increased transit modal shar e Allocation of funding requirements Prioritization of scarce resources Transit agency income Risk management Reduction in crime and accidents Improved time management Travel time savings Operating efficiency Neighborhood/historical preservation Trip reductions Aesthetically pleasing environment Improved access to services Better functional relationships Greater operations efficiency Increased mobility Greater pedestrian movement Better line haul access Improved access In-vehicle travel time savings Improved network efficiency Increased work and non-work transit trips Percent transit ridership Improved air quality, reduced VMT  LOCAL LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION POLICIES  Transit Priority Treatments Parking Management PROJECT FINANCIAL IMPACTS Project Cost Optimizing Fund Sources Project Revenues Leveraging Other Financial Resources Safety/Security Provisions Customer Information Travel Time Speeds Architectural Compatibility Mix of Land Uses Art Local Master Plan Integration Facility Design Integration Transit Stop Location Intermodal Connections Pedestrian Access Transit Vehicle Circulation Bicycle Access Signal Preemption Access Roadway Congestion Levels Transit Usage Transit Mode Shar e Travel Demand Management  QUALITY OF SERVICE  SITE DESIGN PRINCIPLES  SYSTEM ACCESS  TRAVEL DEMAND  I  ntroduction  5   TABLE 2:  LCI DEMONSTRATION PROJECT SUMMARY LCI DEMONSTRATION PROJECT PRINCIPAL FEATURE TOTAL PROJECT COST FTA SHARE (millions) (millions)  Atlanta University Center Access Improvements Austin Baltimore Reisterstown Metr o Station Enhancements Chester Transportation Center Enhancements Chicago Green Line 35th Street Station Enhancements Clackamas County Sunnyside Village Transit Plaza Columbus Engineering for Transit Service Center Corpus Christi Transit Center Dallas Pedestrian Accessway Enhancements East Cleveland - Enhancements to Stokes Station at Windermer e El Paso Union Plaza Pedestrian Enhancements Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiatives (LANI) Transit Enhancements Louisville Neighborhood Travel and Jobs Center New York City Harlem 110th St. Station Security Oakland BART Fruitvale Station Enhancements North Philadelphia Pedestrian Access Improvements Peublo Downtown Transit Center Rosslyn Metro Station Bus Bay, Pedestrian Access and Safety St. Louis Metrolink Wellston Station Enhancements Tampa Ybor City Electric Trolley Access Improvements Tucson South Park Avenue Improvements  Pedestrian Access Pedestrian and Bus Access Customer Services Pedestrian and Bus Access, Customer Services Pedestrian Access, Safety, and Security Land Acquisition Engineering and Architectural Design Pedestrian Access Pedestrian Access Land Acquisition Bus and Pedestrian Access/Safety Safety and Security Features, Bus Shelters, Transit Stores Building Acquisition and Customer Services Safety and Security Enhancements Transit-Oriented Development Pedestrian Access Safety and Security Enhancements Facility Improvements, Bus Access Customer Services Enhancements System and Pedestrian Enhancements Pedestrian Access  $10.00 $1.25 $1.90 $7.50 $3.36 $2.00 $10.001 $3.72 $1.31 $6.00 $30.00 $7.40 $3.00 $2.80 $4.50 $5.70 $1.70 $1.62 $7.80 $4.74 $1.80  $3.10 $1.00 $1.52 $6.00 $2.80 $1.60 $2.50 $3.10 $1.09 $3.20 $7.50 $5.30 $2.40 $2.20 $2.30 $3.00 $1.00 $1.30 $1.00 $1.70 $1.50  TOTAL  $118.10 $55.11  6  I  n t ro d u c t i o n   STATUTORY BASIS AND FUNDING The statutory basis for the Initiative is found at 49 U.S.C. Section 5309(a)(5) and (7) (formerly Sections 3(a)(1)(D) and (F) of the Federal Transit Act). These provisions authorize projects that 1) enhance the effectiveness of mass transportation projects to which they are physically or functionally related, and 2) provide non-vehicular, capital improvements which increase transit ridership in fixedguideway corridors. The flexible funding provisions of TEA-21 strengthen the funding opportunities for transit investments that meet the needs of communities. The FTA Livable Communities Initiative is thus firmly grounded in law. The essential purpose of the Federal transit law is not simply to fund the capital and operating costs of transit systems; more generally, the purpose is to improve the quality of life in urban and rural communities through the use of transit systems, recognizing them as the lifeblood of livable communities.  The Clinton-Gore Livability Agenda is a billion dollar initiative. Sources of Federal funds for projects reflecting the basic principles of the Livable Communities Initiative include: the Transit Capital Discretionary Grant or Loan Program, the Transit Formula Assistance Block Grants, the Planning and Research Program, the Planning and Design of Mass Transportation Facilities to Meet Special Needs of Elderly Persons and Persons with Disabilities, the Rural Transit Assistance Formula Grant Program for Areas Other Than Urbanized Areas, the Surface Transportation Program (STP), and Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funds. Livable communities do not simply happen. They are the byproduct of a coordinated and participatory transportation and community planning process where transit decisions are made in conjunction with decisions on land use and other transportation investments. The principles of livable communities should be instilled throughout the planning and project development process.  A description of that process and the kinds of principles that are appropriate at each stage follows.  STEPS IN PLANNING AND PROJECT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS METROPOLITAN PLANNING  PROGRAMMING  PROJECT DEVELOPMENT  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION  OPERATIONS & MAINTENANCE  I  n t ro d u c t i o n  7   M  ETROPOLITAN PLANNING In urbanized areas around the country, local elected officials and transportation agencies carry out transportation planning and decision-making processes. The planning process produces a transportation plan, identifying the region's transportation policies, investment strategies, and major facilities and services to be implemented during the next 20 or more years. The process also produces a short range transportation improvement program (TIP), which identifies the projects to be implemented over a shorter (generally 3- to 5-year) period. The process is carried out under the auspices of a Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO). MPOs have the authority to adopt plans and TIPs, but most do not implement transportation projects, provide transportation services, or regulate land use. Some of the activities that occur as part of the metropolitan transportation planning process are:  Analysis of transportation system performance and trends;  Projections of future land use, travel, and system performance;  Analysis of alternative strategies for solving transportation problems; and  Involvement of the public and non-transportation agencies (see Table 3 for examples of techniques). There are numerous opportunities to incorporate livable communities principles into the metropolitan transportation planning process. Metropolitan planning leads to decisions, by the MPO and participating implementing agencies, on transportation plans, policies, and priorities. Under Federal law and regulations, metropolitan transportation plans must be relatively specific, must be consistent with reasonable forecasts of revenue, and must be in conformance with air quality plans. In addition, the planning process must take land use and development plans and  LIVABLE COMMUNITIES CONCEPTS METROPOLITAN PLANNING:  IN   Regional transportation policies developed by the MPO might call for high density, mixed use development with good pedestrian access at places with good transit accessibility, such as transit stations.  The travel demand models that are used to predict future travel behavior can be reviewed and adjusted as necessary to make them more sensitive to the tripmaking characteristics of mixed use, transit-friendly communities.  Alternative land use plans and policies can be evaluated in a longrange plan, as a strategy, or as part of a strategy, for addressing transportation problems.  The criteria used to evaluate alternative transportation strategies and to set priorities can favor projects that are supportive of transitfriendly communities.  MPOs can carry out planning studies to help identify areas within the metropolitan region that are suitable for development as livable communities. Or, MPOs can develop regional guidelines or sample ordinances to help local governments establish livable communities programs.  A community involvement program that stimulates increased participation by community organizations and residents, minority and low-income residents, small and minority businesses, persons with disabilities, and the elderly is essential to adequately consider land use and the overall social, economic, energy, and environmental effects of transportation decisions.  8   TABLE 3:  TECHNIQUES  FOR PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT  FUNDING AGENCIES ARE EXPECTED TO ADOPT TECHNIQUES FOR ENCOURAGING PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN THE PLANNING PROCESS. BELOW ARE SOME OF THE MORE POPULAR AND EFFECTIVE INNOVATIONS IN PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT FOR TRANSPORTATION PLANNING.   Charrette  a meeting in which citizens are invited to participate in a full discussion of issues, inter relationships, and impacts. Time limits challenge people to openly examine problems and produce tangible results.  Visioning  a series of meetings open to all citizens or a representative panel focusing on long-range issues that eventually lead to a goals statement.  Brainstorming  a democratic process open to any citizen, led by a facilitator or moderator where participants come together in a freethinking forum to generate ideas. It provides participants with a sense of progress and accomplishments, and helps them move on to more difficult tasks.  Citizen's Advisory Committee  a repr esentative group of stakeholders that meets regularly to discuss issues of common concern. It allows for extended interaction between citizens and their government.  Transportation Fair  a one-day event used to interest citizens in transportation and in specific projects or programs.  Focus Groups  a meeting of a carefully selected group of individuals convened to discuss a single topic. The opinions are used to gauge public opinion.   Collaborative Task Force  a group of individuals selected to come to a conclusion and resolve a difficult issue, subject to ratification by official decisionmakers.  Media Strategies  use of print and broadcast vehicles to advise and inform customers about projects and programs.  Facilitation  a neutral facilitator guides a group of citizen representatives through the problem-solving process.  Citizen Surveys  a survey administered to a sample group of citizens via a written questionnaire or through interviews in person, by phone, or by electronic mail. The tabulated results are considered representative of a larger group.  Telephone Techniques  an interactive medium used to solicit public involvement, obtain information, and get opinions.  Visual Techniques  use of recorded visual and oral messages to present information to the public, e.g., Visual Preference Surveys.  Public Meetings/Hearings  held prior to a decision point, it presents information to the public and obtains formal input from citizens.  M  e t r o p o l i t a n Pl a n n i n g  9   social, economic, and environmental impacts into account. Some metropolitan planning activities occur on a regional scale. For example, forecasts of future population and employment are normally produced for the region as a whole, reflecting regional growth and development expectations. Policies on desirable transportation system performance, highway and transit service levels, pricing, and finance are typically arrived at on a regional basis. Other planning activities focus on major transportation problems within the region. In most metropolitan areas, the planning and regulation of land use and urban development are the responsibility of individual political jurisdictions. Since transportation planning takes place at the regional level, and land use responsibilities at the local jurisdiction level, the coordination of transportation and land use planning can be difficult. However, the same elected officials who sit on MPO policy boards often have responsibility within their local jurisdictions for land use decisions like comprehensive planning, zoning, and subdivision controls.  Thus, there is linkage through which plans and policies developed at the regional level can be adopted and implemented by the local jurisdictions participating in the MPO planning process. Livable community principles can also be implemented through the planning and land use control  mechanisms of local jurisdictions in the following ways:  Active and diverse community involvement in the metropolitan planning process.  Local comprehensive land use plans can call for new development to be concentrated in corridors where high quality transit service exists or is planned.  FEDERAL PROGRAM SUPPORTS COORDINATED LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION PLANNING The Federal Transit Administration is cur rently participating in a program that compliments the Livable Communities Initiative by providing grants to local and state governments that are improving access to jobs, services, and centers of trade. The Transportation and Community and System Preservation Pilot Program (TCSP) supports joint transportation and land use planning projects that address five goals: improve the efficiency of the transportation system; reduce the future cost of transportation infrastructure; provide efficient access to jobs, activities, and business centers; reduce the environmental impacts of transportation; and examine patterns of private sector development. FTA is part of a working group that includes the Federal Railroad Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the Federal Highway Administration. In May of 1999, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater awarded $13.1 million for 35 projects that support innovative local and regional transportation efforts. Projects range from investigating the impacts of transit overlay districts to preparing modern intermodal freight infrastructure in support of the economic development of brownfield sites.  10  M  e t r o p o l i t a n P l an n i n g    Local plans may call for high density, mixed use development with good pedestrian access at places with good transit accessibility, such as transit stations.  Local zoning ordinances may be revised to provide incentives for mixed use, transit friendly developments. Such incentives might include reduced parking requirements, reduced set back requirements, or higher floor area ratios.   Zoning ordinances might promote transit friendly design by requiring sidewalks or by placing off-street parking to the rear of buildings.  QUALITY COMMUNITY SURVEYS: MARYLAND'S APPROACH TO INVOLVING CITIZENS AND OFFICIALS IN DEVELOPING SMART GROWTH STRATEGIES At the heart of Maryland's emphasis on Smart Growth is the belief that progress toward the building of ""Quality Communities"" requires deliberate, goal-oriented planning and decision-making at the local level. Along with other states across the country, Maryland recognized that effective responses to sprawl must include vigorous efforts to enhance the quality of life in existing urban communities. If such communities can offer current and prospective residents an attractive, safe, nurturing environment in which to live and work, fewer Marylanders would elect to leave those communities to populate new neighborhoods at the edge of suburban development. But quality communities do not happen be accident; they are the result of careful planning, hard work, public involvement, local support and continuing investment. Through a special partnership with the Federal Transit Administration's Livable Communities Initiative, the Maryland Mass Transit Administration (MTA) worked with ten Maryland communities from early 1997 through early 1999 to develop and apply the Quality Community Survey (QCS) approach. This approach to planning and community involvement employs public workshops using a technique called ""vision translation."" In advance of each QCS session, MTA planners met with local citizens and elected officials to identify issues that were felt to be critical to the future of each community. These meetings included tours and photo sessions to record and assess existing quality-of-life conditions in the communities. During the workshop itself, community members explore options for enhancement actions using the vision translation method. This interesting and popular process has repeatedly proven its usefulness in helping residents and officials develop consensus on concrete actions needed to create and sustain quality communities.

Projects determined to be of highest priority are programmed via a metropolitan and a statewide Transportation Improvement Program (TIP). TIPs usually  cover 3-5 years. The Metropolitan TIP is approved by the MPO and the State TIP (STIP) is approved by the state's Governor. The annual element of the statewide TIP must be approved by the FHWA and the FTA before financial assistance is provided. These programs are to be prioritized and constrained to reasonably available revenues. Each state and metropolitan area has a process for periodically amending its TIPs to incorporate new projects. If the states and the MPOs wish to program community-sensitive transit projects, the criteria in Table 1, or those determined locally, can be used to evaluate those projects. An example of such local programming initiative is the Delta Area Rural Transit System (DARTS) in Clarksdale, Mississippi. DARTS was launched in 1990 by a local health center with two minivans purchased by the federal  EL PASO FLEXIBLE FUNDING FOR TRANSITORIENTED DEVELOPMENT - A GOOD NEWS STORY In El Paso, Texas, Sun Metro is undertaking a major Transit Improvement Program known as Union Plaza that will redefine and revitalize the El Paso Empowerment Zone using over $30M in flexible funding.

Transit oriented development is the key to making this redevelopment program work.  LEVERAGING OTHER FUNDS Numerous leveraging opportunities exist for facilities which provide onsite community services, incorporate other transportation enhancements, and accommodate transit-oriented real estate development. Transit enhancements envisioned by the Livable Communities Initiative are typically part of larger funding packages. These opportunities occur, for example, in the form of funding from TEA21's flexible funding programs, foundations, the Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities Program administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development  12   SMART GROWTH AND TRANSIT: A PROMISING PARTNERSHIP The growing national interest in the Smart Growth concept, together with the success of the Livable Communities Initiative in forging linkages between transit improvements and community development activities, suggests a wide panorama of new opportunities to achieve permanent changes in urban development patterns. Smart Growth is a local phenomenon and, like the Livable Communities Initiative, derives its energy and momentum from partnerships among key participants at the local level-developers, planners, transit agencies, citizens, and public officials, working together. Under such conditions, growth becomes an opportunity to harness the power of the market to bring a positive reshaping influence to the geographic distribution of population and jobs. As we look at the problems created by sprawl and the need to revitalize our urban cores and protect our rural communities, we must real ize that sprawl creates a quality of life deficit, expressed in terms of, among other things, mobility deficiencies. Transit improvements, when undertaken in conjunction with other key components of community quality of life, can provide an important catalyst and for the implementation of Smart Growth policies.   In Cleveland, the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (GCRTA) used its Livable Communities Initiative demonstration grant to leverage an additional $2 million in foundation funding for a $6 million East Cleveland Windermere Station Head Start and extended day care project.  Missouri's Bi-State Transit Development Agency and the East-West Gateway Coordinating Council are using a Livable Communities Initiative demonstration grant in conjunction with local brownfields redevelopment activities. This grant is being coordinated with a broader, $6 million funding package provided by the U.S. Department of Commerce and a donation of training equipment provided by the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences.

Along with actual projects, MPOs and transit agencies are encouraged to program planning studies supportive of the Livable Communities Initiative in their area's Unified Planning Work Programs. As an illustration, in Oakland, California, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, the MPO, worked with the Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART) and the Spanish Speaking Unity Council, a neighborhood organization, to program planning funds for developing a site plan for the BART Fruitvale Station Transit Village.

In accordance with the goal of the Livable Communities Initiative, FTA encourages transit agencies to seek, early on, active community involvement in project developJOB ACCESS AND REVERSE COMMUTE Transportation is considered crucial in welfare reform. Public transportation has a pivotal role in the journey from welfare to work. To the nearly 40% of the 10 million daily public transit riders in the U.S., transit is more than merely a ride-it is a lifeline. Congress has authorized $750m, with $500M guaranteed for this program under TEA-21.  further project development work is undertaken to examine the pro-  posal in greater detail. Project development includes the analysis of design options like the precise location, physical dimensions, architectural treatments, and access of new transit facilities or enhancements to existing facilities. During this phase, the environmental review process is completed, including the preparation of any environmental documents that may be required. These requirements are described in the FTA/FHWA Joint Environmental Procedures (CFR771). Cost estimates are also refined, along with financial commitments. Project development activities are normally carried out by the agency that will be responsible for implementation and operation.  EARLY AND ACTIVE COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN PROJECT DEVELOPMENT PHASE ENSURES COMMUNITY-RESPONSIVE PROJECT ELEMENTS In San Francisco, a light rail system is being developed for the Bayshore Corridor with intensive public involvement to ensure that the project meets community needs. Major issues addressed included how to successfully integrate the rail system into an area where major redevelopment efforts are planned and the provision of transit service that will best connect the corridor to the rest of the city. To accomplish this, peer panel meetings were conducted with involvement of community representatives and nationally recognized transportation experts. Topics discussed included cur rent stateof-the-art in assessment of pedestrian access, tools and processes for community decisionmaking, land use impacts around stations and stops, micro-scale transit demand estimation, and the use of Geographic Information Sys tems (GIS) in analysis.  14   ment such as occurred in the San Francisco Bayshore Corridor. The process for developing community-sensitive transit facilities will vary depending upon the type and scale of the project. Projects proceed through the phases of preliminary engineering (PE), final design, and construction.  Enhancements to existing stations and stops may involve site planning and facility design without a clear demarcation between PE and final design. Preliminary engineering is where site plans or station area plans are developed, facilities are designed to the 30% level, cost estimates are prepared, and, US  if needed, environmental documents are completed. For major investments, inputs to PE include project design concept and scope, travel demand estimates, master schedules, and budgets. Changes in project definition and operations requirements are incorporated during the PE phase.  FTA ADVANCES IMPLEMENTATION OF B THROUGH DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM  RAPID T  RANSIT  The design of communitysensitive transit facilities is greatly facilitated by an engaged, actively participating community, as illustrated by the site planning and design for rehabilitation of the Chester Transportation Center. Techniques such as the Visual Preference Survey, focus groups, and HandsOn Model Building Workshops are excellent methods for building community consensus during project development. Project development is normally where issues associated with FTAsupported transit-oriented development are addressed.  While livable communities projects seek to strengthen the link between transit and community, other initiatives underway will enhance mobility and transit efficiency through service improvements. For example, FTA recently launched the Bus Rapid Transit Initiative to improve the speed, reliability, and convenience of bus service while enhancing mobility and minimizing environmental impacts. Central to the Initiative is a Demonstration Program that will support bus rapid transit innovations at ten selected locations throughout the United States. The improvements funded through this Initiative will explore ways in which buses can operate with the speed, reliability, and efficiency of light rail at only a fraction of the cost. Bus rapid transit offers many of the features of a subway system--unimpeded vehicle movements, efficient fare collection, quick loading, and reliable service--but above-ground and visible. These advancements are possible through the use of dedicated bus lanes or bus streets; engineering improvements such as bus turnouts and traffic signal preference and preemption at intersections; and enclosed bus-level boarding areas that allow passengers to pay fares prior to entering the bus. The Demonstration Program will support implementation of bus rapid transit in ten cities, including Boston, MA; San Juan, PR; Eugene, OR; and Honolulu, HI. Funded projects include improvements to existing bus service, replacement service for discontinued light rail services, and intermediate service prior to extension of light rail. Careful documentation and analysis of each program will illustrate key lessons that can be applied to the implementation of bus rapid transit elsewhere.  P r o j ec t D e ve l o p me n t  15   INNOVATIVE PLANNING TECHNIQUE LEADS TO DESIGN THAT MEETS COMMUNITY NEEDS The expectations and needs of a community must be reflected in the design of each project. At a transportation town meeting in Corpus Christi, Texas, over 150 neighborhood residents, agency representatives, elected officials and interested individuals met to exchange ideas for improving pedestrian and transit access from the award-winning Staples Street Transit Center to the Northside Community. A series of visual representations of design options were shown to assess the relative values of the group and to begin establishing community priorities. Knowing the community's priorities helped define not only the access improvements but also the customer safety and security enhancements to be made.  LIVABLE COMMUNITIES CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT DEVELOPMENT:  Involve intensive community participation  Accommodate transit-oriented development  Locate transit station convenient to surrounding development, minimizing walking distance and avoiding hostile pedestrian environments  Plan for an appropriate intensity of uses in the station area and along transit corridors  Identify joint development opportunities, including integration of community facilities--such as day care centers--into transit stations  Build in flexibility for future joint development (e.g., onsite services such as child care, health care, transit operator training facility, etc.) as the community's needs evolve  Provide a sense of arrival, order, and orientation within the station area  Balance architectural variety with overall consistency  Mitigate adverse environmental impacts and replace lost resources such as parks grantees should refer to the FTA Grant Management Guidelines (FTA Circular 5010.lB), the Capital Program: Grant Application Instructions (FTA Circular 9300.1), and the FTA Policy on Joint Develland for nearby real estate development; preparing land for development (Federal Register, Friday March 14, 1997; Vol. 62, No. 50, Pages 12266 to 12269).

FTA has determined that such revenue is Program Income, usable for any eligible transit purpose. 6. Producing suppor tive land use poli cies, urban design guidelines, and transportation man agement strategies to increase transit ridership: FTA is encouraging local gov ernments, transporta tion agencies, employ ers, building owners, and building managers to work together in implementing policies and strategies that will support transit utiliza tion. Supportive land use policies include promoting mixed use and high density devel opment around transit stations. Urban design enhancements include landscaping, pedestri an and bicycle ameni ties, safety and security improvements, and improved access to transit services. Transportation actions include parking man agement strategies to increase the cost and reduce the number of parking spaces for sin gle occupant vehicles, priority treatments for transit vehicles, and transit pass programs. 7. Joint Development Agreement: Joint development agree ments address a num ber of issues including institutional arrange ments such as revenues to be paid to transit operators, use of pr oceeds, land acquisi tions, project financ ing, and the extent of Federal participation. Also, cost-sharing arrangements are to be considered whether they are voluntar y, incentive-based, or mandatory. 8. Cross-Cutting Feder al Requirements and Executive Orders: Projects that have a Federal interest must comply with statutory and regulato ry requirements under Federal Transit and related laws, including the National Environ mental Policy Act, Civil Rights, Americans with Disabilities Act, the Clean Air Act, Com mon Grant Rule, and other Federal cross-cut ting requirements, including Davis Bacon, Buy America, thir d party contracting and 13(c). Such projects should also comply with Executive Orders on Infrastructur e Investment and Envi ronmental Justice. Decisions on whether these requirements apply will be made on a case by case basis. Flexibility will be allowed as appropriate.  1. Establishing the physical or func tional relationship to transit: Each pr oject should establish the link between transit and the proposed commu nity-oriented project, be it a child care cen ter, health care facility, mixed-use develop ment or retail facility. Issues to be considered include travel time between the community services and the transit facility, trip generation rates of the proposed community development, and transit share of those trips. 2. Coordinating the site and functional plans, particularly in relationship to transit facility oper ation and mainte nance so as to avoid non-incidental uses: Major trip generators like housing complex es, hotels, and office buildings may be defined as incidental uses. However, because of their scale and potential for obstruct ing transit access, or causing safety prob lems, an incidental use determination for these major generators would be made on a case-by-case basis. 3. Program Income: Most importantly, TEA21presumes that the transit operator will recover the reasonable cost of a joint develop -  4. Designing transit and related services in an integrated manner: It is impor tant that the architec tural, structural, mechanical and electri cal systems for the transit facility are com patible with the requirements of other anticipated uses. These and other aspects of the transit facility infra structure should be adequately designed to accommodate the needs of community oriented enterprises such as health and day care, retail, financial, recreation and educa tional facilities which may be incorporated into the facility. 5. Determining the market and financial feasibility of the transit-related components: If community facilities ar e included in a proposal, market and financial feasibility need to be established to insur e successful implementation and operation of the project. This will include some analysis of the potential demand for the ser vices and the likelihood that the space will be occupied.

To address this situation, the DTPW used flexible funding to design and develop an accessible beach facility at Luguillo Beach, located on the east coast of Puerto Rico. This innovative and fully accessible project is called Mar Sin Barrera, or Sea Without Barriers. The transit agency--the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority--provides service to this attractive beach facility with specially equipped paratransit vehicles.  18   SUCCESS OF LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY EFFORT LEADS TO BECOMING NATIONAL COMMUNITYINVOLVEMENT MODEL The Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative (LANI), an eight-neighborhood coalition, is working with the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) to make community-recom mended transit enhancements. This coalition is serving as a national model for community involvement in the planning and implementation of transportation improvements. LANI recognized the vital role of transportation to the economic, social, and environmental well-being of communities. installing, and testing; and systems. Effective construction management requires a clear definition of objectives, well-defined team roles and responsibilities, requirements and procedures for coordination, a promulgated management plan, and a dispute resolution process. Generally, a project manager assumes overall responsibility for cost and schedule. Design support is required daily. Testing, inspection and quality assurance, change order approval controls, invoices, and submittals are required of the contractor. The project manager handles third party issues, specifically public inquires and negotiations of approvals from public agencies and utilities. The project manager also addresses systems elements, management controls, and financial/budget controls. Effective communication is of paramount importance during the construction phase. Throughout the process, communication with the affected community plays a key part in the success of any project. Newsletters, community meetings, town hall meetings, project milestone celebrations, and other special events are effective tools for maintaining contact with neighborhood groups and citizens. Public notices and information about transit routes, schedules, and other customer information should be prepared, distributed, and posted well in advance of startup. Staging an open house at a transit center/station or its adjoining community facility provides a good welcoming and orientation to the neighborhood.  P  r o je ct  I  mplementation  19   Project sponsors are encouraged to pursue innovative project delivery approaches where feasible or where market conditions permit. In some cases, a turnkey or design/build approach may save time and budget. Turnkey is where the design and construction activities are contained in a  single contract. Joint development with private developers, who may handle finance, engineering, and construction, is another possibility.  LIVABLE COMMUNITIES GRANT MOVES COMMUNITY DRIVEN GRANT FROM PLANNING PHASE TO DESIGN DEVELOPMENT In New York City, citizens have been participating in the redesign of Frederick Douglass Circle, located at the northwest corner of Central Park. A series of meetings, workshops, and exhibits sponsored by the Central Park Conservancy have explored ways to revitalize this busy and neglected interesection. During the process, participants sought to make the circle more pedestrian-friendly, improve access to bus and subway stops, and strengthen the intersection's role as a gateway to Central Park and three surrounding neighborhoods. Partici pants also suggested ways to incorporate elements depicting the life of Frederick Douglass into the design of the area. A recent $140,000 Livable Communities grant from FTA has provided the funds to move the process from planning to design development. The project is progressing as a public-private partnership between the Central Park Conservancy and City agencies, and will incorporate new traffic signals, crosswalks, pedestrian lighting, a monument to Douglass, and urban design elements that will encourage future retail and commercial development around the Circle. The project is progressing as a public-private partnership between the Central Park Conservancy and City agencies, with Federal funding being provided by the Federal Highway Department.

Although these responsibilities become paramount after the facility is open and in use, operations and maintenance requirements should be addressed early on in the planning and project development phases. Proper operations and maintenance are essential to safeguard the initial investment and to achieve the use of facilities. In recently completed community-sensitive transportation projects, a number of innovative approaches to operations and maintenance are presented. In Corpus Christi, Texas, over 1,500 community members created colorful ceramic tiles for the awardwinning Staples Street bus transfer center. This direct community participation reduced litter and graffiti, and maintenance costs are significantly lower than at other transit stations. By employing off-duty city police officers, the Transit Authority is able to provide quality customer security at a lower cost.

The master lease even put in electrical services as part of the agreement.  negotiated, annual fee to the Mall for cleaning and maintenance of the bus transfer center. In each case, the SCMTD has significantly reduced the operating and maintenance costs. Community-sensitive transit projects provide special opportunities for community stewardship. Community stewardship of transit stations and centers provides a sense of community ownership  While stewardship can be applied at many transit facilities, the approach may vary based upon the facility, the location, and community interest. However, the partnerships created between transit and neighborhoods through the Livable Communities Initiative provide an ongoing basis for community stewardship, thus alleviating many operating and maintenance difficulties.  P  ro j ec t  I  mplementation  21   T  he Livable Communities Initiative is demonstrating that transit can provide an important means of strengthening the link between transportation and communities. This booklet has described how the concepts and objectives of the FTA Livable Communities Initiative are incorporated into the ongoing  planning, programming, project development, and project implementation processes. Examples were used to  illustrate these phases, as well as operations and maintenance aspects. The FTA Livable Communities Initiative involves a number of other activities. These include:  Documentation of Best Practices in planning, developing, implementing, and operating community-sensitive transit facilities.

GX228-83-7098554	FUNCTION 400: TRANSPORTATION  FUNCTION SUMMARY  Function 400 includes all modes of transportation including: ground transportation programs, such as the federal-aid highway program; mass transit operating and capital assistance; rail transportation through the National Rail Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) and rail safety programs; air transportation through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airport improvement program, facilities and equipment program, and operation of the air traffic control system; water transportation through the Coast Guard and Maritime Administration; the Surface Transportation Board; and related transportation support activities. In 1998, spending for Function 400 was $46.0 billion in BA and $40.8 billion in outlays. Discretionary spending, including obligation limitations placed on transportation programs by the Appropriations Committee, represents nearly all spending in the function. As reflected in the spending summary table, compared to the freeze baseline, budget authority would be $46.0 billion in 1999, rising to $46.2 billion by 2003. Outlays would rise from $41.8 billion in 1999 to $43.1 billion in 2003. Discretionary spending in Function 400 was designated as a protected function under the BBA last year.  400-1   FUNCTION 400: TRANSPORTATION  SPENDING SUMMARY ($ billions) 1998 Chairman's Mark BBA Freeze Baseline BA OT BA OT BA OT 46.0 40.8 46.0 40.8 46.0 40.8 1999 51.5 42.8 47.3 41.3 46.0 41.8 2000 51.9 44.7 47.1 41.5 46.1 41.9 2001 52.1 45.7 47.4 41.3 46.1 42.1 2002 51.5 45.8 47.2 40.7 45.6 42.1 2003 52.1 46.9 48.2 42.3 46.2 43.1  Chairman's Mark compared to: BBA Freeze Baseline BA OT BA OT ----+4.2 +1.5 +5.5 +1.0 +4.8 +3.2 +5.8 +2.8 +4.7 +4.4 +6.0 +3.6 +4.3 +5.1 +5.9 +3.7 +3.9 +4.6 +5.9 +3.8  DESCRIPTION OF CHAIRMAN'S MARK The Chairman's Mark proposes discretionary spending of $13.9 billion in BA and $40.4 billion in outlays in 1999. This represents an increase of $0.2 billion in BA and $0.9 billion in outlays more than 1998. Over the next five years, the Chairman's Mark would increase discretionary outlays by $18.8 billion over the discretionary levels assumed in the BBA. < The Chairman's Mark incorporates the Senate-passed increases and proposed offsets for the reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). Specifically, this agreement calls for increases of $25.9 billion in contract authority for highway and highway safety programs above the levels agreed to in last year's BBA. Spending this additional contract authority requires $18.5 billion in outlays. Identified offsets for this increased discretionary spending are contained in Function 920, Allowances.  <  400-2   FUNCTION 400: TRANSPORTATION  < <  The Chairman's Mark assumes increased spending of $2.7 billion in outlays over the next five years for mass transit programs. The Chairman's Mark assumes the President's proposed reductions to other non-ISTEA transportation programs such as the Coast Guard, the Federal Railroad Administration, (FRA), Appalachian Highway Development funding (consistent with the Senate-passed ISTEA bill), the Maritime Administration, NASA Aeronautics, and other programs. The Chairman's Mark rejects the President's budget proposal to redefine obligation limitations set by the Appropriations Committee for federal-aid highway, highway safety, mass transit, and Airport Improvement Program (AIP) contract authority programs as discretionary budget authority.  <  400-3

Modal Shift to Transit An initiative of the Canadian Urban Transit Association (CUTA)  CUTA is pleased to announce the availability of a series of reports from its recently completed Modal Shift to transit study. The study was financially-assisted by a number of departments and ministries of the Federal and various Provincial governments, as well as a large number of local municipalities.  The objective of the study was to identify short and long term measures which could be implemented by all levels of government to help effect a modal shift to transit  The study was conducted by a team of consultants representing different disciplines in transportation, management, demographics and taxation. The consultants were directed by  Steering Committee that included representatives of all levels of government from across  Canada.   Some of the study findings:       Socio-demographic trends are negatively affecting transit       ridership.       Increased transit ridership is critical to addressing major       issues such as traffic congestion, air quality, the quality of       urban life. It is also required in order to attain increased       productivity and throughput of the existing urban transportation       infrastructure as required to accommodate economic growth.        Transit market shares vary according to the size of the       municipality, as do solutions and options to improve this market       share.        There are initiatives which the study found to have benefitted       transit ridership in specific communities and there are easily       transferable to other communities.  Some of the study conclusions:       A dobling of  urban transit fridership in Canada is achievable       in the foreseeable future.       Such a goal will only be achieved if there is cooperationm  from       all levels of government.       Action plans should be developed at the local level to first       counteract the negative impacts of current socio-demographic       trnds, and secondly to induce a modal shift to transit.   Study recommendations:  The study concludes with wide ranging recommendations aimed at all levels of government, the private sector and to individual Canadians.  The recommendations deal with short and long range actions required to retain and expand transit's share of the urban transportation market, and deal with transit operations, land use patterns, traffic measures, taxation measures, communications strategies and more.

First introduced in 1987 in the New York City area, TransitChek® vouchers are provided to employees by their employers solely for the purchase of transportation on participating public and private transit and railroad systems in a metropolitan area. The vouchers are a tax-free benefit to the employees and a tax deductible expense to the employers, up to the amount allowed by federal law, currently $60.00 per month per employee ($720 per year). Employers purchase the vouchers from the organization administering the program, and distribute them to their employees. Employees redeem them at participating transportation providers of their choice. The vouchers function as checks, which the transportation providers deposit into their bank accounts.     Significant features of the program include:     - the cooperation and coordination of the many public and private transit and rail operators involved;     - the simplification of using one instrument to provide numerous transportation choices and fare options to the commuter;     - its appeal to small companies which find it easier to join than pass programs of individual operators;     - its taxable equivalent value to the employee, which is considerably greater than the face value of the TransitChek® vouchers themselves.     The main goals of the program are to increase the use of public transportation services, improve employee mobility, reduce traffic congestion and automobile emissions, and support the region's economy.    New York City Region TransitChek®      The New York City Region's TransitChek® program grew out of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's (Port Authority's) desire in 1984 to relieve traffic congestion in its tunnels and on its bridges. The Port Authority formed the Employer Liaison Transportation Office (ELTO) to examine ways to reduce the prevalence of auto subsidies through alternate pro-transit financial incentives, capitalizing on the recently federally enacted $15 de minimis transit fringe benefit, and through developing interest and support by the Manhattan business community in promoting transit to their workforce. In 1986, the Port Authority expanded ELTO's activities and merged them into the newly created TransitCenter, with a federal grant, and funding and in-kind support from the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation (PATH), the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) and the New Jersey Transit Corporation (NJ TRANSIT). TransitCenter developed the concept of the current TransitChek® program, implemented it in 1987, and administers it today.     Although it receives financial support from an alliance of both public and private entities, TransitCenter is organizationally an operating division of the Port Authority. It is headed by an executive director, with supporting positions of an assistant director, and key persons in the marketing, sales operations, business development and finance areas. The staff is projected to increase to 34 by 1995. A board of trustees, composed of representatives from ten transit operators and related agencies, governs TransitCenter, and meets annually to approve TransitCenter's funding, operating budget, and program plans. Three standing committees on operations, marketing, and finances, composed of board members, meet throughout the year to discuss issues and direct activities in their respective areas.     The TransitChek® program has been successful in the New York City region. Sales of TransitChek® vouchers have grown at an annual growth rate of 64 percent since 1988, the first full year of program operation. From 1991 through 1994, as the maximum benefit grew from $15 to $60, a 400 percent increase, TransitChek® sales grew over 700 percent. This tremendous growth can be attributed to several factors, including TransitCenter's highly effective and focused marketing program, the dedicated program staff, the support TransitCenter receives from the Port Authority and the transportation community, and the transit-rich and transit-dependent environment in which the program operates.     The TransitChek® program has made progress toward achieving many program goals. It has  improved employee mobility  by increasing the commuting choices for employees of participating companies, and making transit and vanpools affordable choices, especially for lower paid employees. It has contributed to  reducing commuter dependence on automobile  usage; employee surveys showed that automobile and taxi use decreased and transit use increased by 16 to 23 percent among TransitChek® recipients.     There is evidence of  increased transit ridership  due to TransitChek®. Surveyed employees report taking an average of one additional commuter trip and one half new noncommuter trip per month. The number of  new  riders that TransitChek® has attracted is unclear, although anecdotes from employers affirm some employees have switched from single occupancy vehicle commuting to transit. Because the number of TransitChek® users is small compared to total ridership on the major transit systems (TransitChek® redemptions for NYCT, LIRR and NJ TRANSIT represent 0.63 percent, 0.34 percent and 0.40 percent of total revenues, respectively), the increased transit usage by TransitChek® participants is not apparent from transit ridership data.     TransitChek® vouchers  reduce the amount of cash handling  for transit operators. Riders must use their vouchers to purchase fares in bulk, either as packs of tokens or passes; transit operators will not give cash change for fare purchases less than the face values of the vouchers.     The TransitChek® program has  fostered cooperation among the operators  and the business and transportation communities. This is evidenced by the joint participation of these groups on TransitCenter's board, and by the general success and growth of the program, which would not have occurred without the cooperation of all involved.     The  effects of TransitChek® on congestion are not measurable , given the small size of the TransitChek® community compared to the workday traffic in the region.     TransitCenter is effective in administering the program, and all aspects of the TransitChek® system are functioning as desired, including fulfillment activities (order processing, payment handling, and record keeping), check design, fee structure, and marketing. Because of their initial market research and careful system design, the program did not encounter any major difficulties once it was set up. TransitCenter made various improvements as needs arose.     The increase of the maximum monthly tax benefit from $21 to $60 affected employer enrollments significantly; over three times as many companies enrolled in 1993, the year of the increase, as the year before. Likewise, employees appeared to make more new transit trips at the increased subsidy amount of $60.     TransitChek® provides a mechanism to ease the impacts on both commuters and their employers of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act regarding reduction of single occupancy commuting. TransitCenter's strategy of emphasizing this in the employer marketing program, as well as the savings an employer would derive from giving employees a benefit such as TransitChek® over a conventional raise, promises continued future success in increasing TransitChek®'s share of the commuter market.    Philadelphia TransitChek®      The Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) wanted to demonstrate the importance of transit to economic growth in the Philadelphia area. DVRPC decided a program similar to the New York TransitChek® program would help promote transit to Philadelphia area businesses. In particular, TransitChek® would be beneficial to small employers for whom participation in the pass programs of SEPTA and NJ TRANSIT was not efficient.     When DVRPC approached major transportation providers and related organizations, most were interested in pursuing the TransitChek® program. A core advisory group, known as the Policy Committee, was established consisting of the DVRPC, the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, the Central Philadelphia Development Corporation, the Departments of Transportation of Pennsylvania, Delaware and New Jersey, and many major transportation     operators. Along with a federal grant, these organizations provided the financial support to develop the program. The program became operational in June 1991.     The TransitChek® program has grown at a healthy rate in the Philadelphia area. From 1992, the first full year of its operation, through 1994, it has achieved average annual growth rates of 60 percent in sales and 45 percent in company enrollments. However, it is significant to note that from 1992 to 1993, sales more than doubled. This is the same period in which the maximum transit subsidy increased from $21 to $60. From 1993 to 1994, when the maximum benefit remained the same, sales increased by only 27 percent. The lower growth in 1994 is also partly due to a change in program staffing at DVRPC. (During the first five months of 1995, sales have resumed their robust growth, increasing 57 percent.)     TransitChek® has made progress toward many goals of DVRPC and other interested parties. TransitChek® has  increased employee mobility  by making transit an affordable choice for commuting. There was a  modal shift away from single-occupancy vehicles  among TransitChek® recipients. Before TransitChek®, 20.3 percent of TransitChek® recipients said their primary mode of transportation to work was the automobile; after TransitChek® only 0.4 percent continued to use the automobile as their primary mode.      Transit ridership has increased  because of the TransitChek® program. Employees increased the number of trips they took per week from 7.8 to 10.3 trips after receiving the vouchers, an increase of 32 percent. Among surveyed recipients of TransitChek®, 30 percent were  new  transit riders. This indicates that TransitChek® has the potential to convert a significant number of employees to transit in the Philadelphia area, where an extensive transit system exists and where the transit market is not yet saturated.     The amount of  cash handling was reduced  for operators after the introduction of TransitChek®. Monthly and weekly pass purchases increased, while ticket and token purchases declined.      Cooperation among the operators , private industry and the Chamber of Commerce has been fostered by their joint participation on the TransitChek® Policy Committee.     Given the small size of the TransitChek® user community compared to weekday transit ridership and to the total number of commuters, the  effects of TransitChek® on ridership on specific transit systems and on congestion are not measurable .     The TransitChek® program has been popular among employees of participating companies. However, the employers in the Philadelphia area seem very cost conscious; due to budget limitations they have been reluctant to increase their subsidy amounts even though the maximum allowed by law has increased. In some cases they discontinued the program, because it did not induce their employees to increase their use of transit.     The Philadelphia TransitChek® system appears to work well, and DVRPC is administering it to the satisfaction of participating employers and operators.    Conclusions      The TransitChek® program, as implemented in the New York City and Philadelphia regions, has moved toward its goals of increasing transit ridership, reducing commuter dependence on the automobile, improving employee mobility, reducing cash fare payments, and fostering cooperation among operators and the transportation and business communities. It has helped retain current transit users, and has induced some commuters to switch to transit. As more employers enroll, TransitChek® has the potential to convert significant numbers of riders to transit in a noncoercive way, and contribute toward regional compliance with the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act.     The program is popular among the groups it affects. It provides employers with a way to compensate employees with benefits in a more cost-effective manner than a conventional salary increase, because the value of TransitChek® vouchers given to employees is a tax deductible business expense. It provides employees with a tax-free benefit that subsidizes their commute to work. The combined after-tax benefit to both employers and employees is substantially greater than the pre-tax cost to the employers. Finally, it provides operators with an administrative-free source of additional ridership and revenues.     Raising the maximum monthly benefit to $60 per employee in 1993 has had a positive effect on TransitChek® sales, having increased the program's attractiveness to both employers and employees. There is also some evidence indicating that transit usage increases as the benefit grows.     Both TransitCenter and DVRPC have been successful in administering their TransitChek® programs. Employer surveys and interviews revealed that employers were pleased with the service they received from their TransitChek® suppliers. TransitCenter and DVRPC are making progress in penetrating their markets, although they are far from being saturated. DVRPC suffered a temporary setback in the loss of its initial program staffing, and subsequent momentum in sales. But now that the key positions have been filled, it is instituting some program changes to make operations more efficient, and to hire more staff.     Program revenues in both cities have been increasing each year, and the goal of program self-sufficiency may be achieved in the next few years in both areas. In New York, the increase in ridership on the larger operators' systems is beginning to offset their contributions to TransitCenter's operating budget.    1.0 INTRODUCTION    1.1 OVERVIEW       This report documents and evaluates the TransitChek® programs implemented in the New York City and Philadelphia metropolitan areas. Chapter 1 contains a general overview of the TransitChek® program and the evaluation framework. Chapter 2 contains a description and evaluation of New York's program, while Chapter 3 contains a description and evaluation of the Philadelphia program. Chapter 4 provides a comparison of the two versions of TransitChek®. Finally, Chapter 5 presents the evaluation conclusions.    1.2 TransitChek® OVERVIEW       First introduced in 1987 in the New York City region, TransitChek® vouchers are provided to employees by their employers solely for purchasing transportation on participating public and private transit and railroad systems in a metropolitan area. The vouchers are a tax-free benefit to the employees and a tax deductible expense to the employers, up to the amount allowed by federal law, currently $60.00 per month ($720 per year). The employers purchase the vouchers monthly from the organization administering the program, and distribute them to their employees. Employees redeem them at the participating transportation providers of their choice. The vouchers function as checks, which the transportation providers deposit into their bank accounts.     Significant features of the program include:     - the cooperation and coordination required from the many public and private transit and rail operators involved;     - the simplification of using one instrument to provide numerous transportation choices and fare options to the commuter;     - its appeal to small companies which find it easier to join than pass programs of individual operators;     - its taxable equivalent value to the employee, which is considerably greater than the face value of the TransitChek® vouchers themselves.    1.2.1 Program Goals       The main goals of the program are to increase the use of public transportation services, improve employee mobility, reduce traffic congestion and automobile emissions, and support the region's economy.    1.2.2 TransitChek® Sites       Currently, the TransitChek® program is operating in three metropolitan areas that have received federal start-up grants, including New York City, where the concept was initially developed, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, and in three other locations, including Chicago, Detroit, and Sacramento. The Commuter Check program is similar to TransitChek® in concept, and is operating at a number of sites, including Boston, Buffalo, Dayton, Denver, Louisville, Milwaukee, Norfolk, and San Francisco. Several other cities (Minneapolis, Baltimore, Portland, OR, and Washington, D.C.) have initiated programs similar to TransitChek®.    1.2.3 TransitChek® Development       TransitCenter was formed in New York City in 1986 to secure the support of the Manhattan business community for promotion of transit use, and provide coordinated marketing and other services integrating public and private transit operators serving New York City. While the TransitChek® program is its most visible activity, the center conducts private sector outreach through the Business-Transportation Committee, in which the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry is especially active. TransitCenter members work to make transit more attractive and easier to use through joint marketing, ticketing, information programs, and service adjustments and accommodations.     TransitCenter developed the TransitChek® concept and program using member funding and two grants provided by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to set up the mechanisms for carrying out the program, including:     - negotiating agreements with the operators     - creating a check instrument that would be difficult to counterfeit     - obtaining bank participation     - developing the operating procedures for transferring funds, and selling, distributing, and redeeming the checks     - developing the necessary computer software.    1.3 EVALUATION OVERVIEW     1.3.1 Evaluation Objectives       The evaluation 1) assesses the effectiveness of the TransitChek® program in meeting the goals of the transit organizations involved, as well as those of the FTA's Regional Mobility Program (RMP), 2) identifies system improvements based on experience gained from program implementation, and 3) examines the effects of the increasing maximum tax benefit on company enrollments and employee participation. It examines relevant aspects of the program, including its administration, operation, functional characteristics, effects on participants (transit providers, employers, employees), costs and revenues, and external impacts (congestion, quality of life).    1.3.2 Evaluation Methodology       The evaluation does not undertake new data collection efforts, but relies on existing information and historical records maintained by transit organizations in the program, from interviews with representatives from appropriate agencies, and from other available data sources. Organizations contacted include:     - TransitCenter in New York, and the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) in Philadelphia     - member transit, rail, and other organizations     - participating employers.     To the extent permitted by existing data, the evaluation is a before-after comparison of the effects of TransitChek® on the evaluation criteria. Quantitative measures of effectiveness are developed where possible. However, although TransitChek® has been a popular program among the various participants, and has induced some commuters to switch to transit from automobile usage, many of its effects are difficult to measure on an aggregate level. For example, the increase in ridership due to TransitChek® is small, when compared to overall ridership for a transit operator. Even with measurable changes, it is unlikely that a true cause-and-effect relationship could be proven, given the large number of exogenous factors at work in a metropolitan area. In this evaluation, the effects of TransitChek® are discernable most easily using a ""bottom up"" approach, from information provided by individual employers and employees, and by the TransitCenter and DVRPC.    1.3.3 Evaluation Criteria       The criteria in Table 1-1 are grouped according to the TransitChek® program's objectives.

An effective program will increase transit ridership, the primary goal of all parties associated with the TransitChek® program.    1.3.3.2 Financial Impacts  -      The financial impacts of a program on an organization are of concern, and a cost-effective program is an implied goal, to each participating party. In TransitChek®, the parties that are affected include the transit operators, the cooperative organization administering the program, and the employers. Operators are generally beneficiaries in the TransitChek® program, with expected increased revenues due to increased ridership. Since TransitChek® users are generally pass holders, an operator may also benefit from an increase in fare prepayment, resulting in reduced cash handling costs.     The cooperative organization administering TransitChek® incurs both one-time costs in developing or acquiring the program, and ongoing costs in the form of operating expenses, marketing, and materials. It receives revenues from sales of its services to the operators and employers.     The employers are the benefactors in the TransitChek® system, as purchasers of vouchers for their employees. In return, TransitChek®, as a tax deductible employee benefit, may help employers retain their employees, save them tax dollars, and make it easier for them to provide a transit benefit than to set up programs with individual operators.    1.3.3.3 Mobility of Employees  -      A key goal for both the FTA, TransitCenter and DVRPC is to improve the population's mobility, that is, their travel choices and ability to travel. This is measured by examining the employees' own perceptions of the benefits they receive from TransitChek®, and by their changes in behavior and transportation choices. The savings in transportation costs realized from TransitChek® may open new transit opportunities to many employees. The employer also provides insights into employee mobility by supplying information on the degree of employee participation in TransitChek®.    1.3.3.4 Functional Characteristics  -      The evaluation examines the functional characteristics of the TransitChek® system to determine if it is performing adequately and to assess its ease of implementation. System features, such as the vouchers themselves, are assessed according to the appropriateness of design and reliability. Processes are examined to see if they are efficient, and if they are producing the desired results.    1.3.3.5 Physical Impacts  -      Impacts on the environment and energy usage occur if TransitChek® produces a decrease in automobile use. Reduced automobile usage eases traffic congestion and parking demand, as well as reduces auto emissions and fuel consumption. These are goals of the FTA, TransitCenter and DVRPC.     Traffic and air quality studies done before and after the introduction of TransitChek®, if they existed, would provide data for ""top down"" estimates of the overall reductions. Unfortunately, reductions due to the program are not measurable against the tremendous volume of traffic, emissions and energy consumption in a major metropolitan area. Measurements of these criteria are instead built from the ""bottom up"" based on employee surveys on automobile usage before and after TransitChek®. Estimates of decreased automobile usage, emissions and fuel consumption, and parking demand are derived from employee survey data when they exist.    1.3.3.6 Other Impacts  -      The program fosters a high degree of cooperation among the participating agencies in the form of information sharing, coordination of services, and the joint pursuit of goals. The evaluation assesses the degree to which TransitChek® has influenced these activities among the participating agencies.    2.0 TransitChek® IN THE NEW YORK  CITY REGION      2.1 BACKGROUND      2.1.1 Description of the New York City Region      2.1.1.1 Location  -      The New York City region covers over 4,000 square miles in 18 counties of three states ­ the five boroughs of the city of New York and Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, and Rockland Counties in New York State; Essex, Hudson, Union, Bergen, Passaic, Middlesex, Morris, and Somerset Counties in New Jersey; and Fairfield County in Connecticut. Figure 2-1 shows the New York City region's transit systems.     The area is naturally advantageous to commerce and habitation. It has a protected deepwater port, access to abundant supplies of water, geological substrata favorable to high density development, and water and land routes to other regions of the country.    2.1.1.2 Mass Transportation  -      In New York City, bus, subway and suburban rail services are operated by the subsidiaries of the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) listed below. MTA is also responsible for seven bridges and two tunnels in the New York area.     - MTA New York City Transit (NYCT)     - MTA Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)     - MTA Staten Island Railway (SIR)     - MTA Long Island Bus (LIB)     - MTA Metro-North Railroad (Metro-North).     A heavy rail system is operated between New York and New Jersey by the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation (PATH), an operating subsidiary of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (Port Authority). The New Jersey Transit Corporation (NJ TRANSIT) operates bus, light rail and suburban rail systems that carry passengers to and from the region, and interface with MTA and PATH lines. Amtrak provides intercity and some local connector rail service. Several private bus lines provide substantial additional services from and within New York under the City Bureau of Franchises, and other commuter bus services operate from New Jersey. There are also some private door-to-door minibus pickup services and express routes to Manhattan. A private bus operation is contracted for the Westchester County area. Ferries operate between Manhattan and Staten Island, New Jersey and Long Island leisure areas. Operated by different agencies or companies, these services use varying fare systems and have different information services available to their customers.     Each weekday approximately 5.5 million riders use the MTA public transport services (totalling 1.6 billion in 1991) and more than 770,000 vehicles use the seven bridges and two tunnels operated by the MTA's bridge and tunnel authority. Weekday ridership on other regional systems is also significant: New Jersey private bus - 600,000; New York private bus - 315,000; PATH - 150,000; and New Jersey commuter rail - 140,000.     The recession in the late 1980's and early 1990's caused a reduction in patronage and income. But MTA, PATH and NJ TRANSIT nevertheless continue to invest funds for rehabilitation and capacity expansion over the coming years.     Although crime and fare evasion continue to be a problem on the subway system, substantial progress has been achieved in reducing crimes, making the subway safer and improving its physical environment. Plans exist for systemwide installation of an automatic revenue collection system called ""MetroCard"" by 1998. (As of mid-1995, 69 MTA subway stations were already using the system.)    2.1.1.3 Other Transportation  -      The region's 3,600 miles of freeways and principal arterial highways handle by far the largest share of all surface movement ­ 90 percent of all passenger miles traveled, 75 percent of all journey-to-work travel, and at some point in its movement nearly all freight traffic. Unfortunately, about 40 percent of the expressway systems in New York City are congested during peak periods, costing businesses and travelers millions of dollars annually.     Literally every industry is dependent on the smooth and efficient functioning of the region's rail, marine, air, and truck freight systems on a daily basis. Conrail is the main supplier of rail freight transportation in the region. Trucking is the responsibility of private trucking companies. John F. Kennedy International, LaGuardia, and Newark International airports are all operated by the Port Authority. About one-half of all US international air travelers and air cargo move through these three airports, making the area the continent's leading air freight center. New York's marine cargo facilities are equal to or better than any in the world.    2.1.1.4 Demographics  -      The City of New York has a population of 7.3 million. The region as a whole has a total population of 16.3 million and a civilian labor force of 7.9 million. The median age of the population is increasing as is the number of households as more people live alone or in two-person households. The number of two-earner households is also growing. Immigration accounts for a large proportion of the population increase. The region's labor force is growing more rapidly than the population due to changes in age composition and the increased participation of women in the workforce.    2.1.1.5 Environmental Issues  -      Like most large cities in the United States, New York City experiences air, water, and soil pollution problems. The New York metropolitan area is classified as a severe nonattainment area for ozone according to the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. As such, in 1994 all businesses in the area with 100 or more employees had to submit trip reduction plans demonstrating how they would reduce single occupancy vehicle commuting by 25 percent by 1996. This had a significant impact on affected companies, who considered various options to attain the desired results, from encouraging carpooling, imposing limits on parking, charging for parking, or even eliminating it altogether. Another approach was to encourage use of public transit with such mechanisms as TransitChek®.    2.1.2 History of TransitCenter Development      2.1.2.1 Port Authority Motivation  -      In 1984, the Port Authority noticed increased congestion and traffic flows through its trans-Hudson facilities, the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels, and the George Washington Bridge, which link New Jersey to the Manhattan central business district (CBD). They conducted detailed studies, which revealed that despite severe auto congestion at these facilities during the morning peak period, there would be continued and increased demand for access into Manhattan for the next decade. Additionally, it was discovered that about 64 percent of CBD employees using the bridge and tunnels to commute to work were receiving driving subsidies. About 85 percent of these subsidized drivers were receiving free parking from their employers with an average value of $200 per month.    2.1.2.2 Transit Fringe Benefit  -      During the same period, a group of transit operators were successful in lobbying Congress to secure a tax-free de minimis noncash transit fringe benefit for employees under the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984. As a de minimis fringe benefit, the value could not exceed $15 ($180 per year), or the entire amount would be considered taxable income.    2.1.2.3 Formation of ELTO  -     The Employer Liaison Transportation Office (ELTO) was created by the Port Authority in 1984 to examine ways to reduce auto congestion by reducing the prevalence of auto subsidies through alternate pro-transit financial incentives, capitalizing on the $15 transit fringe benefit, and developing interest and support by the Manhattan business community in promoting transit to their workforce.     ELTO's staff and consultants worked intensively with PATH, the MTA, and NJ TRANSIT to develop a consensus on how to progress in these areas. On an ad hoc working group basis, the transit operators and Port Authority coordinated research and program definition efforts including interaction with the local business community. These initial efforts concluded that there was significant interest within the business community for developing and supporting employer-based transit promotional and fare subsidy programs and multi-operator marketing efforts to increase the involvement of the private sector in transit-supportive activities.     One research effort in particular established employer focus groups to discuss the form of the transit subsidy. Overwhelmingly, employers indicated they preferred vouchers over tokens and passes, to simplify and minimize the costs of administering the benefit. They did not want to deal with individual transit operators, and wanted a voucher that would be redeemable at the transportation provider of choice. However, it was unclear from the 1984 Deficit Reduction Act whether ""vouchers"" would be acceptable to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for dispensing the benefit. NJ TRANSIT and ELTO were instrumental in obtaining a clarification through U.S. Senator Bradley as part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, to include ""vouchers"" as legitimate vehicles for distributing the subsidy, thereby paving the way for TransitChek®.    2.1.2.4 Emergence of TransitCenter  -      The working group agreed that the ad hoc research and exploratory activities should be expanded to create a viable employer-based transit promotional program, which incorporated the transit fringe benefit as a key element. In 1986 PATH, the MTA and NJ TRANSIT agreed to create and fund a private sector transit promotion center, called ""TransitCenter."" Other local transit agencies and the private sector contributed additional funding.     TransitCenter applied to the FTA under Section 6 for a grant to establish a two-year demonstration program to develop its programs. It established a Board of Trustees that included eight transit and rail operators, and two key related organizations:     - Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation (PATH)     - New Jersey Transit Corporation (NJ TRANSIT)     - New York Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA)     New York City Transit (NYCT)     Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)     Metro-North Railroad (Metro-North)     - New Jersey Private Bus Operators     - New York Private Bus Operators     - New York City Department of Transportation     - New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry.     The Board of Trustees was, and is currently, chaired by the MTA and co-chaired by the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry.   The primary goal of TransitCenter was to secure the support of the greater Manhattan business community to encourage the use of transit. Secondary goals included:     - improving the region's mobility     - reducing congestion     - supporting the region's economy     - serving as a model for coordinating multiple operators and securing private support.     To accomplish these goals, TransitCenter proposed developing an employer-based transit program promoting the $15 public transit fringe benefit, a set of multi-operator marketing activities aimed initially at the trans-Hudson market, and joint ticketing and information activities. The emphasis would be on developing a new transit subsidy mechanism: a voucher to permit employees to commute to work on their transit mode of choice.     In the fall of 1986, TransitCenter chose Rand McNally and Company under competitive bid to develop the voucher. PATH, acting as host agency for TransitCenter, performed the contracting on behalf of TransitCenter. By March 1987, most technical aspects of the voucher were settled, the name ""TransitChek®"" was coined, and the focus switched to marketing the product. TransitCenter hired Poppe-Tyson to develop an advertising campaign. Using Dun & Bradstreet databases, they mailed information on TransitChek® to employers in Manhattan. The direct mail effort achieved about a 4 percent inquiry response rate, generating 195 enrolled companies by the end of 1987. Posters and flyers were also developed for posting in stations and vehicles and distributing to transit users. Press releases and public service announcements were produced.     With 18 employers enrolled, the TransitChek® program was launched on October 7, 1987. In a ceremony at the 42nd Street and 6th Avenue subway station, Alfred DelliBovi, Administrator of FTA, inaugurated the nation's first transit subsidy voucher program with the presentation of the first TransitChek® to then New York Mayor Edward Koch. The occasion attracted heavy television and newspaper coverage.     TransitCenter publically bid and contracted with Rand McNally to perform the fulfillment activities for the TransitChek® system for the first two years of its operations. (See Section 2.3.6 on fulfillment activities.) This agreement was extended several times, most recently through a competitive process in 1994 for two years with three one-year renewal options.    2.2 TRANSITCENTER TODAY      2.2.1 Organization and Staffing       Although it receives financial support from an alliance of both public and private entities, TransitCenter is organizationally an operating division of the Port Authority. It is headed by an executive director, with supporting positions of an assistant director, and key persons in the marketing, sales operations, business development, and finance areas. The initial TransitCenter staff of seven, including the director, four professionals and two secretarial staff, is projected to increase to 34 by 1995. Twelve of these positions are being funded specifically by a federal grant of approximately $1.25 million to coordinate the marketing of TransitChek® with the requirements of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act.     A board of trustees, composed of representatives from ten transit operators and related agencies, governs TransitCenter. It meets annually to approve TransitCenter's funding, operating budget, and program plans. Before approval by the board, the three funding organizations, namely, PATH, MTA, and NJ TRANSIT, must separately approve the proposed budget. Three standing committees on operations, marketing, and finances, composed of board members, meet periodically to discuss issues and direct activities in their respective areas. In addition, ad hoc advisory committees are formed from board representatives as needed to support TransitCenter on specific activities. In recent years, ad hoc committees have been established for selecting a new fulfillment contractor for TransitChek® security, for implementing the $60 transit fringe benefit, and for technical advice.    2.2.2 Funding and Expenses       TransitCenter was initially and is currently funded by a combination of public and private grants and contributions, as well as revenues from the sale of TransitChek® vouchers and the TransitLink service. Because TransitCenter's director obtains board approval for its funding in two-year program cycles, the first two-year budget and the current two-year budget are presented in Tables 2-1 and 2-2. (Operating budgets within the scope of the approved funding are submitted annually.)     These tables reveal a tripling of TransitCenter's budget during the seven years of the TransitChek® program's operation from 1987 to 1994. The funding sources have changed significantly from mainly grants and contributions in 1986-1987 to over 50 percent program revenues projected for 1993-1994. FTA provided aid in the form of three grants:     - $1,500,000 in 1987 in Section 6 funds for initial development and implementation of the TransitChek® program.

This group will work with larger companies, substantial numbers of which have not yet enrolled, by helping them set up TransitChek® as part of their Employee Commute Option (ECO) plans.

Each time the fee has taken the form of a per-voucher charge and a shipping charge. The current fee structure is the simplest: a set charge of 4 percent of the value of each TransitChek® voucher ordered, and a set shipping charge regardless of the denominations or number of vouchers ordered.     The portion of the fee based on the voucher value just covers the costs of voucher production, administration and control. TransitCenter makes more from the shipping charge, since employers have been ordering the vouchers in small enough quantities that the shipping charge is more than enough to cover the actual average shipment cost.    Table  2-3 . TransitChek® Fee Structure in New York                                                                                         Year      Shipping Charge (Flat Fee)  Per Voucher Charge                          1987-1988  For 12 to 50 vouchers, $11.00  For vouchers in sheets of 3,          ($15 vouchers)        no charge                                                          For more than 50 vouchers, $20.00 For separated vouchers, $.08            1989-1992    $10.00   12-35 vouchers, $.75                                      ($15 and $21 vouchers)      36-100 vouchers, $.60                                        101-750 vouchers, $.45                                                          750+ vouchers, $.30                                                       1993-present   $12.00   4% of voucher $ value                                   ($15, $21 and $30 vouchers)                                                              The current structure has proven to be a significant source of revenue for TransitCenter, accounting for over 50 percent of its 1993-1994 funding. This share has been increasing each year, and TransitCenter's goal is eventually to be self-supporting, that is, TransitCenter's operating expenses are to be covered by operating revenues, thereby eliminating the need for member's contributions and government grants, by 1997.    2.2.4 Other Activities       TransitCenter provides technical assistance to transit operators in other cities who are interested in developing transit voucher programs for their areas. In recent years, they have met with representatives from other cities, discussed issues over the telephone, provided marketing materials, and, in one case, provided the TransitChek® printing plates to another organization. TransitCenter has licensed the ""TransitChek®"" name to the Los Angeles, Sacramento and Detroit subsidy programs. In particular, they helped DVRPC establish a TransitChek® program in the Philadelphia area.     TransitCenter initiated another service offered to businesses with 100 or more employees, known as TransitLink, which provides a clearinghouse for distributing information on transit via a newsletter, ""TransitLine,"" and an emergency service notifying subscribers of transportation emergencies, up-to-the-minute route closings, and alternate modes. The service also distributes ""The Manhattan Traveler,"" a regional transit travel guide, and various maps to its customers and their employees. Although the service is popular among its 23 subscribers, TransitCenter will not actively market it until it increases its staff to handle the telephones during emergencies.    2.2.5 Plans for the Future       TransitCenter plans for expansion of the TransitChek® program in 1995 on several fronts:     - Establish a satellite office in Westchester to coordinate the technical assistance support group for employers with 100 or more employees.     - Expand the TransitChek® program to vanpools operating under a lease from vanpool leasing companies to reach the suburban employer market, whose workforce using transit is small. TransitChek® vouchers would be marketed by regional ridesharing groups, transportation management associations, transit agencies, and transportation departments as well as TransitCenter.     - Expand the market area of TransitChek® from primarily the Manhattan CBD to include all of New York City, and the mid-Hudson south area.     - Develop a machine-readable voucher so users can purchase fares with their TransitChek® vouchers through ticket vending machines soon to be installed at PATH, NJ TRANSIT, and NYCT locations.     - Offer assistance through a MTA grant-funded program to companies with 100 or more employees, in writing their trip reduction plans to comply with the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act by disseminating information on New York City and state clean air guidelines.     In addition, TransitCenter plans to develop a park-and-ride subsidy mechanism similar to TransitChek® to take advantage of the $155 per month parking subsidy employers are permitted to give their employees under the 1992 National Energy Policy Act. TransitCenter also plans to enhance its TransitLink services and to market it to additional employers in the city.    2.3 TransitChek®      2.3.1 What It Is       TransitChek® vouchers are provided to employees by their employers solely for the purchase of transportation on participating public and private transit and railroad systems in the metropolitan New York/New Jersey/Connecticut area. The vouchers are a taxfree benefit to employees and a tax deductible expense to employers, up to the amount allowed by federal law, currently $720 per year. Employers purchase vouchers on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis from TransitCenter, and distribute them to their employees. Employees redeem them at the participating transportation provider of their choice for tickets, tokens or passes. The vouchers are financial instruments that function like checks, which the transportation providers deposit into their bank accounts.     Significant features of the program include:     - the cooperation and coordination required from the many public and private transit and rail operators involved;     - the simplification of using one instrument to provide numerous transportation choices and fare options to the commuter;     - its appeal to small companies that find it easier to join than pass programs of individual operators;     - its taxable equivalent value to the employee, which is significantly greater than the face value of the TransitChek® vouchers received.     The maximum amount of the tax-free benefit has risen since the TransitChek® program was first introduced in 1987. On July 1, 1991, the IRS factored in cost of living increases since 1984 to raise the monthly subsidy level from $15 to $21 ($252 per year). Effective January 1, 1993, a provision of the Comprehensive National Energy Policy Act (P.L. 102-486, Title XIX, Section 1911 - Treatment of Employer-Provided Transportation Benefits) added a new Section 132(f), ""Qualified Transportation Fringes,"" to the tax code that enabled employers to provide employees with a transportation fringe benefit of up to $60 per month ($720 per year). The benefit may be used by employees commuting to work by public transportation or by vanpool. Up to $60 per month is tax-free for the employee, and the benefit is deductible as an ordinary business expense for the employer. While the new law increased the transportation fringe benefit from $21 to $60 per month, it limited for the first time the value of tax-free parking benefits to $155 per month. Commuters who drive to park-and-ride lots to use public transportation or carpools may receive up to $155 in tax-free parking benefits from their employer besides the $60 per month transit commute benefit. Under the new law, the employee is liable for taxes on any transit subsidy amount received over $60 per month and any parking subsidy amount received over $155. Also included in this legislation is a clause that raises the benefit value in increments of $5 whenever the cost of living index increases sufficiently.    2.3.2 Program Goals      2.3.2.1 TransitCenter  -      TransitCenter's primary goal for the TransitChek® program is to encourage greater transit use for commuting in the New York City area. Secondary goals are:     - to improve employee mobility     - to reduce traffic congestion     - to support the region's economy     - to serve as a model for coordinating transportation providers and securing private support.    2.3.2.2 Transit Operators  -      Similarly, the transit operators' goals are to increase ridership, and consequently, the revenues and the efficiency of their operations. They are also interested in fostering a cooperative spirit among themselves and with businesses in their market area.    2.3.2.3 Federal Transit Administration  -      The FTA provided a significant amount of funding under its RMP for the development of the TransitChek® program. The goals of the RMP are to mitigate metropolitan congestion in cost-effective ways that make efficient use of existing transit capacity, and to increase mobility for all sectors of society in the face of the diffuse travel patterns that have developed in many areas of the country, while improving air quality. Specific objectives of the RMP are to:     - reduce dependence on single occupant auto travel and encourage alternate means of travel     - promote multi-modal and intermodal planning and decision making aimed at reducing traffic congestion and increasing mobility     - encourage a greater variety of transportation choices     - promote a spirit of competition in transportation     - improve transportation productivity.    2.3.3 Physical Characteristics       Initially TransitChek® vouchers were issued in $15 denominations. In response to the IRS increase in the transit allowance, TransitCenter added a $21 denomination in 1992. With the increase of the maximum benefit to $60 in 1993, TransitCenter introduced a $30 TransitChek®, ceasing the sale of $21 TransitChek® vouchers except to employers who had opted for this denomination in 1992. Only the $15 and $30 TransitChek® vouchers are available to new enrollees. TransitCenter discontinued the $21 voucher in 1994, and is considering other denominations to increase the flexibility of employers in choosing a monthly amount to distribute.     Each voucher has a 13½ month validity period allowing companies to order a yearly supply of the vouchers that will not expire before they can be given to employees. The expiration date encourages the employees to use the vouchers before that date, and allows TransitCenter to claim the funds for expired, unused vouchers.     Figure 2-2 shows the front of a $30 TransitChek® and highlights its features. The bank check format of TransitChek® provides a simple means by which transit operators may easily and quickly receive value for the TransitChek® vouchers they collect. A bank-acceptable check, the voucher is the same size as a personal banking check, and is encoded with a readable micr line that meets the Federal Reserve's check clearing standards and specifications. Because the voucher meets all the requirements of the federal banking system, it can be deposited by transit operators into their bank accounts, as they would any other check.     To guard against counterfeiting, many security features have been incorporated into the voucher. Among these are:     - a two-dimensional ""polaproof"" decal, in the upper right front corner     - use of multicolored inks in the background pattern of the TransitChek® logo     - a bar code     - a magnetic strip on the back side     - embossed printing of the validation dates and amounts in special ink     - other overt and covert design features.     An added deterrent to counterfeiters is the level of visual scrutiny the vouchers receive when presented to transit agents for fare media purchases.    2.3.4 How It Works       Figure 2-3 shows a flow diagram of the way the TransitChek® system operates and the movement of funds through the system.     TransitCenter initiates TransitChek® operations by marketing the program to businesses throughout the greater Manhattan area, providing application/order forms in information packets to simplify enrollment.      Figure  2-2 . A New York TransitChek®        Figure  2-3 . Flow Diagram of New York City TransitChek® System       Businesses send their orders and payments for TransitChek® vouchers to the TransitChek® customer service department operated by the fulfillment contractor. From this point on the fulfillment contractor assumes the bulk of responsibility for system operations, with TransitCenter serving in an oversight capacity.     The fulfillment contractor forwards payments received from business customers through PATH for deposit in TransitCenter's bank account, and forwards TransitChek® voucher issuance data directly to TransitCenter's bank. No orders are processed until full payment has been received. The contractor then processes and ships the voucher orders to the customers, using a secured delivery service.     The businesses distribute the vouchers to their employees according to the schedule they have adopted. Most businesses order TransitChek® vouchers quarterly and distribute them monthly to their employees in their payroll envelopes, but other ordering and distribution schedules are used occasionally. Some companies with limited cash flow order monthly; others order a year's supply at once. Some companies give their employees three months' or an entire year's worth of vouchers at once.     Employees present TransitChek® vouchers to the participating transit operator of their choice in exchange for passes, tokens or tickets on the system. Since participating operators accept TransitChek® vouchers as equivalent to cash fare payment, employees may redeem them     - at any subway station     - at any ticket window at a commuter rail station     - at any bus station ticket window     - in ticket-by-mail programs     - at designated retail outlets.     TransitCenter is continuing to make the TransitChek® program as convenient as possible by working with operators and retailers to increase the number of redemption options and locations. However, since TransitChek® vouchers may not be redeemed for cash, bus and train drivers will not accept them for the purchase of tickets that are less than the voucher face value. In addition, cash services cannot accept TransitChek®. Each operator has imposed a limit on the number of vouchers that may be used at one time to purchase fares.     The transit operators in turn deposit the vouchers into their own bank accounts. Through the federal banking system, TransitCenter's bank clears the vouchers and transfers funds to the transit operators' banks.     TransitCenter's bank reconciles vouchers that have been redeemed with data on voucher numbers and denominations received from the fulfillment contractor, then forwards reconciliation statements to TransitCenter. It also forwards redemption data to the fulfillment contractor for customer account reconciliation, ending the TransitChek® cycle.    2.3.5 Operators Accepting TransitChek® Vouchers       As of 1995, the transit operators listed in Table 2-4 would accept TransitChek® for transportation on their systems.    2.3.6 Fulfillment Activities       Although TransitCenter administers the TransitChek® program and guides its development, they contract out certain specialized operations, and have TransitCenter staff oversee the contractor. Key among these are the fulfillment process and affiliated services.     The fulfillment contractor plays a significant role in the performance of the TransitChek® system. The responsibilities of the contractor include a wide range of services that tie directly to the daily operations, voucher production and customer service functions of the program, including those highlighted in the flow diagram in Figure 2-3. Activities include:     - design, printing, and inventory control of bank-acceptable TransitChek® vouchers     - design, production, application, and inspection of security features     - receipt and acceptance of all customer orders and payments     - invoicing of customers     - packaging and delivery of TransitChek® orders     - development, maintenance, and operation of a customer management information system (MIS)     - generation of MIS reports as they relate to customer order history, voucher production, order shipments, and customer payments     - magnetic encoding of TransitChek® vouchers for future ticket vending machine acceptance     - exchange of data with TransitCenter's bank concerning issuance of TransitChek® vouchers and data verification for full voucher reconciliation    Table  2-4 .

In addition to the above services, the new fulfillment contract, which began on January 1, 1995, calls for expanded MIS capabilities and extra services in the area of reporting and market analysis.    2.3.7 Marketing TransitChek®       Extensive marketing of the TransitChek® program has been crucial to its initial success and continuing growth. TransitCenter maintains that growth could not have been achieved with less aggressive marketing. As testimony to the effectiveness of the marketing program, TransitCenter believes that almost all CBD businesses had name recognition for TransitChek® by the end of 1992. The two key components of TransitCenter's marketing campaign have been 1) consumer-based marketing, and 2) direct mail (business-to-business) marketing.     The consumer-based marketing program has focused on employees who already use transit. In TransitChek®'s primary market, the Manhattan CBD, transit users comprise 85 percent of the approximately 1.8 million daily commuters. Employees have educated their companies about TransitChek® either by obtaining information from TransitCenter and sharing it with their companies' decision makers, or by contacting TransitCenter and having the information mailed to the appropriate decision makers in their companies. Consumer marketing includes:     - the posting of ""car cards"" on all operating equipment including the New York City subway and buses, LIRR, Metro-North, PATH and NJ TRANSIT rail and bus systems     - the distribution of ""seat drops"" on the region's three commuter railroads     - the display of ""take ones"" at ticket windows of the commuter railroads     - handouts at major subway stations in the Manhattan CBD.     Direct mail marketing, or business-to-business marketing, provides detailed information about TransitChek® directly to company decision makers: executives, chief financial officers, human resource managers, office managers, etc. TransitCenter has engaged in at least one major direct mail activity per year to about 30,000 companies. The information package mailed is complete enough to allow a company with little or no follow-up to understand the program and begin participating simply by completing and remitting an order form and payment. Appendix A contains samples of TransitChek® marketing materials.     The direct mail campaign is focused on several selling points:     - TransitChek® is a tax deductible business expense for the company.     - TransitChek® provides tax savings to a company over a comparable salary increase.     - Because it is tax-free, it is an employee benefit that is worth more to the employee than the same dollar amount of salary increase.     - It boosts employee morale; employees want it.     In view of the the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, TransitCenter is targeting companies with 100 or more employees, and marketing the program as a means for reducing significantly the amount of single occupancy vehicle commuting by their employees, as required by the Act.     Small businesses are easier to market than larger ones, because often with smaller businesses one person has sole authority to make the decision to enroll, whereas in larger companies, many people must review the decision, and there are certain rules and procedures to follow which are time-consuming. According to an employer survey conducted in 1994, the average enrolled company size was 37 employees with a distribution as shown in Table 2-5.     The marketing program includes public relations activities using the mass media, including press releases, press conferences with public officials, coverage by cable television, and articles in newspapers and periodicals. TransitCenter also continues to appeal to companies already participating to increase their subsidy levels to the maximum allowable by law.     TransitCenter would like to expand the marketing area beyond the CBD. Some inroads have already been made into satellite communities, and into areas where branch offices of companies with headquarters in the CBD are located. Vanpool commuters also are a potential market for the program.    Table  2-5 .

The main objective of the survey was to measure the impact of TransitChek® on the individual transit operators and on employee transit and vehicular usage patterns for commuting and noncommuting trips. The survey obtained responses from 193 employers, representing 38 percent of the 513 companies enrolled at the time, and 2,320 employees, representing about 50 percent of the employees of the companies responding, yielding results with a 95 percent confidence level. Copies of the employer and employee survey forms are shown in Appendix B.     1990 Port Authority TransitChek® Survey ­ In the summer of 1990, TransitCenter conducted a survey of Port Authority employees who had participated in TransitChek® since its initiation in July 1989, as a benefit program for Port Authority clerical and support staff. (In mid-1993, the Port Authority expanded the program to all its employees.) The main purpose of the survey was to measure the impact of TransitChek® on each operator, and on transit and vehicular usage for commuting and noncommuting trips. Of the 845 qualified personnel surveyed, responses were received from 526 clerical and support personnel, yielding a response rate of 62 percent and a confidence level of 95 percent. Survey questions asked in this survey were identical to those of the 1989 TransitChek® Survey shown in Appendix B.     1994 Survey of Participating Employers and Employees ­ In the Summer and Fall of 1994, TransitCenter conducted three TransitChek® surveys. The first was a survey of employers participating in TransitChek®, about 3,100 at the beginning of the year. Its objectives were to obtain information on how employers administered the program, and to obtain their opinions and suggestions about the program. The response rate was 34 percent. The second was a survey of employees at 50 companies selected through stratified sampling by work force size, to obtain information on their commuting habits and use of TransitChek® vouchers. About 4,170 employees, or 51 percent, responded. The third was a survey of Port Authority employees, with questions similar to those for the employee survey. Appendix C contains the survey forms.    2.4.1.2 Interviews  -      The Volpe Center conducted interviews with significant organizations involved in administering and developing the TransitChek® program, as well as representative participating employers and operators. A cross section of participating employers was chosen from the range of industry types, locations, and sizes of the companies enrolled in the program. The participating operators interviewed included the largest public transit agencies, a railroad and a private transit operator. Appendix D contains a synopsis of the findings from each operator and employer interview.    2.4.2 Transit Usage       Direct measurement of TransitChek®'s effects on transit ridership is hampered by limited data available from operators and TransitCenter, and by the small TransitChek® community relative to total transit usage. Consequently, the evaluation takes a less direct route in attempting to assess TransitChek®'s effects on ridership. Using a ""bottom up"" approach, the evaluation focuses first on TransitChek® users, and their stated changes in transit usage and choices of transit mode. Then the evaluation looks at the number of TransitChek® users as estimated by TransitCenter, and the number of TransitChek® vouchers redeemed by individual operators.    2.4.2.1 Changes in Transit Usage  -      The 1989, 1990, and 1994 employee surveys showed an increase in use of transit for both commuting and noncommuting trips by employees receiving TransitChek®, and a corresponding decrease in use of automobiles and taxis. Table 2-6 shows a comparison of the three surveys in the percent of TransitChek® users who increased transit usage, and the number of new transit trips per $15 worth of TransitChek® vouchers. It appears that the percentage of TransitChek® recipients who increased transit usage declined somewhat in 1994, although there was still a general increase in transit usage due to TransitChek®.     Although the table shows the number of new trips per $15 worth of TransitChek® vouchers has also declined, this should be interpreted considering the fact that the average value of TransitChek® vouchers received per user in 1994 is about three times that in 1990. An employee who received $15 in TransitChek® vouchers in 1990 would be receiving $45 in 1994, so for 1994 the number of new commuting trips  per recipient  would be 1.29 and of noncommuting trips, 1.74, or approximately three new transit trips per 1994 recipient compared to 1.75 new trips per recipient in 1989. It appears that the higher subsidy induces the recipient to take more additional transit trips.     Other data from the 1994 employee survey also bear out the effect of the subsidy amount on the number of additional trips taken. Employees receiving $31 or more per month took on average over three times as many additional trips than those receiving $30 or less per month.     Based on the 1994 survey, it is estimated that 1.7 million additional transit boardings occurred in 1994 due to TransitChek®, broken down by the region's operators as follows:     - NYCT - 1,019,000 boardings     - LIRR - 84,000 boardings     - Metro-North - 82,000 boardings     - NJ TRANSIT - 223,000 boardings     - PATH - 127,000 boardings.

Table 2-7 shows that NYCT redeems the most TransitChek® vouchers, followed by NJ TRANSIT, although both percentages have declined with the entrance of more operators into the program. Railroads are redeeming an increasingly large portion of the vouchers.     The table also shows the estimated number of TransitChek® users by transit system for 1989, 1990 and 1994. It appears that the number of TransitChek® users on NYCT has come to represent a significant portion of its ridership; when compared to the approximately 2.5 million riders using the system during a typical rush hour, TransitChek® users comprised almost 2 percent in 1994.

Because TransitCenter does not request the number of employees receiving vouchers from enrolled companies, the number of users is only a rough estimate based on the number of vouchers ordered per period, modified by information obtained from employer communications with TransitCenter customer relations representatives.        As shown in the table, the TransitChek® program has experienced steady growth since its inception, and has accelerated in recent years simultaneously with the increase of the tax deductible subsidy limit. The annual growth rate in total users since 1989 was 31 percent. During the same period, dollar sales increased at an annual growth rate of 66 percent, or about twice the rate of the number of users. This demonstrates the subsidy per employee has increased as the tax deductible limit has increased over the years.    Table  2-8 .

One reason few operators tracked TransitChek® redemptions separately from other types of fare payments is that the vouchers were designed to function like regular bank checks, and are treated as such. Since they do not require special procedures to process, most operators did not want to increase agents' workloads by requiring additional recordkeeping.     Of the major participating transit operators, only NYCT routinely tracked the value of TransitChek® vouchers redeemed at their facilities, and had information on the market share of their revenues from TransitChek®. Table 2-9 shows these statistics. The value of TransitChek® vouchers redeemed at NYCT has been steadily increasing since 1991, the earliest year for which partial statistics were available, both in absolute value and compared with total noncash fare revenue. In 1993, the value of TransitChek® vouchers redeemed at NYCT was 0.63 percent of total revenues.     The average monthly value of redeemed TransitChek® vouchers is growing at roughly the same rate as the legislated maximum tax-free transit benefit, and at the same rate as the ratio of TransitChek® value to revenue, also shown in Table 2-9. These data suggest the increasing dollar value of TransitChek® vouchers redeemed at NYCT is keeping pace with increases in the subsidies users receive from employers. This implies that TransitChek® helps retain current transit users. It may also attract new riders, but not in great enough numbers to surface in these statistics.    Table  2-9 .

Nevertheless, the survey suggests that an estimated 1,019,000 additional boardings on NYCT occurred because of TransitChek®. Given a $1.25 fare, these boardings would have yielded $1,273,750 of additional revenues for the year. Although this is only about 0.1 percent compared to $1,246 million in total NYCT revenues, it more than compensates the MTA for its $500,000 in contributions to TransitCenter's budget for 1994.     The LIRR performed a special survey to discover the volume of TransitChek® vouchers redeemed at their ticket offices. During November 1993, LIRR redeemed approximately $85,000 in TransitChek® vouchers (mostly the $30 denomination), or about 0.34 percent of their $24,570,000 total monthly revenues. This is abouthalf the redemption rate for the NYCT, but it is possible that a slightly larger proportion of LIRR riders are TransitChek® users. It appears that LIRR riders who also take the subway to get to their final destinations may be more likely to redeem their TransitChek® vouchers at subway stations, since the $60 subsidy covers a full month's subway transportation, whereas it only partially covers the cost of a railroad pass.     NJ TRANSIT collected 50,710 TransitChek® vouchers with a total value of $1,244,164 during the first three quarters of 1994, representing approximately 0.4 percent of revenues for the same period. NJ TRANSIT noted that ridership on the system has increased markedly during 1994 after declining for several years. Although TransitChek® redemptions on the system are low compared to total revenues, they have been increasing in both absolute value and as a percent of revenues along with overall system ridership.     Ridership on most transit systems has increased since 1992. Additional transit boardings due to TransitChek® remain small compared to total system ridership on participating transit systems, and fluctuations in TransitChek® usage at this stage of the TransitChek® program would not affect ridership statistics to any great extent.    2.4.3 Financial Impacts      2.4.3.1 On Operators  -      As discussed in Section 2.4.2.2 Operator Choice, TransitChek® has greatly affected ridership, but it is too small to make an impact on overall operator revenues at this stage of the TransitChek® life cycle.     Interviews with the major operators participating in the TransitChek® program revealed that they incur no additional ongoing costs in administering the program. Initially, NYCT incurred minimal costs from installation of black boxes in their ticket offices to read various optical characteristics of the vouchers and from training their employees to use them as a security measure for detecting counterfeit vouchers. The boxes proved unreliable, and ticket agents no longer use them, relying instead on visual inspection.     The TransitChek® vouchers themselves, designed to function like regular checks in the banking system, require no special treatment by and result in no additional costs to the transit operators, who generally combine them with personal checks received from riders when making deposits into their bank accounts. (The similarity with regular checks is also the reason most operators do not track TransitChek® redemptions separately from other checks.)     The three largest participating operators make annual financial contributions to TransitCenter to support the TransitChek® program. (See Section 2.2.2.) Most of the operators also provide TransitCenter with in-kind assistance by displaying TransitChek® posters on their vehicles and in their stations when TransitCenter is conducting a marketing campaign.     Several operators have included TransitChek® as a payment option in their own informational brochures. Before TransitChek® most major transportation providers had begun to recognize employers as marketing targets, and had introduced pass sales programs to large employers in their service areas for improving ridership. As TransitChek® sales increase, the operators are becoming more supportive of the program, because it is beginning to account for a small, but significant and growing, portion of their revenues.    2.4.3.2 On TransitCenter  -      TransitChek® sales from the beginning of the program to the end of 1994 are shown in Figure 2-4. Enrolled employers and employees receiving TransitChek® vouchers are shown in Figures 2-5 and 2-6 for the corresponding period. The large increase seen in December 1992 occurred one month before the $60 transit fringe benefit maximum took effect. It appears that the increased sales are due primarily to the enrollment of new companies, although some previously enrolled companies did raise their employee subsidies because of the new maximum.     TransitChek® program revenues are derived mainly from fees (53 percent). Slippage, that is, monies received from employers for TransitChek® vouchers that are never redeemed by the recipient, accounts for 27 percent of program revenues. Finally, float, the interest received on funds between the time they are received from employers as payment for TransitChek® vouchers to the time they are paid to the operators redeeming TransitChek® vouchers, accounts for the remaining 20 percent of program revenues. Figure 2-7 shows the sources of TransitChek® revenue as of mid-1994.    2.4.3.3 On Employers  -      Employers derive a tax savings from giving their employees TransitChek® as opposed to a salary increase or other nontax deductible benefit. Employers may treat the entire cost of TransitChek® vouchers as tax deductible. Figure 2-8 shows the savings an employer would realize if the employee received TransitChek®s at the $60 level each month, or $720 per year. Assuming the employee were in the 28 percent tax bracket, the employer would have to give a conventional raise of $1,000 for an equivalent benefit, plus pay up to 20 percent more in payroll-related costs, yielding a gross cost of $1,200, or approximately $840 after federal, state, and local taxes (depending on the location of the business). With TransitChek® vouchers, there are no additional payroll costs, and the gross of $720 would be $504 after taxes, producing a net savings of $336 per year per employee.        Figure  2-4 .

Employer Tax Comparison      2.4.4 Mobility of Employees       It appears that TransitChek® has increased the mobility and travel opportunities of employees in that it has made transit an affordable and realistic choice for commuters.    2.4.4.1 Modal Shift  -      The first two surveys showed that TransitChek® created a modal shift away from automobile and taxi usage for both commuter and noncommuter trips. Most of the shift to transit for commuter trips occurred during peak commuter hours. Table 2-10 shows the shifts by trip purpose for each survey. It appears that a slightly higher proportion of Port Authority TransitChek® users decreased their automobile usage than TransitChek® users from other companies. That may be because the Port Authority at the time of the survey was giving the transit benefit only to clerical and secretarial staff, where the benefit would have represented a more significant portion of employee income.    Table  2-10 . Modal Shift in New York due to TransitChek®           % Respondents Who Decreased     1989 Employee    1990 Port      Auto/Taxi Use                Survey       Authority                                                          Survey       Commuter Trips                         15.6           22.8          Noncommuter Trips                      13.7           16.0              2.4.4.2 Employee Attitudes  -      Over 70 percent of the TransitChek® users in the first two surveys said they developed more positive opinions of their employers because of TransitChek®. Favorable comments from respondents included that the program gave transit a favorable image, increased their usage of transit, was simple and easy to use, and helped to defray transit costs and fare increases. The only negative comments dealt with some difficulties encountered in redeeming TransitChek® vouchers. Subsequently, TransitCenter alleviated the problems identified in the surveys.     Over 70 percent of the respondents to the 1989 TransitChek® survey earned incomes of $35,000 or less, with 41 percent earning less than $25,000. The vast majority of TransitChek® users were female, 64.3 percent for the 1989 Employee Survey and 81.6 percent for the 1990 Port Authority Survey. However, it should be noted that at the time of the survey the Port Authority had restricted the transit benefit to clerical and secretarial employees, which positions are filled predominantly by women at the Port Authority.     By 1994 TransitChek® recipients' characteristics had changed dramatically. Only 24 percent lived in households with less than $35,000 in income. About 44 percent earned income of between $35,000 and $100,000. And approximately the same number of men as women received TransitChek® vouchers.    2.4.4.3 Employee Tax Savings  -      Employees who work in New York City enjoy a significant tax savings from TransitChek® vouchers. As Figure 2-9 shows, a $60 tax-free benefit to an employee is worth $101 in an equivalent taxable salary benefit. In other words, for every nontaxable TransitChek® dollar an employee receives, he or she would have to receive a salary increase of $1.68 to achieve an equivalent net benefit after paying federal, state and city taxes.    Figure  2-9 . Value of TransitChek® as a Tax-Free Benefit Compared      to an Equivalent Taxable Salary Increase     2.4.4.4 Employer Attitudes  -      Employer attitudes about the TransitChek® program's effects on employee mobility were discovered through the 1994 Survey of Participating Employers and through interviews conducted with several companies participating in TransitChek®.     The 1994 Survey revealed that employers believed the mobility of their employees had increased due to TransitChek®. Highlights of the survey results include:     - Seventy-two percent of the companies gave TransitChek® vouchers to all their employees, while the remainder gave them only to select employee subgroups.     - Eighty-six percent of the companies gave TransitChek® vouchers as a fringe benefit, about 9 percent gave them as a bonus or incentive for performance, and 5 percent had other policies.     - Fifty-four percent of the companies distributed TransitChek® vouchers monthly, and 21 percent distributed them quarterly.     - The mean voucher value per recipient was $49. The most popular amounts were in the range from $46 to $60 per recipient (49 percent) and from $16 to $30 per recipient (25 percent). Small firms tended to have slightly higher average values of vouchers than large firms.     - Participating organizations offered the following other commute-related benefits to at least some of their employees: free parking spaces at or near the work place (10 percent), reimbursement of some or all of the costs of parking in commercial lots at or near the workplace (10 percent), and reimbursement of other costs of commuting by private vehicle (12 percent).     - Twenty-nine percent of employers have increased the maximum value of TransitChek® vouchers offered since starting their programs, while 1 percent have decreased the maximum value. Reasons for increasing the value were the popularity of this employee benefit (61 percent), changes in the tax code (40 percent), pressure from employees (17 percent), and external pressures about transportation and the environment (10 percent). They decreased the amount because the organization was spending too much on TransitChek® (40 percent), and there was lack of employee interest (14 percent).     - Eighty-nine percent of the employers were not aware of any problems that their employees had experienced in using the TransitChek® vouchers within the prior year.     - When asked to characterize the relative importance of TransitChek® as an employee benefit, 48 percent viewed it as ""very important,"" 40 percent said it was ""somewhat important,"" 12 percent chose ""of limited importance,"" and only 1 percent said that it was ""not important at all.""     Interviews with representatives from eight participating companies about their experiences with TransitChek® confirmed the 1994 survey results. All of the organizations reported TransitChek® was very popular among their employees, and the companies themselves viewed it positively, in general.     - One state agency, prevented from raising employee salaries by state legislation, appreciated TransitChek® as a means to give employees a tax-free benefit equivalent to a greater value in pre-tax salary dollars.     - Although neither could provide any figures, two companies that provide free parking for employees believe some employees switched from single occupancy vehicle usage to transit because of TransitChek®. To qualify for the program, the employees had to relinquish their parking spaces. Other companies located in downtown Manhattan acknowledged that most of their employees had already been using transit before the program.     - None of the companies was aware of any program abuse. US Customs conducts regular audits of the program.     Although the employers cited a desire to promote transit, increase employee benefits and/or improve employee morale as motivation for initially enrolling in TransitChek®, these companies were also keenly aware of program costs.     - Two employers felt TransitChek® was expensive compared to other alternatives. US Customs would have preferred to purchase fares and passes directly from the individual operators using Government Purchase Orders (but the operators refused), and Aegis Insurance Services would have preferred to include the transit benefit in employee paychecks (but this is against IRS regulation of the subsidy).     - One organization, which enrolled to provide an incentive for improved employee attendance, eventually dropped TransitChek® because the employees for which it was intended did not respond to the incentive, and management did not think the benefits of TransitChek® without improved attendance warranted its cost (though the employees supported it).     - Budget limitations were cited as the reason several companies did not increase the subsidy to $60 in 1993.    2.4.5 Functional Characteristics      2.4.5.1 Vouchers  -      The various security features of the TransitChek® voucher design, described in Section 2.3.3, appear to have been successful in preventing counterfeiting. TransitCenter knows of no attempts to duplicate the vouchers for illegal use. TransitCenter is constantly reviewing innovations in design for applicability to TransitChek®, and holds a quarterly review of security measures and techniques with the fulfillment contractor, who is responsible for implementing any new features agreed upon.    2.4.5.2 Check Distribution System  -      Employers interviewed were pleased with the responsiveness of TransitCenter to their needs. Orders were received on time and in good condition, and were filled correctly. Ninety-four percent of the employers in the 1994 Survey of Participating Employers had no problems with the administration of the TransitChek® program.     TransitCenter currently uses UPS to deliver orders, but may switch to Federal Express to take advantage of the Port Authority's contracted rates. The delivery system has worked well, with only a few orders lost or stolen during delivery. TransitCenter has initiated controls to assure that large orders over $10,000 are delivered safely. The fulfillment contractor first notifies the company of the anticipated shipping date. A second call is placed when the order is shipped, giving the customer the expected time of arrival and the carrier's name. Once the order is accepted by the company, TransitCenter's responsibility ends. TransitCenter reports that thefts of TransitChek® after delivery are no more frequent than thefts of other office property.    2.4.5.3 Program Abuse  -      As far as TransitCenter is aware, there have been no major thefts of TransitChek® vouchers. The system is fully reconcilable, and both the fulfillment contractor and bank match the numbers of redeemed vouchers against those issued. TransitCenter will replace damaged vouchers, but will not replace lost, misplaced or expired vouchers.     TransitCenter views other types of abuse, such as employees using fares purchased with TransitChek® vouchers for noncommuting purposes, selling them to others for cash, or using them as a black market currency, as beyond their area of responsibility and control. TransitCenter encourages employers to extract statements from their employees that they will not use the vouchers for purposes other than those intended, but many employers do not do so. In fact, some employers give TransitChek® vouchers to all their employees, whether or not they use public transit for commuting. While this practice may encourage some employees to switch to public transit from single occupancy vehicle commuting, it also encourages misuse of the tax-free transit benefit by those who do not switch.    2.4.6 Physical Impacts       A rough estimate of the amount of fuel conserved by TransitChek® recipients can be calculated as follows. Every commuter who leaves the car at home and travels to work by public transit saves about 400 gallons of gas per year, or approximately 0.75 gallons per one-way commuting trip. Every $15 worth of TransitChek® vouchers sold in 1994 generated about one new transit trip per month, trips that users would likely have taken by auto or taxi before TransitChek®. Assuming employees received $30 in TransitChek® vouchers monthly, it is estimated that the number of gallons of gasoline saved per month was 118,973 gallons for all 79,315 users enrolled at the end of 1994. The associated releases into the air of carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons, soot and particulate matter from the burning of that gasoline, did not occur.    2.5 SUMMARY FINDINGS FOR THE NEW YORK CITY REGION       - Sales of TransitChek® vouchers have grown at an annual growth rate of 64 percent since 1988, the first full year of program operation. From 1991 through 1994, as the maximum benefit grew from $15 to $60, a 400 percent increase, TransitChek® sales grew over 700 percent. This tremendous growth can be attributed to several factors, including TransitCenter's highly effective and focused marketing program, the dedicated program staff, the support TransitCenter receives from the Port Authority and the transportation community, and the transit rich and transit dependent environment in which the program operates.     - The TransitChek® program has made progress toward the achievement of many program goals and goals of affiliated organizations.     It has  improved employee mobility  by increasing the commuting choices for employees of participating companies, and making transit and vanpools affordable choices, especially for lower paid employees. It has contributed to  reducing commuter dependence on automobile  usage; employee surveys showed that automobile and taxi use decreased and transit use increased by 16 to 23 percent.     There is evidence of  increased transit ridership  due to TransitChek®. Survey results suggested participating employees took an average of three new transit trips per month. However, it is not clear how many new riders have switched to transit due to TransitChek®. Anecdotes from employers affirm some employees have switched from single occupancy vehicle commuting to transit, although no survey data exist to support this. Because the number of TransitChek® users is small compared to total ridership on the major transit systems (TransitChek® redemptions for NYCT, LIRR and NJ TRANSIT represent 0.63 percent, 0.34 percent and 0.40 percent of total revenues, respectively), any increased transit usage by TransitChek® participants is not apparent from transit ridership data. On NYCT, for example, it appears that increases in TransitChek® redemptions are more likely due to the increased maximum subsidy rather than to new riders on the system.     TransitChek® vouchers  reduce the amount of cash handling  for transit operators. Riders must use their TransitChek® vouchers to purchase fares in bulk, either as packs of tokens or passes; transit operators will not give cash change for fare purchases less than the face values of the vouchers.     The TransitChek® program has  fostered cooperation among the operators  and the business and transportation communities. This is evidenced by the joint participation of these groups on TransitCenter's board, and by the general success and growth of the program, which would not have occurred without the cooperation of all involved.     The  effects of TransitChek® on congestion are not measurable , given the small size of the TransitChek® community compared to the workday traffic in the region.     - TransitCenter is highly effective in administering the program, and all aspects of the system they have developed are functioning as desired, including fulfillment activities, check design, fee structure, and marketing. Because of their initial market research and careful system design, the program did not encounter any major difficulties once it was set up. Various improvements have occurred as needs arose. For example, the new fulfillment contract calls for providing TransitCenter with easier access to sales and program status information. As they gain experience with the system and as sales increase, they expect the program to be self-supporting by 1997.     - The increase of the maximum tax benefit from $21 to $60 has had a significant effect on employer enrollments; over three times as many companies enrolled in 1993, the year of the increase, as the year before. Likewise, employees appeared to make more new transit trips with the increased subsidy amount.     - TransitChek® provides a mechanism to ease the impacts of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act regulations on both commuters and their employers. TransitCenter's strategy of emphasizing this in their employer marketing program, as well as the savings an employer would derive from giving employees a benefit such as TransitChek® over a conventional raise, promises continued future success in increasing TransitChek®'s share of the commuter market.    3 .0 TransitChek® IN THE PHILADELPHIA REGION      3.1 BACKGROUND      3.1.1 Description of the Philadelphia Region      3.1.1.1 Location  - The Greater Philadelphia Region, shown in Figure 3-1, covers over 2,000 square miles . Situated on the Delaware River, the area comprises ten counties in three states:    - in Pennsylvania: Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, and Philadelphia Counties     - in New Jersey: Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, and Mercer Counties     - in Delaware: New Castle County.    3.1.1.2 Demographic and Economic Overview  -     The Greater Philadelphia Region had a population of 5.7 million as of the 1990 Census; 1.6 million people lived in the City of Philadelphia, while the remaining 4.1 million people lived in surrounding areas. Projections for the year 2020 indicate Philadelphia will lose 4.8 percent of its population, while the suburbs will grow by 6.9 percent.     The region enjoys a diverse economy, a low cost of living and a high concentration of colleges, universities and cultural institutions. In 1993, the area's 2,069,700 jobs were concentrated in the service (33 percent), trade (22 percent), manufacturing (15 percent), and government (14.5 percent) sectors. Housing prices are low (as well as salaries) compared to other East Coast cities.     The Philadelphia area's economic condition has suffered from the recent recession. The City of Philadelphia has been particularly hard hit by both the recession and the trend of businesses moving to the suburbs, losing about 80,000 jobs since 1989, especially in the manufacturing and construction sectors. Overall by 1993, the number of jobs in Philadelphia had decreased by 13 percent and the number of jobs in the suburbs had increased by 23 percent compared to 1980 job levels.    3.1.1.3 Mass Transportation  -       The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), controlled by a representative board, provides bus, trolley, rapid transit light rail and commuter rail services in the Philadelphia area, including the adjoining areas of New Jersey and Delaware. SEPTA is the fourth largest transit system in the US. It consists of three divisions: City Transit, Suburban Transit, and Regional Rail. Critical economic and engineering problems have dominated SEPTA's financial outlook, but patronage has started to recover following the     recent improvements introduced with the cross-city suburban rail link. SEPTA provided about 308.6 million passenger journeys in Fiscal Year 1993.     Feeder service is provided by the Port Authority Transit Corporation (PATCO), which operates the Lindenwold High-speed Rail Line, the first of the new generation of highly automated transit lines in North America, opened in 1969. PATCO provided about 11 million passenger journeys in 1989. Additional feeder service to Philadelphia is provided by NJ TRANSIT, operating an extensive network of buses, light rail and commuter rail in New Jersey.     A 1988 survey of Philadelphia residents showed that a critical concern was the cost of transit. The most frequent response to fare increases was to drive automobiles more. Very few respondents said they were riding transit more because of service improvements; places of work and residence seemed to have the most influence on the degree of transit usage.    3.1.1.4 Other Transportation  -      Philadelphia's situation in the center of the Northeast Corridor affords it broad access to major transportation systems. The region has an extensive network of interstate highways and arterials. AMTRAK operates hourly service from Philadelphia to New York and Washington, D.C. Eighteen national and international commercial airlines provide service to Philadelphia International Airport, offering more than 100 domestic and 15 international flights each day. In addition, Philadelphia is the fourth largest United States seaport for imported goods.    3.1.1.5 Environmental Issues  -      Like New York City, Philadelphia experiences air, water and soil pollution problems, and the Philadelphia metropolitan area is classified as a severe nonattainment area for ozone according to the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act. The Act required businesses with 100 or more employees in a severe nonattainment area to submit trip reduction plans in 1994 demonstrating how they planned to reduce single occupancy vehicle commuting by 25 percent by 1996. These plans were to address options for attaining the desired results, from encouraging carpooling, imposing limits on parking, charging for parking, or even eliminating it. Another approach would have been to encourage use of public transit with such mechanisms as TransitChek®.     However, the state of Pennsylvania and the Philadelphia area, in particular, opposed the provisions of the Amendments through court action, legislation, lobbying and negotiations with the EPA. A tri-state business group known as Penjerdel portrayed the Amendments in a negative light to area corporations, and many are resisting the mandates. EPA in early 1995 indicated it would not enforce the trip reduction plan requirement in Pennsylvania. Consequently, DVRPC changed its TransitChek® promotion to emphasize the program's potential for reducing traffic congestion rather than for meeting the requirements of the Amendments.    3.1.2 History of TransitChek® Development in Philadelphia      3.1.2.1 Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission  -      Created in 1965, the DVRPC is an advisory agency that provides continuing, comprehensive and coordinated planning for the orderly growth and development of the Delaware Valley region. The region includes Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery Counties and the City of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, and Burlington, Camden, Gloucester and Mercer Counties in New Jersey. DVRPC's mission for the 1990's includes:     - conducting high priority, short-term strategic studies for its member state and local governments and operating agencies     - developing and maintaining a long range, regional comprehensive plan     - providing technical assistance, data and services to the public and private sectors.     DVRPC is the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for the Philadelphia region. Besides administering TransitChek®, activities include the formulation of the region's long range transportation plan, air quality planning, and helping develop and demonstrate the conformity of the region's transportation improvement program with the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act.    3.1.2.2 Motivation for TransitChek® Program  -      Given its regional perspective, the DVRPC wanted to demonstrate the importance of transit's role in the growth and development of the Philadelphia area. DVRPC decided a program such as the New York TransitChek® program would be an appropriate means to promote transit to Philadelphia area businesses. In particular, TransitChek® was seen as a benefit to small employers who were excluded from the employer pass programs of SEPTA and NJ Transit, which did not market to small companies. Moreover, small companies did not generally have the resources to dedicate one person to pass sales.     When DVRPC approached major transportation providers and related organizations, most were interested in pursuing the TransitChek® program. A core advisory group, known as the Policy Committee, was established consisting of the DVRPC, the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, the Central Philadelphia Development Corporation, the Departments of Transportation of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and many transportation operators, including SEPTA, NJ TRANSIT, PATCO, Bieber Tourways, Capitol Area Transit and Capitol Trailways (Harrisburg), Berks Area Rapid Transit Authority (BARTA), AMTRAK, the Delaware State Transit Agencies (DART), and the Port Authority of Allegheny County (PAT) in Pittsburgh. These organizations provided a large portion of the financial support to develop the program.     DVRPC, with the help of consultant Richard Oram, a key player in developing TransitChek® for New York, applied for a $300,000 Section 8 FTA grant to initiate TransitChek® in Philadelphia. The grant, received in 1989, along with $110,000 in matching funds from DVRPC, funded the design of the vouchers and the system, and the first two years of the program's operation. TransitCenter assisted DVRPC by sharing its experience with TransitChek®.     TransitChek® and the $15 transit fringe benefit were portrayed as an ""employee benefit program"" rather than a ""transit subsidy"" because of the negative reputation of transit in the Philadelphia area. The program became operational in June 1991, with participation by ten firms ordering over $20,000 in TransitChek® vouchers. After one year of operation, 69 firms had bought $169,540 in TransitChek® vouchers. As of September 1994, 178 firms had enrolled, representing about 5,000 TransitChek® users, and had purchased over $1.7 million worth of TransitChek® vouchers since program inception.    3.1.2.3 Program Goals  -      DVRPC's main goal in establishing the TransitChek® program was to increase ridership on the Philadelphia area's major transit systems, especially SEPTA, through a commuter benefit program. The goals of the participating operators and the FTA were similar to those for the TransitChek® program in New York, listed in Section 2.3.2.    3.2 TransitChek® TODAY IN PHILADELPHIA      3.2.1 Funding       Expenditures and revenues for the TransitChek® program have been increasing since 1991. Figure 3-2 shows growth in actual budgets for Fiscal Years 1991 through 1995, and the estimated budget for Fiscal Year 1996. Table 3-1 details the Fiscal Year 1994 through 1996 budgets, showing on the revenue side, the level of program funding by transportation agencies and operators, and the amount of internal revenues.

However, future funding from some smaller operators is less certain, since they have not realized the ridership increases they expected from program participation.     Internal revenues are generated by slippage (monies received for vouchers that were distributed but never redeemed), float (interest on the balance of monies in the bank account awaiting disbursement to operators), and fees for the sale of the vouchers. In 1994, slippage produced internal revenues equal to about 2 percent of gross sales, float about 3 percent, and fees about 3 percent. Because the $0.70 fee was less than the $1.03 it cost DVRPC to produce and process each TransitChek® voucher, the fee was changed in 1995 to be scaled according to the number of vouchers purchased plus shipping. For the near term, internal revenues are projected to cover the costs of the fulfillment contractor, but it is the goal of DVRPC to make the program self-sustaining, meaning that the internal revenues will cover all expenditures, and contributions from the operators and other agencies will not be needed.     Besides funding, the TransitChek® program receives in-kind contributions from a number of operators. SEPTA, NJ TRANSIT and PATCO provide some telemarketing and advertising services, but an estimate of the value of this and other in-kind contributions is not available. Many small operators that accept TransitChek® vouchers contribute neither funding nor in-kind services to the program.    3.2.2 Staffing and Organization       The TransitChek® program was originally part of the Commuter Benefit Program, which operated under the Transportation Planning Division at DVRPC. Staffing resources included a Marketing/Program Manager and several co-op students full time, and 20 percent of the division's Associate Director's time. In 1993, the program staff was expanded by a full time entry level professional employee.     In 1994, the departure of both the Program Manager and the Associate Director led to a reorganization of the Commuter Benefit Program. An Office of Commuter Services was formed within DVRPC to manage both TransitChek® and the Regional Rideshare program, called ""Share-A-Ride."" The Office's Marketing Assistant works full time on TransitChek® with the Marketing Manager spending approximately 25 percent of her time on this program. The staff is supported by printing, TransitChek® fulfillment, telemarketing, and advertising contractors, and by banking services.     The major funding operators and organizations make important operating and policy decisions on the TransitChek® program through participation on two committees: the Policy Committee and the Marketing Task Force. Since TransitChek® is a program of the DVRPC, it has no separate Board of Directors. The Policy Committee is effectively the Philadelphia program's board, and consists of general managers and marketing representatives from the funding organizations, private industry, and the Chamber of Commerce. The Marketing Task Force, which includes marketing directors from the major funding operators, and representatives of the Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware DOT's, meets periodically to offer marketing advice. An Operations Committee, initially formed to develop and implement TransitChek® system operations, and design the vouchers and their security features, was dissolved.    3.2.3 Marketing       In mid-1993 DVRPC launched a major three-year ""Ride Free...Breathe Easy"" marketing campaign for TransitChek®, emphasizing the three key themes of employee benefit, clean air, and congestion relief. These themes capitalized on the expected needs of companies seeking to satisfy demands of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act to reduce employees' single occupancy commuting. The campaign enlisted WCAU television and radio as a joint partner with DVRPC, a ""partner in a caring community"" offering free community features and stories, public service announcements, and ads. WCAU paid for the ad production, and in return its logo appeared with DVRPC's on publications, posters and newly designed stationery with a clean air motif. The campaign represented a departure from their previous marketing approach, which focused primarily on the program's tax-free employee benefit. Some campaign literature is included as Appendix E.     In 1995, based on limited research and considering the climate of skepticism over the EPA's enforcement of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, DVRPC staff decided to move the emphasis of the marketing materials to the more tangible benefit of less traffic. A new slogan of ""Clear the Road, Clean the Air"" was introduced, and materials were revised and condensed to make program information less cumbersome and easier to understand. A new media partner was sought.     DVRPC employs standard marketing methods to reach potential employer customers and their employees: direct mail, public service announcements via television and radio, Chamber of Commerce mailings, transportation and business fairs, poster and bus card campaigns, etc. The campaigns appeal to employees to request the program from their employers. Some operators have heard of the program from passengers attempting to purchase passage using TransitChek® vouchers, and consequently, have become participants. The quarterly TransitChek® newsletter is also used to market new companies.    3.2.4 Program Expansion and Plans       Although most marketing efforts are directed toward the Philadelphia tri-state area, DVRPC has reached out to cities in which Philadelphia businesses have subsidiaries or branch sites. In addition, some operators that provide commuter service from outlying areas into Philadelphia have agreed to accept the vouchers. As a result several operators and companies from Allentown, Harrisburg, Pittsburgh, Lehigh, Reading, and Lancaster, and from Berks County are participating.    3.2.5 Operators Accepting Vouchers       Table 3-2 below contains a list of the operators accepting TransitChek® vouchers as of early 1995. The list includes not only operators who take an active part in supporting TransitChek® with monetary or in-kind contributions, but also those that simply accept the vouchers as payment for transportation.

The most significant difference from the New York system is that the Philadelphia employer purchases TransitChek® vouchers by sending both its order and payment to a lockbox at DVRPC's bank, rather than to the fulfillment contractor. The bank, in turn, forwards the order to the fulfillment contractor, and deposits the payment directly into the TransitChek® bank account, where it is used to reimburse transit operators for their redeemed vouchers. DVRPC preferred this arrangement to New York's, so that it could maintain constant ownership of the funds, rather than rely on the fulfillment contractor to deposit them into the bank. It believed this procedure would facilitate the transition, if the fulfillment contractor were to change in future years.    Figure  3-3 . Flow Diagram of Philadelphia TransitChek® System       DVRPC initiates the process by marketing the TransitChek® program throughout the Philadelphia tri-state area. Interested employers contact the commuter benefits hotline at DVRPC to obtain an information packet and self-explanatory order form. The employer completes the form and sends it along with payment to the bank lockbox.     The bank deposits the funds into the TransitChek® account and forwards the order form to the fulfillment contractor. In addition, the bank sends the fulfillment contractor a quarterly tape of the numbers on the redeemed TransitChek® vouchers.     The fulfillment contractor fills the orders for TransitChek® vouchers, and ships them to the employers. It maintains a record of voucher numbers shipped, and runs the quarterly tape of redeemed voucher numbers received from the bank against the shipped voucher numbers to detect the entrance of counterfeit vouchers into the system, and to identify unused vouchers that have expired.     After employers receive the TransitChek® vouchers, they distribute them to their employees. Although employers are encouraged to order vouchers quarterly, semi-annually, or annually to minimize associated administrative activities and to give them a backup supply of vouchers on-hand, they typically distribute vouchers monthly.     Employees redeem their TransitChek® vouchers for tickets or passes on the participating transit mode of their choice. The operator redeeming the vouchers then deposits them into its bank account just as though they were regular bank checks. The bank processes the vouchers, and clears them through the federal banking system.     Finally, the TransitChek® bank account is debited by the amount of incoming redeemed vouchers.    3.2.7 Fulfillment Activities       The Philadelphia system handles fulfillment and associated activities differently from the New York system. Activities that were performed by one contractor in New York are divided among three organizations in Philadelphia: DVRPC has the TransitChek® vouchers printed; a service company reviews them for printing quality and fills the orders; and a bank handles the funds. As of early 1994, Commuter Check Services Corporation, located in New York, was performing the fulfillment activities, and First State Marketing Corporation, a subsidiary of First State Bank in Lake Lillian, Minnesota, was performing the banking activities.     Bank activities include:     - maintaining a lockbox for incoming orders     - depositing funds from TransitChek® sales into DVRPC's account and maintaining a deposit log     - producing records of redeemed voucher numbers     - faxing order information to the fulfillment contractor and to DVRPC.     Fulfillment activities carried out by the service company include:     - reviewing vouchers for printing quality     - filling and shipping TransitChek® orders to customers, and producing invoices     - reconciling the numbers of shipped and redeemed vouchers     - maintaining an information system and dispersing management information and data on transactions to DVRPC     - providing customer service support.    3.2.8 Physical Characteristics       Figure 3-4 shows the front and back of a TransitChek®. The denomination is printed in the box on the left as the orders are filled. Originally DVRPC offered seven denominations ($7, $15, $20, $21, $30, $45 and $60), but as of March 31, 1995, this number was streamlined to four ($15, $21, $30 and $60). The $21 denomination is available only to companies ordering it prior to the change; it is not offered to new participants. All TransitChek® denominations have the same security features: water marks in the paper, a striped pattern on the back of the voucher, paper that smudges easily if erased, chemical void paper, a hologram of the TransitChek® logo in the upper right corner, a copy void paragraph (a pattern on the voucher that appears only on duplicated copies), and a laser lock (a process that locks the print to the paper surface).    3.3 EVALUATION      3.3.1 Methodology      3.3.1.1 Interviews  -      The Volpe Center conducted interviews with DVRPC and with representative participating employers and operators. A cross section of participating employers was chosen from the range of industry types, locations, and sizes of the companies enrolled in the program. The participating operators interviewed included the largest public transit agencies and several private transit operators. Appendix F contains a synopsis of the findings from each operator and employer interview.    Figure  3-4 . A DVRPC TransitChek®     3.3.1.2 Surveys  -      In preparation for a full scale survey in late 1993, the DVRPC conducted a limited test survey of employees receiving TransitChek® at two companies participating in the program during the spring of 1993, namely Alexander & Alexander and the U.S. Mint. The survey achieved a response rate of 63%, or 314 TransitChek® recipients out of a total of 500, requesting information on mode of transportation, particular transit system used, type of transit fare purchase, monthly transit expenditures, and frequency of usage both before and after receiving TransitChek®. Survey results appear in Appendix G.     The full scale survey was conducted during December 1993, using a refined questionnaire seeking the same type of before-after information from its respondents. A copy of the survey, entitled ""TransitChek® '60-Second' Survey,"" is shown in Appendix G. Like the pretest, the survey questionnaire contained seven short-answer and check-off response questions.     DVRPC mailed a letter of explanation and a copy of the survey to all currently enrolled employers in the Philadelphia/Wilmington, Pittsburgh and Harrisburg areas, except for Alexander & Alexander and the U.S. Mint. Employers were asked to duplicate the surveys and to distribute them to all employees receiving TransitChek® vouchers. Only 43 of the approximately 144 companies in the program actually complied, and 386 TransitChek® recipients responded. DVRPC staff cited the timing of the survey (near the winter holidays) as the main reason for the low response by enrolled companies. Although not verified, it was believed that within the companies participating in the survey, close to 100 percent of TransitChek® recipients responded. The number of responses received per participating employer ranged from two to 50. Survey results are found in Appendix G.     For the discussions below, the results of the test and full scale surveys have been combined into one data set, except where noted. This combination approach is appropriate since:     - basically the same questions were asked in both surveys     - the two employers of the test survey were excluded from the full scale survey, so there is no double counting of respondents     - together the two surveys provide a more representative picture of the TransitChek® user population, including the range of participating employer sizes and locations     However, the low response rate and survey design require caution in extrapolating the results to the overall participant market; DVRPC plans a more extensive survey for late 1995.    3.3.2 Transit Usage       As with New York, direct measurement of TransitChek®'s effects on transit ridership is hampered in two ways: 1) data available from operators and DVRPC are limited, and 2) the TransitChek® community is small relative to total transit usage. Consequently, the evaluation takes a less direct route in attempting to assess TransitChek®'s effects on ridership. Using a ""bottom up"" approach, the evaluation focuses first on the TransitChek® users, and their stated changes in transit usage and choices of transit mode. Then the evaluation takes a general look at the number of TransitChek® users as estimated by DVRPC and the number of TransitChek® vouchers redeemed by individual operators.    3.3.2.1 Changes in Transit Usage  -      Based on the combined survey results, employees increased the average number of transit trips they took from 7.8 to 10.3 per week after receiving TransitChek®, an increase of 2.5 trips, or 32 percent. These trips were taken for both commuting and noncommuting purposes. While significant, this increase applies only to those employees receiving TransitChek® vouchers, not to the employee population as a whole within participating companies. Except for specific companies interviewed, it is not known what proportion of all employees at participating companies receive TransitChek®. (See Section 3.3.4.3.)    3.3.2.2 Operator Choice  -      In the Philadelphia area, SEPTA received the bulk of new transit ridership due to TransitChek®, with PATCO and NJ TRANSIT also experiencing small ridership increases. In the Harrisburg area, the bulk of new riders chose Capitol Area Transit. In the Pittsburgh area, new riders chose Port Authority Transit. The smaller operators from satellite communities do not show up in the survey. Table 3-3 shows the results of the survey question asking which transit system is primarily used by each TransitChek® recipient; the Before TransitChek® column is based on the 536 respondents using transit before receiving TransitChek®, and the After TransitChek® column is based on all 700 respondents.     It appears that TransitChek® induced many employees in participating companies to switch to transit, compared to the number of employees using transit before TransitChek®. The 164 new transit users represent a 30 percent increase. An extrapolation of this result to the population of nonparticipating companies would not be advised, given that the small number of currently participating companies may not be truly representative of all businesses in Pennsylvania's metropolitan areas. Nevertheless, it shows that in areas such as Philadelphia, where an extensive transit system exists and where the transit market is not saturated, there is a great potential for a program such as TransitChek® to convert a significant number of employees to transit.    3.3.2.3 Growth in TransitChek® Usage  -      Table 3-4 shows the growth in the number of TransitChek® users since the program began in 1991. The number of employees participating in the program is obtained from the form a company completes for its first TransitChek® order. DVRPC does not attempt to track adjustments to that number after the initial order. However, if a participating company drops out of the program, its number of participating employees is subtracted from cumulative figures.     The table reflects growth each year since its inception in all aspects of the program. Since 1992, revenues have grown at an average annual rate of about 60 percent, and the number of participating companies has grown at an average annual rate of about 45 percent.    Table  3-3 .

There was a significant shift away from tokens and tickets to weekly and monthly passes. Transit passes provide operators with the advantage of up-front fare payment, but the disadvantage of inducing pass holders to use transit more often than they would if paying for individual rides. Nevertheless, because the introduction of TransitChek® converted 164 new riders among the survey respondents, the average amount of money spent on transit per month per survey respondent increased from $42.62 to $52.44, a 23 percent increase.

Most operators treat TransitChek® vouchers no differently from other checks received in payment for transportation, and do not separate them when depositing them into the bank.     Operators sitting on TransitChek®'s Policy Committee make sizable contributions to the TransitChek® program's annual budget. (See Section 3.2.1.) SEPTA, NJ TRANSIT and PATCO, in particular, provide in-kind assistance by actively marketing TransitChek® to employers in their service areas. In addition, most operators display TransitChek® posters on their vehicles during marketing campaigns.    3.3.3.2 On DVRPC  -      Figure 3-5 shows the monthly TransitChek® sales from program inception in June 1991, to December 1994. The large spike in March 1993 is due to employer anticipation of a fee increase in April, and the spike in December 1994 is due to employer anticipation of tax changes in 1995. Figures 3-6 and 3-7 depict the growth in number of employers and employees, respectively. These figures, along with Table 3-4, show that revenues and participating employers and employees did not grow as fast in 1994 as in the previous years of the program. This is likely due both to the personnel change and reorganization of the Commuter Benefit Program at DVRPC earlier that year, and to the withdrawal of EPA, heretofore the single largest purchaser of TransitChek® vouchers, from the program. It is expected that with full staffing, the program will experience increased growth in 1995.    Figure 3-5. Monthly TransitChek® Sales in Philadelphia      Figure 3-6. Cumulative Number of Employers Enrolled      in the DVRPC TransitChek® Program      Figure 3-7. Cumulative Number of Employees Using TransitChek® Vouchers      in the Philadelphia Area      The pie chart in Figure 3-8 illustrates the sources of revenue for DVRPC from the TransitChek® program as of mid-1993. About 37.5 percent of revenues came from fees for the purchase of TransitChek® vouchers, 37.5 percent from float, and 25 percent from slippage. Compared to New York's sources of revenues, the Philadelphia program's revenues from fees comprised a significantly smaller portion of total revenues. Philadephia's fees averaged 3 percent of voucher value, since they charged a fixed $0.70 per voucher regardless of face value, while New York's fee is 4 percent, resulting in increasing revenues as voucher value increases. Consequently, in 1995 DVRPC scaled its fee according to the number of vouchers purchased.    Figure 3-8. Sources of Philadelphia TransitChek® Revenue      3.3.3.3 On Employers  -      Employers reap benefits from giving their employees benefits as TransitChek® vouchers rather than salary increases, because of the tax savings: TransitChek® expenses are tax deductible. Figure 2-8 in Section 2.4.3.3 shows that employers in Philadelphia giving employees a $60 per month TransitChek® benefit would save $336 per year per employee over an equivalent conventional raise, assuming as for New York an approximate 30 percent corporate tax bracket.    3.3.4 Mobility of Employees      3.3.4.1 Modal Choice  -      Table 3-6 shows there was a significant shift among survey respondents to public transit as the primary mode of transportation from single-occupancy vehicles. Before TransitChek®, 73.7 percent of the employees surveyed indicated transit was their primary mode of transportation and 20.3 percent indicated single-occupancy vehicles. After TransitChek®, 98.7 percent used public transit, and only 0.4 percent continued to use single-occupancy vehicles as their primary mode.    Table 3-6. Modal Shift among Survey Respondents     Due to Philadelphia TransitChek® Program              Mode of                Before                 After             Percent Change       Transportation          TransitChek®            TransitChek®                              Public Transit              73.7 %              98.7 %              + 33.9 %          Drive Alone                 20.3 %               0.4 %              - 98.0 %          Drive with Others           3.9 %                0.6 %              - 84.6 %          Bicycle                     0.1 %                 0 %               - 100 %           Walk                        2.0 %                0.3 %              - 85.0 %          Total                       100 %                100 %                                      3.3.4.2 Employee Attitudes  -      Information on employee attitudes is limited. The full scale TransitChek® survey suggested 91 percent of the new riders switched to transit because of TransitChek®, but contained no other questions on employee attitudes toward the program. The employers interviewed said the program was popular among their employees, especially those already using transit.     Employees working in the City of Philadelphia save tax dollars by receiving benefits in the form of TransitChek® vouchers, rather than salary increases. As Figure 2-9 in Section 2.4.4.3 shows, a $60 tax-free benefit to an employee is worth $92 in an equivalent taxable salary benefit. In other words, for every nontaxable TransitChek® dollar an employee receives, he or she would have to receive a salary increase of $1.53 to achieve an equivalent net benefit after paying federal, state and city taxes.    3.3.4.3 Employer Attitudes  -      Employer attitudes about the TransitChek® program's effects on employee mobility were revealed through interviews conducted with several participating companies in the Philadelphia area. In general, they believed that employee mobility increased, because the subsidy expanded the employees' commuting choices. Highlights from the interviews are below. (Interview synopses are found in Appendix F.)     - Employers interviewed were not aware of a major switch in employee commuting mode of transportation due to TransitChek®, in contrast to the DVRPC survey results (Section 3.3.4.1), which showed a 33.9 percent increase in public transit usage and a 98.0 percent decrease in single occupancy vehicle commuting. In fact, the EPA discontinued program participation partly because an internal survey they performed showed few employees switched to public transportation.      - The majority of the employees who signed up for the TransitChek® program were already transit users. Several companies were ""captive"" transit audiences, because of their convenient locations to transit and lack of reasonably priced local parking. High percentages of their employees registered: 700 of 900 EPA employees; 80 of 150 Alexander & Alexander employees; 400 of 850 US Mint employees. These companies said the program was very popular among the participants.     - Program participation was offered to all employees of the interviewed employers, regardless of job category and salary, although it was most popular among lower paid employees. The terms for receiving the benefits varied from company to company: one company required employees in writing to give up driving in exchange for the vouchers; another relied on the ""honor system.""     - Most employers distributed vouchers monthly. The monthly amounts ranged from $5 (the employees paid $10 and received a $15 voucher in return) to $21. None of the interviewed employers had increased the amount to $60, citing budget limitations.    3.3.5 Functional Characteristics      3.3.5.1 Vouchers  -      It appears the many security features incorporated into the TransitChek® vouchers, described in Section 3.2.8, have prevented their counterfeiting.     At the autumn 1994 Policy Committee meeting, DVRPC reexamined the large number of denominations of TransitChek® vouchers it offered to TransitChek® subscribers, seven in all. Figure 3-9 shows Fiscal Year 1994 sales of TransitChek® vouchers by denomination. It was decided to eliminate the $7, $20 and $45 vouchers, since they represented only 5.6 percent of sales revenue and 6.2 percent of vouchers for the year. The Committee also adopted a fee structure patterned after that of New York, in which the fees are scaled according to the value of the order instead of a flat per voucher charge.    3.3.5.2 Program Abuse  -      DVRPC is not aware of any counterfeiting activities or the use of TransitChek® vouchers as underground currency. Although DVRPC has assumed liability for any bad vouchers that might slip past transit agents, none has surfaced to date. DVRPC feels confident enough in the present security measures to allow SEPTA to expand its redemption points for TransitChek® vouchers to include supermarkets.    Figure 3-9. FY1994 TransitChek® Sales by Denomination in Philadelphia Program      3.3.6 Physical Impacts       Almost all the TransitChek® users in the Philadelphia area that were driving alone to work switched to public transit upon receiving TransitChek® from their employers, approximately 1,020 people based on combined survey results. If, as in New York, a commuter who leaves the car at home and travels to work by public transit saves about 400 gallons of gas per year, then 408,000 gallons of gas in total have been saved in a year because of the TransitChek® program in the Philadelphia area, and the release of over eight million pounds of carbon dioxide into the air did not occur. Although this is significant, nevertheless considering the 1.8 million vehicles on the road daily in the Delaware Valley, the effects of the reduction in emissions due to TransitChek® would not be measurable in any air quality study.    3.4 SUMMARY FINDINGS FOR THE PHILADELPHIA RE GION       - The TransitChek® program has grown at a healthy rate in the Philadelphia area. Since 1992, the first full year of its operation, it has achieved average annual growth rates of 60 percent in sales and 45 percent in company enrollments. However, it is significant to note that from 1992 to 1993, sales more than doubled. This is the same period in which the maximum transit subsidy increased from $21 to $60. From 1993 to 1994, when the maximum benefit remained the same, sales increased by 27 percent. The lower growth in 1994 is also partly due to a change in program staffing at DVRPC. (Growth in 1995 has improved substantially; sales grew 57 percent during the first five months.)     - TransitChek® has made progress toward many goals of DVRPC and other interested parties.     TransitChek® has  increased employee mobility  by making transit an affordable choice for commuting. There was a  modal shift away from single-occupancy vehicles  among TransitChek® recipients. Before TransitChek® 20.3 percent said their primary mode of transportation to work was the automobile; after TransitChek® only 0.4 percent continued to use the automobile as their primary mode.      Transit ridership has increased  because of the TransitChek® program. Employees increased the number of trips they took per week from 7.8 to 10.3 trips after receiving the vouchers, an increase of 32 percent. Among surveyed recipients of TransitChek®, 30 percent were new transit riders. This suggests that as the TransitChek® program grows, it has the potential to convert a significant number of employees to transit in the Philadelphia area, where an extensive transit system exists and where the transit market is not yet saturated.     The amount of  cash handling was reduced  for operators after the introduction of TransitChek®. Monthly and weekly pass purchases increased, while ticket and token purchases declined.      Cooperation among the operators , private industry and the Chamber of Commerce has been fostered by their joint participation on the TransitChek® Policy Committee.     Given the small size of the TransitChek® user community compared to weekday transit ridership and to the total number of commuters, the  effects of TransitChek® on ridership on specific transit systems and on congestion are not measurable .     - The TransitChek® program has been very popular among employees of participating companies. The employers in the Philadelphia area seem very cost conscious, however, and due to budget limitations have been reluctant to increase their subsidy amounts even though the maximum allowed by law has increased. In some cases they have discontinued the program, because it did not induce their employees to increase transit usage.     - The Philadelphia TransitChek® system appears to work well, and DVRPC is administering it to the satisfaction of participating employers and operators.    4 .0 COMPARISON OF THE NEW YORK CITY AND PHILADELPHIA    TransitChek® PROGRAMS      4.1 TransitChek® SYSTEMS       The TransitChek® systems set up in New York and in Philadelphia are similar in overall design, since DVRPC used New York's model, and received guidance from TransitCenter in system development. But the two systems diverge in several areas.     Activities performed by one fulfillment contractor in the New York system are split among three entities in the Philadelphia system: DVRPC has the TransitChek® vouchers printed; the consultant reviews the vouchers for printing quality, fills the orders, provides customer service support, and produces management reports; and the bank receives the orders and payments, deposits the funds into DVRPC's account, and forwards the orders to the consultant. TransitCenter has opted for administrative simplicity in contracting with only one organization to perform a multitude of activities, while DVRPC has a more hands-on role that allows it to maintain constant ownership of monies received for TransitChek® purchases. Both systems have performed satisfactorily. Two other models for TransitChek®-like instruments have been used in various cities around the country: the sponsoring organization contracting out all activities to an independent contractor such as Commuter Check Services Corporation or Voucher Corporation, and a group of operators performing all activities itself. These two models are beyond the scope of this evaluation.     TransitCenter offers three TransitChek® denominations: $15, $21 and $30. Although the demand for a $21 voucher was considerably reduced once the subsidy maximum was raised to $60 from $21, TransitCenter is continuing to offer it to Chapter S corporations for which the de minimis maximum is still by regulation only $21. DVRPC originally offered seven denominations: $7, $15, $20, $21, $30, $45 and $60. In 1995, DVRPC reduced the number of denominations offered to four, eliminating the $7, $20 and $45 vouchers, based on low sales figures for these amounts in the past. The $21 denomination is not offered to new customers.     The two systems differ in the fees they charge employers on TransitChek® purchases. TransitCenter's fee is a percentage of the total dollar value of the TransitChek® vouchers purchased plus a flat $12.00 shipping charge, while DVRPC's fee is $0.70 per voucher plus a flat $10.00 shipping charge. In July 1995, DVRPC is planning a change in its fee structure to be scaled according to the number of vouchers purchased plus shipping, more similar to that of TransitCenter. The new structure will be: $0.70 for orders of 1 to 89 vouchers, and $0.65 for orders of more than 90 vouchers, plus a $12 shipping fee.    4.2 SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS       The sponsoring organizations in both cities are departments of larger, well-established organizations, the Port Authority in New York and the DVRPC in Philadelphia. Both organizations receive financial and in-kind support from public and private entities of the transportation community. They have advisory boards composed of major operators, state departments of transportation and chambers of commerce.     In spite of these similarities, there are major differences between the two organizations. TransitCenter has significantly greater resources to work with than the Office of Commuter Services of DVRPC. TransitCenter's budget for 1994 was approximately $3,170,000, over ten times the Office of Commuter Services' $277,500 budget for 1994. This translates into about 20 TransitCenter staff devoted to TransitChek® (and TransitLink) compared to the Office of Commuter Services' staff of approximately 2 people devoted to TransitChek®. Even when New York's larger city population (about five times Philadelphia's), larger regional population (about three times Philadelphia's) and larger workforce (about four times Philadelphia's) are considered, the TransitChek® program enjoys proportionately stronger support from its sponsoring organization and from the transportation community in New York than in Philadelphia.    4.3 ENVIRONMENTS       Many factors external to the TransitChek® system itself and its administration play an important role in the ultimate success of the program. Some environmental factors at work in the two cities are discussed here.     It is more difficult and expensive to commute by auto in New York than in Philadelphia. Commuters from outside New York must pay bridge and tunnel tolls; parking is expensive and scarce; and there is severe congestion. While highway congestion is also an issue in Philadelphia and is increasing, there is a surplus of reasonably priced parking available once the commuter arrives in the city. Transit in Philadelphia has a poor reputation; in Center City, transit has experienced a 14 percent loss in modal share since 1980, and in the Region, a 2 percent loss. Ongoing construction projects, while beneficial in the end, have been causing service disruptions and delays for several years, and will do so to the year 2000. There has been a major flight of businesses to the suburbs (where typically parking is free), which trend is expected to continue. In addition, the recession has been easing more slowly in Philadelphia than in New York, and Philadelphia companies are much more dollar conscious regarding employee benefits.     Finally, while New York City seems to have accepted its status as a nonattainment city for ozone according to the criteria set forth in the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, the state of Pennsylvania and Philadelphia area businesses have fought Philadelphia's classification as a nonattainment area on all fronts: through legislation, lobbying, lawsuits and negotiations with the EPA. Penjerdel, a regional business group, conducted a negative campaign against the automobile trip reduction plans required by the Amendments, labeling them ""government meddling."" As a result, EPA suspended enforcement of the trip reduction plan requirement in the Philadelphia area. In contrast, a big selling point for TransitChek® in New York has been its ability to counteract any negative response employees might have to the setting up of employer trip reduction plans by area businesses.     One advantage of Philadelphia transit's loss of modal share in the last decade is that it affords TransitChek® with a greater opportunity to convert more commuters to transit than in New York, wher transit already enjoys popularity. Indeed, Philadelphia survey results show an increase of 2.5 transit trips per  week  by TransitChek® recipients, while New York survey results show an increase of three trips per  month  by TransitChek® recipients.    4.4 RESULTS       Employees of participating companies in both regions have been enthusiastic about the TransitChek® benefit. Both programs have conducted successful marketing programs that have contributed to increasing enrollments in the two cities. Employers have been satisfied with the programs' effects on employees and the service received from TransitCenter and the DVRPC. It appears both programs have made progress toward the goals of increasing transit ridership, improving employee mobility and reducing dependence on automobiles, although in both cities, the number of enrolled employees is still too small to make a noticeable difference in traffic congestion and operator revenues.     Since New York's TransitChek® program began over seven years ago, a comparison of the initial period of New York sales with sales in Philadelphia was made. After three and one half years, the TransitChek® program in Philadelphia has sold just over $2 million in TransitChek® vouchers. After an equivalent period, September 1987 through March 1991, New York had sold almost $7.2 million. The relative sales are roughly proportional to the relative sizes of the work forces of the two cities, although the New York number might have been larger if the maximum benefit had been increased to $60 during the early stages of the New York program. This would suggest that the Philadelphia program, though much smaller than New York's, could be on a growth track similar to New York's in spite of the obstacles of limited resources and the negative transit climate in Philadelphia.     TransitCenter has benefitted from minimal staffing changes since the inception of TransitChek®. The original executive director and other principal staff have stayed with the program, and their collective experience has been of great value to its advancement. DVRPC received a setback with the departure of their two key staff in 1994, and temporarily lost its sales momentum. The hiring of new people and a small increase in the number of support staff has infused the program with new energy that should cause the resumption of the sales growth experienced before the former staff's departure.    5.0 CONCLUSIONS       The TransitChek® program, as implemented in the New York City and Philadelphia regions, has moved toward its goals of increasing transit ridership, reducing dependence on the automobile, improving employee mobility, reducing cash fare payment for operators, and fostering cooperation among operators and the transportation and business communities. It helps retain current transit users, and has induced some commuters to switch to transit. As more employers enroll, it has the potential to convert significant numbers of riders to transit in a noncoercive way, and contribute toward regional compliance with the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act.     The program is popular among the groups it affects. It provides employers with a way to compensate employees with benefits in a more cost-effective manner than a conventional salary increase, because the value of TransitChek® vouchers given to employees is a nontaxable business expense. It provides employees with a tax-free benefit that subsidizes their commute to work. And it provides operators with an administrative-free source of additional ridership and revenues.     The raising of the maximum benefit to $60 in 1993 has had a positive effect on TransitChek® sales, having increased the program's attractiveness to both employers and employees. There is also some evidence indicating that transit usage increases as the benefit grows.     Both TransitCenter and DVRPC have been successful in administering their TransitChek® programs. Employer surveys and interviews revealed that employers were pleased with the service they received from their TransitChek® suppliers. TransitCenter and DVRPC are making progress in penetrating their markets, although they are far from being saturated. DVRPC has suffered a temporary setback in the loss of its initial program staffing, and subsequent momentum in sales. But now that the key positions have been filled, it is instituting some program changes to make operations more efficient, and hiring more staff.     Program revenues in both cities have been increasing each year, and the goal of program self-sufficiency may be achieved in the next few years in both areas. In New York, the increase in ridership on the larger operators' systems is beginning to offset their contributions to TransitCenter's operating budget."

Worth City Council Supports Mass Transportation Plan                                 ""I commend the City of Fort Worth and the Council for taking a major step toward creating a mass transit system that will fuel the future growth of our region. For Fort Worth to reap the benefits of mass transit, the process needs to move forward - and that's exactly what the Council has done today by supporting the Light Rail Starter Project.    ""Now that the Council has approved the Light Rail Starter Project, I am committed to working with the City to move the process forward by obtaining vital federal support for it. While major decisions about mass transit in Fort Worth remain, its benefit to our entire community is clear and our united support for the project's early development is essential.     ""I have worked to support the development of the Dallas Area Rapid Transit System from its beginning. DART has promoted economic growth and revitalization in the City of Dallas and surrounding communities. Clearly, a large measure of DART's success has come through its commitment to serving communities where residents use mass transit. As a result, DART has provided an engine to revitalize neighborhoods - turning abandoned city blocks into vibrant community centers.   ""Throughout this planning process, I have been a strong advocate for extending rail service to Southeast Fort Worth, where the usage opportunities are tremendous and where the economic impact of mass transit would be greatest. Although the current plan calls for the rail line along the Rosedale Corridor to end at Texas Wesleyan, I am aware that there is strong support in Southeast Fort Worth for extending the Rosedale route all the way to Loop 820 and Handley. I urge the City to fully consider this extended Rosedale route as a part of its original plan.   ""Again, I congratulate the leaders of Fort Worth for their commitment to bringing the benefits of mass transit to our region. Working together, we will create a mass transit system that will improve our quality of life and foster economic growth throughout Fort Worth.""         # # #"

Kennedy and John Kerry today announced congressional passage of $1 million for    the Attleboro Intermodal parking facility. The funding is included in the Conference    Report of the Transportation Appropriations bill, which passed the House and    Senate today. The President is expected to sign the bill.    ""I'm very pleased we were able to keep the full $1million for    this critical project,"" Rep. McGovern said. ""This parking facility will be a    great help to the commuters in the Attleboro area. Smart transportation planning    should include ways to make commuter rail more accessible and easier to use.    This parking facility will do just that, in a way that helps parents with children    in day care and disabled riders. I know this is project is a top priority for    local officials in Attleboro, and it will continue to be one of my top priorities    in the years to come.""    ""This project is essential to both the economy and the environment    of the region,"" Sen. Kennedy said. ""Greater access to public transit will help    commuters, businesses and tourists, and will be of special benefit to the elderly    and the disabled. Increased use of mass transit will also significantly reduce    auto emissions and improve air quality across the state.""    ""This parking facility will make it easier for residents in and    around Attleboro to have better access to mass transit,"" Sen. Kerry said. ""I    am grateful to Senator Kennedy and Congressman McGovern for their work in obtaining    funding for this important project. Cutting down frustrating traffic congestion    and facilitating commuter rail access make this a win-win for Attleboro.""    The parking facility is expected to support the increasing needs    of the current commuter rail station that services Attleboro's Central Business    District. Commuter demand at the station currently exceeds capacity, and ridership    projections indicate that the station will need at least 73% more parking spaces    by 2010.    Increased parking and transfer capacity at the station will facilitate    usage of commuter rail, cutting down on intense traffic congestion in the region.    Additionally, the proposed facility will include a day care center that will    eliminate wasted time that parents spend driving to day care each morning. Finally,    because of the proposed facility's location, the Greater Attleboro-Taunton Regional    Transit Authority in Attleboro will be able to move public bus service closer    to the center of the station. Relocation of the bus line will make transfers    simpler for all passengers and far more accessible to the handicapped.

GX234-50-1605098	"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: December 01, 1998        Governor Pataki: MTA To Make Historic Investment In Service         Surplus Funds Targeted to Improve Subway and Bus Service, Maintenance            Governor George E. Pataki today said the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will use $379 million in New York City Transit surplus revenues generated in part by the Governor's historic discount fare policy to make the largest ever investment in bus and subway service and system maintenance. The unprecedented investment will bring service to its highest level in 25 years when fully implemented.        ""The remarkable growth of one of the world's premier transportation systems requires nothing less than an historic commitment to its riders,"" Governor Pataki said. ""We made history by ending two-fare zones and offering the first-ever discount fare plans, the 11-for-10 ride program and the seven-day and 30-day unlimited ride passes. Today we make history again.        ""Under the successful leadership of Chairman E. Virgil Conway, the MTA will commit all of its surplus funds to enhance bus and subway services, and improve maintenance and cleaning -- the largest single-year increase in service in the history of the system,"" the Governor said. ""We can add more bus and subway service, improve on-time performance and make the system cleaner. Our riders deserve nothing less.        ""New York's mass transit system is undergoing a true renaissance, spurred in part by our historic fare discount plans. Now it's time to keep that momentum going by making an equally historic investment in service so we can keep the customers we have attracted and bring in even more riders.""        Governor Pataki said the MTA surplus will hit $379 million as a result of increased ridership, the metropolitan region's robust economy and more efficient and effective management.        At the Governor's behest, the MTA will spend $150 million in service, cleaning and maintenance improvements, including $93 million from the surplus and $57 million from savings resulting from more efficient and effective management. In addition, $161 million in surplus funds will be earmarked to purchase 112 new subway cars to expand subway service. In addition, $125 million in surplus funds will be used to sustain the service improvements by giving the MTA flexibility to address additional  needs.                The additional $379 million for enhanced service comes on top to the $43 million already included in the 1999 budget and the $60 million allocated in 1997 and early 1998 for service improvements.        ""This plan will ensure that we address the immediate needs of our riders, while ensuring that we are properly prepared to make significant investments in service as we move into the 21st Century,"" Governor Pataki said. ""We cut fares and people came back to the system. Now we must be prepared to keep them coming back for more.""        The 112 new cars are in addition to the recently approved order of 100 new ""B"" Division cars. These 212 cars come in addition to 1,080 new cars the MTA ordered last year to replace aging cars. The MTA will use surplus funds to refurbish 120 cars that otherwise would be replaced -- bringing the total new expansion of the fleet to 332 cars. In all, 1,412 new cars will be in service.         ""It's clear that we need to expand service,"" the Governor said. ""By significantly expanding subway service, we can relieve overcrowding by increasing the number of train trips both on weekdays and weekends. That will only encourage more people to use mass transit, and help to relieve gridlock and air pollution throughout the city.""        In 1999, subway service will increase by 330 more weekday train trips and 368 more weekend train trips. Bus service will increase in 1999 with 173 more peak buses -- bringing the increase in peak buses since 1997 to 575. Total bus trips will increase 2,200 on weekdays and 4,000 on weekends.         With additional bus and subway trip increases in 2000, the service increases introduced since 1997 will bring NYC Transit's vehicle miles of bus and subway service to the highest level in more than 25 years.         The MTA also will enhance car and station cleanliness, as well as add more road supervisors and platform controllers to improve bus and subway on-time service. The surplus will also be used to improve subway maintenance, allowing the MTA to increase scheduled maintenance on subway cars to improve performance.        Working with the city, New York City Transit also will begin a bus lane enforcement program aimed at reducing bus bunching and shortening customers' commuting time. Service improvement also will include enhancements to the Paratransit  Program for disabled riders and making it easier for senior citizens to buy and replenish Reduced Fare Metro Cards.        Governor Pataki said about 17 percent of riders are using the seven- day unlimited ride pass, well above the  9.9 percent anticipated by the MTA. More than 6 percent of riders are using the 30-day pass, just below the 8 percent level projected by the MTA. In all, more than 57 percent of riders are taking advantage of discounted fares.         ""This is a comprehensive plan that will allow us to make immediate improvement in the system while giving us the flexibility to make additional improvements where they are most needed,"" Governor Pataki said. ""We are witnessing the rebirth of New York's mass transit system. We can and will continue to ensure the system thrives as we enter the 21st Century.""

GX007-40-6552198	Transportation Subsidy                             The transportation subsidy is a financial incentive that      encourages employees and officers to use public transportation, rather than      single-occupancy vehicles, to commute to and from work. Employees are      eligible to receive up to a $100 benefit per month for Metro-approved mass      transportation. To participate in the Transit Benefit (Metrocheks)      Program, you must:               be an employee of the Department of Commerce or a member of the        National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Corps            use mass transportation to commute to and from work, and             work in an operating unit that is participating in the Metrochek        Program.             You may not receive Metrocheks if you are a driver or passenger in a      vehicle that uses a government subsidized parking space.       To apply for the Transit Benefit Program, you must complete a           CD-543 , DOC Application for Transit Benefit       [O/S Employees], and return it to your Transit Point of Contact (refer to           Questions and Answers ).

GX241-57-13437340	"State of California  Business, Transportation and Housing Agency  Memorandum To:  Tom McDonnell, Chief Division of Mass Transportation DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION DIVISION OF MASS TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM  M.S. #39  Date:  January 13, 2003  From:  Peter Steinert & Toni Clayborne Transit Investment Benefits Branch Subject:  EVALUATION OF DOT'S  OBJECTIVE Contrast other DOT's transit functions with the Department's transit function to identify activities that could be employed to assist the Department in achieving the goal of flexibility and making transit a more practical travel option. DISCUSSION A nationwide survey of a sample of DOT's was conducted - 11 states were surveyed ranging in size from 3,421,399 (Oregon) to 21,325,018 (Texas). The survey revealed that all those other state DOT's are actively involved in promoting transit usage in their states. The survey results are summarized in the attached matrix. Significant findings from the survey are:  Size Comparison Although California is by far the largest state surveyed, (state population 34,501,130) and has the largest number of public transit operators by far (497) and the largest DOT (23,400) we fall short compared to all other states surveyed in the area of advocating for increased transit use, even though we have a set goal of tripling transit trips by 2025. Annual Report All other states surveyed produce an annual report that illustrates the structure/overview of the department, major accomplishments/highlights for the year, public transit operator information and transit statistics. California does not. The staff time required by other DOT's to prepare the annual report varies from one to ten dedicated staff depending on the comprehensiveness of the report. The time frame varies from one month to nine months. The data sources for the report are various DOT databases and transit operators.  Marketing Program All states surveyed are actively involved in advocating for transit by way of some pretty slick materials such as CD's that contain short movies, camera ready art for print ads and busboards, and public service announcements in the form of short videos and 30-second commercials. Illinois modeled their marketing campaign (including Vision 2020) from the State of Wisconsin.     TOM MCDONNELL 8/27/2003 Page 2  Most of the DOT's use slogans to promote transit ridership. Some examples include: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. ""Relax. There's more than one way to get there."" ""Your Ride is Here"" ""32 passengers, 1 tailpipe  riding the bus reduces pollution"" ""You look lonely, vanpooling is a happy thing"" ""Hey you on the bike. Thanks  riding a bike reduces traffic""  The only ad campaign that Caltrans markets is the nationally recognized ""Slow for the Cone Zone"". We currently do no marketing directly related to increasing transit usage.  Organization The organizational structure of the state DOT's surveyed varies in regards to the reporting relationship of the transit function to the Director. In most states, there is a ""Deputy Level"" Public Transportation function reporting directly to the Director. In those states the ""Transit Division"" reports to the ""Public Transportation Deputy"". In Caltrans, the deputy  level function is split between transit, and the other modal and planning divisions. Innovative Programs A variety of new innovative programs have been implemented to address the emerging issues affecting the delivery of transit services. Some of these programs include: 1. Each fall, prior to Maryland's winter/spring legislative session, the Secretary of MDOT visits each county in the state at which time a workshop is held with the state and local elected officials from the county to discuss transit issues. 2. The State of Maryland (pop. 5,375,156) has a 30-minute monthly cable show, and a weekly talk radio program which highlights Maryland's mass transit system and its programs, as well as an interactive CD showing all of their transit systems. 3. The State of Illinois (pop. 12,482,301) uses a catchy phrase ""Your Ride is Here"" with lots of print ads on CD format as well as a video with a 30-second commercial spot advocating bus ridership. 4. The State of Florida (pop. 16,396,515) has a CD on ""Performance Evaluation of Florida's Transit Systems"". They also produced a transit video entitled ""Moving People on Public Transportation in Florida"". 5. The State of Washington (pop. 5,987,973) has a ton of great ideas of getting folks out of their vehicles. Their campaign is called ""Relax. There's More Than One Way To Get There"".     TOM MCDONNELL 8/27/2003 Page 3  6. The State of Pennsylvania (pop. 12,287,150) in addition to producing several transit-related statistical reports has a very well put together video entitled ""Transportation Options...The Choice is Yours"". If that's not enough, they place decals on all the vehicles that are purchased by PENNDOT stating ""Public Transportation Supported by PENNDOT"". These are placed on all the vehicles that are owned and supported by PENNDOT. This effort is to communicate to the public that the commonwealth of PA strongly supports public transportation. 7. The State of Colorado (pop. 4,417,714) has a new resident program that sends surveys out to new residents regarding transit. Once they complete the form and return it, they receive free ride coupons. RECOMMENDATIONS  Annual Report The California Department of Transportation should produce an annual report to showcase what we do as a department to support transit and other modes of public transportation. Noteworthy transit projects should be showcased, and public transit operator information and transit statistics should also be listed. This information could be presented at statewide conferences, local meetings, in-house training sessions, special target-group presentations, and be available to be sent out upon request. Marketing Caltrans should develop a statewide multi-media marketing program that would include workshops, television shows, radio spots, compact disks, video, public service announcements and print ads to promote transit usage. The program should be developed in partnership with APTA and our regional and local transit partners. In-house staff is available to develop this program, building upon existing materials currently available from APTA, other state DOT's, MPO's and RTPA's, and transit operators. Cost of developing and implementing the program could be shared among the partners. 1. Name Recognition One fairly easy way to get name recognition is to have facilities and equipment with the CT logo produced to identify products and services owned/operated by Caltrans i.e., Amber Alert System.     TOM MCDONNELL 8/27/2003 Page 4 2. Vehicle Decals Produce and distribute decals to be placed on the doors or sides of vehicles purchased through Caltrans, similar to PENNDOT, which say ""Public Transportation Supported by Caltrans"". In order to achieve the new goals of the Department, Caltrans needs to realign our functions and refocus on developing partnerships to be more proactive in advocating for transit. By adopting these recommendations, we can live up to our claim of being a leader in transportation and truly improve mobility across California."

The ready availability of low-cost, reliable microelectronics has opened up many new opportunities for enhanced information, communications, and control strategies for transit and ridesharing modes. Many public transportation agencies have been applying recent technological advancements to improve services. To help develop, evaluate, and publicize these opportunities, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has established the Advanced Public Transportation Systems (APTS) Program. FTA's objective is to increase the industry' knowledge of successful s applications of advanced technologies with the expectation that this will lead to their widespread adoption. This report documents a limited investigation of the extent of adoption of advanced technology in the provision of public transportation service primarily in the U.S. and Canada. It is an update to two similar reports published in April 1991 and April 1992. It was not an exhaustive search of every city or transit authority which has tested, planned, or implemented an advanced technology concept. Rather, it focused on some of the most innovative or comprehensive implementations, categorized broadly under three different types of systems: Smart Traveler Technology, Smart Vehicle Technology, and Smart Intermodal Systems. SMART TRAVELER TECHNOLOGY The ""Smart Traveler"" is a person who has access to real-time and reliable information in order to make travel decisions that involve high-occupancy vehicles and transit. The concept of the Smart Traveler encompasses several technologies including smart cards, audiotex and videotex, telephones, cable television, personal computers, and geographic information systems. Activities are focused on the demand side of transportation supply and demand relationships. Passenger Information Systems Passenger information systems provide timely transportation data to trip makers at home, in the office, and enroute, including transportation centers, at wayside stops, and on-board ix   vehicles. The data can be delivered via a variety of conventional and high technology methods, including telephones, direct computer links, and cable television. With links to automatic vehicle location (AVL) methods, advanced passenger information systems can provide real-time updates on expected transit vehicle arrival times, as well as warn transit users and system operators of delays. The newer pre-trip systems are designed for use by people who are unfamiliar with the city and its bus routes. Some include geographic information system (GIS) map displays of the service area. A few transit systems are also exploring direct computer links and use of cable television information systems which can provide scheduling and routing information. The potential for using personal pagers or hand held computers to supply this information is also being explored. Cities with existing pre-trip information systems include: New York City; Columbus, Ohio; San Diego, Palm Springs, Ventura, San Bemadino, and Riverside County, California; Calgary, Alberta; and Ottawa, Ontario. In-terminal and wayside information systems are gradually being installed by a number of bus systems. They provide schedule updates and transfer information for passengers already enroute. The systems generally list the next two or three transit vehicles expected at a particular stop, give transfer requirements and provide updates on any unexpected delays. with AVL systems are planning to have monitors reflect real-time schedule information. Although there are few American examples to date, several transit agencies have installed or are soon to install free-standing smart kiosks which would convey schedule information, trip planning information, and static files such as the locations of popular restaurants and tourist attractions. Some are interactive, enabling the potential rider to query the computer for ridespecific information. Primary concerns include costs for the kiosks and the potential for vandalism especially in outdoor locations. Examples of existing systems include Los Angeles, California and Halifax, Nova Scotia. In-vehicle information systems support the transit user enroute, with on-board displays and communication devices which provide information on routes, schedules, and connecting services. There has been extensive development in the last two years, inspired largely by the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1991 (ADA), which mandates that all X  This  information can be conveyed through electronic or computer-based display devices. Some cities   fixed-route transit vehicles provide both visual and audible information to passengers on major intersections and key transfer points. These automated devices remove the responsibility for announcing stops from the drivers, leaving them to concentrate on driving which should result in greater safety for the passengers. Video displays have not yet been installed extensively on buses. Existing examples include: Salem, Oregon; JFK Airport, New York; and Montreal, Quebec. Real-Time Rideshare Matching The need for compliance with the Federal requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 has led to renewed interest in carpools and vanpools. Car-pooling and vanpooling is relatively common for fixed groups of people traveling to or from work on a regular basis, but rare for other purposes. In contrast, dynamic carpooling is multipurpose and can be arranged either in real-time or close to it (near term). Participants pre-qualify and are put into a database. Upon receipt of a trip enquiry, the database is searched for others who are traveling in the same direction at the same time. Participants can not only use this database to carp001 to and from work, but also to a shopping center, medical facility or any other major trip generator. The concept of dynamic carpooling is new and still in the experimental stage. However, there are some tests of the concept either in the planning stage or in pilot test stages, including applications in: Houston, Texas; Bellevue, Washington; Medford and Portland, Oregon; Sacramento, California; and Northern Virginia. Multiprovider Trip Reservation and Integrated Billing Systems Trip reservations utilizing multiple transportation providers allow the traveler to obtain trip reservations and tickets for a trip (portal-to-portal) from a single source. This would be based on ticketing and fare collection agreements by transit, paratransit, and other transportation providers. An integrated billing system is one in which bills for the purchase of fares for all modes are generated from a central source. For instance, if several different carriers were used for a  xi   trip and the fare was purchased by a credit card, the billing for each fare would be generated by the credit card company. Multiprovider trip reservation and integrated billing systems are being developed in North America, primarily based upon the Mobility Management concept that was developed for FTA. Currently, there are systems being developed in Medford, Oregon; Winston-Salem, North Carolina; and Northern Virginia. Integrated Fare Media Integrated fare media are tickets that can be used on more than one mode, such as a magnetic-stripe card that could be used for both bus and subway fares. There are several North American transit systems that are utilizing integrated fare media that can be used on several modes being operated by different transit agencies. The most common application of integrated fare media involves the use of magnetically-encoded farecards for both bus and rail modes. The only operational system is in Oakland, California. Cities that will soon be testing or installing integrated fare media systems include: Chicago, Illinois; Ann Arbor, Michigan; New York City; and Mississauga and Toronto, Ontario. Electronic Ticketing and Automated Trip Payment Electronic ticketing involves the automated generation of tickets and automated fare collection. This can be accomplished with the use of non-cash media, such as credit cards and/or debit (ATM) cards. Automated trip payments are those payments made without a manual exchange of coins or bills. Often, electronic ticketing provides automated trip payment through the use of magnetically-encoded farecards or advanced card technology, such as smart cards. Advanced card technology typically means plastic cards (credit card size) with a programmable memory chip that can be used for identification, trip payment, and other travel-related functions. Electronic ticketing and automated trip payment are technologies that are beginning to be utilized by transit agencies throughout North America. Frequently, these two technologies go hand-in-hand (i.e., electronic ticketing often provides automated trip payment through the use of advanced card technology or the more conventional magnetically-encoded cards). Operational xii   systems are located on Long Island, New York; in Northern Virginia; and Niagra Falls, Ontario. Implementation or testing is occurring in Chicago, Illinois; Northern Indiana; and Washington, DC. SMART VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY The ""Smart Vehicle"" incorporates many of the vehicle-based APTS technologies and innovations for more effective vehicle operations and control and fleet planning, scheduling, systems operations, and passenger safety. Whereas Smart Traveler technology focuses on passengers and directly increasing the ease and convenience of using transit (the ""demand side""), Smart Vehicle technology focuses principally on the vehicle and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of service provided (the ""supply side""). By making transit more efficient and more secure, it should be more attractive to prospective riders. Automatic Vehicle Location Systems Automatic Vehicle Location systems are computer-based vehicle tracking systems. The system measures the actual location (real-time position) of each vehicle, which can be compared with its expected position (based on the schedule). This information is relayed to the central base station or dispatching center or can be determined by the vehicle' computer. The potential s for improving on-time performance is evident. Data generated over a period of time can be used to plan schedules and routes, collect data for use in maintenance, and prepare management reports. Real-time vehicle location also provides the basis for additional benefits for a transit operation. A silent alarm can be activated by a driver in an emergency and police (or other emergency services) can be dispatched immediately to the location of the bus. AVL can be linked to Automatic Traveler Information Systems which can convey actual bus locations to the public through pre-trip information systems or through monitors in terminals or at transfer points. The system may be connected to vehicle component probes, so that conditions out of tolerance may be flagged, and dispatch alerted. Bus location information could be combined with automatic passenger count data, and communicated to the dispatch center in real time. Bus  x ii i   location information could also be used for automated actuation of traffic signal preferential treatment for buses. The primary components of any AVL system are: a method of position determination; a means of communication with the dispatcher in real time; and a central processor capable of storing and using transmitted information. There are several types of AVL systems in existence: Signpost/Odometer; Radio Location (either ground or space-based); and Dead-Reckoning. The most common form of AVL applied to transit is the signpost/odometer system, which involves a series of beacons or tags along the bus routes. These are normally mounted on utility poles and send out a low-powered signal which can be detected by a vehicle fitted with a receiver or are integrated by the vehicle. The signposts each have their own ID and are spread throughout the system. Several cities in North America have installed these systems. Ground-based radio systems are no longer widely used for intensive real-time vehicle tracking. The Loran-C systems which used ground-based signal triangulation have been largely displaced by the space-based Global Positioning System (GPS). Loran-C radio waves were affected when a vehicle passed a radio station or utility company wires. Florescent lighting on buses creates noise that interferes with the radio signals. As a result, systems based on Loran-C have turned to other position determination methods. There is, however, a form of ground based radio system which is proving to be effective in generalized vehicle tracking. In the Los Angeles area, for example, a private vendor serves a variety of clients in several different businesses including package delivery, an ambulance service, a sanitation service, and a transit system. Global positioning is the technology of preference among an increasing number of transit operations. However, at the time of this publication, no North American city has a fully operational GPS tracking system for its transit operation. Several cities are either planning GPS systems, conducting operational tests, or installing systems. Given the flexibility involved with GPS, it is now possible to consider application to demand-responsive paratransit systems where the primary motive is increased efficiency of service and improved vehicle allocation. Rural public transportation systems are also considering use of GPS to monitor vehicles in remote areas. Transit agencies currently installing GPS AVL systems include those in: Dallas, Texas; Denver, Colorado; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. GPS systems are also expected to be installed xiv   in Baltimore, Maryland; Miami, Florida; Scranton, Pennsylvania; Ann Arbor, Michigan; and the twin cities of Minneapolis and St Paul, Minnesota. A number of technological issues are being addressed. The U.S. military is employing selective availability, which results in decreasing precision of location. The limited number of radio frequencies available in many urban areas has proven difficult for many transit agencies. The issue of map display systems is one that a number of operations are weighing against cost. The U.S. Census Tiger files, although ""free,"" require considerable editing in order to be usable for transit. A number of innovative solutions are being employed. Transit Operations Software Transit operations software usually performs and integrates several operations functions within a transit agency, such as computer-aided dispatching (CAD), computer-aided service restoration, and service monitoring. Service restoration involves the adjustment of vehicle operations based on schedule adherence or scheduled headways, the replacement of a disabled vehicle (which was in revenue service), and the activities necessary to restore the schedule disrupted by a disabled vehicle. Service restoration can involve dispatching a vehicle to replace a disabled vehicle or restoring the vehicle schedule. The vehicle schedule may be restored by adjusting vehicle dwell time at particular stops/locations (e.g., at transfer points), adjusting vehicle schedule/headway, performing traffic signal priority, rerouting the vehicle, or adding a vehicle to the route. Service monitoring involves collecting data on such operational details as vehicle position, schedule adherence, route adherence, headway adherence, passenger data (e.g., passenger counts), status of vehicle components, and traffic and weather conditions. Service monitoring also involves analyses such as determining vehicle performance and loading, driver performance, schedule/route/headway adherence, estimated time of arrival at a specific point or stop, passenger statistics (e.g., passengers per vehicle, per stop, etc.), and system-wide statistics (e.g., overall on-time performance), Systems that integrate software and hardware have been and are being developed to address the operations functions mentioned above. Most of these systems are being developed  xv   for the larger rail properties. The following rail systems are planning, designing, or developing new operations control centers, which will provide real-time control and management: - Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), - Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), - Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, l Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), l Metro-Dade Transit Agency (Miami), - New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA), l Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation (PATH), - Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), and - Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Rail systems are more advanced than bus systems in terms of operations automation because rail operations have traditionally been more automated than bus operations. For example, many rail systems have automated vehicle monitoring through the use of technologies such as automatic train control and automatic vehicle identification, whereas most bus systems have not had vehicle location until the recent advent of vehicle location technologies. Also, many of the AVL systems that have been implemented for bus operations contain real-time control and management features. Existing systems are located in: Ottawa and Toronto, Ontario; and Hull, Quebec. Systems are being developed in Boston, Massachusetts; New York City; Dallas, Texas; Ann Arbor, Michigan; and Dade County, Florida. Automated Demand-Responsive Dispatching Systems Automated demand-responsive dispatching systems include scheduling features which assign individuals to demand-responsive vehicles that are operating in a shared-ride mode. The scheduling components accommodate advanced trip reservations, standing orders, and immediate requests. Increasingly, automation is becoming more available for paratransit systems, specifically in the areas of scheduling, dispatching, billing, and accounting and is based on advanced technologies such as radio-frequency (RF) communications in conjunction with onboard computers or mobile display terminals, CAD, location technologies, GIS, and smart cards. As a result of the ADA, many paratransit operations have chosen to automate scheduling and dispatching in order to comply with several of the complementary paratransit service criteria xvi   of ` Act. The ADA has stimulated the vendors of scheduling and dispatching software to the incorporate many new features, such as mapping or GIS software, to assist in the determination of whether an individual' origin or destination is located within %-mile of a fixed route, and s the scheduling of trip requests within one hour of the requested pick-up time. The level of automation in scheduling and dispatching systems ranges from minimal (specialized software to assist manual dispatch) to fully automated scheduling and dispatch with the use of advanced communications and/or location technology. Many cities have established automated demand-responsive dispatching systems. SMART INTERMODAL SYSTEMS Recently, there has been increasing interest on the part of government, local, state, and Federal, in intermodal transport, i.e., the coordinated use of two or modes to make a single trip. This way, the best aspects of each mode may be isolated for a particular segment of the trip and combined to increase the efficiency and utility of the entire trip. In order to encourage travelers to take this intermodal approach, it must be made attractive. APTS technologies have great potential in this area and are already being applied in several cases. Traveler Information Systems Intermodal Traveler Information Systems are intended to entice the single occupant driver out of his or her vehicle and into a carp001 or a transit vehicle for at least a portion of the trip. Although some intermodal systems only present an array of transit or carpooling options, the trend is toward providing information about the level of traffic congestion by the same means as information about various transit or carpooling options. These systems parallel the basic Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) in that they can provide pre-trip or in-trip information. Information is provided through an interface between real-time traffic management systems and real-time transit or dynamic ridesharing information systems. Although few fully intermodal systems are operative at this time, they clearly represent the direction for future automated traveler information projects. Examples of intermodal traveler information systems are found in Boston, Massachusetts; and Minneapolis, Minnesota.  xvii   Multi-Modal Smart Cards/Payment Systems As stated above, smart card technology typically means plastic cards (credit card size) with a programmable memory chip that can be used for identification, trip payment, and other travel-related functions. There are three types of smart cards (categorized by how they are used): Contact Cards (require a physical contact between the card and the reader/writer unit), Contactless Cards (use a contactless interface to provide power to the card and for data transfer - using inductive techniques for power and capacitive for data reading), and Proximity Cards (use a contactless interface to interchange data between card and the reader/writer unit - using RF or laser techniques). The multimodal aspect of smart cards and payment systems refers to a smart card that could be used to pay fares across several modes of transportation (bus, rapid rail, light rail, highway, etc.). No multimodal application of smart cards has been demonstrated as yet in the U.S. A demonstration of a proximity smart card for Metrorail, Metrobus, and transit parking in Washington, DC is planned for 1994. There are, however, several multimodal smart card systems being implemented in Europe, Asia, and Australia. High Occupancy Vehicle Facility Monitoring The concept of high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes is well established as a means of encouraging single occupant drivers to carp001 and thereby help to relieve congestion. Those traveling in cars with two or more passengers (or in some cases, three or more passengers, depending on the threshold established) are rewarded with a shorter travel time by being permitted to use exclusive travel lanes. Given the benefits of congestion-free travel, there is a temptation for drivers of single occupancy vehicles to use the HOV lanes illegally. Hence, monitoring the use of HOV lanes has become an increasing challenge. The traditional response is to station police cars near ramp entrances, but costs in personnel time and limited effectiveness in monitoring peak hour use of HOV lanes has led to the search for a technological solution to the issue. To date, a number of HOV lane monitoring devices have been tested but none has proven to be fully effective in operation. Experimental tests are continuing, largely focusing on adapting military surveillance techniques or techniques used in law enforcement for such a xv ii i   purpose. Some metropolitan areas have dismissed technological solutions, noting the costs involved in implementation - an issue which has not been fully explored. Transportation Management Centers There are a number of well-established Transportation Management Centers (TMCs) associated with highway monitoring. They use an array of television monitors and cameras to observe congestion levels on limited access highways. Observation of congestion leads to displaying warnings and suggested re-routings on automated highway message boards. Some of the Transportation Management Centers, like that in Los Angeles, also monitor traffic build up on arterials by using inductive loop detectors imbeddcd in the pavement at intersections. Traffic signals are preprogrammed to respond to high levels of traffic build-up on key arterials by extending the green time. None of the current TMCs are yet linked to information about a transit alternative. There are, however, plans to feed real-time traffic congestion reporting into traveler information systems that will highlight transit and ride-sharing alternatives in: Bellevue, Washington; Detroit, Michigan; Anaheim, California; and Portland, Oregon. The U.S. Department of Transportation has just issued a request for proposals for public-private partnerships to address the interrelated issue of enroute driver and traveler services information. Operational tests are planned. Vehicle Guidance Systems Vehicle guidance systems integrate technologies that laterally and longitudinally control the operation of a vehicle. To date, vehicle guidance technologies that have been demonstrated include: track guidance, electronic guidance, magnetic guidance, and vision systems. Track guidance is mechanical, and electronic guidance consists of wire buried in a roadway that emits a signal to guide a bus. There are developments in new technologies that are being demonstrated in the San Francisco Bay Area, Japan, and the United Kingdom.  xix   1. INTRODUCTION Purpose of Report The ready availability of low-cost, reliable microelectronics continues to open up many new opportunities for enhanced information, communications, and control strategies for transit and ridesharing modes. This report describes the implementation status of advances in new technologies in the public transportation industry which have occurred since the last State-of-theArt report (Update ` 92). Background The 1980s saw rapid advancements in the development of information and communication technologies. During this period, many public transportation agencies have been employing certain of these technologies to improve the services they offer. Automatic vehicle location and monitoring, automated guideway operations, and computerized dispatching were some of the earliest applications of advanced technologies. However, the greatest opportunities for public transportation enhancement through advanced technologies are just unfolding as the private sector development of these technologies accelerates. In an effort to assist the development and evaluation of these opportunities, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has established the Advanced Public Transportation Systems (APTS) Program. Through in-service operational tests, evaluations, and publication of results, FTA's objective is to increase the industry' knowledge of successful applications of advanced s technologies with the expectation that this will lead to their widespread adoption. The improved public transportation services that will result should attract more riders to transit and ridesharing modes, thus producing the added public benefits of reductions in traffic congestion, air pollution, and energy consumption. This state-of-the-art update is just one of the initiatives of the APTS program. Scope This effort was a short-term investigation of developments and advancements in the adoption of new technology in public transportation services in North America during the past 1   two years. It was not an exhaustive search of every city or transit authority which has tested, planned, or implemented an advanced technology concept. Rather, it focused on some of the most innovative or comprehensive implementations of new technology approaches. It must be emphasized that this study did not encompass an examination of advanced technology applications in Europe, Japan, or other foreign countries. Nevertheless, where North American applications were few or nonexistent, foreign examples were noted if they happened to be known to members of the study team. They were included in this report only for the purpose of indicating advanced technology approaches that are in use elsewhere and, therefore, which could soon be tried in the U.S. Report Organization This report is organized in accordance with FTA' Advanced Public Transportation s Systems Program. Technologies and applications are discussed under the most applicable of three categories: Smart Traveler Technology, Smart Vehicle Technology, and Smart Intermodal Systems. These sections are preceded by an Executive Summary and this Introduction, and are followed by a list of current FTA-sponsored projects and an Appendix containing a comprehensive list of the individuals contacted during this study.  2   2. s  T TRAVELER TECHNOLOGY  The ""Smart Traveler"" is a person who has access to real-time and reliable information in order to make travel decisions that involve high-occupancy vehicles and transit. Hence, the technologies involved in ""Smart Traveler"" programs are focused on the demand (ridership) side of transportation supply and demand relationships. These technologies include Smart Cards, audiotex and videotex, telephones, cable television, personal computers, and geographic s information systems. The use of one or more of these technologies can facilitate a traveler' decision to carp001 or take transit. This chapter describes five applications of Smart Traveler Technology. These are: l  Passenger Information Systems, Real-Time Rideshare Matching, Multimodal Trip Reservation and Integrated Billing Systems, Integrated Fare Media, and Electronic Ticketing and Automated Trip Payment.  Each of these is discussed, in turn. 2.1 PASSENGER lNFOR MATION SYSTEMS Passenger information systems provide timely transportation data to trip makers at home, in the office, and enroute, including transportation centers, at wayside stops, and on-board vehicles. This information enables travelers to improve their travel decision making, both before they begin the trip and while they are enroute and can include data on transit routes, schedules, transfers, and fares. The data can be delivered via a variety of conventional and high technology methods, including telephones, direct computer links, and cable television. With links to automated vehicle location (AVL) methods, advanced passenger information systems can provide real-time updates on expected transit vehicle arrival times, as well as warn transit users and system operators of delays. Three types of passenger information systems are discussed in this section: - Pre-Trip, - In-Terminal/Wayside, and - In-Vehicle.  3   2.1.1 Pre-Trip Information Pre-Trip traveler information systems reach trip makers in their homes or offices and provide timely information on transit routes, schedules, and fares. In some cities, these systems go beyond responding to specific questions regarding appropriate routes and schedule times to provide automated trip planning. Recently, there has been an increasing number of sites electing not only to provide transit information, but information on other travel modes as well. (These systems will be discussed further in Chapter 4 of this report.) The objectives in using technology in pre-trip information services are to increase efficiency in responding to calls and to improve the accuracy and completeness of information supplied. Efficiency can be increased by using touch tone telephones and/or voice synthesizers to report back information on routes and schedules much as telephone companies do with directory assistance. In this way, many calls, especially those for basic information are pre-screened. A number of transit systems feel that it is important to have a person initially answer and direct the call in order to convey personal interest. Computer data retrieval systems provide quick and accurate information to the operator to respond to the customer' inquiry. s State-of-the-Art Summary Although the early systems were primarily directed toward riders who knew the basic bus routes and who only wanted to be updated on schedules and transfers, the newer systems are also designed for use by potential new riders, those who do not know routes and the locations of bus stops. Also, the newer systems are designed to be used by operators who are unfamiliar with the city and its bus routes. All the traveler needs to supply are the cross streets of origin and destination. The operator can enter the city-wide data bank where routes and schedules are associated with street locations. Some newer information systems include GIS map displays of the service area. The operator can use these to locate the closest route and stop to the street comer referenced. by the caller and then apply network analysis. origin and destination supplied by the caller. Other bus systems use extensive computer data banks which can accomplish trip planning by associating the points of  4   A few transit systems are also exploring direct computer links and use of cable television information systems which can provide scheduling and routing information. The potential for using personal pagers or hand held computers to supply this information is also being explored. With the expanding interest in AVL systems, the potential for providing real-time information on bus arrival and departure times at bus stops system-wide is coming closer to reality. Real-time schedule information can be made available through telephones, computers, televisions, and personal pagers. Applications Columbus, Ohio An automated transit information system designed by Megadyne was introduced in late 1992. It has proven to be a time saver for the Central Ohio Transit Authority' (COTA) s customers and customer service representatives. Training time for new customer service representatives has been cut in half and the volume of calls handled has increased considerably.' San Diego, California An automated trip planning system developed by Tidewater Consultants of Virginia Beach provides a variety of information about bus and trolley systems for a large portion of San Diego County. Travelers may call InfoExpress, a computer-based system, to request information on ways to travel between points. can be handled with InfoExpress. Human clerks answer the more complex questions, assisted by a computer-based trip planning system which can identify in a few seconds the optimum routing between any two points in the huge 1,000 square mile service area. Clerks provide a human touch answering the caller in English, Spanish, or Tagalog. The information is retrieved from the computer database, and a computer voice gives the caller the answer. Many more calls are being answered with the Answers are provided in English or Spanish and include information on routes, schedules, and stop locations. About 20 percent of the incoming calls  [1]  ""Columbus Uses Team Effort to Better Serve Customers, "" Passenger Transport, March 29, 1993.  5   new system. previously.*  Only about four percent of calls are lost, compared to about 30 percent  Calgary, Alberta Calgary Transit provides bus schedule information for prospective passengers. The passenger must know his or her bus stop number before calling from home or work to find out when the next few buses will arrive at that stop. The system is computerized but does not use real-time bus location information. This type of system requires that the caller have knowledge of the bus network. For those who do not know the bus routes, it is still possible to call a customer information number and talk directly to a customer service operator.3 New York City, New York The customer information service provided by the New York City Transit Authority can handle large volumes of calls with the use of a computerized telephone response system designed by Tidewater Consultants. Callers are given the option of talking directly with a customer agent, but only a small number do so. This system supplies intermodal information on how to travel from origin to destination. It can provide schedules and routes of subways, buses, and ferries and transfers between them. Customer agents do not need to know the city personally, since the system includes a Geographic Information System which can identify the caller' origin s and destination by street segment. Those segments are linked to transit routes.4 Ottawa, Ontario Ottawa-Carleton Transit has developed an automatic telephone system (called the 560 system) over the last ten years. The entire city has been covered since 1991. This system provides the individual caller with information on the scheduled arrival time of the next two  [2] [3] [4 ]  ""Info Express,"" Bus Line, April 1992. Theresa Brock, San Diego Transit Corporation. Fred Warg, Calgary Transit. Andi Overton, Tidewater Consultants.   buses at a particular stop. Plans call for adding a run plate to the front of the bus. These plates would then be read as the bus leaves or enters the garage and actual and printed schedules could be compared. (See also Section 3.2.) Washington, District of Columbia The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) plans to operate paratransit as a feeder to fixed-route service and has recently issued an RFP to have a computeroperated information system designed to respond to requests regarding both fixed-route and paratransit trips. This concept may be of interest to other transit agencies responding to the requirements for complementary paratransit service specified in the Americans with Disability Act. Other California Sites Riverside Transit Authority (California), Sunline Transit (Palm Springs), Ventura County Transit Commission, Omni Transit (San Bemadino), and Culver City Transit are currently using an automated telephone traveler information system developed by Transtar. These systems provide the prospective passenger not only with schedules, but also with information on trip length, trip time, and walking distance to the bus stop.' Germany Some German cities have introduced innovative telephone-based information systems that permit residents to request rides between any two checkpoints at any time. The rider calls for the trip as needed and supplies the telephone operator with origin and destination checkpoint numbers, requested departure time, number traveling, and special needs. A computer analyzes the request and assigns vehicles to pick up the traveler, generally within seven minutes. Such a concept could be adapted to rideshare.6  [5 ] [6 ]  Bob Kohl, Transtar. Behnke, Robert, ""The Need for IVHS Technologies in U.S. Public Transportation Systems,"" Aegis Transportation Systems, 1993.  7   2.1.2 In-Terminal and Wayside Information Systems In-terminal and wayside information systems provide schedule updates and transfer information for passengers already enroute. They generally list the next two or three transit vehicles expected at a particular stop, give transfer requirements and provide updates on any unexpected delays. This information can be conveyed through electronic or computer-based display devices. Although automated displays announcing the arrival of trains and providing updates on airplane schedules are well established, they are still not regular features in bus terminals and transfer points. State-of-the-Art Summary In-terminal and wayside information systems are gradually being installed by a number of bus systems. Some transit agencies are also exploring the placement of computer-based monitors at locations that are potential transit generators. Some cities with AVL systems are planning to have monitors reflect real-time schedule. There is some debate, however, regarding the advisability of providing real-time arrival times. If a traveler is informed that the bus is running five minutes late and makes plans accordingly, it is possible that the bus can make up time and arrive at the stop earlier than predicted. This might cause the traveler who relied on the information to miss the bus. Some transit agencies are considering providing free standing smart kiosks which would convey schedule information, trip planning information, and static files such as the locations of popular restaurants and tourist attractions. Some are interactive, enabling the potential rider to query the computer for ride-specific information. These smart kiosks proved to be successful in connection with the automobile-based TravTec experiment in Orlando, Florida. They could, therefore, be located at potential transit rider generators including hotel lobbies, convention centers, office parks, and park-and-ride lots. They also can be linked to a bus AVL system and provide real-time transit information. Primary concerns include costs for the kiosks and the potential for vandalism especially in outdoor locations. To date, there are few American examples of remote kiosks being used to convey transit information.   Applications Halifax, Nova Scotia Video terminals are located in transit terminals and malls. Displays list the Metro Transit routes that stop at that location and the time at which the bus will arrive in real time. To access this information, a traveler punches in a four-digit code number signifying his or her location. Anaheim, California Anaheim currently has remote kiosks located at some locations, including the Anaheim Hilton and the Anaheim Stadium, which provide real-time roadway congestion information. Cable TV also provides this information. To date, however, transit information is not provided at these kiosks.7 Los Angeles, California The Los Angeles Smart Traveler program provides pre-trip information on bus schedules and also on kiosks located at Union Station, Arco Plaza, and a shopping mall. Beginning on or about November 1, the kiosks not only were to provide current information on bus, light rail, and heavy rail schedules but also were to include display maps showing congestion on freeways and adjoining arterials. The electronic displays are provided by SilentRadio, a division of Cybernetic Data Products, which has supplied indoor/outdoor LED message displays to AmTrak. The displays are located on station platforms and provide transit arrival information. They are readable in sunlight and equipped with StenoText verbal translation for the hearing impaired. Further, they are weather-proof and are treated with a polycarbonate facia to protect against vandalism. The displays can be programmed and updated from a central location, but are not yet triggered automatically by the vehicles themselves.*  [ 7]  Jim Paral, City of Anaheim, Public Works-Engineering Department.

[8 ]  9   Yosemite Park, California The number of summer visitors to Yosemite National Park has increased to such an extent that the park is frequently congested in the summer months and the limited roadways serving the park are unable to handle the traffic. Travel conditions also change abruptly in the mountain passes due to weather. In an effort to provide dynamic as well as static traveler information, four smart kiosks will be placed at the entrance to the park, five within the park, and five on approaches to the park. These kiosks will provide information on congestion, road and pass conditions, and attractions and lodging information.9 Broward County, Florida Broward County Transit Authority has installed televiewer services in terminals. Similar systems have been installed in Toronto, Kinchener, and Guelph, Ontario, while a Spanish version has been installed in San Juan, Puerto Rico. These viewers, developed by TelerideSage, are similar to the monitors used in airports, but have much sharper graphics. They present material on arrivals and departures, detours, delays, cancellations, and fares. The arrival and departure information is real-time since it is based on sensors that are located on the approach to the station. The televiewers also can display advertisements or store promotions.10 Minneapolis, Minnesota As part of the overall Guidestar project, Travlink anticipates providing real-time transit and traffic information by installing smart kiosks at shopping malls and transit stations as well as making information available on terminals at home and at work places. They also hope to indicate the time saved through use of HOV lanes. (See Section 4.1 for a further discussion of Guidestar.)

Brian Kalanda, Teleride-Sage.  10   Birmingham, England A very ambitious program is being conducted in Birmingham, England as part of the DRIVE Program. Tests will be run on several types of interactive terminals. A computer system will be provided at the central base station for use by the information operators, which will calculate optimum routes. The system will include a map display, Similar facilities will be provided in self-service terminals on the street. These will have screen-based displays, supplemented by optional print-outs, giving timetables and a map showing recommended walking routes to the nearest bus stop. Five such terminals will be installed for the initial test. In addition, home terminals will provide real-time information on departure times at specified bus stops. Twenty such terminals will be tested initially. Portable hand held terminals are also being developed as part of project PROMISE in the Drive program. Passive real-time information will be displayed at a sample of bus stops where the arrival times of the next few buses will be posted. An initial test involves fifty buses from three independent operators. Ten stops will be equipped with the displays. Information also will be provided to automobile drivers. Displays in automobiles will indicate the closest park-and-ride location as well as real-time information on traffic congestion.11 2.1.3 In-Vehicle Information Systems In-vehicle information systems include technical innovations which support the transit user enroute. Travelers are aided by on-board displays and communication devices which provide information on routes, schedules, and connecting services. This is an area which has seen extensive development in the last two years. Much of the inspiration has come from the requirements imposed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1991. The Act requires that all fixed-route transit vehicles provide both visual and audible information to passengers on major intersections and key transfer points. The new equipment, including enunciators and visual display boards have made the systems more user friendly for all passengers. These  [11 ]  Blackledge, David and Laurie Pickup, ""Public Transport Passenger Information Systems: The Potential of Advanced Transport Telematics, "" Proceedings of the IVHS America Annual Meeting 1993, pp. 295-301.  11   automated devices remove the responsibility for announcing stops from the drivers, leaving them to concentrate on driving which should result in greater safety for the passengers. State-of-the-Art Summary Since they operate primarily on exclusive right-of-ways, rail systems are able to provide audio announcements for the various stops with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Bus announcements are more difficult. Some bus systems are preprogrammed to announce stops based on door openings while others respond to sensors placed in the streets. Far more accurate information will come from use of an AVL system which can closely determine position and trigger audio messages. This concept is beginning to spread. Nevertheless, video displays have not yet been installed extensively on buses. Applications Salem, Oregon Four of Salem, Oregon' 54 buses are now equipped with voice enunciators supplied by s Digital Recorders. They have been operating for almost a year. These buses announce stops at major intersections and also provide information to passengers on local retailer promotions. They will be used for more general advertising once all 54 buses are equipped. The approach provides an efficient means of complying with the regulations of the Americans with Disabilities Act - passengers receive relevant information without regularly involving the driver. This system runs on a timer that is activated by a button pressed by the driver. Orange, Osceola, and Seminole Counties, Florida The LYNX bus system has 47 enunciators on order from Digital Recorders with operation scheduled to begin November 1993. They plan to have 300 to 400 buses equipped by 1996. These will announce each stop in this multi-county system.13 12  [12] [1 3]  Greg Cook, Salem Transit. Glenn Parrish, LYNX bus system.  12   JFK Airport, New York Caravan operates the ground transportation services for John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. They currently have 36 ""talking buses"" on line. Inside the bus, the stops are announced; the routes are announced outside the bus at each stop. The same route information is displayed on an LED sign display outside the bus. The system operates automatically but can also be operated manually by the driver. The system, designed by Digital Recorders, is operating effectively and plans call for expansion.14 Other cities are also experimenting with ""talking bus"" enunciators. Wilmington, Delaware has two test units of the talking bus in operation. Atlanta, Georgia is considering using multilingual enunciators during the Olympics."" Montreal, Quebec An in-vehicle information system is in use on the Montreal Metro rapid rail system. A bright lighted display developed by Telecite has now been installed in all subway cars. The flat view, high intensity, LED display screen is placed on the side of the individual cars. This display presents not only the name of the next stop but also can relay any retail store promotions associated with that stop. The advertisements are paid for by the stores. The messages are transmitted via a data radio network from one or more control centers to receivers inside the metro cars. Between stops the displays present weather reports, sports reports, news headlines and information on upcoming events. Advertisements and messages are presented in animated cartoon imagery. The system, which benefits the elderly and persons with disabilities, has been very positively received by the general public as well.l6  Jeff DeStephano, Caravan Bus Lines.

Visual displays are also provided in the bus to aid the hearing impaired. It provides a concept that responds to the needs presented by the ADA. The special feature of this system is that the bus will be tracked through a Global Positioning System (GPS) AVL system and thus can identify its location for activation of information messages.17 2.2 REAL-TIME RIDESHARE MATCHING The need for compliance with the Federal requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) has led to renewed interest in car-pools and vanpools. Carp001 matching has generally been accomplished for regular commuting to a work site. established schedule are with the agreement of the other participants. The participants in each carp001 agree on a travel schedule. Any variations from the regular, preVanpools operate similarly, except that they usually represent a considerable agency or company investment in the vehicle which is driven by a designated driver. Carpools and vanpools can reduce the pressure on over-crowded parking lots and play a role in reducing highway congestion in peak hours. In addition, they help to reduce the real cost of the work trip for participants. In contrast to these pre-established, single purpose carpools, dynamic car-pooling is presented as a mode of transportation that is ""ready when you are."" They are multipurpose and can be arranged either in real-time or close to it (near term). Participants pre-qualify and are put into a database. Upon receipt of a trip enquiry, the database is searched for others who are traveling in the same direction at the same time. Participants can not only use this database to arrange for carpools to and from work, but also to a shopping center, medical facility or any other trip generator.  [17]  Barbara Lange, Luminator.  14   State-of-the-Art Summary The concept of dynamic car-pooling is new and still in the experimental stage. However, there are some tests of the concept either in the planning stage or in pilot test stages. Some vendors like Transtar, which have been active in furthering Automatic Vehicle Information for transit users, are now introducing compatible software for providing information on ride share opportunities. A related set of technologies involve dynamic scheduling of paratransit systems, a process that links scheduling network software and AVL technologies. Applications Houston, Texas Real-time carpooling is a major element in the Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County' Smart Corridor project, funded in part by FTA. The I-10 West corridor and the Posts Oak Galleria area provide the opportunity to test a comprehensive employer-based carp001 matching service. Most commuters in this corridor are suburb-to-suburb travelers and the area is not well served by regular fixed-route bus service. The project is associated with an effort to increase the number of two or three-person carpools on the Katy Freeway HOV lane in the A.M. peak. The initial stages of the project will focus on near-term carp001 arrangements (trips arranged the night before), but longer-term plans call for instant rideshare matching using an interactive program tied into the database. Participants will initially access the database through touch-tone telephones, but videotex systems will be used in the future. Employers have been surveyed to determine their interest in the pilot project which will operate between the Addicks park-and-ride lot and the Post Oak-Galleria area.l8  [1 8 ]  Turnbull, Katherine, ""The Use of Information Generation from Transit AVL Systems,"" Proceedings of the IVHS America Annual Meeting 1993, pp. 82-88.  15   Bellevue, Washington The Bellevue, Washington Smart Traveler project is a major operational test of the concept of dynamic ride sharing. The concept is to use access to real-time traffic information as an incentive to encourage participation in a rideshare pool. Participants will use cellular telephones through which they will receive computerized messages regarding real-time traffic information and bus routes and schedules. An alphanumeric pager will be used to develop near term rideshare matches. The objective is to eventually generate real-time dynamic carp001 matches. Pretests have been completed and an intensive marketing program is underway with major employers. I9 Medford, Oregon The Rogue Valley Council of Governments is about to begin a pilot program in which they will test dynamic scheduling of paratransit service. The software, designed by Easy Street, will allow for real-time insertion of trips and rerouting of paratransit vehicles. A deadreckoning/odometer AVL system will be used to track the location of paratransit vehicles. Vehicle locations will be reported to base where the scheduling program will modify the prescheduled trip routing. Plans call for an initial test with clients of four headstart centers in early 1994. Four months later, an additional test will be conducted with the senior volunteer program.20 (See also the Medford, Oregon description in Section 2.3.) Portland, Oregon Tri-Met is in the process of negotiating a bid for real-time paratransit scheduling. Information on vehicle location will be fed back to the control center where the schedules will be manipulated to reflect real-time changes in travel conditions.21  [1 9] [2 0] [2 1]  Cathy Blumenthal, Bellevue Smart Traveler, Bellevue Transportation Management Association. Patrick Simmons, Easy Street Software. Easy Street is in the process of developing dynamic scheduling software for paratransit systems.  16   Sacramento, California One of the projects in the California Smart Traveler Program is a real-time rideshare matching system in Sacramento. The concept is to provide rideshare information for single trips, such as to the shopping mall. The program is still in the planning phase.22 2.3 MWLTIPROVIDER TRIP RESERVATION AND INTEGRATED BILLING SYSTEMS Multiprovider trip reservations allow the traveler to obtain trip reservations and tickets for a multimodal trip (portal-to-portal) from the initial carrier through inter-line agreements. This would be based on inter-line ticketing and fare collection agreements by inter-regional carriers, transit and paratransit providers in a metropolitan area. An integrated billing system is one in which bills for the purchase of fares for all modes are generated from a central source. the credit card company. This section differs from Section 4.2, Multimodal Smart Cards/Payment Systems, in that this section describes reservation and ticketing for multiple transportation providers through an integrated system. Section 4.2 describes smart card technologies that can be used for a variety of transportation purposes, such as identification, trip payment, parking payment, etc. State-of-the-Art Summary Multiprovider trip reservation and integrated billing systems are being developed in North America, primarily based upon the Mobility Management concept that was developed for FTA.23 Currently, there are systems being developed in Medford, Oregon, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and Northern Virginia. For instance, if bus, subway, and air fares for one complete trip were purchased by a credit card, the billing for each fare would be generated by  [2 2] [2 3]  Robert Ratcliff, California Smart Traveler, California Department of Transportation.

Parker and Associates and International Taxicab and Livery Association, Mobility Management and Market-Oriented Local Transportation, Final Report, prepared for FTA Office of Technical Assistance and Safety, March 1991, Report No. DOT-T-92-07.  17   Applications Medford, Oregon As described in the State of the Art - Update ` report, the Rogue Valley Council of 92 Governments (RVCOG) is developing a mobility management project, called the Rogue Valley Mobility Project (RVMP). The RVMP will demonstrate the use of advanced technologies to provide users with access to information on public and private transportation services in order to make choices among the available modes. The RVMP' objectives are to support the s independence of and the competition between providers, and minimize the cost of public and private mass transportation while maximizing patronage.24 In the fall of 1992, RVCOG selected a vendor for the RVMP. Phase I of the project, which focuses on subsidized taxi and volunteer transportation services for elderly and disabled individuals, is expected to be implemented in February 1994. The RVMP will consist of the following major components:25 - Phone System - Consumers will call one central telephone number to obtain information regarding transportation services and to make trip reservations. The system will use automatic number identification to automatically identify clients of any participating program. - Software - The software (developed by Easy Street) takes client registrations, develops routes and schedules, dispatches vehicles generates reports and billings. The software can also monitor vehicle, activity, trace vehicle maintenance and availability, and maintain training and experience. reservations and and drivers, and driver, and client records of driver  - Data Transmission - Data transmission between the vehicles and the base site will be accomplished via digital communications. The vehicles will be equipped with on-board computers, or mobile data terminals, and the digital signals will be transmitted from the dispatch center via radio waves or cellular technology. The participants will be able to transmit information to each other via modem and/or local area network.  [2 4]  Rogue Valley Council of Governments Request for Proposals for Mobility Management Project, July 14, 1992, p. 2. Rogue Valley Council of Governments RVMP Status Report, July 23, 1993.  [25]  18   l  Fare Media - Magnetic-stripe cards will be used in place of cash, tickets and coupons. Card readers will be placed in participating vehicles, and all financial transactions between provider and subsidy agencies will be tracked using the cards. Passenger consumption and provider information will be recorded electronically. The software can analyze accounting and financial transactions to determine transportation providers' and subsidy agencies'current accounts. The RVMP system, headquartered at RVCOG's offices, will also electronically administer the system.  In Phase II, RVCOG expects to add fixed-route transportation and possibly expand the paratransit/specialized portion of the RVMP into Josephine County. Winston-Salem, North Carolina The Winston-Salem Transit Authority (WSTA) will develop and operationally test a mobility management system for human services transportation. Future plans will involve the fixed-route system. FTA and the North Carolina Department of Transportation, Public Transportation and Rail Division are providing the funding for this project. WSTA provides human service transportation to the Winston-Salem area through TransAID, a 17-vehicle paratransit service. WSTA issued a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) in July 1993 to obtain background information on potential system integrators. A Request for Proposals (RFP) was to have been issued in the fall of 1993. The scope of this project includes: - Mobility Management Definition - Identify current system needs, functions, characteristics and performance, refine hardware and software specification, and develop an RFP; - Mobility Management Acquisition for Human Service Transportation - Advertise the RFP, review and analyze proposals, select a vendor, install and test the hardware and software, conduct training, develop operating procedures, and inform the participating human service providers and their clients on the practical application of mobility management; - Evaluation of Mobility Management - Monitor and assess the performance of the system, analyze the integration of software (through the North Carolina State University' APTS s Computational Laboratory), analyze the hardware, and investigate public-private partnerships for future mobility management activities; l  Conduct Formal Evaluation and Research Program - Install a system to collect data for evaluation, test alternative operating strategies for mobility management, and test 19   optimization routines of the scheduling and dispatching software for system performance and cost impacts; and - Fixed-Route Mobility Management Planing - Develop plans for an extension of the mobility management from human service transportation to include fixed-route transportation. Northern Virginia The Potomac-Rappahannock Transportation Commission has received funding through the IVHS Corridors Program to operate (as a test) an enhanced ridesharing-route deviation transportation system integrated with conventional transit and ridesharing in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, DC (Prince Williams and Stafford Counties). This operational test will begin in 1994 and will last for over 2% years. The Advanced Ridesharing and Traveler Information System will provide on-demand service through an audiotex request system which uses scheduling software similar to that used by the taxi industry. Depending on the needs and preferences of the system user, door-to-door transportation will be provided using both publicly and privately owned vehicles operated by paid and volunteer drivers using vans, minibuses, specialized public vehicles, fixed-route buses, and taxicabs. Users will be charged a standard per-mile rate regardless of the type of vehicle used. System costs not recovered by fares will be covered by the local agencies. Smart cards will be used to process transactions. A dispatch center will be established and the necessary hardware will be installed in fifty vehicles. Technologies are expected to include AVL (GPS-based) and telephones initially. Interactive cable television and electronic bulletin boards are possible future enhancements to the system. Other participating organizations include: Northern Virginia Planning District Commission - providing a geographic information system (GIS) for location/navigation/marketing services and project evaluation services; Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation - providing project oversight, site selection, and multimodal coordination; Gandalf Mobile Systems, Inc. - providing location and communication hardware and software; UMA Engineering Ltd. - providing fixed-route/route deviation and demand-responsive scheduling software and integration; 20   l  Aegis Transportation Information Systems - providing route-deviation and single-trip ridesharing system design; and SG Associates - providing project management technical assistance.  -  2.4 INTEGRATED FARE MEDIA Integrated fare media are tickets that can be used on more than one mode, such as a magnetic-stripe card that could be used for both bus and subway fares. State-of-the-Art Summary There are several North American transit systems that are utilizing integrated fare media that can be used on several modes being operated by different transit agencies. The most common application of integrated fare media involves the use of magnetically-encoded farecards for both bus and rail modes. In addition to the systems described below, the Washington, DC and Ann Arbor, Michigan systems, which also use integrated fare media are discussed in Section 2.5. Applications Oakland, California The TransLink program is an effort by Oakland' Metropolitan Transportation s Commission (MTC), San Francisco' Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District and the Central s Contra Costa Transit Authority (CCCTA) to provide a magnetic-stripe farecard that can be used on CCCTA and BART buses and BART subways. The TransLink farecard is an adaptation of the BART magnetic-stripe stored-value farecard. It looks like a BART farecard with a different logo in the center but has two columns - one to record bus values and one to record rail values. The TransLink farecard does not expire. At the time of the last State-of-the-Art Report, the TransLink program was in an operational test phase. This lo-week test, conducted in early 1992, was declared a success since  21   the equipment only had three valid failures out of approximately 10,500 transactions.26 Currently, TransLink is fully operational, with all 115 ""County Connection"" (CCCTA) buses and 45-50 BART Express buses equipped with on-board ticket validators.27 These buses serve the suburban areas around five BART subway stations. TransLink farecard distribution is being done manually. Pre-encoded farecards are being sold at supermarkets and banks in the Contra Costa area. Also, there is a sales booth in one of the five Contra Costa BART stations and one CCCTA sales location, which is a public outlet. The farecards cost $75 for $80 worth of rides and $30 for $32 worth. ""There are additional discounts including as much as 75C on transfers from BART to BART Express or County Connection buses. ""28 According to the MTC, new ticket vending machines will be developed and placed in five BART stations and in the major downtown destinations in Berkeley, Oakland, and San Francisco.29 There will be one or two machines per station, for a total of about two dozen machines. These machines will accept credit cards, debit cards (automated teller machine (ATM) cards), and currency, but will not make change. The prototype machine was delivered in mid-July 1993. MTC is expecting that the final vending machines will be delivered by the end of 1993 or early 1994. BART has over 300 fare gates, 10% of which are Cubic and the rest are IBM. The Cubic gates are being retro-fitted to recognize the new TransLink farecards, so that all BART fare gates will accept the new tickets.  [26 ] [27 ]  ""Stored Value Cards Emerging as Cashless Bus Tickets,"" Passenger Transport, November 23, 1992, p. 10. The on-board ticket validator is made by a French company and was derived from an implementation of the same equipment in Hong Kong.  [ 28 ] [29]  3.  ""San Francisco Bay Area Launches TransLink Joint Ticketing,"" Passenger Transport, May 3 1, 1993, p.  Joel Markowitz, Manager, Advanced Systems Applications.  22   ""With the inauguration of the TransLink ticket, technical barriers to a truly universal ticket that could be valid on any San Francisco-Oakland Bay Area bus, rail, or ferry system have been overcome. "" 30 Los Angeles, California The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) (formerly the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission) will be demonstrating a stored-value card fare collection system, called MetroCard, which is similar to the TransLink system. The demonstration project is a precursor to implementing a magnetically-encoded farecard to pay for any bus, rail, or transfer trip throughout Los Angeles County. ""Each bus and rail station would have a validator [similar to the validator used for TransLink], which accepts the MetroCard, deducts the appropriate value, prints the trip information, and returns the card to the user. When the fare is deducted from the card, it is recorded on the bus as each trip is taken. ""For continuing trips with transfers between buses in one property, between buses in different properties, or between modes of travel in the same or different properties, the fare deducted for the second and succeeding vehicles will automatically be adjusted in accordance with the fare structure agreements. ""The on-board validator will maintain the records of the fares collected from the cards, and when each bus returns to a garage, would download the recorded data into a personal computer. Each night a central computer would poll each garage to extract the values deducted, which would then be assembled by property and billed to the clearinghouse automatically. A duplicate record would be transmitted back to each property for audit purposes. A similar process would take place for the rail system.""31  [ 30 ] [ 31 ]  ""TransLink Starts in Contra Costa,"" Passenger Transport, September 21, 1992, p. 4. ""Stored Value Cards Emerging as Cashless Bus Tickets,"" Passenger Transport, November 23, 1992, p. 10.  23   This project was started in the spring of 1990. A decision was made in March 1991 to implement a magnetic-stripe, stored-value card rather than a smart card.32 In December 1991, GFI was awarded the contract for the MetroCard system. The MetroCard demonstration will involve three transit agencies: Culver City Municipal Bus Lines, Foothill Transit, and the Southern California Rapid Transit District Pomona Bus Division.33 In-service qualification tests were to begin in October 1993. One hundred passengers were selected for the sixty-day inservice test. A ninety-day reliability test was scheduled for December 1993. The test involves 315 sets of bus validation units (mounted on the side of the existing fareboxes), including 199 units on Foothill buses, thirty on Culver City buses, seventy on LACMTA buses, and sixteen spare units. Eventually, it is hoped that MetroCard will be used as a one-ticket ride anywhere throughout the Los Angeles area, including bus, light rail (Blue and Green Lines), subway (Red Line), and commuter rail (Metrolink). Advanced Fare Payment Media Study, Phase II Phase I of the Advanced Fare Payment Media Study conducted by Echelon Industries, described in Section 2.5, concluded that various smart card technologies could be used for transit fare payment. Phase II will test several smart card technologies in the California cities of Gardena, Torrance, and Los Angeles, as well as an additional site or sites selected by the California Department of Transportation. As many as 25 vehicles will be equipped with smart card reader/writer equipment, and the vehicles will be operated in a variety of environments, including express and regular fixed route services.

Currently, LACMTA operates 2,300 buses over 200 routes. These buses are equipped with Cubic fareboxes. Foothill Transit operates 199 buses on 12-13 routes in the San Diego valley. These are equipped with GFI fareboxes. Culver City has 34 buses (with GFI fareboxes) that operate on 6 lines.  24   Ann Arbor, Michigan A part of the proposed ""Intelligent Transportation System"" for the Ann Arbor Transportation Authority (AATA) is the development of a smart card system that will provide a dual transit fare/parking card to encourage automobile drivers to ride transit. AATA is recommending the use of a proximity smart card, with the capability of handling multiple fare categories and structures. AATA is proposing that the smart card be capable of handling two payment strategies: cash (value cards) and credit. AATA has proposed that information kiosks that are developed as part of their Intelligent Transportation System include the capability to issue and update smart value cards. Chicago, Illinois On September 8, 1993, the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) board approved the purchase of a new revenue collection system based on magnetic stripe technology.34 This system features a ""stored-value"" magnetic-stripe card, similar to that used in the WMATA Metrorail system. This card will be used on both the rail and bus system, and will include the capability to handle transfers. The system, being installed by Cubic Automatic Revenue Collection Group, will work in the following way:35 Riders purchase the farecards from vending machines that will accept currency and credit ca rd s . -  Riders insert cards into rail turnstiles and bus fareboxes. The cost of the fare will automatically be deducted, and the time will be recorded. When riders transfer, the system will know to deduct only the cost of a transfer (30C) based on the time recorded. Once the cost of rides totals the purchase price of a card, it is no longer usable.  0  -  [34 ] [ 35 ]  ""CTA says it is going to hold line on fares in ` 94-at least for now, "" Chicago Tribune, September 9, 1993. ""CTA plans smarter fareboxes,"" Chicago Tribune, September 8, 1993.  25   One unique feature of this system will be the ability of the turnstiles to accept coins, tokens, and monthly passes, as well as the new stored-value cards. Two rail stations will be used to test the new system in mid-1994. If the testing is successful, the whole system could be in place by late 1995. When fully installed, the system will cover CTA's 147 rail stations and 2,000 buses. Also, CTA is considering a smart card system for use by the maintenance personnel who 6 open the vending machines. 36 They would insert a smart card when opening a vending machine, and the time the machine was opened and their identification would be recorded on the card. When they close the machine, the time that it was closed would be recorded as well. CTA is also considering smart cards for their disabled riders. New York City, New York The New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) is in the process of testing and implementing a new automated fare collection (AFC) system which is designed to replace the existing token system.37 (The token system has been in existence for forty yea r s .) 38 MetroCard, which is the fare media that will be used in the new system, is a plasticized farecard that has a magnetic stripe. The Cubic Automatic Revenue Collection Group' system is a reads and-write system, which allows for both time-based and stored-value transactions.39 (This will allow the system to be upgraded to smart cards, eventually.) MetroCards will be swiped through the top of the new turnstiles in rail stations and will be accepted on the fareboxes on buses. MetroCards will be sold from the existing token booths and, in the future, will be distributed through vending machines located in the stations (to supplement token booth sales) as well as at outside distribution outlets.

Implementation in the first 69 rail stations has begun and will continue through March 1994. NYCTA is performing the installations, which involve re-powering the stations and modifying the communications system. The remaining 400 rail stations will be equipped beginning in April 1995 and continuing through the end of 1997. The test of the MetroCard system on buses is underway. Bus implementation will begin in June 1995 and be complete by February 1996. Mississauga and Toronto, Ontario Mississauga Transit and Government of Ontario (GO) Transit (commuter rail system in Toronto) are performing a demonstration test of electronic integrated fare media in the form of a proximity card. This demonstration test, involving Mississauga Transit buses and GO trains, will be performed in one commuter rail station that has feeder bus service (Clarkson).42 2.5 ELECTRONIC TICKETING AN-D AUTOMATED TRIP PAYMENT Electronic ticketing involves the automated generation of tickets and automated fare collection. Electronic ticketing can be accomplished with the use of non-cash media, such as credit cards and/or debit (ATM) cards. Automated fare collection provides the capability to obtain authorizations for credit/debit card payments and to collect detailed information on revenue, passengers, and origins and destinations. Automated trip payments are those payments made without a manual exchange of coins or bills. Often, electronic ticketing provides automated trip payment through the use of magnetically-encoded farecards or advanced card technology, such as smart cards.

[ 42]  27   card technology typically means plastic cards (credit card size) with a programmable memory chip that can be used for identification, trip payment, and other travel-related functions. State-of-the-Art Summary Electronic ticketing and automated trip payment are technologies that are beginning to be utilized in several transit agencies throughout North America. Frequently, these two technologies go hand-in-hand (i.e., electronic ticketing often provides automated trip payment through the use of advanced card technology or the more conventional magnetically-encoded cards). According to APTA, the use of advanced fare systems is significant as shown in Figures 2.143 and 2 .2. 44 4 Applications Chicago, Illinois As reported in the State-of-the-Art - Update ` document, the Regional Transportation 92 Authority' (RTA) Payment and Control Information System (PCIS), was nearing completion s of Phase 1 - system design and development. The system was developed by a team of vendors, lead by Applied Systems Institute, Inc. Phase 1 culminated in a two-week pilot test with 3-4 hand-held computers and smart cards that were kept on the vehicle (rather than issued to riders). ""Instead of recording rides with paper vouchers, PCIS prepares electronic trip records through the interaction of portable terminals carried by drivers and smart cards issued to eligible riders. Once a day, the electronic records stored in the terminals are downloaded to a central computer for reconciliation against the day' reservations. Routine transactions are processed s  [43 ]  APTA, ""Transit Fare Summary as of January 1, 1993"", April 1993, pp. 20-68 to 20-69. Ibid, pp. 20-47 to 20-49.

In late 1993, RTA was to have a test using one carrier and be monitoring performance of the system.46 Washington, District of Columbia WMATA is currently negotiating with Cubic to demonstrate a ""proximity"" smart card. This card could be used by holding it near a reader, rather than having to insert it.47 The card, which will be used in the Metrorail system and on Metrobuses, will have the capability of being updated, and will have the capability to be used in parking lots. The scope of this demonstration will encompass 5,000 passengers, fourteen Metrorail mezzanines, twenty-one buses, and fifteen parking lanes. 48 The card technology will be a radiofrequency (RF) contactless card which is serialized, battery-powered, and will handle multiple fare types (e.g., regular, student, elderly, disabled and employee fares). The current schedule is for the first rail station installation to take place in April 1994, the first bus installation to take place in August 1994, and the first parking lot installation to take place in November 1994. Currently, WMATA is in the process of installing new farecard equipment, some of which will accept credit and debit cards. Farecards can be purchased with credit and debit cards at specific vending locations and with debit cards at certain ATMs. ""NationsBank, which dispenses fare media for use on WMATA, issues fare media of a predetermined value from a cassette within the ATM.

"" 50 Long Island, New York The Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) has eighty ticket vending machines (TVMs) in operation throughout their system (32 stations). Seven of these machines are manufactured by Agent Systems, and accept only Mastercard or VISA for the purchase of monthly and weekly tickets. They also have a touch screen for ease of use. The other 73 TVMs are manufactured by Scheidt & Bachmann. Most of these TVMS accept debit and credit cards as well as cash. These TVMs sell one-way, monthly and weekly tickets, and NYCTA tokens in groups of five.51 San Francisco Bay Area, California The five new stations to be added to the BART system in 1995 will be equipped with automated Scheidt & Bachmann ticketing machines that accept credit and debit cards and dispense BART's magnetic farecards.

""New point-of-sale terminals will automate all aspects of the South Shore' ticket agents' duties. The computerized s point-of-sale system eliminates the burden of printing and inventory control required with 95 different ticket types for a manual sales system. It also has audit and reporting advantages allowing for daily balancing and instantaneous retrieval of daily activity reports by transaction. ""Ticket identification and printing security are other advantages of computerization, making revenue collection more secure. Counterfeiting is deterred because the point-of-sale hardware controls the printing on each ticket. With the aid of a computer program, each ticket is uniquely identifiable with a bar code imprinted on the ticket at the time of its issue. There is no duplication of this bar code. The bar code identifies who sold the ticket, where it was sold, and other attributes. This makes it impossible for someone to counterfeit the ticket because they would have to know what the security code is at the time of issue. Metallic inks are printed as background on valueless ticket stock providing another means of ticket security. ""The computerized system also enables [MCTD] to monitor conductor remittances and parking fees collected at stations. This provides MCTD' transportation and accounting s departments with useful information about railroad activity. It also provides an accurate count of passenger activity between stations.

The ITS will implement and integrate several advanced transit technologies, such as on-board vehicle and central control systems, farebox, destination sign, enunciator, smart cards, adaptive signal control, and computer-aided dispatching (CAD).55 As of October 1993, the proposals submitted in response to the request for proposals for the ITS were in the process of being reviewed. The overall ITS will have the following components: l  Operations Center Information System - Communications - Information storage and retrieval - Computer-Aided Dispatch Vehicle System - Vehicle Network System - Peripheral Devices - Vehicle status Traveler System - Information services - Smart cards The ITS proposes the use of a proximity card as the preferred smart card technology.  l  l  The smart card will be used for passenger identification as well as fare collection. The card will be capable of handling multiple fare categories, various pricing strategies, two payment options (pre-paid and credit), and changes in fare schedules. In addition, the card will be capable of multi-modal use - parking and transit. This is extremely useful for people who take transit to work some days and drive on others.

RTB contracted with the Applied Systems Institute (ASI) to perform this study, which began in August 1992. As of September 1993, the project was near completion. AS1 performed the following tasks as part of this effort: Evaluation of Metro Mobility Requirements, Review and Evaluation of Available Technologies, Definition of Operating and Management Procedures, Recommendation of Preliminary System Design, Development of Plans and Specifications for System Implementation, and Development of Evaluation Plan. A final report detailing the results of this study was expected to be available in the last quarter of 1993.56 Northern Virginia Since June 1992, the Virginia Railway Express (VRE) has used Schlumberger credit/debit card ticket vending machines (TVM 2000) for fare collection. They have had success with the equipment and a ` proof of payment' fare collection system. Fare evasion was less than 1/4 of one percent, and its automated information and ticket ordering systems produced additional savings.57 The VRE currently is testing a pre-production model of Schlumberger' TVM 5000 at s 8 Union Station in Washington, DC.58 (This is the same vending machine that is being installed in Buffalo, Memphis, and Tallahassee.) The TVM 5000, an extension of the TVM 2000, accepts credit and debit cards, coins, and bills.  [56 ] [57 ] [58 ]  Peter Ognibene, Applied Systems Institute, Inc.

It is expected that there will be one TVM 2001 located in each VRE station. It is likely that this ADA compliant machine will give voice instructions along with Braille.60 VRE is also examining the possibility of supplementing the TVMs at heavier vending locations with Ticket Issuing Machines (TIMs). TIMs are clerk-operated, countertop machines like state lottery ticket-issuing machines, but with TVM features that the clerk could use to issue tickets to customers. Any fare type and combination could be issued from this machine. VR E is planning to strategically place these machines in each fare zone. It is hoped that the TIMs will be tested during 1994. Boston, Massachusetts Within the next two years, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) will be eliminating the use of tokens by implementing an automated fare collection system. This new system will be implemented across the bus, rapid rail, and light rail systems. In May 1993, three different electronic farecard systems were demonstrated at three MBTA rail stations to obtain passenger opinions and other data. The three fare collection systems were: l l l  Farecard swiped through the top of an electronic turnstile; Farecard entered into one end of the turnstile, and it comes out on the other end; and Farecard held up to a ""proximity reader"" .61  Passenger opinion was favorable on all of these advanced fare collection technologies, although none of them stood out above the others. According to the MBTA,62 this new system will be seamless between all modes (except commuter rail), will employ read-write entry turnstiles, and will include ticket vending machines.

The Smart Delaware Authority for Regional Transportation project involves testing smart cards in their entire fleet of 128 urban transit buses. The purpose of this test is to introduce smart cards as fare instruments and as a means for local employers to offer their employees one payment/identification mechanism for a variety of work site services. Employers could offer the smart card to their employees as electronic fare for the bus system (which qualifies for state and Federal tax credits), as an identification device, as an access card (if the work site has limited access locations), as a payment mechanism for cafeteria meals, etc. As a fare payment device, this smart card could be a significant part of the employer' employee trip reduction s (employee commute option) program, which must be submitted in January 1994. As of September 1993, three employers had stated their interest in participating. The employers will make the smart cards available to their employees and will coordinate with the smart card vendor through the transit system. There will be a financial clearinghouse function, and the cards will serve either as a debit or credit card for the transit fare, depending on which option the employer chooses. The fare will be electronically removed from the employee' card. Likewise, an electronic transfer from the employee' account will be used to s s replenish the card' stored value or to pay for charged trips. s Recent developments in the smart card industry has caused the Delaware DOT to reassess the smart card options. As of September 1993, the selection of smart card technology had not been made. 63 New Jersey New Jersey Transit (NJT) has an innovative approach to fare collection on buses that operate out of the Maplewood Bus Garage. At the start of each bus operator' shift, the s operator swipes their identification (ID) card through a reader, and enters their employee ID  [63]  Wayne Spaulding, Assistant Director, Program Development, Delaware Transportation Authority. Bee Buergler, Senior Associate, JHK & Associates.  36   number and the route that they will be working. A personal computer (PC) then downloads fare structure information on that particular route to a small module that is physically inserted into the automated farebox on the operator' bus. This unit gives the farebox ""intelligence. "" For s example, the farebox knows that if the operator indicates that the person paying the fare is an adult, the correct fare is $1.00. If the farebox receives 9Oc, it will not allow the bus operator to issue a ticket to the adult until the $1.00 has been deposited into the farebox. Also, the operator communicates with the operations center at the Maplewood facility through a Motorola unit that has a keypad and display unit. The operator indicates to the unit when a run is starting, when a run is finishing, etc. This information is used along with their AVL system to pinpoint 4 exactly where any vehicle is at any given time. 64 (More information on NJT's AVL system is contained in Section 3.1.) California The State of California, Department of Transportation (Caltrans), in partnership with the FTA, will develop and implement a field operational test of a computerized system capable of integrating various advanced fare media technologies and processing systems. Echelon Industries' work on the Advanced Fare Payment Media Study, Phase II, is an integral part of this field operational test. (See Section 2.4 for a description of the Echelon project.) Tests will demonstrate on-board electronic transit fare and data collections, and on-site travel support services, such as congestion and parking management. The project will investigate systems applications, fare reciprocity among service providers, and real-time operational funds allocations and transfers. Evaluations of the tests with regard to operational and behavioral characteristics will be conducted by an independent university team. Following the tests and evaluations, issues and applications will be recommended for further research and problem-solving to increase the potential for a viable inter-agency, multimodal use of smart cards leading to seamless travel. Future activities include integrating  [ 64 ]  Sharish Gupte, Director of Operations System Development, New Jersey Transit  37   electronic advanced fare media with travel services, consumer choice of payment methodologies, and the development of national or regional travel passes.65 Department of Health and Human Services Ride Tracking Project The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is sponsoring a project to research, develop, and market a universal system for DHHS and urban and rural public transportation systems which would track passenger trips automatically, calculate discount fares, process fares, and transfer data to accounting for billing and market analysis. This ""Bide Tracking Project"" is being conducted by Information Management International, Inc. (IMI) in cooperation with the International Public Works Federation and several hardware manufacturers. The project uses low-cost technology and is to be compatible with existing fare processing methods (e.g., cash, token, paper tickets, debit cards, and credit cards). Initially, the project will track DHHS-subsidized trips by persons with physical and mental disabilities and possibly other participants in DHHS programs. The system could ultimately identify vehicle locations, transmit vehicle and passenger data to traffic management, and deliver information to drivers and passengers. The project is in the second of three phases: - Develop concept and design (conducted from June to December - Engineer and test prototypes, and - Commercialize proven products. As part of this project, IMI developed an electronic identification card that is usable by most transportation systems, whether they employ manual or automated fare collection. Each card includes an identification picture, magnetic stripe (and/or integrated circuit), contact (and contactless/proximity) port, printed and embossed (or Braille) name and expiration date, and orientation detector. Cards issued for general trips can be processed by readers at transportation facilities. Cards issued for special purpose trips must be activated first by readers at service facilities, where users are authorized to obtain services. Security measures include incremental activation so that a card only can be used by one person at a time. The system also handles  [65 ]  California Department of Transportation, ""CALTRANS Automated Transit Pass ` Smart Card' Project,"" write-up provided on August 11, 1993.  38   multiple subsidy programs by one or more sponsors. In addition, the system is designed so that it can either be used in conjunction with existing fare processing methods or integrated into health security cards or other new electronic technologies. This system has yet to be applied in regular use.66 Transit Cooperative Research Program - Fare Policies, Structures, and Technologies The Transportation Research Board (TRB) recently awarded a Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) Project on Fare Policies, Structures, and Technologies to Multisystems, Inc. ""The objective of this project is to provide guidance for use by large and small transit agencies in developing and implementing fare policies to meet their social, financial, and service needs. This project should produce: - an evaluation of alternative fare structures; a review of current and emerging fare-collection and media-distribution technologies; an analysis of relationships between fare policies, structures, and technologies; and techniques and guidelines to enable transit agencies to evaluate appropriate structures and technologies in making fare-policy decisions. ""67  Phase I of this project, which involves a ""state-of-the-art review,"" is underway.68 The product of this phase of the project will be a preliminary analysis and evaluation of the interrelationships among fare policies, structures, and payment/collection technologies.

This system checks for an ID number that indicates that a monthly transit pass was purchased. In the first year of operation (1991), the system only handled student IDS. Currently, the system has been extended beyond the student population. In Burlington, Ontario, Burlington Transit has purchased optical card readers as part of a monthly-pass validation system. The Societ e de Transport de L'Outaouais in Hull, Quebec is purchasing a proximity card system.  l  IC/Smart Card and RF Communication Industry Study The Volpe Center supported a study, Phase I of which was completed in February 1993 that examined the smart card industry. The objectives of this study, which was performed by Coopers & Lybrand, included a review of smart card industry suppliers (including component manufacturers, system developers, and system integrators) and the assessment of smart card technology focusing on the non-contact RF/ID segment.70 This study involved the following tasks: Assemble background information, l Segment industry, l Identify potential product suppliers, l Establish evaluation criteria, l Identify issues, l Conduct interviews, and - Summarize findings. l  The issues and influencing factors suspected to impact system design and operation were divided into four areas in the report, The following issues were covered: l  Technology Component Issues - Communications - Location of system intelligence  [ 70 ]  Coopers & Lybrand, IC/Smart Card and RF Communications Industry Study, Final Report, prepared for the Volpe Center, March 5, 1993, p. 1.  40   l  Electrical power security Centralized vs. decentralized spee d Growth  System Issues - System integration - Single vs. multiple technology approach - Proprietary vs. non-proprietary considerations - Developing new solutions - Points of failure - Availability and maintainability - Ease of use - Complexity of system  - Application Issues - Environmental concerns - Route adherence - security - External Influencing Factors - Standards - Environmental Each issue was discussed, and several key questions and points were raised for consideration by agencies about to implement systems and for future research. Multi-Use Remotely Interrogated, Stored-Data Cards for Fare and Toll Payment Study The FTA, through the Volpe Center, is sponsoring a study of multi-use smart cards for toll and fare payment. This study, which is being performed by Coopers & Lybrand, consists of three tasks:71 l  Survey of existing stored readable/writable data card systems technology for fare and toll payment or other applications, including: Conducting data card industry research Conducting transit systems and applications research Conducting external factors research  [ 7 1]  Coopers & Lybrand, ""Multi-Use Remotely Interrogated, Stored-Data Cards for Toll and Fare Payment,"" presentation to the IVHS America APTS Smart Card/Smart Tag Systems Working Group Meeting, June 29, 1993.  41   -  Analysis and development of system requirements for a stored-data multimodal fare and toll card system, including: - Collecting user needs and expectations - Performing analysis  - Design of conceptual prototype, including: - Prototype system design - Design analysis A draft of the first tasks' final report was submitted to the Volpe Center for review in s August 1993. Advanced Fare Payment Media Study In 1992, Echelon Industries performed a feasibility study of advanced fare payment media for the public transit industry (under a Small Business Innovative Research Phase 1 grant), This study: - Reviewed advanced fare media technologies, vendors, and transit and other applications; Surveyed the transit industry to determine: - Fare collection equipment currently in use, - Type and frequency of fare classification surveys, - Type of fare media currently used, - Type of fare structures in use, - Perception of change in ridership with advanced fare payment media, - Current average system fare, - Current cost of fare collection, - Acceptable costs for advanced fare payment media systems, - Acceptable transaction times, - Importance of data provided by advanced fare payment media, - Importance of various operational parameters, and - Constraints to implementing an advanced fare payment media system;  - Interviewed several transit and related agencies; and - Determined a preferred strategy for implementing an advanced fare payment media demonstration. In the first step of this last task, Echelon recommended that a demonstration be structured such that the technology or system elements that are most questionable are tested, taking into 42   account the defined needs of the industry. Further, four generic applications for advanced fare payment technologies were suggested: the corporate card, the basic card, the advanced fare card, and passenger transaction systems. These alternatives would then be evaluated In the second step, Echelon suggested that selection of a fare payment system be based on the problems or concerns, rather than on the size or function of the operation. For the most comprehensive demonstration program - a passenger transaction system - Echelon identified subsystem elements (user interfaces, on-bus systems, central control, etc.). Once the demonstration program and card systems are selected, the specific card type/technology would be selected. Echelon identified fare card technologies (e.g., contact, contactless, RF) and fare cards (corporate, basic, etc.) in terms of transit needs. The final step in selecting the card type/technology would involve the examination of costs. Echelon identified fourteen subsystems and estimated per unit cost for each subsystem by card type.72  [72 ]  Echelon Industries, Inc., Advanced Fare Payment Media for Public Transit: A Feasibility Review, Final Report, prepared for SBIR Phase 1 Contract DTRS-57-92-C-00030, July 1992.  43   3. SMART VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY The ""Smart Vehicle"" incorporates many of the vehicle-based APTS technologies and innovations for more effective vehicle and fleet planning, scheduling, and operations. Whereas Smart Traveler technology focuses on passengers and directly increasing the ease and convenience of using transit (the ""demand side""), Smart Vehicle technology focuses directly on the vehicle, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the service provided (the ""supply side""), and on passenger safety. By making transit more efficient and reliable, it should be more attractive to prospective riders, transit operators, and the municipalities they serve. technologies and innovations described in this chapter are: l  The  Communications Systems, l Automatic Vehicle Location, - Transit Operations Software, and l Automated Demand-Responsive Dispatching Systems.  3.1 COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS Telecommunications technology development is in a growth period. A major stimulus for this growth is a need to make better use of the crowded electromagnetic spectrum to accommodate ever growing communication needs. The public transportation community already makes substantial use of communications in everyday operations. Implementation of the ""Smart Vehicle"" and the application of APTS technologies to public transportation will bring about additional communications requirements. The benefits Smart Vehicle concepts will bring to public transportation will depend upon effective communications. Whether existing communications capabilities and spectrum can support these additional communications requirements is subject to review and analysis at this point. State-of-the-Art Summary APTS and Smart Vehicle technology will require communications for such functions as:  45   Bus and control center communications - Voic e - Data - AVL, APC, Mechanical Health - Emergency Revenue systems - Fare payment - Auto toll payment Park & ride operations HOV/Express Bus Lane access Adaptive signal systems Intermodal communications Workplace/home transit & intermodal information Wayside/transfer center transit & intermodal information On-board information Presently, public transportation mainly uses conventional land mobile communication services. The additional requirements brought about by the introduction of IVHS technology This will be especially true for the transition to public transportation, make it unlikely currently utilized communications and spectrum capability will meet these new requirements. uninterrupted. Alternative communication approaches will be necessary for the smart public transit vehicle functions noted. Some of these alternatives include: o Low earth orbit satellite services: satellite communication services under development, i.e., IRIDIUM system. l  period when IVHS technology will be phased in, but current operations must continue  Analog/digital cellular: Conventional cellular services cover most metropolitan areas but are nearing saturation levels; Digital cellular will expand availability. FM subcarrier radio data system (RDS): Traffic and other information can be transmitted in frequency sidebands of commercial FM radio stations. 46  l   l  Personal communication services (PCS): PCS services are still in the development stages, but will allow communications anywhere. Spread spectrum systems: Rather than operating at a single frequency, spread spectrum systems transmit a low power signal with the information to be transmitted distributed over a band of frequencies. ""Receiver intelligence"" is used to decode the transmitted information. Of all the APTS functions noted which will require communications, by far the most  l  critical function is the bus/control center link. Most systems which radiate energy must be licensed by the Federal Communications Commission in terms of their use of the electromagnetic spectrum. Many of the functions can be satisfied by low power unlicensed electromagnetic devices. However, the bus/control center link requires communications coverage over a metropolitan area, which dictates a licensed service. The bus/control center communication requirement for traffic advisories may be satisfied by broadcast services instead of direct dedicated communications links. Typically, information could be overlaid on transmissions by conventional commercial FM radio stations and other such transmitters. Some examples of this approach are advanced highway advisory radio and RDS. Such approaches, while operational in Europe, are for the most part only at the conceptual stage in this country. Those functions which require detailed information such as route guidance, and safety and warning messages may require a dedicated communication link. Public transportation may have to turn to alternative telecommunication approaches, such as those listed above, to meet these requirements. The selection of an approach will not only depend on meeting performance requirements, but also the cost of operation, and the availability of spectrum. considered. An alternative to using dedicated spectrum for smart vehicle communications is to seek status as a secondary user, where permission to operate on a non-interfering basis to primary users may be possible. Spread spectrum techniques lend themselves to such applications, since only low power signals need to be radiated at any given frequency, and ""receiver intelligence"" is used to. reconstruct the transmitted information. 47 Digital cellular is an example of this Use of state-of-the-art commercial communication services, rather then transit property operated systems, must also be   approach. Analog cellular systems have approached a saturation level, and the application of spread spectrum techniques will allow an improvement in spectrum utilization efficiency of from 3 to 15 times for digital cellular systems. Applications Other than trunked communications systems, current applications of new communication technologies are limited. Such activity is expected to grow in the future. 3.2 AUTOMATIC VEHICLE LOCATION SYSTEMS Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) systems are computer-based vehicle tracking systems. Initially used for military purposes, they are now used extensively to monitor transit and trucking fleets and are beginning to be used to monitor police cars and ambulances. In transit applications, the system measures the actual location (real-time position) of each vehicle. The actual location can be compared with its expected position (based on the schedule) and this information relayed to the central base station or dispatching center. The potential for improving on-time schedule performance and data collection is evident. Data generated over a period of time can be used to adjust schedules and routes and be used for planning and management activities. This should result in more efficient and reliable transit service. Real-time vehicle location also provides the basis for additional benefits for a transit operation. A silent alarm can be activated by a driver in an emergency and police (or other emergency services) can be dispatched immediately to the location of the bus. AVL can be linked to Automated Traveler Information Systems by providing exact updates on the location of the vehicles. This can be conveyed through pre-trip information systems (e.g. automated telephone), or through monitors in terminals or at transfer points. The system may be connected to vehicle component monitoring, so that conditions out of tolerance may be flagged, and dispatch alerted. This allows a bus in danger of breaking down to be removed from service before costly repairs are required or passengers are inconvenienced. Bus location information could be combined with automatic passenger count data, and communicated to the dispatch center in real time. The dispatch center could include the approximate load of the next couple of buses to arrive, along with their arrival times, in wayside passenger information systems. 48   Passengers could then choose to wait for a less-crowded bus. Bus location information could also be used for automated actuation of traffic signal preferential treatment for buses so late buses can be granted priority to catch-up to schedule. Rail services have been using a form of AVL for many years. Given fixed guideways and uniformity of vehicle size it is possible to identify vehicles when they pass points where sensors have been located. Communications are also simplified with rail since there is a dedicated right-of-way in which to place wires and therefore no need for complicated radio systems. For buses, conversely, the task of tracking buses along city streets and in urban canyons is far more difficult. The primary components of any AVL system are: l  l  A method of position determination, A means of communication with the dispatcher in real time, and A central processor capable of storing and using transmitted information.  Addressing each of these components involves a number of critical decisions that must be made in light of the objectives of an individual bus system, what it wishes to gain from an AVL system, and the level of resources available, both financial and human. In response to a survey conducted in February 1993 by Trimble Navigation, most transit authorities indicated an interest in the following: Improved schedule adherence, - Maximum driver and passenger safety, - Better vehicle utilization, and - Real-time rerouting capability. l  These can be addressed with AVL. However, the cost of an AVL system is a major concern, especially' for small and medium-sized systems. State-of-the-Art Summary There are several types of AVL systems in existence (categorized by location technology): - Signpost /Odometer, - Radio Navigation/Location, and - Dead-Reckoning.  49   The most common form of AVL applied to transit continues to be the signpost/odometer system, which involves a series of beacons along the bus routes. These are normally mounted on utility poles and send out a low-powered signal which can be detected by a vehicle fitted with s a receiver. The signposts each have their own ID, so when the vehicle relays each signpost' ID to the control center, the dispatcher knows the position of the vehicle.  The signposts are  spread throughout the system and the vehicles'progress between them is calculated, using an odometer that measures wheel rotation. This technology is well tested having been employed by transit systems for a number of years. However, it is limited due to the requirement that signposts be placed at known locations, and it requires high levels of maintenance. It can only operate where signposts are located, which limits the potential for making major changes in bus routes or could require the installation of a large number of signposts. Several major bus systems are in the process of installing signpost/odometer systems, primarily because of the reportedly lower cost of the equipment involved. Ground-based radio systems include Loran-C (Long Range Aid to Navigation). Loran-C is a land-based radio navigation system which uses low-frequency waves to provide signal coverage. It determines location, based on the reception of transmissions and associated timing. Drawbacks for land vehicle location is its susceptibility to radio-frequency and electromagnetic interference. Interference from close proximity to overhead power lines and substations in urban and industrial areas can cause significant errors (as much as 1,000 meters) in Time Difference calculations. There are also problems with signal reception in urban canyons. As a result, Loran-C is no longer widely used for intensive real-time vehicle tracking. Baltimore, which has a Loran-C system operating, is now moving to GPS. Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, which had an early Loran-C system, abandoned it four years ago.73 There is, however, a form of ground based radio system which is proving to be effective in generalized vehicle tracking. In the Los Angeles area, for example, a private vendor, PacTel Teletrac, serves a variety of clients in several different businesses including: package delivery, an ambulance service, a sanitation service and a transit system. PacTel Teletrac services are  [73]  Jim Dhom, Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District.  50   supported by a radio location system that operates on radio frequencies in the 900 MHz band. Transmitting and receiving towers are placed strategically throughout the metropolitan region. By triangulating the signal at its receiving towers, PacTel is able to locate a vehicle within 150 feet. Positions of vehicles are relayed back to subscribers'base stations where they are shown on display maps. Multiple users of the radio towers leads to a relatively low subscriber' rate. s An increasing number of transit operations are moving towards the space-based Global Positioning System (GPS). 24 U.S. Defense Department GPS satellites have been deployed, and are available for civilian purposes. Three are test satellites and will soon be lost; however, they will be replaced. There is no charge for use of the satellite signals. This technology offers the flexibility which is not available with signposts. The concern with this type of system rests primarily with the newness of the application to large scale transit operations. To date, no North American city has a fully operational GPS tracking system for its transit operation. Several cities are either in the planning phase, conducting operational tests, or installing such systems system-wide. Given the flexibility involved with GPS, it is now possible to consider application to demand-responsive paratransit systems where the primary motive is increased efficiency of service and improved vehicle allocation. Rural public transportation systems are also considering use of GPS to monitor vehicles in remote areas. A number of technological issues are being addressed. These include: the level of accuracy required and provided, reliability of position reporting, frequency of polling, selection of communication devices, and selection of display systems. With the U.S. military employing selective availability (SA) of the satellites, which results in decreased position accuracy, a number of transit operations are considering installing ""differential GPS"" (DGPS) which can correct for this inaccuracy. Under DGPS, a GPS receiver is placed at a stationary site whose location has been precisely determined. The difference in the known location and the GPSmeasured location is used to improve the accuracy of the position determination of the vehicles. Concerns about consistency of SA with GPS in ""urban canyons"" is leading transit systems to add dead-reckoning to supplement GPS tracking systems. The limited number of radio frequencies available in many urban areas has proven difficult for many transit agencies. This has dictated polling rates for AVL systems and led some transit systems to consider ""exception reporting,"" i.e., the bus will only report its position 51   to central dispatch if it is off schedule. schedule.  Otherwise, the dispatcher assumes the bus is on  The issue of map display systems is one that a number of operations are weighing against cost. The U.S. Census Tiger files, although ""free,"" require considerable editing in order to be usable for transit. The number of map production companies and GIS software vendors  continues to increase. The challenge is to select a viable system that will display the vehicle position and still fit within the agency' budget. s Applications Table 3.1 contains a listing of known transit AVL systems or plans in North America, as of September 30, 1993. technologies follows. A. Signpost/Odometer Halifax, Nova Scotia Metro Transit has all 168 of its vehicles equipped with magnetic wheel sensors that respond to a signpost AVL system. This AVL system has been operating since 1987. Location data is generated every eighth rotation of a tire, is gathered by an on-board microprocessor, and is transmitted to the dispatch center by way of radio relay every thirty seconds during peak time. Two radio frequencies are available: one for digital data, the other for voice. The system also has the capability of providing for passenger counting and monitoring the buses'mechanical systems.74 A representative sample of applications using the various  [74]  Moss Mombourquette, Metro Transit, City of Halifax, Nova Scotia.  52   Table 3.1  North American Transit AVL Systems  Sources: the agencies; Pekilis, B. and G.

Schedules have been fine tuned, and on-time performance has increased substantially to over 90 percent. Yet the system has also had its share of challenges. The cost in personnel time required for system installation and the continuing cost of maintenance of the individual beacons on utility poles has been considerable. Most vexing has been software maintenance since the vendor which installed the system (F&M Global Communications) is no longer in business. Kansas City is currently reassessing its system and existing options.75 Norfolk, Virginia A similar system is operating in the Tidewater Transportation District in Norfolk, Virginia. Like Kansas City, the system was developed by F&M Global Communications and uses a signpost/odometer system. The 151 vehicles in the fleet are polled every forty seconds and information is transmitted over dedicated radio frequencies to the central control facility. The system also includes a silent alarm and monitors brake air pressure, engine temperature, and oil pressure.76 San Antonio, Texas The VIA Metropolitan Transit System uses a signpost/odometer system on all 531 fixedroute buses in its fleet but not on its paratransit vans. The system, which has been in operation for six years, uses two radio channels for voice and data and polls each vehicle at sixty second intervals. Buses have emergency notification systems but no passenger counters. VIA is concerned about the heavy maintenance expenses associated with their system and its software.

The system uses signposts with sensors installed on all 825 buses. Detectors are located on utility poles along an exclusive transit way. Signals are sent to the depot via telephone lines. The depot does not poll the vehicles on a regular basis; rather, the system operates by ""exception reporting,"" whereby a vehicle only reports its location if it is not running on time. Otherwise the central computer assumes the vehicle is at its scheduled location. Drivers are notified via radio if their bus is running late, which is the only action taken. Ninety of the buses are equipped with passenger counters that include microprocessors and infrared light beam detectors to record passenger boardings and alightings. Although they do not report passenger count data to the dispatch in real time, the data are used in scheduling activities.78 New Jersey New Jersey Transit, a state-wide operation, has just installed a signpost/odometer system. All 1,900 buses are equipped, although only 300 are included in the current operational pilot test. The entire project is estimated to cost $27 million. Twenty-two frequencies are allocated to the system in northern New Jersey (two for digital data and twenty for voice). In southern New Jersey, one frequency is dedicated to digital communication and five for voice. The system has experienced some software problems that are currently being addressed. Nevertheless, the information received seems accurate. Data is transmitted either every time a signpost is passed or every ten minutes, whichever is shorter.79 Similar signpost/odometer systems are in the 9 implementation phase in Albany, New York and San Mateo, California.

[79]  56   Hull, Quebec The Societe de Transport de L' Outaouais (STO) has a well-established SAGEPAS automated bus fleet management system. The system operates by using in-vehicle microprocessor-based control units developed by Gandalf Technologies. These respond to the proximity signposts which are located strategically along the fixed routes. Buses pass an average of two signposts on each run. In the next polling sequence the on-board unit informs the base station that it passed a signpost, and the position is updated. A transmission odometer which is mechanically connected to the wheels is used to estimate the position of the bus between signposts. Drivers have displays with time of day and early or late indicators. Bus location is indicated at the base station on a stylized graphic indicating the portion of the route completed. The system does not use GIS mapping. The STO vehicle locator system interfaces with INFOBUS, an automatic telephone answering system which provides real-time bus arrival information. Other integrated system modules handle timekeeping, payroll, and scheduling and run-cutting functions."" Louisville, Kentucky The Transit Authority of River City, which serves Louisville and surrounding suburbs, is in the process of installing a signpost/odometer system to improve scheduling and data collection. Infrared passenger counters and mechanical alarms are being installed in the initial phase. A major focus of the project will be on providing real-time schedule information to travelers who telephone for information. Customer service operators will continue to answer the telephone but they will be supplied with real-time information on the location of each bus as it passes a signpost. No base station display is planned, but drivers will receive feedback on on-time status from dispatch through a lighted panel system. The system, which is being developed by Glenayre, will operate with about 95 signposts which will cover the full system and be reinforced by odometer readings. Polling will be every forty seconds for all 292 fixed-  [80]  Pekilis, Barry, P.Eng., and G.

The full system installed on all 300 buses will cost $2.5 million. Installation of the AVL system will begin in early 1994.8l B. Radio Navigation/Location Dallas, Texas Phase I of the Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) AVL project is completed. ElectroCom has equipped 1,200 of the 1,300 DART buses with GPS receivers. Three radio frequencies are dedicated for data collection, one for tracking control, and eight for voice communications. DART has had considerable difficulty with the software, and feels it is not working up to specification. As of October 1993, exception reporting is working, and the paratransit dispatch system is on-line. However, no polling system has been put into effect. The fixed-route system is not yet operational.82 Denver, Colorado The Denver Regional Transportation District is in the process of installing a GPS-based AVL system on 833 buses, eleven light rail vehicles, and 28 supervisory vehicles. The system, designed by Westinghouse, will provide vehicle and schedule monitoring. Map displays showing each vehicle' location will aid the dispatcher in monitoring the system. In the event of an s emergency, a silent alarm will be used to notify the dispatch center and emergency vehicles will be directed to the bus. As of December, the system was being tested, using 82 fixed-route buses. Some implementation issues are being worked out.83  [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [83]  John Woodford and Bill Mason, Transit Authority of River City, Louisville, Kentucky. Chris Patrick, Dallas Area Rapid Transit.

Like Denver, Milwaukee is using a system developed by Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Milwaukee Transit is involving a private sector consortium to assist in implementing the system. Expectations are that it will be operational within the year.84 Baltimore, Maryland The Baltimore Mass Transit Administration (MTA) now has an RFP out for a GPS system that will eventually track all of its buses and trains. An RFP is now circulating for an initial test, involving the tracking of 200 buses and 35 light rail trains. The system is, however, being sized to accommodate 1,200 vehicles, including all 800 buses, the light rail system, and their commuter rail line. The RFP also contains the requirement for installation of 25 automatic passenger counters and the software capability to revise schedules. The goal is to award a contract by mid-February 1994. The MTA has had a fully functional Loran-C system on fifty buses with GIS real-time route tracking maps installed on base station monitors. Reasons for the change to GPS rest with the need for greater accuracy in tracking.85 Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania Lackawanna County Transit System, which operates 30 buses in the Scranton, Pennsylvania area, has just offered a contract to AutoTrac of Dallas, Texas to install a differential-based GPS system. The system will operate with mobile data terminals on the buses and will use Motorola Spectra radios, and Rockwell Navcor V tracking units. Initially, the  [ 84 ]  Turnbull, Katherine, ""The Use of Information Generated from Transit AVL Systems,"" Proceedings of the IVHS America Annual Meeting 1993, pp. 82-88.

A silent alarm could be added later.86 Denmark  It will also include an on-board  Nysteel is a paratransit system with ten vehicles in a small city in Denmark. They currently monitor their fleet using a differential GPS system, designed by TeknoGuide. The system uses a Phillips GPS receiver and transmits location over a telephone line. Printouts of updated schedules are provided to drivers in their cars. The AVL is used both for real-time dynamic scheduling and vehicle location information. It is also linked to the home health service and emergency system, so that help can be dispatched directly to an emergency.87 Heinsburg, Germany Heinsburg, Germany has an integrated Automatic Vehicle Management system, developed by Intelligent Transportation Systems. The system integrates GPS vehicle location, fleet monitoring, CAD, connection protection (for ""guaranteed"" transfers), and a service restoration system.88 Santa Monica, California An alternative form of fleet location system is available in the Los Angeles area. Teletrac, a fleet management company, has built a system using a network of transmitting and receiving antennas owned by its parent company, Pacific Telesis. The Santa Monica Municipal Bus Lines is one of over 900 companies using the system which is noted for its low cost and simplicity. Subscribers to the Teletrac system purchase a PC-based workstation equipped with a 2400-baud (bit per second) modem from Teletrac. They also receive an Etak Map with a detailed database of the streets and addresses in the Los Angeles Area, together with Teletrac  [86] [87]  Pat Friend, AutoTrac. Peter Soelberg, TeknoGuide.

The workstation communicates with the Teletrac control s center through standard telephone lines. The control center is linked with Teletrac' network of transmitting and receiving antennas. To poll a vehicle, an operator enters a command on the Teletrac workstation. The request is then routed through the Teletrac transmitting towers to a small transceiver in the vehicle. This ""Vehicle Locator Unit"" responds by sending a signal back through the system to the operator' computer screen, showing the vehicle' location.89 Teletrac s s has offices in Chicago, Detroit, Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, and Miami and is available for transit subscribers in those areas as well. The system works well for situations in which a dispatcher needs to locate a particular vehicle of fleets that do not require frequent or continuous position location. The cost would be prohibitive for continuous polling of entire vehicle fleets. Melbourne, Australia In Melbourne, Australia, 1,000 government buses and trams are being monitored through an Automatic Vehicle Monitoring (AVM) System that has been installed over a number of years. The system features management information on passengers, vehicle location, emergency and silent alarms, in-vehicle display, remote public address, and real-time information for prospective passengers. The system is in the process of installing late-vehicle priority for buses and trams at traffic signals.90 C. Dead-Reckoning Hamilton, Ontario The Hamilton Street Railway Company has operated a fully implemented dead-reckoning tracking system since 1991. The system operates with periodic corrections provided by signposts. This allows the 37 routes to be completely covered by only sixty beacons.

A common radio is used for both voice and data communications. The system was gradually phased in from a pilot project in 1987, but there are still issues to be resolved, including: end-of-the-line tracking, polling rates, hardware maintenance, and ability to affect route modifications.91 D. Systems Still in the Process of Choosing Technology Ann Arbor, Michigan The Ann Arbor Transportation Authority plans to award a contract in mid-December for a GPS system using smart vehicles. At project completion, 70 buses will be fully equipped. Initial installation will include 30 buses that will use on-board computers to verify schedule adherence. They will initially operate autonomously. Radio communication for exception reporting to central control will be a second step. When fully implemented, the central system will service an accompanying information system, including Cable TV and information kiosks.` * (See also Section 2.5.) Chicago, Illinois The Chicago Transit Authority has devoted considerable time to developing a bid package that would best respond to the interrelated transit needs of the city. They envision a full AVL system including an automated bus service-restoration system. The bid package did not specify a particular location technology. Hence, finalists include vendors proposing signposts and GPS. The CTA is now in the second round of the bidding process. The costs submitted with initial bids were much higher than anticipated and higher than available funding. Funding limitations may require installing the AVL system on less than the full fleet of buses, at least initially.93  [91] [92] [93]  Pekilis, Barry, P.Eng., and G.

Plans call for using GPS for paratransit fleet management and control. This will interface with a central vehicle information system and an automatic dispatch system at the base station. Traveler information will be provided through a toll-free regional telephone transit information system featuring audiotex capabilities. ARTIC will still maintain a telephone operator to provide information directly to rural residents.94  Houston, Texas The Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County is still evaluating technologies for the entire system. The agency has experimented with dead-reckoning, signpost/odometer, and GPS technologies. They are currently using a PacTel Teletrac system on 150 paratransit vehicles. In any future RFP, Houston will emphasize adherence to the proposed standards for communication between systems in transit vehicle applications. The proposed FTA and IVHS APTS standard for a Vehicle Area Network is based on the Society of Automotive Engineer' s SAE J-1708 document entitled ""Serial Data Communications Between Microcomputer Systems in Heavy Duty Vehicle Applications."" Adherence to this standard will enable interchangeable components and flexibility for expansion and technology advancements.95 Minneapolis, Minnesota The Guidestar project is in the process of developing an AVL system for the I-394 corridor. The original scope of the project (installation on 100 buses) is being revised, since cost projections were too high. Current efforts include developing public-private partnerships to share costs and benefits. No specific technology been selected, as yet. They expect that this  [ 94 ] [95]  Chris Hill, Castle Rock Consultants.

Dakota County, Minnesota The Dakota Area Resources and Transportation Services for Seniors (DARTS) and the Minnesota DOT are involved in a study assessing the feasibility of implementing advanced technologies in the DARTS demand-responsive paratransit operation. They expect that AVL can improve responsiveness and service to users, enhance the personal interface between provider and user, and increase the capacity of the system to accommodate more requests and riders.97 Peter Pan Buslines A new dimension in AVL applications is to be pursued by Peter Pan Buslines, an intercity bus company with 150 vehicles operating out of two terminals in Massachusetts, one in Southern Connecticut, and one in Washington, DC. (Their headquarters are in Springfield, Massachusetts.) The system will employ GPS and is experimenting with Rockwell International Tripmasters. The first batch of GPS receivers will arrive in early 1994 with the full system to be operational in 1996. The system is planned not only to provide bus location information, but also to enable the company to track mileage within the various states its vehicles traverse.98 3.3 TRANSIT OPERATIONS SOFTWARE Transit operations software usually performs and integrates several operations functions within a transit agency, such as computer-aided dispatching, computer-aided service restoration, and service monitoring functions. Integration of service components like fixed-route services with paratransit and demand-responsive services is in the early development and operations stages. Service restoration involves the adjustment of vehicle operations based on schedule  [ 96 ] [ 97 ] [ 98 ]  Ibid. Benson, Jeffrey, ""Paratransit and the Promise of Advanced Technologies: The Smart Darts Case Study,"" Proceedings of the IVHS America Annual Meeting 1993, pp.295301. Lloyd Jack, Peter Pan Buslines.  64   adherence or scheduled headways, the replacement of a disabled vehicle (which was in revenue service), and the activities necessary to restore the schedule disrupted by a disabled vehicle. Service restoration can involve the following strategies:"" l  Restore vehicle schedule - Adjusting vehicle dwell time at particular stops/locations (e.g., at transfer points) - Adjusting vehicle schedule/headway - Performing traffic signal priority - Rerouting the vehicle - Adding vehicle to route Dispatch vehicle to replace disabled vehicle Service monitoring involves collecting data on such operational details as vehicle position,  l  schedule adherence, route adherence, headway adherence, passenger data (e.g., passenger counts), status of vehicle components, and traffic and weather conditions. Service monitoring also involves analyses such as determining vehicle performance and loading, driver performance, estimated time of arrival at a specific point or stop, passenger statistics (e.g., passengers per vehicle, per stop, etc.), and system-wide statistics (e.g., overall on-time performance). State-of-the-Art Summary Systems that integrate software and hardware have been and are being developed to address the operations functions mentioned above. Most of these systems are being developed for the larger rail properties. The following rail systems are planning, designing, or developing new operations control centers, which will provide real-time control and management: l  -  Bay Area Rapid Transit, Chicago Transit Authority, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, Metro-Dade Transit Agency (Miami), l New York City Transit Authority, l Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation (PATH),  [99]  In order to implement these strategies, a vehicle monitoring system with AVL and communications is necessary.  65   - Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), and - Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. Further, many of the AVL systems that have been implemented for bus operations contain realtime control and management features. Applications Boston, Massachusetts On March 6, 1992, the MBTA awarded a turnkey system contract to Union Switch and Signal to develop and install a state-of-the-art operations control center which will provide central control for the bus, light rail, and rapid rail systems. It is expected that this system, which is a good example of integrating service components, will be fully operational by February 1996. The following paragraphs describe features of the new control center as they relate to each mode. Bus dispatch will be centralized at the new operations control center. Each bus dispatcher will have a console that contains three elements: Event management system, which is an expansion of the existing automated dispatcher log, (located on the left side of the console), Graphic presentation, which contains route and tracking displays, (located in the center of the console), and  - Voice control, which handles the radio, public address, and telephone communication, (located on the right side of the console). In the graphic presentation portion of the console, the route and tracking display will be on a geographically-encoded map of the service area overlayed with bus stops and landmarks. Although the system is not initially planned to have an AVL component, some bus locations will be plotted, based on voice reports and schedule information. The dispatcher will be able to make an inquiry to obtain information by bus number, route number, bus stop, landmark, or street intersection. This graphic display can be updated dynamically to show things like detours but will not show bus movements, since there is no AVL system. However, for the future, the MBTA is looking into a GPS-based computer-aided dispatch and AVL system, for all revenue 66   and non-revenue surface vehicles (buses, service vehicles, police vehicles, commuter rail, light rail, and paratransit vehicles). Currently, the MBTA's light rail operations include 33 automatic vehicle identification (AVI) readers placed at 22 key points throughout the system. Nine of these units automatically set the switches. The only information available through this technology is the passage of a train by a point where an AVI unit is located. This information can be captured on a display screen, and queries as to which train has passed which key point can be made in real-time. As part of the new control center project, AVI will be expanded to 65 key locations. The MBTA has three rapid transit (heavy rail) lines with control for each line performed from a different location. All rapid transit revenue service control will be relocated to the new control center project. The rapid transit consoles will be similar to the bus consoles. The new control center will have a 106-foot long by seven-foot wide graphic display board. The rapid rail systems will be projected onto this display. Automatic capabilities will permit following a train throughout the system, scanning the entire system, and viewing all signal switch indicators. Controllers at the consoles will have the ability to de-energize the power on track sections by clicking with a mouse. Also, if there is an emergency at a particular location, functions such as calling police and/or fire departments, or turning fans on intake or exhaust will be controlled from the console. Any call from a vehicle will be automatically recorded by the system. Further, the new system will prioritize queue transactions, so that an emergency would go to the top of the queue. A factory test of the system is planned to occur in February 1995. The MBTA currently has a functioning model (prototype), with the train graphics and event management defined.100 New York City, New York The NYCTA is in the process of developing a new central operations control center, similar to the MBTA effort, but much larger in scope (there are a total of 469 rapid transit  [1 00 ]  Robert Clark, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.  67   stations). Currently, the NYCTA operations""' are de-centralized and the dispatchers have total, direct control over their portion of the system. If an incident occurs (there are 200 incidents per day), it is reported to the cognizant command center by radio. The new control center will centralize all routing, dispatching, monitoring, and train control. They will be adding a passenger information system that will coincide with an upgrade to the public address system. This system, like the MBTA's system, will have state-of-the-art display technology. The IRT division will be implemented first (consists of 150 miles) and then the BMT division. The IND division will not be part of this new system. Other projects related to the new control center include an improved radio system, an upgrade to the communications systems, and emergency response systems. By April 1994, the specifications for the new control center will be ready for bid, and NYCTA is expected to make an award in early 1995 to do the final design, installation and implementation. By 1999, the IRT division will be operated from the new control center. A skeleton BMT division will be operating from the facility as well.102 Ottawa, Ontario Although there are many transit agencies that have employed AVL systems, not all have an explicit control function that assists dispatchers/controllers in making operational decisions based on the data generated by the AVL system. Two Ontario transit systems that have implemented automatic vehicle location and control (AVL/C) systems are featured to illustrate the automation of operations using AVL/C technologies. The Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission (OC Transpo) has an AVL/C system that ""consists of a real-time AVL module capable of monitoring the passage of all buses at specific locations. Buses are identified by a unique tag which can be read at strategic locations in the service area. ""l03 ""Real-time bus location monitoring is an exception based process in  [101] [102] [103]  NYCTA rapid transit operations consists of three divisions: Interborough Rapid Transit (IRT), BrooklynManhattan Transit (BMT), and Independent Subway System (IND).

""l04 Schedule adherence and headways are reported to the controllers. The controllers then take action manually based on the data supplied by the AVL/C system by either calling the bus driver on the radio and asking him/her to change speed or introducing another vehicle into the system. Actions that controllers can take are built into the service control module of the AVL/C. Each of the twelve control actions is displayed on a screen. Also displayed with each control action is related data, such as schedules, in order to facilitate a decision by the controller. (See also Section 2.1.1.) Toronto, Ontario The Toronto Transportation Commission' Communications and Information System s (CIS) involves ""2,000 transit vehicles, which operate out of three districts further divided into ten separate garage divisions. Each division has its own control center, which monitors and controls the vehicles operating on the routes within its service area. TTC's main control center oversees the overall CIS system and fleet performance. ""105 TTC's AVL technology is a signpost-based system. A Transit Universal Microprocessor (TRUMP) is installed on each vehicle. The TRUMP consists of a microcomputer, UHF radio, cellular telephone, handset, microphone, driver display screen, and user keypad. Through this equipment, the driver can communicate with the appropriate control center via either voice or data. ""Inspectors at each Division Control Center monitor three-color screens displaying the scheduled and actual locations of every vehicle assigned to them.

""l06 Dallas, Texas The Dallas Area Rapid Transit system initiated the implementation of a GPS-based AVL system in July 1992 ""as part of a comprehensive tracking and communication system to keep a closer eye on its 1,430 buses, transit police cars, and other vehicles. DART' bus and van s network carries more than 175,000 people each weekday in an urban/suburban network covering 700 square miles. ""l07 As with other AVL/C systems mentioned previously in this section, the control features of DART' system will be based on the data generated from the AVL system. s Information generated by DART' AVL system will be used on-line ""for tracking and s post-service use by transportation and fleet division managers to check and document performance during certain operational periods, such as morning and afternoon rush hours. It also will compile and store information on the status of the dispatch consoles, dispatchers, and accuracy of bus route time points. These reporting features will provide an invaluable tool for management of vehicles, personnel, fleet performance, and scheduling. The reports [that will be generated from the system] will provide aggregate information to document late or early bus times, diverted routes, and other on-time performance for schedules and route review with bus service planners and for community review. ""The AVL system will be an integral part of the integrated radio system, especially for locating vehicles in emergency or off-route conditions. In each case, the system will immediately start tracking the vehicles and will alert dispatchers to a vehicle' condition for s further action. (The system will watch route parameters and time points, and will notify the control center if travel distances are shortened or diverted.) It also will serve to offer real-time vehicle monitoring and tracking of all transit vehicles for schedule adherence. This function, performed from the control/dispatch facility, will be more cost-efficient than stationing  [106] Ibid, p. 77.

""108 (See also Section 3.1.) Ann Arbor, Michigan The Ann Arbor Transportation Authority' Intelligent Transportation System (See also s Section 2.5 and Section 3.1.) includes a computer-aided dispatch function. The CAD portion of the ITS will have the following components: l l l  Visual Display; Vehicle Management; and Motor Coach Operator Management. In the Vehicle Management portion of the CAD system, graphic displays will provide  information to the Operations Controller (OC) on vehicle routes, locations, and status conditions. Status information could include schedule adherence, wheelchair lift and lockdown utilization, and the mechanical condition of specific bus components. Transfer coordination is proposed to be fully automated, with transfer requests being sent to the specific vehicle. When there is an indication of an emergency, the vehicle' location will be displayed, and the OC will be s prompted to perform a set of activities pertinent to the particular situation. Flexible routing refers to both the fixed-route and paratransit operations. It is proposed that the ITS be capable of dynamically re-routing paratransit vehicles in real time based on trip additions and cancellations. It is also proposed that the ITS be capable of modifying fixed routes in real time (e.g., route deviation). The motor coach operator management software handles driver assignment. This includes check-in, check-out, relief, and extra assignment. Pinellas County, Florida Even though the use of CAD by an emergency services company (LifeFleet) in Pinellas County is not a transit application, it is important to note here since advanced technology is  [l 08 ] Ibid, p. 34.  71   being employed. This CAD system was developed by EAI Systems, Inc. Dispatchers are provided with the real-time location and status of each vehicle (available, en-route, on-site, etc.) on color-coded maps which show streets and geography. Further, ""each vehicle is equipped with an Etak Navigator@ map display and driver guidance system, an on-board computer that displays a dynamic, digitized street map showing both the vehicle' present position and the s destination as provided by the dispatch center. Every one-tenth of a mile, the Etak Navigator(R)  automatically transmits its coordinate data, determined from the map, through an on-board modem and radio to the [dispatch center]. ""l09 This dispatch system is capable of automatically dispatching vehicles, even though it is being done manually based on the data from the CAD system. However, if dispatch is not performed within forty seconds of an emergency call, the system will automatically dispatch the closest vehicle. Dade County, Florida Dade County, Florida will be implementing a mobile communications system, which includes computer-aided dispatching. Frederick R. Harris, Inc., contractor to Ericsson GE Mobile Communications, will be installing the system which will link fire fighters, police, transit employees and public works employees via mobile voice and data communications. The system, which includes AVL and computer-aided dispatch, is GPS-based and will be capable of tracking about 800 buses, rail cars, and other transit vehicles both on and off-route. The system will also monitor the status of on-board conditions, such as engine temperature and tire pressure.110 Hull, Quebec The Societe de Transport de L'Outaouais (STO) in Hull, Quebec has a comprehensive AVL/C-based system that provides real-time monitoring and control of their bus fleet.

Further, STO has an executive information system (EIS) that interfaces with the AVL/C system to provide exception reports to management. 111(See also Section 3.1.) 3.4 AUTOMATED DEMAND-RESPONSIVE DISPATCHING SYSTEMS Automated demand-responsive dispatching systems include scheduling features which assign individuals to demand-responsive vehicles that are operating in shared-ride mode. The scheduling components accommodate advanced trip reservations, standing orders, and immediate requests. Immediate trip orders, or real-time dispatching can be accommodated through the use of radio frequency (RF) communications with on-board computers. Information from scheduling and dispatching can be integrated into management information, billing, and accounting functions of the transportation provider. State-of-the-Art Summary Automation is being increasingly applied to the scheduling, dispatching, billing, and accounting functions of demand-responsive vehicles. This automation is based on advanced technologies such as RF communications in conjunction with on-board computers or mobile display terminals, CAD, global positioning systems or other location technologies, GIS, and smart cards. Another innovation in scheduling and dispatching systems is the ability to dynamically reschedule and re-route paratransit vehicles, based on trip additions and trip cancellations. These systems can operate with or without the use of advanced hardware. As a result of the ADA, many paratransit operations have chosen to automate scheduling and dispatching in order to comply with several of the complementary paratransit service criteria of the Act. The ADA has stimulated the vendors of scheduling and dispatching software to incorporate many new features, such as mapping or GIS software, to assist in the determination  [ 11 1]  Brendon Hemily, Canadian Urban Transit Association.  73   of whether an individual' origin or destination is located within %-mile of a fixed route, and s the scheduling of trip requests within one hour of the requested pick-up time. The level of automation in scheduling and dispatching systems ranges from minimal to fully automated scheduling and dispatch with the use of advanced communications and/or location technology. The lowest level of automation, computer-assisted scheduling and dispatch, involves the use of specialized software to develop schedules for paratransit vehicles. The vehicles are then dispatched manually. If any changes in schedule and/or routing are required due to trip cancellations or additions, the vehicles' schedules and routes must be modified manually. The next level of automation is the capability of the software to dynamically modify the schedules and routes of paratransit vehicles in real time, based upon trip cancellations and additions. These modifications are then communicated to the vehicles manually (by voice over the radio) by the dispatcher. A more automated system includes this same type of software with a capability to automatically communicate, in real time, changes in schedules and routes to the drivers. This communication is accomplished through technology such as on-board computers/displays that can receive data from the scheduling and dispatching software. The highest level of automated scheduling and dispatching systems incorporates AVL in the decision-making process. Applications In order to determine the extent to which automated scheduling and dispatching software is actually being successfully used in the paratransit industry, both paratransit agencies and vendors were contacted. Since information on specific vendors and their products can be found in the APTS Vendor Catalog, published by IVHS America in October 1993, this section focuses on the users of the software. This section includes information on automated or computer-assisted scheduling and dispatching systems. Table 3.2 shows a sample of the users of automated or computer-assisted scheduling and dispatching systems. This is not an exhaustive list of users and is presented to illustrate how widespread is the use of automated scheduling and dispatching systems. Table 3.3 lists the manufacturers of each system, as a further reference. A detailed table is included 74   as table A.2 in the Appendix.  One particularly innovative application, Delaware County,  Pennsylvania, is described in detail. Other users are identified, along with the systems they employ. Also included in this section are several important research projects that have been or will be accomplished to determine the ""state of the art"" of automated scheduling and dispatch systems in the paratransit industry. Even though there are many automated scheduling and dispatching systems available for paratransit operators, not all have been successfully implemented. It is important for prospective  buyers of these systems to carefully evaluate software and hardware before considering its installation. This evaluation should include an investigation of the experience of paratransit operators who are using this software and/or hardware.

Delaware County, Pennsylvania Community Transit of Delaware County currently is developing and will implement an automated system that includes sophisticated scheduling and financial management software integrated with an automated identification and billing system (AIBS). l12  Community Transit  is a private, non-profit transit service that enables Delaware County citizens to travel within the county. The operation is demand-responsive, shared-ride, with advanced reservations and doorto-door service. Community Transit provides an average of 1,400 one-way trips per day, including shuttle service to Delaware County employers. The system that Community Transit is developing involves the automated scheduling and dispatching software, on-board computers, RF communications, and automated identification cards (see Figures 3.1 and 3.2).

On-Board Data Collection (part of AIBS) The primary goal of the AIBS portion of the project is to significantly improve the identification of passengers (in terms of reliability, eligibility, and security), the data collected on each passenger trip (which will subsequently be used for accounting and billing purposes), and the reporting required for agency coordination and for internal performance monitoring. Additional benefits will include increased operational productivity and maximum use of limited vehicular and personnel resources. Specifically, the AIBS will be capable of: l l  Automated passenger identification and trip eligibility validation; Automated fare calculation for various billing schemes (diversified fare structure); 79   l  Interactive acceptance and recording of trip data, including passenger travel time, trip length, and fare; and Automated transfer of trip and performance data to Community Transit' accounting and s performance analysis systems.  l  A direct link between the AIBS and the scheduling and dispatching system will ensure the transfer of trip and passenger data between these two systems. In addition, the overall system will have the capability to receive and transmit data over RF for both the AIBS and the scheduling and dispatch system at the same time. Assessment of Computer Dispatch Technology in the Paratransit Industry Computer scheduling and dispatching in the paratransit industry was the focus of a study performed by the Institute of Transportation Research and Education at the University of North Carolina. Through on-site and telephone interviews with many taxi and paratransit operators and many software vendors, this study determined the following: l l  113  Current operating capabilities of computer dispatch systems; The costs and economic benefits of these systems; - The suitability of computer dispatch technology for the Mobility Manager concept; and - Future technological directions for computer dispatch. This study showed that the improvement in response time when using computer dispatch technology was significant. With manual dispatching in the taxi industry, it could take 30 minutes or more to assign a vehicle to a request. Conversely, it takes only 30-45 seconds if computer dispatch technology is employed. In terms of costs and economic benefits, the study showed that while computer dispatch technology is not inexpensive, the costs can be easily recouped through reduced operations costs. Further, the benefits include travel time savings to passengers. The study concluded that computer dispatch technology is an integral part of the Mobility Manager concept, and that for it to be most successful, it must provide real-time scheduling and dispatch. Finally, the study discussed the future direction of computer dispatch  [ 113 ]  Stone, John R., G o rman Gilbert, and Anna Nalevanko, Assessment of Computer Dispatch Technology in the Paratransit Industry, Final Report, prepared for Federal Transit Administration, Office of Technical Assistance and Safety, March 1992, Report No. DOT-T-92-23.  80   in terms of the ADA requirements and the integration of this technology with several other technologies that are increasingly being implemented by paratransit operators. Paratransit Scheduling and Dispatching Systems: Overview and Selection Guidelines This study, an update and follow-on to the previously mentioned study identified the capabilities of paratransit scheduling and dispatch software, and developed guidelines for the selection of automated paratransit management software. Also, the costs of scheduling and dispatching software and hardware were examined, yielding the following: ""Total system costs will vary depending on the size of the system and the options acquired. Paratransit software averages about $30,000 depending on available functions. Hardware costs vary depending not only on the products purchased, but also on the number of vehicles and personnel locations that the items serve. According to vendors, it will cost up to $4,000 to install APTS equipment in paratransit vehicles and up to $65,000 for the operations center. The costs include: VEHICLE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE In-vehicle computer & application software GPS receiver unit and antenna Smart card reader/writer RF modem (depends on type of radio system) $1,750-2,000 800 300 400-900 OPERATIONS CENTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE Communications software and hardware Database reporting software AVL software Scheduling/dispatching software Additional computer hardware Total per vehicle cost $3,250-4,000 Total operations center cost $10,000 5,000 10,000 30,000 10,000 $65,000  An automated scheduling and dispatching package represents about half of the total APTS system cost.""114  [114] Stone, John R., ""Paratransit Scheduling and Dispatching Systems Overview and Selection Guidelines,"" prepared for and presented at the 1993 IVHS America Annual Meeting, April 14-17, 1993, Washington, DC.  81   Transit Cooperative Research Program - Project A-6: Computerized Paratransit Dispatching In April 1993, the Transportation Research Board announced several transit research projects as part of the Transit Cooperative Research Program. Included was a $200,000 project called ""Computerized Paratransit Dispatching. "" ""The objective of this research is to determine the current state of the practice in computerized demand-responsive scheduling/dispatching and to compare the state of the practice with the current capabilities of software and hardware for demand-responsive transit scheduling/dispatching. This will involve examining experiences in the U.S. and abroad. The further objective of the research is to assess the cost-effectiveness and service quality implications of moving from the software typically used to computerized systems H with improved capabilities. ""115 A request for proposals for this project was to be issued in late 1993. Advances in Paratransit Scheduling and Dispatching Related to the ADA Many of the commercially-available routing and scheduling programs developed for the paratransit industry have recently been upgraded to include features that address ADA information needs and requirements. These packages typically include client information l16  modules as well as trip files, scheduling algorithms, reporting routines, and other functions designed to offer full support in all aspects of paratransit operation. include: l  Some of the common features that have been developed for ADA paratransit operation ADA Paratransit Eligible Customer Information: Individuals who are determined to be ADA paratransit eligible can be distinguished from other riders. Conditions and limitations of eligibility and/or the regulatory categories under which riders are eligible can be displayed. If ADA paratransit eligible persons are also eligible under other programs, this multiple eligibility information can also be displayed. To be of immediate use to schedulers, the above client information can be displayed in ""real time,"" meaning that it can be immediately accessed as part of a scheduling routine.  [115] [116]  TRB, ""Transit Cooperative Research Program Announcement of Transit Research Projects,"" April 1993. Thatcher, Russell, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Paratransit Eligibility Manual, Final Report, prepared for FTA Office of Grants Management, September 1993, DOT-T-93-17, pp. 122-133.  82   Relationship of Desired Trip to the Fixed-Route System:The ADA regulations require transit providers to offer complementary paratransit service to eligible individuals in an area defined by corridors 3/4 of a mile to each side of fixed routes plus to other areas within a ""core service area. "" In determining if a requested trip is eligible, transit providers will need to check the geographic relationship of the origin and destination to the fixed-route service. In addition, customers may be able to get to and from bus stops up to a certain distance (e.g., up to 1/4 of a mile) but are eligible for paratransit when they would need to travel a greater distance to and from bus stops. Several scheduling systems are now capable of incorporating geographic information on the fixed-route system. ADA paratransit service corridors can be displayed and calculations of distances from origin or destination to the closest fixed route can be made. More accurate systems will develop these calculations by using exact latitude/longitude coordinates or street centerlines. Trip eligibility can then be determined using this information. Visitors Information: The regulations require that ADA visitors to the area. Visitors are to be provided with 21 period of time if they have been determined eligible by claim to be eligible. After 21 days of service, the person local eligibility determination process. paratransit systems accommodate days of service over a reasonable another transit agency or if they can be required to go through the  Several paratransit scheduling programs are able to process visitor requests, track the days of service provided to a visitor, and display this information as part of the scheduling routine. Documenting Compliance: In addition to assisting with determining individual and trip eligibility, these systems are also capable of providing data and developing reports that can assist in assuring compliance with the regulations. For example, the ADA regulations require that complementary paratransit service, when fully implemented, cannot have capacity constraints. Examples of capacity constraints are an excessive number of trip denials, late pick-ups, and long trips. Trip requests are to be considered denials if they cannot be scheduled within one hour of the requested pick-up time. Additionally, the regulations limit subscription trips (""standing orders"") to no more than 50 percent of total trips when capacity constraints exist. Several software systems allow users to track and analyze capacity constraints and subscription trips. As part of the preparation of FTA's Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Paratransit nual, information about the availability of the above features was requested from 30 of the leading paratransit software companies. Twelve companies responded and indicated  83   that one or more of these features was either currently available or in development. Tables contained in the aforementioned manual summarize this information. Out of the twelve software systems offered by the companies that responded to the request for information, eight can display ADA service area corridors, and origins and destinations. The other four have this capability under development. Five can make real-time calculations of distance from routes to origins and destinations. Seven use latitude/longitude as the basis of distance calculations; one uses zonal-based centroids; one uses street centerlines; and the rest have the option of using any of these methods. Ontario ""Over the years, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation has funded the acquisition and implementation of scheduling software for transit systems for the disabled. Although there are a few systems in use in Ontario, they all require long lead times for trip reservations, usually one or two days in advance. This is due to the lack of an on-line automatic scheduler."" 117  Currently, UMA Engineering is developing and will be implementing a demonstration of a fully automated, on-line routing and scheduling system for specialized transit operators typically of less than thirty vehicles. The status of this project is that testing of the system is being completed in Burlington (single user) and Kitchener (multi-user). Parallel evaluation and acceptance testing by the Ministry' Transportation Technology and Energy Branch is also being s conducted. 118  [117]  Transportation Control Technology and System Office, Transportation Technology and Energy Branch, Ontario Ministry of Transportation, ""Automatic On-Line Scheduling/MIS System for Paratransit,"" Fact Sheet No. 37.

SMART INTERMODAL SYSTEMS The goal of smart intermodal systems is to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of transit for both system operators and trip-makers. The concept involves sharing information systems and other technology between and among modes. The overall objective is to decrease congestion by encouraging the use of alternatives to single occupancy vehicles. APTS technologies have great potential in this area and are already being applied in several cases. The following types of applications of smart intermodal systems are discussed in this chapter: l l l l l  Traveler Information Systems, Multimodal Smart Cards/Payment Systems, High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Facility Monitoring, Transportation Management Centers, and Vehicle Guidance Systems.  4.1 TRAVELER INFORMATION SYSTEMS Intermodal Traveler Information Systems are intended to entice single occupant drivers out of their vehicles and into a carp001 or a transit vehicle for at least a portion of the trip. Although some intermodal systems only present transit or carpooling options, the trend is toward providing information about the level of traffic congestion by the same means as information about various transit or carpooling options. These systems parallel the basic ATIS systems in that they can provide pre-trip or enroute information. State-of-the-Art Summary Although few fully intermodal information systems are operative at this time, they clearly represent the direction for future automated traveler information projects. These trends are evident from the following application examples. Applications Portland, Oregon The Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District is in the process of bidding an automated trip planning system which will interface with the City of Portland' smart corridor s 85   project and its highway monitoring system. This will insure that telephone information operators have real-time information on congestion levels. Los Angeles, California A California Smart Traveler project being pursued in the Los Angeles basin incorporates pre-trip planning. A prospective passenger can dial a 900 telephone number and use a 7-digit code identifying his or her point of origin and preferred destination. Multi-modal information is provided which could include bus, light rail and/or heavy rail itineraries. San Francisco, California The design of a broad based regional traveler information system (TravInfo) for the San Francisco Bay Area is almost complete. Travel information will be provided through touch-tone telephones. Callers will select among a menu of possible types of information, including highway congestion reports and updated schedules for the various transit systems operating in the Bay Area including Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), the ferry systems, Muni, commuter rail, and several bus operations. The regional carpooling ride-matching program, RIDES, is also a participant in TravInfo. The concept includes an open access architecture that can accommodate both multiple data sources and a variety of different types of requests for transportation information. An initial pilot multimodal information telephone system will be tested shortly. A traveler will have one basic number to call for all travel information and the call will be routed to the appropriate provider though a switching mechanism currently staffed by 26 operators. The private sector will be involved in developing kiosks displaying dynamic and static information at transit centers. TravInfo is directed both at marketing travel information systems to the ultimate user and a computer-based data system to the many transportation providers in the Bay Area. The system is an example of a public-private partnership. It has an advisory group of over 100 individuals from local firms, major automobile manufacturers, local governments, and state government 120 119  [ 119] [ 120 ]  Ken Turner, Portland Tri-Met. Robert Ratcliff, California Department of Transportation.  86   agencies. The large advisory group has four steering and working committees. The legal committee is currently tackling the issue of liability. A management board includes the Metropolitan Transit Commission, the California Department of Transportation - District 4, and the California Highway Boa rd. Boston, Massachusetts Travelers in the Boston area can obtain real-time traffic information over a computerized telephone information service every day except Saturday. The system is called ""Smart Routes."" It also provides information on bus, light and heavy rail, and commuter rail. The system lists certain roads and highways and asks the traveler to select one or to select information about transit modes. If the caller selects transit, he or she is guided through a menu to information on specific routes and given the status of the route. Minneapolis, Minnesota Minnesota DOT has developed an integrated motorist information program (Guidestar) in cooperation with the University of Minnesota, Motorola, and the Federal Highway Administration. Several elements of this comprehensive information system are already in place with others planned or under contract. An advanced motorist information system incorporates cable TV, teletex, and audiotex elements into a single LAN-based arrangement. Cable TV includes a real-time graphics map showing traffic flow on all currently instrumented freeways and live video from on-line closed-circuit television cameras. Radio traffic broadcasts are also supplemented with this information. Audiotex allows for information retrieval with touch-tone telephone, while teletex uses personal computer communication software packages to interactively retrieve traffic information. Automatic facsimile will be added later. The Genesis project, which begins in Fall 1993, will test the use of personal communication devices to deliver real-time traffic and transit information services. Devices to be evaluated include an 122 121  [121] [122]  Melanie Crotty, Metropolitan Transportation Commission. Boston Globe, Jan. 13, 1993.  87   intelligent hand-held unit with two-way wireless communications and a touch or pen-based screen, an alphanumeric pager, and off-the-shelf dedicated traffic information-only devices. In Fall 1994, traffic congestion and bus information will be added to pager functions. The Travlink project will test the impacts of various advanced information transfer and automated vehicle location systems on transit ridership and traveler behavior. This project will involve audiotex and videotex services in delivering real-time transit and traffic information. Estimates of travel time savings for HOV use will be provided.` "" ARTIC, a developing rural-based project of the Minnesota DOT, will offer automated dispatching and advanced rideshare matching for demand response transportation providers operating in multiple counties in northeastern Minnesota. will aid in the formation of real-time, single-trip ca rp ool s . 1 24  The system is expected to  accommodate standing orders and single trip requests with limited advance notice. As such it  4.2 MULTI-MODAL SMART CARDS/PAYMENT SYSTEMS As stated in Section 2.5, smart card technology typically means plastic cards (credit card size) with an integrated circuit microprocessor chip that can be used for identification, trip payment, and other travel-related functions. Generally, ""there are three types of smart cards: l  Contact Cards - require a physical contact between the card and the reader/writer unit. Data interchange occurs via ` touching fingers' in the unit. The Gemplus card used for the Chicago Regional Transportation Authority' (RTA) Payment and Control s Information System (PCIS) Project is an example. Contactless Cards - use a contactless interface to provide power to the card and for data transfer. This is done using inductive techniques for power and capacitive techniques for data reading. AT&T' card is an example. This card is available for use in AT&T' s s 2000 telephones, toll roads, and for other applications. Proximity Cards - use a contactless interface to interchange data between card and the reader/writer unit. This is done using radio frequency (RF), or laser techniques. Power may be supplied by a battery built into the card or by means of received magnetic  l  l  [123] Minnesota DOT, 1993 Melanie Brawn, Minnesota DOT, Transit Division. [124] Minnesota DOT, 1993. 88   s energy. Westinghouse-Cubic' ""Touch and Pass"" card used in a trial for London 125 Underground is an example. "" The multi-modal aspect of smart cards and payment systems refers to a smart card that could be used to pay fares across several modes of transportation (bus, rapid rail, light rail, highway, etc.). This section differs from Sections 2.3 and 2.4 in that it describes smart card technologies that can be used for a variety of transportation purposes, such as identification, trip payment, parking payment, etc. Section 2.3 describes reservation and ticketing for multiple transportation providers through an integrated system. Section 2.4 describes fare media that can be used on more than one mode, such as magnetic-strip cards that could be used for both bus and subway fares. State-of-the-Art Summary In Sections 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 of this report, applications of smart cards and multimodal fare payment are presented. However, none of these applications in North America have demonstrated the use of multi-modal smart cards as yet. The planned 1994 demonstration of a proximity smart card for Metrorail, Metrobus, and transit parking in Washington, DC (See section 2.5 for description.) is the only North American demonstration of multimodal smart 6 cards expected in the very near future. 126 There are, however, several multimodal smart card  systems being implemented in Europe, Asia and Australia. A few of these systems are described below. Applications Manchester, England Progress is being made in Great Britain on ""the world' first fully-integrated multi-modal s ticketing system based on contactless smart card technology"" [125] [126] 127  This system is being  Joshi, Ashok, J.W. Leas & Associates, ""Get Electronic Card Smart,"" prepared for the 1993 APTA Fare Collection and Police/Security Workshop, Chicago, IL, September 10, 1993, p. 2. There are other smart card applications, but they are not multimodal (e.g., Chicago RTA).  [127] ""Manchester Gets Smart, "" International Railway Journal, May 1993.  89   implemented in Manchester. When completed in 1995, ""it will enable cardholders to travel on regional rail, Metrolink light rail and bus networks in the area. "" 128  The Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive has contracted with AES Scanpoint for the El0 million system. The smart card, based on a contactless smart card developed by GEC Card Technology, has an antenna which receives signals from the card reader in order to add or subtract funds. The card can either touch the reader or pass within close proximity. The card has an effective range of one-two centimeters, and a transaction time of 300 milliseconds. ""The system will begin in early 1994 with 300 buses, two depots and up to 10,000 passenger smart cards. All post offices in the service area and twenty newspaper outlets and convenience stores will also participate in this first phase."" 129  Ultimately, card readers and ticket machines will be installed at 350 British Rail and Metrolink locations. The cards will be issued at more than twenty locations, and over 800 agents will be able to add funds to the cards. It is expected that electronic fund transfer kiosks will enable cardholders to add value to their cards. Approximately 500,000 cards will be issued. New South Wales, Australia Although the fate of this project has yet to be determined, the New South Wales Government is seeking an operator for a smart card system that will not only cover the public rail, bus, and ferry systems, but will cover many other services, such as fast food, convenience stores, and parking. Called the ""Stored Value Card"" (SVC), this smart card would be purchased at participating merchants for fixed values (e.g., $20, $50 and $100). The SVC system would be operated as shown in Figure 4.1. The following government and private sector service providers have committed to join the SVC system: - Public Transportation - rail, buses and ferries; - Pay Telephones - Optus Communications; - Fast Foods - McDonald' Kentucky Fried Chicken; s, [128] [129] Ibid.

They plan to introduce the card in late 1994. Denmark Denmark is implementing a national smart card system in which consumers can pay for telephone service, train and bus service, parking meters and items from vending machines. The contact smart cards will be in denominations of 30, 50 and 100 krone, and will not be capable of being replenished. This system was to be introduced in Copenhagen in December 1993. Switzerland The Post, Telephone and Telegraph service (PIT) in Biel, Switzerland is in it' third year s of experimenting with contact smart cards for purchasing a variety of services and products. Currently, 30,000 people are using this ""POSTCARD"" system. POSTCARDS ""can be used: - In ten Ascom ticket vending machines to purchase single and multiride bus tickets for the local bus system; - In 32 PTT public pay telephones; l  130  131  In 25 readers/writers in stores to pay for goods and services; In three hot and cold drink vending machines; and  -  - In readers/writer at the post office to pay for electric and telephone bills and to buy stamps. "" 132 4.3 HIGH OCCUPANCY VEHICLE FACILITY MONITORING The concept of high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes is well established as a means of encouraging single occupant drivers to carp001 and thereby help to relieve congestion. Those [130] Briefing Document on Stored Value Card Project, prepared by Commercial Services Group, New South Wales Government, Australia, July 1993. Morris, Linda, ""Plastic Cash Card for Trial,"" Telegraph Mirror, May 6, 1993. Joshi, Ashok, J.W. Leas & Associates, ""Get Electronic Card Smart,"" op. cit., p. 11.  [131]  [132] Ibid, p. 10.  92   traveling in cars with two or more passengers (or in some cases, three or more passengers, depending on the threshold established) are rewarded with a shorter travel time by being permitted to use exclusive travel lanes. Given the benefits of congestion-free travel, there is a temptation for drivers of single occupancy vehicles to use the HOV lanes illegally. Hence, monitoring the use of HOV lanes has become an increasing challenge. The traditional response is to station police cars near ramp entrances, but costs in personnel time and limited effectiveness in monitoring peak hour use of HOV lanes has led to the search for a technological solution to the issue of HOV lane monitoring. State-of-the-Art Summary To date, a number of HOV lane monitoring devices have been tested but none has proven to be fully effective in operation. Surveillance cameras have been used in several locations, but they are not accurate in recording the presence of children or an individual lying down in the automobile. They are also not usable in darkness. Infrared beams are turned aside by tinted windshields. Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI), where vehicles are equipped with transponders which are read by wayside sensors, will verify compliance even if the vehicle does not have the requisite passengers on a given trip. Experimental tests are continuing, largely focusing on adapting military surveillance techniques or techniques used in law enforcement for such a purpose. Some metropolitan areas have dismissed technological solutions, noting the costs involved in implementation - an issue which has not been fully explored. Applications Portland, Oregon In an ongoing operational test, car-pools and buses use by-pass lanes to avoid rampmetering queues when entering the HOV facility. Registered carpools are issued vehicle ID cards, which are displayed in the windshield and are read at the ramp. More permanent ID tags are affixed to buses. The number of registered carpools is extensive, since Tri-Met has been managing a carp001 matching program for several years. The Oregon Department of  93   Transportation is developing a smaller version of the tag which can be attached to its vehicles using velcro. The Oregon DOT is now accepting proposals for a study to test the relative effectiveness of using law enforcement personnel, compared to capital investments such as cameras or signs, for monitoring HOV violation rates. Dallas, Texas The Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) has initiated a study that will assess the applicability of various types of automated enforcement technologies for the East R. L. Thornton HOV lane. The study will focus on two basic types of automated enforcement technologies AVI and imaging technologies. The AVI approach would use a small in-vehicle device that will identify the vehicle to an electronic reader via radio frequency. Imaging technologies would use video or other visualization techniques to distinguish individual vehicle passengers remotely. Initial contacts are being made with vendors who might provide necessary software. Implementation will occur if any of the alternative technologies examined are judged to be feasible. 133  Houston, Texas Houston is experimenting with use of AVI to monitor congestion on HOV lanes, rather than as a surveillance device. One thousand tags have been distributed to commuters who travel on I-10, I-45, and US 290. Radio frequency antennas are mounted overhead on existing signs and bridges and will continuously scan the lanes looking for tags on vehicles that are serving as congestion probes. Actual trip times are compared with expected trip time and the level of congestion assessed. Similar tags are being used for electronic toll collection on the Sam Houston and Hardy toll roads as well as in highways in Oklahoma, Dallas, Hong Kong, and London. To date, over 400,000 AVI tags have been distributed for revenue collection. 134  No plans have been  [133] [134]  Lomax, project statement, September 1993. AmTech, Backscatter, summer 1993.  94   announced to use tags to identify registered carpools or to use the same antennas for monitoring the number of passengers in vehicles on an HOV lane. Georgia Institute of Technology At the Georgia Institute of Technology, a unique set of experiments in advanced monitoring systems for HOV lanes are being performed. Prototype scanning radiometers are being field tested. These use electromagnetic radiation as a means of reading inside a vehicle to determine the number of passengers. Since humans raise the heat of a seat by about six degrees, it is claimed to be possible to detect exactly how many people are in a vehicle. This concept would be successful in detecting the use of dummies as vehicle passengers and will report the presence of children or individuals who are lying down and who might not be seen by a camera. Earlier studies using infrared were quickly abandoned since the windshield blocks infrared light. The concept awaits funding for an operational test. Camera Surveillance The Minnesota Guidestar project is experimenting with the use of autoscope, an advanced area-wide vehicle directional and automatic vehicle surveillance system invented at the University of Minnesota. The autoscope looks for changes in vehicle speeds and volumes and then analyzes video imagery and generates traffic flow information. To date, however, it is not being used to monitor the number of passengers in cars on the HOV lanes. 136 13 5  Jackson, Michigan and National City, California police are using camera-based advanced traffic enforcement systems developed by U. S. Public Technologies to enforce speed limits, red lights, and stopping at railroad crossings. The system has not been tested on HOV lanes except with spot checking using cameras. 137  [135]  Gene Greneker, Professor of Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology.

[137] Zev Fogel, U.S. Public Technologies.  95   The cities of Portland, Oregon, Boca Raton, Florida, and San Jose, California are all using Colby Monitoring Products for remote monitoring of traffic signals and parking areas. These systems involve using a standard touch-tone telephone to access remote video monitors and to transmit video pictures. Options include zoom and pan, tilt, and infrared detectors and cellular phone access. The system has not been used for HOV monitoring as yet. 4.4 TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT CENTERS A number of well-established Transportation Management Centers (TMCs) are associated with highway monitoring. They use an array of television monitors and cameras to observe congestion levels on limited access highways. Observation of congestion leads to displaying warnings and suggested re-routings on automated highway message boards. Some of the Transportation Management Centers like that in Los Angeles also monitor traffic build-up on arterials by using inductive loop detectors imbedded in the pavement at intersections. Traffic signals are preprogrammed to respond to high levels of traffic build up on key arterials by extending the green time. On Century Boulevard in Los Angeles, for example, the traffic signals are configured to respond to the level of traffic expected at sporting events at the Los Angeles Coliseum. Examples of TMCs are: the Inform project in Long Island, New York; the Washington, DC Metropolitan Traffic Management Facility; the Minnesota Department of Transportation Interstate Highway Monitoring System; and the California Department of Transportation system for monitoring the Los Angeles freeways. State-of the-Art Summary None of the current TMCs are yet linked to information about a transit alternative. There are, however, plans to feed real-time traffic congestion reporting into traveler information systems that do highlight transit and ride-sharing alternatives, as was discussed earlier. The U.S. Department of Transportation has just issued a request for proposals for public-private partnerships to address the interrelated issue of enroute driver and traveler services information. Operational tests are planned.  96   Applications One type of application is the provision of traffic signal preemption or extension of green time for buses that are running late because of congestion levels. The following are examples of some attention being afforded to transit operations, although most do not involve a Transportation Management Center. Detroit,. Michigan Plans for the Detroit Transportation Center Transit Information System call for an eventual multi-modal information system which would link transit information with highway congestion information. Under the plan, real-time traffic information generated by the interstate traffic management system will be relayed to the transit authority. The transit authority is currently supplied with information on congestion points, but not yet in real time. Anaheim, California The Anaheim Traffic Management Information and Fleet Operation Coordination project has an extensive freeway monitoring program for Orange County, based in Anaheim, but no transit component is operational yet. Portland, Oregon A pilot project is underway in traffic signal preemption for one corridor, Route 9, Powell Street. This is managed by the City of Portland. They are using vehicle ID cards and inductive loop detectors imbedded in the pavement. A related project sponsored by the Oregon DOT is considering the potential for ramp monitoring on the Sunset Highway. Both use the same bus ID cards. 140 13 9 138  [138] [139] [140]  Janet D' Ignazio, Michigan DOT. Doreen Tyrell, Detroit DOT. Jim Paral, City of Anaheim. Ken Turner, Portland Smart Vehicle.  97   Toronto, Ontario The city of Toronto now has thirty intersections which have adaptive signal control for street cars in the Queen Street corridor. There are also ten intersections that have adaptive signal control for buses. Chicago, Illinois The CTA is in the process of negotiating a contract with an integrator for a system that would not only include automatic vehicle location for the majority of its fleet but would also include adaptive signal control for transit vehicles operating on major arteria ls. Saarbruecken/Oldenburg, Germany There are several examples of effective traffic signal preemption operations in Europe. For example, in Saarbruecken, Germany, an autonomous vehicle control monitoring system features management of on-board electronics/peripherals and traffic signal preemption, connection protection, and active passenger signs. The system, designed by Intelligent Transportation Systems, also features cashless payment via smart cards. In Oldenburg, Germany, traffic signal preemption is also integrated with the use of smart cards. Both systems use GPS and GIS mapping in their tracking systems. London, England A bus priority system is being tested in London within the SCOOT traffic-responsive UTC system. SCOOT currently is operating 450 intersections; 5,000 buses are equipped with transponders. The system uses selective detection of buses, based upon bus transponders and inductive loop detectors. SCOOT features the regular optimization of cycle time and the use of 143 142 141  [141] [142] [ 143 ]  Brandon Hemily, Canadian Urban Transit Association. Ronald Baker, Chicago Transit Authority.

Forty intersections are involved and soon s the entire fleet of 1,300 vehicles will be equipped. The system uses journey time prediction methods to provide the information necessary to give priority to the public transportation vehicles. A similar system is being introduced in Gothenburg where adaptive control is based on automatic updating at central control and modified by SPOT units at the local level. Most intersections have the system installed with priority given to trams. However, the granting of priority does not consider the level of congestion.145' 4.5 VEHICLE GUIDANCE SYSTEMS Vehicle guidance systems integrate technologies that laterally and longitudinally control the operation of a vehicle. To date, vehicle guidance technologies that have been demonstrated include: track guidance, electronic guidance, magnetic guidance, and vision systems. Track guidance is mechanical, and has been used in bus systems in Rochefort, Belgium; Essen, Germany; Adelaide Australia; and Birmingham, United Kingdom. Electronic guidance consists of wire buried in a roadway that emits a signal to guide a bus. This technology is operating in Furth, Germany. Magnetic guidance and vision systems are described below. State-of-the-Art Summary In the State-of-the-art Update ` 2 report, the aforementioned guided bus systems were 9 reviewed. Since then, there has been no further development in these specific systems.  [144] Burton, Robert and Nicholas Hounsell, ""Bus Priority and UTC Systems: The PROMPT Project,"" Proceedings of the IEEE-IEE Vehicle Navigation Systems Conference, VNIS ` Ottawa pp. 602-605. 93, [145] Ibid.  99   However, there are several developments in new technologies that are being demonstrated in North America, England and Japan. Applications United Kingdom A bus system similar to that in Furth, Germany was to be operating in the English Channel Tunnel, probably by the end of 1993. This system has electronic guidance, which consists of wire (buried in the road) that emits a signal which is used by a transducer on the bus to control the steering system. San Francisco Bay Area, California The Partners for Advanced Transit and Highways (PATH) has a test track which uses a guidance system based on magnets. PATH has been experimenting with this concept since 1987, and is currently testing the technology with automobiles. This technology consists of permanent magnets buried in the center of the road three to five feet apart. The magnets, which have a one inch diameter and are four inches long, would be dropped into holes drilled into a road and then covered with pavement (so they would not be detectable to the eye). 146  This ""magnetic marker reference system is used to provide vehicle lateral displacement and the upcoming road radius of curvature to the vehicle. The road geometric information (curvature, start and end points) are obtained off-line and stored in an on-board database. The absolute position is transmitted to the vehicle, which is then used to extract the road curvature information. "" 147  PATH is discussing the potential for bus implementation with the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District (AC Transit). PATH is working with Honeywell on the magnets, with TRW  [146] [147]  Weibin Zhang, Research Specialist, Partners for Advanced Transit and Highways (PATH). Peng, Huei, Weibin Zhang, Steven Shladover, Masayoshi Tomizuka, and Alan Arai, ""Magnetic-MarkerBased Lane Keeping: A Robustness Experimental Study,"" prepared for the 1993 SAE Congress, September 27, 1992, p. 2.  100   on the steering actuation, and with Gillig on the buses themselves. PATH anticipates a full demanstration of this technology in three to five years. Japan In Japan, the vision system of guidance has been demonstrated with automobiles and a small Nissan bus. The vision system recognizes vehicle lateral and longitudinal position, and traffic signs. ""Vision-based systems have the potential to be used for a wide variety of vehicle control purposes, e.g., obstacle detection, collision warning, lane keeping, adaptive cruise 8 control, etc. "" 14* The demonstration, which was supported by the Japan Ministry of International  Trade and Industry, was performed at low speeds and used six to eight videocameras. This system could be a potential guidance technology for transit in fifteen to twenty years.  [148]  Ibid.  101   5. FTA-SPONSORED FIELD OPERATIONAL TESTS AND RESEARCH Testing in a real-world environment is essential for a complete and proper evaluation of any technology, system, or innovation. It is only in this environment that the system will be subjected to the challenges that it will experience in regular operation. As part of the Advanced Public Transportation Systems Program, the Federal Transit Administration is sponsoring several Field Operational Tests (FOT) of various innovative technologies throughout the country. These tests will include a full assessment of each promising technology with test results widely disseminated. This will allow service providers interested in implementing APTS technologies and innovations to benefit from the FOT information generated by others. It should reduce trial-and-error inefficiencies and may eliminate wasteful implementation of systems that are inappropriate. Representative Projects There are several FTA-sponsored FOTs planned or in progress. They are listed in Table 5.1.

Federal funding for bus purchases has r ecen tly been expanded. Our Nation is building mor e new transit systems tha n at any time during the past 80 year s. The number of Americans traveling by bicycle continues to increase. These trend s ma ke it more import ant than ever to strengthen the connections between bicycles and transit. This FTA brochure, Bicycles and Transit: A Partnership that Works , describes how t ransit agencies around the country are building these connections, and how Federal t ransportation programs may be u sed to support more of these effort s.  "" Li nk i n g bi c y cl e s a nd tr a ns i t  Linking bicycles and transit together is a win-win proposition. Bicyclefriendly transit provides cyclists with inc reased options for tra vel, and it tion can help establish more livable communities. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Centur y (TEA -21) authorizes unpr eced ented le vels of funding a nd fle xibility to tie together t ravel by transit a nd bicycle. Under TEA-21, transit age ncies can continue using Fed eral Tra nsit Administration (FTA) re sources to improve bicycle acces s to public transp ortation fa cilitie s.

""   BICYCLES AND TRANSIT  A Pa r t n e r s h i p t h a t  Wo r k s  In an era of increasing traffic congestion, concern about air quality, and limited public resources, more and more of our cities and communities are discovering the benefits of serving people's travel needs with bicycling and public transportation. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) encourages states and metropolitan areas to develop innovative transportation plans and programs which better integrate public transit, bicycle facilities, and other modes of travel into the existing transportation system. The goal of this multimodal planning is to provide travelers with a real choice of travel options. In many areas, increased investment in transit and bicycle facilities can help meet goals for cleaner, healthier air; less congested roadways; and more livable communities. Used individually, bicycling and transit provide low-cost mobility and place fewer demands on local roads and highways to carry everyday trips. Used in combination, bicycles and public transportation provide millions of Americans with enhanced access buses  to work, shopping, services, and family and friends. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA), in partnership with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), supports the TEA-21 vision of a more coordinated, truly multimodal transportation system, and believes that public transportation and bicycles are logical partners in realizing this future. This booklet summarizes the benefits of bicycles  integrating bicycle and transit facilities and explains how FTA capital and planning program funds can be used to plan and implement facilities and equipment which improve bicycle access to public transportation. It also provides examples of how communities are successfully linking bicycles and transit to provide more and better  trains  choices to meet people's daily travel needs.   BICYCLES AND TRANSIT  S t r a t e g i e s a n d Be n e f i t s There are several benefits to investing in and integrating transit and bicycle facilities: for  Bicyclists  Access to transit allows bicyclists the opportunity to make longer trips. Where physical conditions prevent a continuous bicycle trip, public transportation can provide a link to previously inaccessible destinations.  Public Transportation Providers for  Improving bicycle access attracts new transit riders. Bicycle access expands transit's catchment area. Distances to transit stops that may be too far to walk may be within range of a short bicycle trip. Bicyclists represent an important weekend or off-peak market, when transit ridership is typically lower and capacity is underutilized. Providing secure parking for bicycles at transit stops and stations is less expensive than providing parking for automobiles.  for L i v a b l e Communities  Bicycles and transit provide more mobility options to everyone, particularly those who because of age, disability, or income are unable to drive. Less automobile traffic through neighborhoods contributes to a safer, quieter, and more pleasant environment.  for  Everyone  Safe and convenient transit service and bicycle facilities attracts more passengers and increases the viability of transit service. Fewer trips by automobile reduces polluting emissions. Increased use of transit and bicycle facilities can decrease traffic congestion.   {  Caltrain  B oos ts Ride rshi p  Almost 2,000 bicyclists a day climb aboard the 110-km (70-mile) Caltrain passenger rail line between San Francisco and the Silicon Valley, and bring trains may have two bike cars, for a capacity of 48 bikes) up from just four  their bikes on board with them. Each train has space for 24 bikes (some  spaces when the program began in 1992. More than half of a recent ridership jump of seven percent was attributable to bicyclists and the initial $30,000 investment by San Francisco County, plus another $30,000 from Caltrain to expand capacity, was repaid in farebox revenue within six Demand for bicycle spaces is now so fierce that Caltrain recently months. started offering two rented bicycle lockers for the price of one in an effort  to persuade bicyclists to keep bikes at both ends of their trip rather than  bring their bike on boar d  !

FTA's principal capital funding programs the Capital Pr og ram, the Urbanized Area Formul a Program and the Formula Program for NonUrbanized Areas are eligible for bicycle transit linkages. TEA-21 defines capital projects as including: ""a mass transportation improvement that enhances economic development or incorporates private investment including...pedestrian and bicycle access to a mass transportation facility...because the improvement enhances the effectiveness of a mass transportation project and is related physically or functionally to that mass transportation project, or establishes new or enhanced coordination between mass transportation and other transportation, and provides a fair share of revenue for mass transportation that will be used for mass transportation.""  Pe de st r ian Ac ces s an d Wal k w ay s f a l l i n to t he tr a ns i t enhancement category.  TEA-21 also creates a new category of transit enhancement activities. One percent of Urbanized Area Formula program funds apportioned to urban areas of at least 200,000 population are set-aside for transit enhancements, including the following activities: bicycle access, including bicycle storage facilities and installing equipment for transporting bicycles on mass transportation vehicles; pedestrian access and walkways; historic preservation, rehabilitation, and operation of historic mass transportation buildings, structures, and facilities (including historic bus and railroad facilities and canals); bus shelters; landscaping and other scenic beautification; public art; projects that enhance access for people with disabilities to mass transportation.   Bike Racks  Bi ke Lo c ke r s  Many transit agencies have also chosen to apply for funds administered by the Federal Highway Administration such as the Transportation Enhancements program and Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) program to pay for bike racks on buses and other projects (see below for more details).  {  FHW A F u n d i n g S o u r ces Bicycle improvements, such as projects to better integrate bicycles and transit, remain eligible for most of the federal-aid highway funding pronew TEA-21 legislation. Numerous bike racks on buses programs have been funded from the  grams established by ISTEA in 1991. These programs are continued in the  Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) program and the Transportation Enhancement program. Metra, Chicago's regional  commuter rail service, recently invested CMAQ funds to install almost 200 bicycle lockers at nine stations throughout the system. Other funding sources that have been used for bicycle improvements  include the Surface Transportation Program and the National Highway Sy st e m.

Bicycle projects using other transit funds may be funded at up to the 90 percent federal matching level. Non-bicycle related transit enhancement activities have the usual 80/20 ratio for federal/local funding.

Like a number of other transit agencies, the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) eliminated its permit requirement for bringing bicy-  bikes on board. Obtaining a permit costs $5 and requires the rider to  cles on Metro trains. This simplifies travel for bike-transit users and encourages more bike-transit trips (www.wmata.com).   BICYCLES AND TRANSIT  The Planning Process  In addition to providing unprecedented funding opportunities for bicycle and pedestrian projects, TEA-21 requires that State and local agencies (including transit operators) participate in a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive multimodal transportation planning process. This process is the forum for 1) developing regional and statewide goals and objectives for improving transportation facilities and systems; 2) identifying the transportation needs for a given planning area; 3) evaluating the wide range of transportation alternatives and funding options available to address deficiencies; and 4) selecting the most appropriate projects and strategies to meet transportation goals, objectives, and needs. TEA-21 encourages the participation of the general public, public transportation providers, and bicycle and pedestrian advocates (among other stakeholders) in the planning process. Participation by these groups ensures the consideration of bicycle facility improvements in the development of long-range plans and near term transportation improvement programs. In urbanized areas of over 50,000 population, interested  TEA-21  encourages  parties should contact their Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) and local transit providers to participate in planning for improved bicycle access to transit, and for other bicycle-related facilities and programs. In nonurbanized areas, individuals and groups interested in bicycling and transit should contact their State Department of Transportation for information on bicycle and transit programs in their State. The FTA Regional Office serving your State (and identified in the Resources section of this guide) can direct you to appropriate local contacts.  t he pa r ti c ip a t ion o f t h e g en e r a l p ub li c , p u bl i c t ra n sp o rt a ti o n p r o vi d er s, a nd bi c ycl e an d p ed e s t r i a n a d v oca t es i n t he p l an n i n g p roc e s s.   B IC Y C L ES A N D TR AN S I T  The Planning Process  P l an n i n g S t u d i e s  Access 200 0:  Maryland' s bic yc le a cce ss inv ent ory  In July, 1996, the Maryland Mass Transit Administration (MTA) initiated a statewide inventory of access for bicycles and pedestrians at 111 existing and planned light, heavy, and commuter rail stations throughout the State. The goal was to identify the availability and condition of roadways and facilities at or near rail stations to determine what improvements are needed to accommodate, in a safe and effective manner, pedestrians and bicyclists. The inventory was funded with $160,000 of Federal Transit Administration State Planning and Research Program money and $40,000 of state matching funds. Data were collected within a three kilometer (2 mile) radius for bicycles and one kilometer (0.6 miles) for pedestrians on a wide range of items including: availability of bicycle racks and lockers condition and availability of bicycle routes and facilities connecting to stations traffic conditions such as traffic volumes and speed, lane widths, surface conditions, parking, bridges, traffic mix, and related considerations. The information is being used to target improvements by the Maryland DOT (including the MTA) and local governments and to generate a greater understanding of the importance of adequate access to public transportation.

The pilot program, financed by the City of Phoenix and Arizona DOT, was a huge success with more than 5,500 riders using the racks in the six-month trial period. Later that year, the city matched local funds with Urbanized Area Formula program Federal Transit dollars to outfit all 350 buses in the fleet with bike racks. The bike racks were designed by a local company with input from the transit operator, government agency staff, and bicyclists. The racks allow either of the two bicycles to be loaded and unloaded quickly, safely, and without touching the other bike. The racks have proven durable and do not interfere with bus maintenance and cleaning.

Seattle:  Metr o C ar ri es the La rge st Load  The success of the Phoenix program quickly caught the attention of other transit agencies and it is now estimated that more t han one-in-five transit buses in the country is equipped with a bike rack. In 1993, t he Seattle / King County transit agency, Metro, used more than $900,000 of CMAQ funds to equip every one of its 1,200 buses with racks and the agency now boasts more than 40,000 bicycle-carrying passengers every month. The racks were designed and supplied by a northwest firm whose racks now carry more than 250,000 riders each month on systems throughout the country.

This is the second such bicycle facility in Los Angeles County built with voter-approved Proposition C cent sales tax revenues, which the MTA allocates for a variety of regional transportation improvement projects. The first facility opened in 1996 at the Long Beach Transit Mall next to the MTA Metro Blue Line Station in Long Beach. The MTA earmarked $283,000 in Proposition C sales tax revenues to build the $350,000 Chatsworth building which will be open to the public between the hours of 6 a.m. and 6:30 p.m., Mondays through Fridays. The Chatsworth Depot Bike Stop will feature bike rentals, repairs, accessories, and information and assistance for enthusiasts. Other services offered at the facility include changing rooms, an emergency ride home program for registered bicycle commuters and electric bicycle rentals for use by commuters traveling from the station to worksites in the Northwestern San Fernando Valley. In addition, the Chatsworth Depot Bike Stop will feature bicycle locker rentals and a meeting room for local bicycle clubs and advocacy groups. A third MTA funded full-service bicycle storage and rental facility is slated to open at a Metrolink Station in the Santa Clarita Valley in 1999.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Goal  The goal of this transit plan is to provide policy guidance in the development and where necessary, retraction of the transit system. It does not suggest any funding strategies, but rather offers a framework for what transit should look like in Scottsdale. Policy Statements  Transit service should be implemented based upon customer demand, performance and availability of funding.  Transit service should be actively marketed in order to increase ridership and fare revenues.  The area of Scottsdale south of the Loop 101 should have frequent service on more closely spaced routes; the area north of the Loop 101 should have less frequent service on more widely spaced routes.   Outside funding sources (e.g. fares, federal grants, regional transit funding) should be maximized. Transportation choices should be balanced with productivity when considering transit service reductions. General Recommendations      Assign Transportation Commission as a transit oversight committee. Actively market transit. Prepare a monitoring system for reporting performance of service. Consider land use strategies that encourage transit friendly design. Increase shelter maintenance as shelters are constructed.  City of Scottsdale  -2-  Transit Plan   February 2003  Recommendations for Current Services   Operate Scottsdale Trolley year round, on Sundays and longer hours per day. Expand operating hours and frequencies on current bus routes. Special Services  Continue to meet the mobility requirements for people with disabilities as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Expand alternative paratransit programs with the purpose of managing costs of Dial-a-Ride costs and providing basic service to seniors and people with disabilities. Recommendations for New Transit Services    Create a Resort Trolley in partnership with the resorts and merchant associations. Create second Scottsdale Trolley route in the downtown Create a circulator in southern Scottsdale to serve areas such as Paiute Center, Civic Center Senior Center and Civic Center Library.     Create a limited stop service on Scottsdale Road. Provide service using Lincoln Road and Indian Bend Road Plan and establish a neighborhood circulator in McCormick Ranch. Provide access to the Salt River Pima Maricopa Community and Mesa by participating in a McKellips Road fixed route.  City of Scottsdale  -3-  Transit Plan   February 2003           Plan and establish a neighborhood circulator in McDowell Mountain Ranch. Provide an express route from McDowell Mountain Ranch Telecommute Center to Phoenix. Provide an express route from a park and ride at Pima Road and Pima Freeway into Phoenix. Plan and establish a neighborhood circulator near Shea and 132nd Street. Plan and establish a neighborhood circulator in DC Ranch. Provide an express route from a park and ride at Pima Freeway and Shea Boulevard into Tempe/Phoenix. Extend the Scottsdale Road route to Pinnacle Peak. Create a limited stop route on Pima Road.  City of Scottsdale  -4-  Transit Plan   February 2003  2. THE VISION 2.1 Vision Statement The transit system provides accessible mobility choices supporting a diverse population, improved air quality, greater safety, cost effectiveness, multiple mobility modes and integration with other valley transit systems. 2.2 Values  Offer mobility choices that reflect the community's diverse needs, lifestyles, and neighborhood dynamics and reduce reliance on automobiles.  Develop a transit system that supports the natural environment, preserves the Sonoran desert and improves quality of life.   Support contiguous and consistent regional and citywide connections. Encourage partnerships between citizens, businesses, system users and the city to develop, promote and implement the transit system.    Pursue efficiency and efficacy in balance with availability of choices. Use technology to increase effectiveness and efficiency of system performance. Ensure that choices made today consider our vision for the future. 2.3 Goal The goal of this transit plan is to provide policy guidance in the development and, where necessary, retraction of the transit system.  City of Scottsdale  -5-  Transit Plan   February 2003  3. TRANSIT SERVICE 3.1 General Policy Statements To support the vision articulated above, the following policies have been developed: Regional Connections   The Scottsdale Transit Plan encourages the development of regional transit service to meet inter-city travel needs. Policies for transit service in Scottsdale will be developed in coordination with policies in neighboring jurisdictions. Special Services The City of Scottsdale is committed to making its transit service accessible to people who have mobility-impairments, using both traditional and non-traditional services to meet their transportation needs. System Expansion and/or Retraction The transit system should be developed in response to travel demand. This policy includes:     Actively marketing the transit system in order to generate demand for existing services. Encouraging development of coordinated linkages between the transit system and land use policies. Promoting transit demand in new areas by encouraging transit and pedestrian friendly facilities. Creating policies to balance automobile and transit systems such as the use of bus bays and bus priority systems.  City of Scottsdale  -6-  Transit Plan   February 2003  Education The City should actively educate, market and promote transit with the intention of increasing ridership and establishing new markets for transit. Quality of Experience  The City should seek to improve communications between all elements, providers and users of the system wherever feasible.  The City should demand high standards for operations excellence from its contractors including passenger comfort, customer service and reliability. 3.2 Operating Policy Statements These operating statements are intended as strategic goals for the system and should be implemented as demand is  demonstrated. Service levels on regional routes should not exceed those of neighboring jurisdictions. Days of Service Fixed Route Service The system should operate seven days a week, all year, including holidays. Operating Hours All routes should operate between 5 a.m. and 1 a.m. Frequency All routes should be operated at 15-minute service levels from start of service until early evening and half hour service thereafter. Route Design Fixed route and flexible routes should be designed using local community input.  City of Scottsdale  -7-  Transit Plan   February 2003  Coverage  South of Loop 101: Route spacing should be at 1/2-mile intervals except where the street system does not allow a grid system; circulators would be used in non-grid areas.  North of Loop 101: Route spacing should be sparser; circulators should be used in non-grid areas. Fare Pricing Fare structure should:     Be coordinated with the regional system Include off-peak pricing to encourage more ridership Continue to include free fares for downtown shuttles and neighborhood circulators Allow for a free-fare trial period during start-up of each new service Cost Recovery through Fares The overall goal of the system is to achieve 25% of funding from the farebox for that portion of the system upon which fares are collected. This plan acknowledges that some routes support community social goals and may not perform at this level. New services operating less than one year are not included in the goal as it is acknowledged that new services require at least a year to achieve minimum operating standards.  City of Scottsdale  -8-  Transit Plan   February 2003  Downtown shuttles should operate free fare for the following reasons:   Eliminating the fare speeds operations which is crucial to this type of service, These services serve major activity centers where short trips as well as repetitive trips are encouraged; eliminating the fare encourages more people to use these services rather than re-parking their vehicle.      These services specifically support economic vitality by introducing new potential customers to businesses.  Bus Stops Bus stops should generally be spaced  mile apart except in areas of greater demand and in areas predominantly used by seniors and people with disabilities. Where the bus operator deems safe, passengers may alight from a bus at a non-designated place. Service Trial Period A service trial period should be established for all new services, route extensions or modifications. Typically, new service should be operated for a minimum of one year. Shuttle services are designed to operate in small areas serving very short trips. These services are often delivered using specialty theme vehicles. Routes and schedules should be very easy to understand.  The service should be designed with frequencies of ten minutes or less.  City of Scottsdale  -9-  Transit Plan   February 2003    The service should be designed to a specific purpose (e.g., deliver people from parking area to a stadium.)  Flexible Route Service Flexible route services have many variations and are designed to be adaptable to special circumstances. For example, vehicles providing a service may have a basic route to follow but when requested, the vehicles may deviate from that route. Similarly, schedules may be written so that variations may be allowed.    The service should be designed in coordination with neighborhoods The service should be anchored to a fixed route service at a major activity point The service should use small vehicles  Special Services Special services are those that are directed to two specific markets: seniors and people with disabilities. Mobility Training Personalized training is provided to seniors and people with disabilities through the Community Forum. This training matches an instructor with similar physical abilities to the user and the training is accomplished on the buses routes the user is most likely to use. In addition, Valley Metro provides group travel training through senior centers on routes leading to the senior centers. The City should continue to support mobility training in all forms to encourage citizens to utilize the bus system, less expensive special services and as a last resort dial-a-ride.  City of Scottsdale  - 10 -  Transit Plan   February 2003  East Valley Dial-a-Ride (EVDAR) The EVDAR is provided by joint agreement between Mesa, Chandler, Gilbert, Tempe, Scottsdale and Valley Metro. It is a shared-ride service for senior citizens and people with disabilities. Registered participants can either make a reservation or call for an immediate ride in a van that is also picking up other passengers.   ADA service should be designed in coordination with and meet the standards of the Regional ADA Plan City-provided demand service should strive for service standards similar to ADA standards Cab Connection and Transportation Reimbursement and Information Program (TRIP) Cab Connection is a new Scottsdale program that is designed to offer seniors and people with disabilities an alternative to DAR. While important to the regional transportation system, DAR can be expensive and result in lengthy trips for some passengers. This taxi voucher program provides users more flexibility than EVDAR and operates at less cost to the city. These programs should continue to seek new ways of meeting customer needs.  CAB CONNECTI ON Call a cab. We vouch for it!    The primary goal of this program is to provide an excellent service to the special needs customer by keeping control of the trip in the customer's hands.    A secondary goal is to maintain a low average cost per trip to the city when compared to Dial-a-Ride services.  3.3 Performance Standards Standards are indicators or measures of the system that trigger further analysis if the parameters are exceeded or are not met. Some standards are objective and are based on industry  City of Scottsdale  - 11 -  Transit Plan   February 2003  experience while others allow services to be compared relative to each other. Generally speaking, the more objective standards are used for effectiveness evaluations while relative objectives are used for efficient management objectives. For some types of services, no performance standard is set although a more general goal may be pursued. Specific performance measures are used for specific services:  Arterial Routes (Performance standard: 1.80 passengers/mile minimum) Local Routes (Performance standard: 1.00 passenger per mile minimum)  Express Routes (Performance standard: 20 passengers per trip minimum)  Dial-a-Ride (No performance standard as ADA service is federally required. Goal: Stabilization, if not reduction, of annual operating budget.)  Cab Connection/TRIP (Performance standard   cost per trip of DAR. Goal: Decrease reliance on Dial-a-Ride.)  Trolley (Performance standard: more passengers per day than last year.) 3.4 Capital Policy Statements This plan recognizes that capital investments directly affect passengers' experience of transit and as such should be implemented with the highest quality of experience in mind. The    City of Scottsdale  - 12 -  Transit Plan   February 2003  transit system should reflect the high standards of Scottsdale character. The City should leverage local dollars with federal, state and regional funds whenever possible. Passenger Waiting Areas (Bus Stops)  Bus stops in residential areas should be designated with a pole and a sign. Benches and trash receptacles should be placed at the bus stop with notification to the property owner and tenants.  Bus stops adjacent to multi-family developments should be designated with a pole and a sign. Benches and shelters should also be placed at the bus stop.  Bus stops along minor and major arterial streets should be shaded, comfortable, safe and easily cleaned and repaired.  Passenger waiting shelters should be oriented to provide shade first in the primary travel direction during peak hours and second throughout the maximum number of hours of the day. Shelter design should be sensitive to the character of the surrounding neighborhood.    Other amenities should also be added as technology becomes available. Adequate seating should be provided. Maintenance at stops (such as shelter cleaning or trash disposal) should be provided commiserate with the level of activity occurring at the stop. Park and Ride Lots Park and Ride lots are intended to allow people who live in areas not immediately served by transit routes to access transit for their daily commute trips. Figure A. Standard Bus Shelter  City of Scottsdale  - 13 -  Transit Plan   February 2003    Park and Ride lots where justified should be established near freeways and, whenever possible, have direct access onto freeway facilities     Park and Ride lots should be served primarily by express routes and, when possible, by feeder local routes. The City should own Park and Ride lots; operations of the lots should be evaluated to determine if contracting the operation is advantageous to the City and to the users.  Telecommute Centers A telecommute center includes office space, conference rooms and office equipment areas designed for use by people who choose to work near home. A telecommute center should be established and operated for a minimum of three years as a demonstration project to determine the feasibility of additional facilities. The telecommute center may initially be operated with city subsidy funds but should be operated with the intent of being self-sustaining within the demonstration period. Transit Centers Transit centers accommodate the transfer of passengers between buses at a point where several routes converge. Transit centers should be located where their existence will improve the efficiency or safety of the operations of the system, facilitate passenger transfers, and improve general traffic conditions. Maintenance/Fueling Facilities The City should own maintenance and fueling infrastructure or support a regional facility. This allows more competition (and possibly lower operating costs) from service providers. These facilities may also be co-owned and/or coordinated with other municipalities and transportation governmental agencies. City of Scottsdale  Figure B. Loloma Station  - 14 -  Transit Plan   February 2003  Transit Vehicles (excluding Cab Connection, TRIP and short duration contracts, e.g. Giants Shuttle) Vehicles should:           Meet federal, state and regional standards Be owned by the city Be sized to the service provided Emphasize comfort through low steps, easy access and heavy-duty air-conditioning Be designed to allow easy and thorough cleaning Should have tinted windows to reduce glare and heat but also allow passengers to see through the tint. Should use fuels that improve air quality Include bike racks, enunciators and security cameras Include automatic vehicle locators, passenger counters and technology to monitor the operation of the bus Include fareboxes that can accommodate flexible fare media (e.g., magnetic cards) and provide accurate data. Rapid Transit Systems A Rapid Transit Study addressing whether a mass transit system (such as light rail) is warranted in Scottsdale has been conducted. This plan recognizes the continuing need to study the potential for rapid mass transit systems and that these systems may be warranted in the future. Transportation System and Travel Demand Management An effective transit system includes a variety of strategies beyond buses and dial-a-ride. These strategies use technology, encourage business and personal trip management and implement policies Figure C. Transit Vehicle  City of Scottsdale  - 15 -  Transit Plan   February 2003  that directly or indirectly influence travel choices, such as parking policies. Strategies may include:  Transit Priority Options o Support high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes o Construct queue jumpers that allow buses to move more quickly through an intersection. o Coordinate signal priority to favor buses where appropriate.  Employer strategies o Encourage coordination of activities occurring through the Maricopa County Trip Reduction Program o Support ridesharing o Encourage flex time o Promote incentives in companies affected by the Maricopa County Trip Reduction Program and companies too small to be governed by this legislation. 3.5 Integration with Land Use Policies Where appropriate to the types of land use and character contained within a character area, consider strategies that support the provision and viability of existing and planned transit facilities and services into the character area. Preservation Area Transit may serve major destinations, such as trailheads or interpretive centers located in preservation areas, using shuttletype transit services.  City of Scottsdale  - 16 -  Transit Plan   February 2003  Regional Corridors Ensure that transit is factored into development proposals along major transit routes (existing and proposed), particularly those that provide city-wide or regional connections. Design standards and policies should be created that place entrances into the multi-family residences and commercial centers within 300 feet of the transit system corridor. New or expanded multi-family projects (with at least 200 units) or offices, retail uses or major service uses (all with at least 100,000 square feet) should provide transit stop facilities along any adjacent street frontage that has an existing or planned transit route. The site planning for all new developments of 10 or more acres (or redevelopment projects of 5 or more acres) should demonstrate that pedestrian walkways are continuous between the access points of the on-site buildings and any existing or planned transit stops provided by the development or should provide shuttle connections with the transit system. Major public service facilities, including but not limited to institutions of higher learning, senior centers, hospitals and satellite service centers should be located along or near major existing or planned transit service routes. Transit Capital Improvements Whenever a new or redeveloped multi-family, office, retail or service use project is proposed within 1,000 feet of a proposed or existing transit stop, the building entrances should be oriented toward the transit stop. There should be also continuous City of Scottsdale Transit Plan  - 17 -   February 2003  pedestrian access facilities between the entrance(s) and the transit stop. Bus stop improvements, including bus bays, shall be stipulated to adjacent (either new or redevelopment) as appropriate. Where a bus stop improvements are stipulated to a development, they shall be built at the same time as the first on-site building. When amenities are stipulated to a development and transit service currently serves that location, funds equivalent to the purchase and installation costs may be accepted by the city in lieu of the developer installing the amenities. The City would then be responsible for installing the amenities at a later date. Amenities may include passenger waiting shelters, benches, trash receptacles, bike loops, etc. The design of transit stop amenities may be integrated with the design and materials of an adjacent development if the construction is to be paid by the adjacent development and the design has been approved by the city's Transportation Department. In order to encourage the physical integration of transit stop amenities into the development of adjacent properties, transit stops that are integrated into outdoor dining patios, plazas or entrance features of the adjacent development shall be counted as part of the open space requirement for that site. Parking This plan recommends a study be conducted that reevaluates the city's policies on parking, creates support for city goals, modifies  City of Scottsdale  - 18 -  Transit Plan   February 2003  the policies to be more consistently and easily applied and promotes transit as a primary mode of travel. Street Design Bus bays should be located on arterials (major) roadways and on the far side of signalized intersections. Exceptions shall be approved by the city's Transportation Department. To support access to transit stops, streets should be designed to accommodate continuous pedestrian paths. Sidewalks should be provided on all streets as referenced in cross sections in the city's Streets Master Plan. Pedestrian crossings of streets should be at intervals of not more than 500 linear feet. Pedestrian refuges (a specially designed place halfway across a street) should be included as appropriate in any street with a width of more than 50 feet. At intersections where the curb-to-curb distance is greater than 75 feet and where an intersecting bus route exists, bus stops should be located on both sides of the intersection. Passenger waiting areas will be developed only for those stops located at the far side of the intersection location. Exceptions shall be approved by the city's Transportation Department. Priority measures (e.g., queue jumpers, dedicated lanes, signal preemption) should be implemented to give preferential treatment to buses operating on Scottsdale Road, Hayden Road and Shea Boulevard. The specific type of priority measure should be determined through further study on a case-by-case basis and in cooperation with traffic engineering staff.  City of Scottsdale  - 19 -  Transit Plan   February 2003  Transit stops should generally be located on the far side of signalized intersections or intersections with collector and larger streets. Additional transit stops should also be considered at locations near or adjacent to major retail, office or multi-family (i.e. 250,000 square feet or 500 units or more) facilities. In some cases, the far side location may be moved further away from a intersection if there is no crossing transit route and there is a better access point serving adjacent uses within 500 feet of the intersection. Larger transit stop facilities should be located where two citywide and/or regional transit routes intersect or at transit stops located at park-and-ride facilities. Schools The City should coordinate with school districts to promote safe pedestrian walking and bicycling routes to school. Incentives Incentives should be created for companies choosing to develop in a transit-oriented design such as providing expedited plan review if developers provide direct pedestrian access between local shopping centers and adjacent neighborhoods. Figure D. Pedestrian Refuge  City of Scottsdale  - 20 -  Transit Plan   February 2003  4. SPECIFIC TRANSIT SERVICE IMPROVEMENTS The Character and Design Element of Scottsdale General Plan states its vision of Scottsdale as: Scottsdale residents and visitors value the diverse character and unique quality of design that our Sonoran Desert community offers. Scottsdale promotes a quality of development and redevelopment that is considered above the norm in terms of aesthetic composition and sustainable durability. Appropriate development in Scottsdale will strike a balance that respects the natural desert settings, historically significant sites and structure and the surrounding neighborhood context, with the objectives and needs of future generations. Art and aesthetic enhancement will continue to be essential components of our community's character and lifestyle. Transit service should be designed to be appropriate to the nature of Scottsdale's lower density neighborhoods. These methods include systems to serve neighborhoods with flexible routing services or partnerships with private providers to encourage their more active role in transit. These and other service methods are included in the services described below and represent a commitment on the City's part to investigate and explore new ways to serve the mobility needs of residents, businesses, workers and visitors. 4.1 Operating Listed below are specific areas where service demand has already been noted, where service demand is likely to grow in the next few years and where service would be needed to meet the goals outlined in this plan. Implementation would depend on availability of funding, current demand estimations and upon the willingness and acceptance of transit in local  City of Scottsdale  - 21 -  Transit Plan   February 2003  neighborhoods. Each of these services would be planned with stakeholders. General Recommendations      Create the Transportation Commission as a transit oversight committee Actively market transit Prepare a monitoring system for reporting performance of service Support land use strategies that encourage transit friendly design Increase shelter maintenance as shelters are constructed  Recommendations for Current Services   Operate Downtown Trolley year round, on Sundays and longer hours per day Expand operating hours and frequencies on current bus routes Recommendations for New Services  Create a trolley route to convey riders from resorts along Scottsdale Road to the downtown in partnership with the resorts and merchant associations   Create a second downtown Trolley route Create a neighborhood circulator in southern Scottsdale to serve such areas as Paiute Center, Civic Center Senior Center and Library.    Create a limited stop service on Scottsdale Road Provide service using Lincoln Road and Indian Bend Plan and establish a neighborhood circulator in McCormick Ranch City of Scottsdale  - 22 -  Transit Plan   February 2003    Provide access to the Salt River Pima Maricopa Community and Mesa by participating in a McKellips bus route.           Plan and establish a neighborhood circulator in McDowell Mountain Ranch Provide an express route from McDowell Mountain Ranch Telecommute/Transit Center to Phoenix Provide an express route from a park and ride near Pima Road and Pima Freeway into Phoenix Plan and establish a neighborhood circulator near Shea and 132nd St. Plan and establish a neighborhood circulator in DC Ranch Provide an express route from a park and ride at Pima Freeway and Shea Boulevard into Tempe/Phoenix Extend the Scottsdale Road route to Pinnacle Peak Create a limited stop route on Pima Road  Recommendations for Special Services  Continue to meet the mobility requirements for people with disabilities as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Expand alternative paratransit programs with the purpose of managing costs of Dial-a-Ride and providing basic service to seniors and people with disabilities.

Future Transit System  City of Scottsdale  - 24 -  Transit Plan   February 2003  4.2 Capital Capital improvements include projects that physically enhance the current system and support the operating needs listed above. Two guiding principles in the purchase and construction of capital projects are:   Planned in cooperation with local neighborhoods and stakeholders Reflect Scottsdale's character  Capital projects include:   Purchase of Scottsdale Trolley vehicles Addition of technology to improve passenger-waiting areas (e.g. lighting, real-time information, audio signs and customer information).  Addition of technology to improve bus service (e.g., enunciators, automatic vehicle locators, and automatic passenger).  Facilities including: o A transfer and passenger center at the former Los Arcos mall o A telecommuting center in McDowell Mountain Ranch o A passenger transfer center near Mustang Library o An off-road bus parking area and passenger station near Northsight and Butherus   Participation in a regional maintenance facility located in the East Valley. Park and Ride lots established in the areas of: o Pima Road and Pima Freeway o Pima Freeway and Shea Boulevard   Transit and Dial-a-Ride Vehicles Transit Shelters - 25 Transit Plan  City of Scottsdale   February 2003  5. AMENDMENT PROCESS Every five years, the full report should be updated and resubmitted to Council for information. Council action is needed for substantial policy changes that would affect the Goal of this report.

FINANCIAL PLAN POLICY STATEMENTS General Policies  Existing resources should be maximized through leveraging state and federal grant funds and innovative cost controls.   An aggressive marketing program should be used to assist the cost recovery goal. Private investment should be encouraged to enhance the transit system whenever possible for both operating and capital goals.  Performance measures should continue to be used to monitor system effectiveness and cost management goals. Future Funding Mechanisms An independent analysis of current and potential funding sources for both operating and capital has been conducted. This analysis was done to provide illustrative costs and possible funding scenarios. Copies of this analysis are available through the City of Scottsdale's Transportation Department. While this Transit Plan acknowledges the need for additional and dedicated sources of funding, this plan does not advocate a specific source.  City of Scottsdale  - 27 -  Transit Plan

Recent studies have shown that high concentrations of pollutants, such as ozone and particulate matter, adversely affect our health. For example, it is well known that children with asthma and older adults with lung diseases, such as emphysema and COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), have an increased risk of disease exacerbation requiring medical treatment on days with poor ambient air quality within their community. Health-based air quality standards are designed to provide protection of human health, which is the ultimate basis for many of NJDEP's regulations. The NJDEP knows the impact that transportation has on our air quality and human health. Transportation issues are complex and require innovative solutions with the ultimate goal of protecting air quality and hence our communities' health. This public hearing solicited advice from interested parties on new ways in which New Jersey can improve transportation and meet clean air goals. SCOPE New Jersey's dependence on the automobile has a direct impact on air quality. Patterns of development, such as increased population, suburban sprawl and suburban office parks have increased dependence on automobiles and inc reased vehicle miles traveled (VMT). The existing transit system does not provide transportation adequate for use by vast numbers of commuters. Congestion, idling vehicles and vehicle cold starts also contribute to poor air quality. Past patterns of deve lopment and allocation of spending for new roads has created this problem. Although vehicles are getting cleaner, New Jerseyans are driving more with anticipated VMT to continue its upward trend and congestion already a critical problem. Breaking this cycle will require political will and a reassessment of home rule. Recent initiatives by the state that promote ""Smart Growth"" planning and the integration of environmental protection with development can change these growth- related problems.   6  The State ha s worked consistently at complying with the health-based National Ambient Air Quality Standards since the passage of the Clean Air Act (CAA) in 1970 and has substantially improved its air quality. It will need to develop new strategies to meet new federal health standards for fine particulates (PM 2.5), and air toxics and the eight - hour average ozone standard. These pollutants are a serious public health concern in New Jersey. BACKGROUND In the last 30 years New Jersey's population has increased 38%, the number of drivers has increased 68% and VMT has increased 142%. As a result, over 60% of the State's interstate system is operating at or above capacity during peak periods of use. New Jersey has more miles of highway per square mile than any other state. Cars are cleaner than in the past, but the number of cars in New Jersey increases yearly and the number of VMT continues to increase. This intensive dependence on automobiles contributes about one -third of New Jersey's air pollution inventory. With a predicted growth of one million more residents by 2020, the citizens of the State need to take responsibility for reducing motor vehicle dependence and increasing utilization of mass transit in order to clean the air. ""Smart Growth"" development could help by decreasing the distance traveled to and from work, by improving the interconnection of the transit systems, by increasing bicycle and pedestrian travel and by bringing people and destinations closer together. The State Plan and ""Smart Growth"" principles recommend the development of centers and compact forms of development in order to reduce the need for additional roads and increase the use of mass transit. ""The State Plan calls for the redevelopment, maintenance and revitalization of our exiting communities and the development of new communities in compact forms with a mix of uses."" (State Plan Executive Summary p.10) Revitalizing urban centers, creating and supporting Transit Villages could reduce VMT. Mobile sources of air pollution in New Jersey have been the subject of legislation and regulation in order to bring the State into compliance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA). The first Federal Clean Air Act (1970) established the basis for achieving health-based National Ambient Air Quality Standards in the United States. Each state was directed to write a State Implementation Plan (SIP) describing its strategy for attaining and maintaining these federal standards. At the present time advanced vehicle emissions control and reduction in vehicle miles traveled seem to offer the most beneficial path to reach clean air goals. In addition, an increase in mass transit, more low emission vehicles (LEVs),   7  improved fuel quality, diesel retrofits and new pattern of land development would reduce mobile emissions. Other approaches, such as the use of regional planning, reform of the tax laws to prevent the ratable chase, increase in gasoline taxes for mass transit support, car pooling financial incentives, tax incentives for low emission vehicle purchase, changes in Municipal Land Use Law and promotion of the State Plan and ""Smart Growth"" have been suggested at this hearing. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Because transportation and land development are closely allied, the Clean Air Council recommends that the principles of the ""Smart Growth"" Initiative be implemented to more effectively control New Jersey's land - use planning. The integration of the State Development, Redevelopment Plan and the BIG Map (Blueprint for Intelligent Growth) in the ""Smart Growth"" Initiative can provide unified land use plans with strong planning elements, including air quality requirements. For example, a change in land development patterns can significantly change travel behavior. 2. The Council recommends that improvements in methods for cooperative regional planning be explored by the State. Center -based land use patterns, such as transit villages and revitalized cities, can reduce automobile dependency and improve air quality. The Council recommends that the state conduct a study of the existing regulatory framework that affects implementation of regional cooperation and identifies the steps that will advance common goals. 3. The Council supports the revitalization of NJ's major cities through a comprehensive approach that addresses quality of life in our neighborhoods. Several initiatives to be considered include; improvements in air quality, tax incentives, development of brownfields, better crime control, commodious mass transit options, improved schools and a variety of housing options. 4. The Council is concerned that the current ""ratables chase"" is spurring development patterns that increase air pollution. The Council asks the legislature to consider if comprehensive property tax reform and a lternative methods of taxation, as, for example, for school funding, would encourage sound planning processes and good development patterns. 5. The Council urges the State to implement as many as possible of the recommendations of the Congestion Buster Task Force of October 2002. The Council especially recommends support for Transportation Management Association programs (TMAs) and pricing measures to ease peak traffic periods and reduce VMT. In this regard the Council recommends that the   8  DEP serve as a catalyst to bring together the critical players in a forum that can lead to a strategic framework and required support, especially at the local level. 6. The Council believes that additional funding for mass transit is justified. The Council supports the Tra nsit Development Action Grant program and the Governor's Blue Ribbon Transportation Commission which is wrestling with the problem of providing adequate funding for public transit. Funding intraNew Jersey projects that connect urban neighborhoods to significant destinations and revive investor interest in those neighborhoods should be studied. 7. The Council recommends that the State provide financial incentives to encourage the purchase of Ultra Low, near zero, Emission Vehicles (ULEV), hybrid vehicles and fuel-efficient vehicles. The Council recommends that the state initiate a ""green vehicle"" labeling program for motor vehicles in the state and that this labeling carry financial incentives as well as clean air incentives. 8. The Council supports the Commuter Choice program as a method of encouraging car pooling, telecommuting and alternative modes of transportation to work. The Council encourages the State to work more closely with EPA and other federal agencies to provide incentive, outreach and encouragement for greater participation. 9. The Council also recommends strategies for reducing fine particulate emissions from diesel-powered vehicles and equipment. Such strategies should include a program for retrofitting buses, sanitation truck fleets and state and municipal diesel fleets as well as encouraging the retrofitting of the much larger privately owned fleets. The Council also supports a program for purchasing low sulfur diesel fuels for both public and private fleets. 10. The Council applauds the effo rt of State Government to encourage ""Smart Growth,"" revitalize urban and suburban areas, and reduce sprawl patterns of growth. However, the Council is concerned that promoting growth in urban centers will on the short term exacerbate documentable air quality issues in these areas. In order to net out the negative impacts of additional growth, significant efforts in improving vehicular traffic flow through these areas will have to occur. The Council urges that air quality issues be considered in any and a ll state initiatives that will channel growth into areas where air quality impacts may already exist. The following recommendations are from prior hearings. It is the Council's tradition to include former recommendations where applicable.   9  11. The Council recommends that the public policy of New Jersey should be to increase the capacity of public transportation to the maximum extent possible. This policy should encourage more light rail projects as well as program s that better coordinate and connect existing public transportation systems. 12. The Council continues to support a statewide public awareness and education program with emphasis on the impact of automobiles on air quality in general and air toxics in particular. This program should continue to stress the importance of reducing vehicle miles traveled, the advantage of the use of public transportation, the benefit of the purchase and use of LEVs, ULEVs and ZEVs (respectively, low, ultra-low and zero-emission vehicles), as well as the importance of good vehicle maintenance. 13. The Clean Air Council, in its own deliberations, recognizes that reasonable measures to smooth the flow of motor vehicle traffic and lessen street and highway congestion will decrease air pollution from cars and trucks. Many of these measures have been recognized and promoted by the Congestion Busters Task Force. The Council knows that over the last two decades, New Jersey's municipalities, counties, and the State Department of Transportation have taken many positive steps to improve traffic flow. These steps include the following: providing left- and right- turn lanes at many intersections; reconstructing certain intersections to eliminate confusion, jogs, and offsets which interfere with signal timing and traffic flow; improvi ng signal timing; converting ""isolated"" signal installations from fixed timing to actuated operation; putting signals on ""flashing"" mode at night where traffic flows permit; synchronized, interconnected signals favoring inbound traffic during the morning r ush hour, and outbound traffic during the evening rush hour; and synchronization where appropriate during the day; other approaches, such as bike paths, bus shelters, carpool / vanpool encouragement, etc. 14. The Council recommends that the State adopt financial incentives for the use of alternative and renewable sources of energy to replace or complement polluting fossil fuels. ORAL TESTIMONY Commissioner Bradley Campbell, NJ Depart. of Environmental Protection The challenges we face achieving cle an air in New Jersey will be increased by the federal new source review rules. Older dirtier coal fired plants would essentially be grandfathered into the provisions. This means more transport of pollutants. 1/3 of New Jersey's air pollution comes from a ir transport. Another 1/3 of New Jersey's dirty air comes from transportation and that must be a major source of reduction. There are four major areas of focus:   10  1.  Air pollution comes from transportation resulting from patterns of land use. Right now NJ is loosing 50 acres a day to development. Changing these patterns of development through the use of the Big Map can significantly reduce air pollution. Village development and re-population of urban areas can reduce the rate of increase in VMT. People living in villages and urban areas drive less. We must change the way we spend state funding. We need to focus on easing congestion and streamlining mass transit infrastructure. Developed areas need funding to attract residents and riders. We must formulate aggressive strategies for reducing fine air particulates. We need to find solutions to this problem before the federal regulations deem us out of compliance. Retrofits for buses and off- road vehicles must be required. More regional approaches to protecting the air must be regulated. The federal government has abdicated leadership in clean air protection. The mobile source sector needs to be addressed regionally.  2.  3.  4.  Dennis Keck - Assistant Commissioner of DOT When we look at transportation in New Jersey, it is helpful to analyze travel trends. In the last thirty years state population has increased by 33 %, but vehicle miles traveled (VMT) has increased 150%. There are now 70% more registered vehicles and 70% more registered drivers. Over the last ten years transportation trends have led to cleaner cars, but more driving. Carpooling is down 12%, walking is down 35% and the number of people driving alone is up 1%. The Department of Transportation mission is about balancing safety, infrastructure, environment and mobility. DOT's capital budget this year is almost fifty- fifty in terms of investment in public transportation and highways. DOT has been very active in the State Planning Commission. We support ""Fix it First"" by limiting highway capacity increases, reducing sprawl and rebuilding suburban corridors. We are also trying to reduce our backlog of deficient bridges. In the State of New Jersey we currently have over six thousand bridges. About twenty-five hundred of those are on State highway systems. The vast majority of the others are on the County systems. We have just ten bridges in our program and the cost of repair could easily exceed two billion dollars. With ""Fix It   11  First"" we discovered that just repairing pavement on the ground today over the next ten years could cost easily 1.9 billion dollars. One of the things we want to do is limit new capacity. No more than four percent of our total 2.5 billion dollar capital program will be used on major new capacity projects because we want to stop subsidizing sprawl. We are working with the Office of Smart Growth to redesign and defer some of our local projects. We are also supporting New Jersey Transit by working with them on the concept of the transit village. We are also increasing some of our local aid programs so that municipalities will do the planning to encourage growth around rail stations. We have now established about seven Transit Villages. We are encouraging compact mixed use development within walking distance of these stations. One of the commitments of DOT is to add twenty thousand new parking spaces over the next five years for park and ride. Ride sharing, van pools, alternate work schedules, telecommuting are all supported by DOT. We help ed develop eight different transportation management areas in the State and we work with the private sector to develop transportation. The Department spends almost five million dollars a year supporting transportation management associations. To address a ir quality, Congestion, land use and sprawl require the multi -faceted solutions that DOT is supporting. Joseph Maraziti  Former Chairman State Planning Board Growth in New Jersey has been dramatic over the lost 20 years and we are still growing at a rate of forty-five thousand people annually. There has been an increase of 806,000 jobs and 1 million people. That put 800,000 more cars on the road and increased air pollution. New Jersey may become the route of travel as the flow of cargo from Southeast Asia comes through the Suez Canal and arrives in the United States on the East Coast where New Jersey is the gateway to the continent. Today eighty percent of that shipping goes to Los Angeles. In 2020 it is predicted it will be down to seventy-three percent. Then those numbers shift even more dramatically. We will have enormous influx of commerce arriving at Port Newark and Port Elizabeth. When this cargo is offloaded, it will require a caravan twenty-eight miles long of tractor- trucks to move it out of the port. That's an enormous impact on clean air and highways. That cargo will arrive in an incompletely manufactured state, there will still be some more processing that will be required. In all likelihood it will go to Pennsylvania with our highways as conduits to Eastern Pennsylvania. The most important statistic is that employment will grow by some eight hundred sixty thousand jobs. That means eight hundred thousand more cars on the roads   12  in the morning and the evening. That means more sprawl. A good definition of sprawl is a pattern of development characterized by inefficient access between land uses or to public facilities or services and a lack of functional open space characterized by being automobile dependent, single use, resource consuming, discontinuous with a low-density development pattern. Alternative land - use patterns would involve more concentrated, center-based design, more compactness and this is laid out in the State Plan. The State Plan is not anti -growth. The State Plan is designed to find a different way to grow. Land development in the form of sprawl is characterized by inefficient access between land uses and public facilities. This creates automobile dependence and resource consumption, which in tern creates pollution. The State Plan was developed to counteract these patterns of growth. The goals of the State Plan are: 1. Revitalize the state's cities and towns. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. Conserve the State's natural resources and systems. Promote beneficial economic growth, development and renewa l. Protect the environment, prevent and clean up pollution. Provide adequate public facilities and services at reasonable cost. Provide adequate housing at reasonable cost. Preserve and enhance areas with historic, cultural, scenic, recreational and open space value. Ensure sound and integrated planning and implementation statewide.  The importance of statewide coordination and regional coordination cannot be underestimated. Overall planning, taking into account air quality needs, is critical. Center-based land - use patterns will reduce automobile dependency, shorten trip lengths and encourage use of alternative modes of transportation. The revitalization of our cities will effect center-based planning. New Jersey has an economy, which if we were separated as a country, would eclipse most of the nations of the world and yet we don't have one city that people are eager to visit. The BIG map will help with this redevelopment by placing resources in areas of the state where growth should be encouraged. C oordinating the BIG map with all of the State's agencies will insure coordinated growth.   13  Adam Zeller  Department of Community Affairs, Office of Smart Growth, Executive Director The office of Smart Growth is the land use-planning unit for New Jersey. The Smart Growth Policy Council works with State agencies to incorporate the State Plan and Smart Growth principles in their plans, regulations and programs. The office of Smart Growth seeks to pilot strategies to reduce mobile emissions and to improve transportation throughout the State. Managed growth will target resources and funding to preserve open space and support multi -modal transportation. The Transit Village Program is one way to reduce automobile dependency. A Transit Village community is o riented to multi -modal transportation. A Village master plan is submitted to the Smart Growth office and approval means funding for this redevelopment. Mixing residential with industrial, offices and institutions near transportation hubs will contribute to better air quality by decreasing VMT and congestion. The NJ Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency working with Smart Growth is encouraging employees to live near work in their HomeWorks program. Brownfields redevelopment is another incentive. New Jersey has the bestlocated brownfields in the nation and they are finally being redeveloped. Michael Moltzen  EPA Region II, Mobile Source Team Leader Air quality in New Jersey is closely tied to transportation issues. In 1996 Highway vehicles contributed 40% of volatile organic compound emissions and 44% of NOx from all source categories. VMT per day in the State is estimated to have increased by almost sixteen million miles per day between 1996 and 2000. Some of the EPA programs that address the larger problem of air quality are quite innovative although voluntary. They require building partnerships in the public and private sectors with businesses, citizen groups, industry and state and local governments. The voluntary diesel retrofit program seeks to encourage private fleets to use retrofit equipment. EPA is developing a grant program for half a million dollars in grants to purchase equipment to retrofit diesel vehicles. In the Commuter Choice Leadership Initiative EPA addresses getting emp loyees to and from work. This program currently represents thirteen hundred employers with six hundred thousand employees where the employer provides van transit to work and designates points of contact and centralizes information. The   14  Commuters who use the transit van are guaranteed a ride home if they work late or if there is an emergency. This program requires that employers offer their employees a minimum of thirty- two dollars per month for not parking. The employer's rewards include public recognition and recruitment advantage. The Smart Way Transport program aims to reduce emissions of greenhouse gas and emissions from the freight sector. This is an attempt to reduce up to two hundred thousand tons of nitrogen oxide, up to eighteen million metric tons of carbon equivalent emissions annually or twenty percent of total freight carbon. A major practice that this program encourages is idle reduction. Trucks on average burn eighteen hundred gallons of fuel a year just in idle. Technology has been imple mented in New York City at three locations utilizing a system which pumps in warm or cool air and provides electrical outlet cables to reduce the need for idling trucks. I believe currently there are only four companies in New Jersey in this program, which represents approximately twenty-seven hundred employees so it is not insignificant, but there is a huge potential. Michael Cerra  League of Municipalities Senior Legislative Analyst All of New Jersey's municipalities are members of the League even though there is no requirement. The League's annual conference in Atlantic City is the largest annual municipal conference in the United States. The League also does independent research on issues of local government and holds hundreds of seminars throug hout the year, lobbies the State Legislature and protects home rule. ""Smart Growth"" has become an essential part planning in New Jersey. An important element of ""Smart Growth"" is smart transportation. Two aspects that the League has the greatest interest in are the strategies that address sustainable development through the elimination of sprawl and the application of mixed- use concepts. Unfortunately, we have a large constituency that likes sprawl and opposes mixed use. People often choose to live near excellent schools. The development community and the lending community see this and make their investment decisions accordingly. The State Plan gives little guidance on retrofitting classic sprawl into mixed use when the homes and businesses and developers are happy with the status quo. We are also of the opinion that the objectives of ""Smart Growth"" will not be met until there is significant Mount Laurel reform. The Mount Laurel doctrine, which requires every municipality to provide its fair share of housing to the low and moderate income, effectively imposes additional housing on less developed areas, regardless of whether the municipality has the existing infrastructure to accept such housing. Municipalities look for ratables to offset   15  these costs. The goals of the ""Smart Growth"" are in direct contradiction to the actual results of the Mount Laurel doctrine. The League has been working with the Department of Environmental Protection on the development of the ""Blueprint for Intelligent Growth,"" bette r known as the BIG map. We try to act as the intermediary between DEP and our members to ensure that every municipality has input on the map. New Jersey's Mayors, Governing Body members and planning officials have let the Administration know how the map affects their communities. Numerous local officials have raised home- rule concerns over the map. Additionally, the Governor has outlined a legislative package that will include, legislation authorizing municipalities to assess impact fees, timed-growth ordinances, transfer of development rights and more regional input in the development application process, particularly in so-called ""border conflicts"" between municipalities. ""Smart Growth"" needs to be home rule friendly. The League believes that home rule is not the problem, it is the solution. Critical to the success of ""Smart Growth"" is the inclusionary dialogue that is the cross acceptance process. Because New Jersey is so densely populated, efforts to reduce traffic congestion are to be applauded. The recent light rail lines in northern New Jersey and here in central Jersey are illustrations of the State Plan working well. ""Smart Growth"" can help guide development and redevelopment into centers, to use public transportation and promote environmenta l protection policies that will lead to cleaner air. Substantial funding from the State and new regional agencies are needed to begin regional planning. Right now only county governments have any power to plan regionally and that is very limited. Greg Dana  Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, Vice-President Environmental Affairs In 1996 forty percent of air pollutants came from motor vehicles, but with advanced technology, that is no longer true. Most emissions from new cars today are emitted during the first fifteen to sixty seconds of warm - up of the car. In addition to the denser cell structure in the catalyst (400 to 900 cells), the amount of fuel used is more closely controlled. The fuel is monitored so closely that only the exact amount of fuel needed is used. The changes that will come about through the EPA Tier 2 rulemaking will improve air quality. All light trucks will be required to meet the same emission standards as passenger cars. Tier 2 will cut NOx emissions and reduce evaporative hydrocarbons. By 2020 the entire fleet will be Tier 2 vehicles.   16  We are meeting a standard, which is very close to zero on NOx. Cleaner vehicles in New Jersey will make a huge impact on monitored emissions. The California standard and the Federal stand ard are virtually identical. The only real difference in the California program is the ZEV mandate. They have a zero emission mandate set in 1990 to require the auto industry to make zero emission vehicles. California has consistently backed away from that when they realized they really aren't feasible in the marketplace. There are electric vehicles in use, but the range is limited and they use acid batteries. The cost is prohibitive, the range is only seventy-five miles and it takes four to six hours to recharge them. Neighborhood electric vehicles and city vehicles do have niche applications. However, gasoline cars today are very close to zero emissions. Fuel cell technology is also in development, but these cars currently cost one million to produce. Some projections put fuel cells on the market by post 2010 with the promise of zero emissions. The fuel cell is the long - term strategy. BMW is working on hydrogen for internal combustion engines, which has a filling system that creates the hydrogen from panels on the roof of the station. John Ciaffrone  TransOptions, President TransOptions represents all Transportation Management Associations (TMAs) in New Jersey. The Transportation Management Associations are divided into geographic areas. Some a re county affiliated, some are totally independent. TMAs work with employers to create new methods of commuting to work. With 790 vehicles per square mile in New Jersey and 6.4 million registered drivers, options for commuting are critical. Eighty-seven percent of single occupancy vehicles are used to drive to work. By the year 2025 by virtue of the extra million people we will increase the annual cost of traffic congestion which is now 7.3 billion dollars in lost time, operating costs and wasted fuel. That's an average of twelve hundred fifty- five dollars per licensed driver, an increase of three hundred seventy-five dollars per driver between 1998 and 2001. Traffic congestion has been an air quality problem for a long time and that the inefficiency of the internal combustion engines put hazardous gases and particulates into the air each year, There are many answers to the problem of mobility in New Jersey. First, is the TEA-3 (Transportation Equity Act) reauthorization. The demand now is much greater. Six years ago there were six new starts, like the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail, now there are two hundred twenty-five requests. It is critical that New Jersey fights for more money for mass transit to improve air quality. This should include an increase in fringe benefits for car poolers, bicyclers, ride-a-shuttle people and walkers. This can be funded at no cost by capping the maximum parking fringe benefit. That's the only fringe benefit that ties into an annual   17  increase. It now costs one hundred ninety d ollars a year to park. It is a fringe benefit for using a car. Another source of income is the gas tax in New Jersey. A ten cent increase per gallon would generate over five million a year. Ride sharing can be encouraged by State policy- makers. Two e mployers representing over four thousand employees are trying to attain a fourteenpercent level for eighteen months. One of our companies with thirty- five hundred employees attained that level in six months. An important inducement was putting a shuttle between the local train station and place of employment. The biggest problem in Morris and Somerset County is that there is no rail connection. Ridesharing reduces traffic congestion, gas usage, dependency on foreign oil and has environmental benefits. It is much safer to ride in a bus or train than in a car. With the dredging of the harbor in Newark and Elizabeth and with approximately three billion cargo containers a year, truck traffic will increase. Rail freight therefore needs rejuvenation. Going to New England the only current rail crossing is in Albany. David Piech  International Truck and Engine, Senior Counsel We believe that diesel is and will be the environmental solution to today's and tomorrow's problems. International is the leading manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks, medium sized trucks, school buses and dump trucks. We are the largest worldwide manufacturer of the diesel engine. New EPA regulations are driving diesel technology. Starting in 2004 there will be a reduction of almost fifty- percent in NOx. Beginning in 2007 NOx will be down ninety-five percent and particulates down ninety percent from today's levels. Diesel engines were first introduced in the late eighteen hundreds. But, in the last five years the technology of diesel engines has improved significantly. By 2007, NOx absorbers and particulate traps as well as newer valve drain technology will be added. In 2010 improvements will include advanced NOx absorber technology. The diesel engine in the light-duty market will have a place in the future. Sulfur in gasoline is decreasing and green diesel technology is also an option. This 530 cubic inch, 275 horsepower diesel engine is lower in NOx and lower in particulates. The green diesel school bus compared to the leading natural gas school bus has a lower PM level and lower NOx. The cost is also lower. Diesel is cheaper than hydrogen fueled vehicles because of existing infrastructure. This will cost half a million to over two and -a- half million dollars per facility. O ur school bus program   18  has qualified in California because of our lower emissions. Besides new vehicles, we have an emissions technology program involving retrofits. Through retrofits we can get over eighty percent reduction in particulates and hydrocarbo n, depending on the age and condition of the older school buses or older trucks. It achieves a virtually smokeless, odorless diesel vehicle for vehicles already in service. Regarding the cost of ultra- low sulfur diesel fuel. BP, Chevron and Phillips are developing these fuels. By taking the sulfur out, the catalyst is more aggressive and more durable. The problem with biodiesel fuel is that is can be inconsistent so no more than twenty percent diesel blend is recommended. Gary Johnson  Interested public Traffic congestion and suburban sprawl are contributing to many of New Jersey's problems. The decline of our cities, decreasing open space and the crowded highways impact all of us. New Jerseyans need to switch in large numbers to mass transit. By introducing a Traffic Relief Tax of $.25 per gallon initially and increasing that tax yearly until it reaches the levels found in Europe will discourage driving and provide monies for mass transit. The Traffic Relief Tax could also be used for propert y tax relief by paying for road maintenance based on VMT. Thus, someone traveling only 2,000 miles per year would not be paying for road maintenance at the same rate as someone traveling 40,000 miles per year. Also, automobile insurance could also be based on the odometer reading in each car and the per-mile cost of insurance. The Traffic Relief Tax could also fund the installation of sidewalks and bike paths, which will remove a barrier to physical activity and reduce the cost of healthcare. The Tax could fund also commuter shuttle buses taking would -be drivers to the train station. New Jerseyans will change their driving habits if it saves them money. Martin Robins  Director Voorhees Transportation Policy Institute, Rutgers New Jersey's ""Smart Growth"" principles could change the current transportation trends. We need to shape the mass transportation system in New Jersey so that the result is cleaner air. In the northeast rail corridor, NJ's Main Street, ridership has grown 127% over the past 2 0 years. The major problem with using mass transit has been our sprawling patterns of development. Land use decisions and investments are central to travel behavior. Facts should convince us that compact, walkable settlements work in reducing auto reliance. More than 60% of NJ resident workers near Jersey City's transit hub reach work by transit, walking or bicycle. Suburban office park workers travel by auto to   19  work. People who live proximate to train stations use transit to work at a higher rate than people living further away. Transit-oriented housing along the Hudson River is expanding rapidly. When NJ Transit initiated Midtown Direct services on the Morris & Essex Line in 1996, ridership grew to 11,000 daily. There is a need to invest in infill sites near our train and bus stations and to invest in making the transit system more useful to more New Jerseyans. James Sinclair  Chairman Congestion Busters There are methods available to the State to reduce congestion and thereby improve air quality. The Congestion Busters recommendations from October 2002 have been presented to the State and should be supported by this Council. The New Jersey Task Force is a fairly broad task force representing citizen groups, representatives from the business community, government officials, local transportation agencies. We looked all around the country and selected good ideas for incentives for people to get people out of their single occupancy vehicles. The Task Force tried to come up with short -term suggestions. One of those solutions had to do with pricing congestion, like raising or lowering the price of the roadway at peak traffic times. It can be done with rationing lanes, HOVs or the like. Rationing strategies was another idea, for instance. restrictions on the number of vehicles that can be registered and restrictions on times for operating vehicles. A license plate would be issued that limits driving a car on Tuesdays or Wednesdays. It is really a politically sensitive subject when it comes to the kinds of restrictions that people will accept. With ""Smart Growth"" congestion is a big issue because the proposed million additional people coming to New Jersey will create more congestion. The business community has to work with the local transportati on management agencies. The advantages of expanding the Park-and - Ride programs were discussed. New Jersey is predicted to have four times the freight volume, which means four times the volume of trucks moving around the State. That might mean getting the trucks out of the morning rush hour in our urban areas and have the deliveries at off-peak hours. New Jersey needs to invest more in public transportation so that it becomes an attractive alternative for people.   20  Robert Campbell  Sierra Club Ozone and particulate matter are still serious air pollutants in New Jersey. Complying with the Clean Air Act (CAA) has been a major problem since 1970. Automobiles are a major source of these contaminants. The increasing popularity of ""light trucks"" or SUVs has increased gasoline consumption and contributed to the problem even though the cars are cleaner burning vehicles. Half of all vehicles sold in the US last year were SUVs, vans and pick- ups. Three states in the northeast, Massachusetts, New York and V ermont, have already adopted the California low-emission vehicle (LEV) Phase II standards for tailpipe emissions. Among those states, the standards will apply the emissions requirement of passenger vehicles to SUVs and all light trucks beginning in either 2003 or 2004. Since the US Senate failed last year to approve an increase in the CAF standards. They have failed to reduce our nation's dependence on foreign oil and reduce the massive volumes of nitrogen oxides (NOx), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and particulates emitted by cars and light trucks. The EPA Cumulative Exposure Project indicates that there were 24 carcinogenic chemicals predicted to exceed health benchmarks in 1990. Benzene, 1,3 butadiene and formaldehyde are listed as mobile and e xist statewide. It is essential that the State Senate, Assembly and the NJ Clean Air Council work together to approve the bills introduced two years ago in both houses calling for NJ to adopt the more stringent California LEV Phase II regulations for vehicles sold in NJ beginning in the year 2006. Diane Blake  President Regional Planning Partnership The Regional Planning Partnership is a non-profit organization formed in 1968 to protect the quality of community life through sound land use planning and regional cooperation. Our Board is made up of people who represent corporations, the development community, the environmental community and the public sector. We are all interconnected through roads, rails, bridges and tunnels, and we are connected with sewer lines and septic areas. We are connected through the watersheds, wetlands and surface water and all these things affect our water and air. What is done at the local level affects all these large systems. New Jersey's landscape would be destroyed and the State in gridlock if a full build -out of the current zoning were to happen. Nobody wants that but planning is required if we are to move on to some other future starting where we are.   21  It is always important to remember that Americans really hate sprawl and they also really hate density, which is what we are asking them to accept when we are talking about public transit. The real question is where are we going to grow? We are asking people to build in areas where there is also Infrastructure. If we select growth centers and connect them with transportation we can save open space. That's the technique we are asking to be applied regionally. This is about reducing dependency on automobiles. Density and congestion have to be redefined if we are going to be providing the amenities of public transportation, commerce, interaction, a walkable community life. Density and congestion have to be looked at in a new way. We are proposing legislation to help promote the regional planning process and when the public sees how it fits into New Jersey's goals, I think they will support it. The property tax issue has been raised today. Since a lot of the transportation initiatives are about where the houses are in relation to jobs, communities will not take on more housing in those transit corridors unless they have the support to pay for the school children. Regional planning is working in New Jersey in the Meadowlands and the Pinelands because they were created through special legislation. There were also ve ry compelling environmental reasons to make planning work. In the Pinelands every town gets to do its own planning, it has to be certified, and there is plenty of Home Rule. In ""Smart Growth"" two major items need to be considered. One is build -out of the Master Plan because zoning is controlled land use. Most municipalities do not know the long -term implications of their zoning ordinances. The second item involves the capacity of the system. It is very important to encourage growth in an area where the capacity of the system can support it and there is very little information about the capacity of systems in any particular location. Robert Babik  General Motors Director Vehicle Emission Issues A discussion of auto manufacturers long - term goals might be helpful at this juncture. Although we have made great progress with reducing emissions, we are in the process of re-inventing the automobile to make it even more environmentally sound and safe. Right now the California car and EPA's Tier 2 standards are almost identical. However, GM intends to move advanced technology through an evolutionary period with hybrid electric vehicles. We are also developing eight cylinder vehicles that run on four cylinders when less energy is needed. GM is also developing new hybrids. We started out with the hybrid transit bus because that technology had a big impact first on a large vehicle in urban   22  settings. We are now concentrating on smaller vehicles. We are putting hybrid technology in the Saturn VUE, the Chevrole t Equinox, Malibu Sedan, and other vehicles which will debut in 2005, 2006 and 2007. This allows the consumer the choice of a hybrid pickup truck. We are implementing the technology so there is no trade-off as to vehicle performance and consumer demand. We even have a 110- volt outlet in our pickup truck for construction workers so they can plug in tools and use them. Affordability is another consideration. We are making an effort to get consumer based tax credits in the near term for hybrids since the y are more expensive to manufacture. GM is also into fuel cells development. The only feasible way to obtain zero emissions is with hydrogen. At the 2002 auto show GM produced a futuristic hydrogen fuel cell car, the HY-Wire. The car has no dashboard, everything is on the floor which makes it safer than conventional vehicles. It might even be possible one day to use the hydrogen fuel cell in your car to power your house. The house would be off the grid because the fuel cells in the car would actually power a house with sixty-five to seventy- five kilowatts. It is important to support state and local agencies that purchase advanced technology vehicles. It is also important to promote policies that change consumer behavior. Andrew Hudson  NJ PIRG C lean Air Associate Adopting the California car emissions program is the most important thing New Jersey can do right now to improve air quality. Blaming Pennsylvania and Ohio is not helpful when we not doing everything we can in New Jersey to reduce the pollution from our cars. GM is now manufacturing hybrid automobiles when just a few years ago General Motors said the company would never be able to build hybrid cars without substantial government subsidies, they were just not cost effective. If we a re serious about reducing emissions in New Jersey, we have to push the automobile industry to do more than they are doing and the only way we can do that is with the California emissions program. It is an either/or choice between the Federal program or the California program in New Jersey and all the analyses show that the California car is the better choice. The last thing in looking at the big picture is to be cognizant that air quality problems result from more that just cars. If we want to solve the larger problem, we need to support the development and production of renewable sources of energy.   23  Jeff Tittel  Director NJ Sierra Club Dealing with both transportation and air quality is very complex. Mass transit is lacking and New Jersey is number 1 in this nation in VMT. We have more vehicles in the State of New Jersey than we have registered drivers. There is one automobile for every acre and a quarter in New Jersey and the reason for this is bad land use planning. There has been a pattern o f overbuilding along little country lanes which are then widened. New Jersey is overbuilt. The Department of Transportation should be planning and investing where the infrastructure already exists. In Oregon they ran a light rail line to areas that had projected growth. That is how we have to look at planning in New Jersey. Those wonderful railroad suburbs created before the turn of the last century should now become the models for ""Smart Growth."" Communities, like Westfield, Cranford or South Orange we re developed mixed transit centers and mixed use around them. Park and Ride will encourage Smart Growth. In developing a transit system with increased density, we have to have the sewer and water capacity to allow that increase. This kind of planned growth and increased mass transit will improve air quality. In an average year twenty thousand residents are taken to emergency rooms because of respiratory illness due to air quality. The California car would produce the benefit of reduced fuel consumptio n as well as emission reductions. DEP did a study showing major reductions in air toxins, which were up to twentythree percent reduction with the California car. One of the biggest failures in the last administration was the trip reduction program. It was voluntary and haphazard and it didn't work. Other states been able to work on trip reduction programs. The last census report showed that in most of the major towns in New Jersey half the people still work within the Counties in which they live. We need more mass transit for these commuters, like hybrid buses. Unfortunately, New Jersey Transit is locked into a long - term contract to buy seven thousand diesel buses, the largest diesel bus contract purchase in the history of the United States. We need to find alternative renewable energy for New Jersey by integrating our transit needs and transit system with alternative and renewable energy, which will also go a long way towards cleaning our air.   24  Written Testimony Ford Motor Company In 1998 the US EPA adopted the most stringent federal vehicle emission requirements in the world. The Tier 2 standard no only brought about significant reductions in car emissions, but brought trucks down to passenger car levels. Tier 2 standards reduce emissions by an additional 60% for cars and 90% for trucks. This required reduction in emissions makes the emission control system one of the most expensive parts of the vehicle. When developing Tier 2 rules, EPA took into account the air quality needs of the entire country. Conversely, the California LEV program only considers California's needs. Modeling has been done comparing the impact of Tier 2 with California LEV and the difference between the programs is insignificant. In developing Tier 2, Ford worked with EPA to align them as much as possible to the California's LEVII standards. This was to minimize development and manufacturing complexity by providing manufacturers with the opportunity to produce a single vehicle for both markets. Ford voluntarily committed to certify all SUVs and pick- up trucks to the California low emission vehicle standards. Another result of minimizing production complexity has led Ford to commit to providing California evaporative emissions hardware on vehicles sold federally. Most new Ford vehicles will continue to be certified for sale in both California and federal states. Ford also has the widest range of alternative fueled products of any manufacturer. Some are operated on liquefied petroleum gas or ethanol as well as an array of natural gas vehicles, all available in California and federal states. The new Escape hybrid electric vehicle is the most fuel-efficient SUV and the most practical hybrid ever built. It will deliver nearly 40 miles per gallon in city dri ving as well as meet the most stringent tailpipe emissions standards (SULEV). Ford is also dedicated to the realization of fuel cell powertrains in consumer vehicles. Ford is working to develop these technologies out of concerns for global warming, urban pollution and energy security. Central Jersey Rail Coalition The Central Jersey Rail Coalition is an advocacy group that was founded in 1997 to foster restoration of passenger rail service through central Monmouth, Ocean and Middlesex Counties. The C oalition seeks to have NJ Transit resume passenger train service along an existing freight route from Lakehurst to New York- New Jersey along an existing freight route from Lakehurst to New York -   25  New Jersey metropolitan area via Farmingdale, Freehold and the nce to Monmouth Junction where trains would continue along the Amtrak Northeast Corridor. This route, referred to as the Monmouth-Ocean-Middlesex (MOM) line, offers particular benefits to a region that is currently lacking in public transportation alterna tives. The purpose of the CJRC effort is to enhance air quality be reducing traffic and allowing for expected growth in population and employment. It is expected that these three counties will be home to  of New Jersey's population by the year 2010. Wi th no rail connections, the reliance on automobiles to commute to the workplace will continue to grow. A ten-car passenger train can accommodate up to 800 passengers. Restoring this service would reduce congestion and air pollution.

                                                    This statewide study presents and                              evaluates transit operator marketing efforts to attract                              new riders and explores travel behavior, perceptions,                              preferences, needs and expectations of existing and                              potential transit customers. For the purpose of the                              study, the non-traditional rider was defined as ‘commuters                              who travel to work and/or school, including both transit                              riders and non-transit riders alike’. Many transit                              agencies refer to these commuters as “choice                              riders” or “potential riders”.                             In particular, the study                              was designed to answer the following questions:                                                              What do transit operators know                                about their customers and how are they trying to                                expand their markets?                                Are there untapped market segments,                                what are their characteristics and where are they                                located?                                What changes are necessary in                                terms of transit marketing and outreach, service                                enhancements and the overall funding and policy                                framework to achieve an increase in transit ridership?                                                         To answer these questions,                              the researchers conducted                                                            An extensive review and analysis                                of existing marketing efforts by transit operators                                in California;                                A household survey of commute                                behavior, mode choice criteria, perceptions and                                awareness of public transportation;                               Focus groups with transit operators                                and regional planning agencies on ideas on how to                                promote the use of public transportation.                                                         Evaluating their findings,                              the researchers were able to                                                             Identify regions in California with the best                                potential for ridership growth;                                Develop characteristics of people likely to increase                                their use of public transportation;                                Develop recommendations on how to achieve a better                                match of customer preferences with services operated.

Follow-up studies:                              Based on recommendations developed in the course of                              the study, two projects are currently being implemented                              with the objective to                                                           Test the effectiveness of  community-based,                                low-cost transit marketing strategies .                                Seven transit operators in the Sacramento region                                are involved in this effort. Marketing and outreach                                will be designed based on the particular characteristics                                of the communities served along selected transit                                routes and tested in their effectiveness to attract                                additional riders. The evaluation might also result                                in service changes and enhancements based on identified                                customer needs.                                 Find out who is using                                 Los Angeles’ Metro Rapid  –                                the enhanced bus service routes, which are attracting                                more and more riders. This project looks in particular                                at the potential of Metro Rapid to attract new customers                                to transit, either people who are actually shifting                                from their private vehicle to public transportation                                or customers for which Metro Rapid increases their                                mobility options. The project is also trying to                                answer the question whether Metro Rapid can be a                                model for other urban areas in California.                                                          Completion of these projects is expected                              for June 2004.

Comments from Local Elected Officials and from the Public     Mayor Tibshraeny was introduced and spoke regarding the approach      the City of Chandler has taken to meet its local transportation needs. He      provided examples of how innovation and partnering have helped the City of      Chandler succeed in meeting many of its transportation goals.     Mr. Bryan Patterson, deputy public works director, began      by providing a brief description of the community’s population and demographics.      He stated that traditional sources of funding, including a gas tax, have not      kept pace with the city’s needs. He explained that all gas tax monies now      go to maintenance and operation leaving no monies for new construction. He      highlighted 100 to 120 million dollars in street projects the City of Chandler      has planned, which will be paid for with the city’s impact fees program. Mr.      Patterson also touched on some of the city’s developing congestion problems      and its proposed solutions, including improvements to its mass transit system.      He stated that a recent proposal for a three-eighths increase is sales tax      which would have been used to fund these solutions, was defeated. Mr. Patterson      also spoke regarding the state infrastructure bank and its affect on the city.      Mr. Patterson concluded by asking for the committee’s assistance in having      the flight property tax funds restored.     Mr. Redondo asked Mr. Patterson how much money the three-eighths      cent sales tax would have generated. Mr. Patterson answered approximately      10 million dollars annually. Mr. Patterson also explained that, in reference      to the impact fees, developers are given the choice of building the arterial      streets themselves instead of paying the fee. He stated this means the city      is actually getting more dollars worth of construction than just the actual      fees collected.     Mr. Patterson explained for Mr. Shultz how the impact fees      are assessed and explained that the city is very careful to make sure fees      are tied directly to the demand that growth is creating.     In response to Mr. Basila’s question, Mr. Patterson stated      the City of Chandler’s top three priorities would be finishing the freeways,      developing the transit system and relieving congestion.     Mr. Radicke questioned Mr. Patterson as to whether the impact      fees would be increased over time. Mr. Patterson stated that his expectation      is that roughly every four years the base of the fee would be increased on      master plan updates and in between increases would be tied to some measure      of inflation.     Mr. Bivens asked Mr. Patterson if he had done any studies      on how much of the city’s transportation problems are internally generated      versus those generated by people who do not live in Chandler. Mr. Patterson      stated that he believed the majority of the traffic congestion is probably      generated by traffic either coming to Chandler to work or people going to      work somewhere else, but that no official studies had been done. Mr. Bivens      followed up by asking if Mr. Patterson had specific recommendations as to      how the task force could help alleviate the regional kinds of problems in      Chandler relative to traffic. Mr. Patterson suggested getting more of the      arterial traffic onto freeways would be very helpful and that any thing the      task force can do to secure funding for building freeways earlier would be      very beneficial.     Mr. Patterson stated for Mr. Redondo that long-term maintenance      for the streets created by the impact fees has not yet been addressed.     Mr. Keno Hawker, Mesa city council member, spoke regarding      his vision for transportation for the next 20 years. He stated that any light      rail transit system would need to be rapid to encourage usage. He stated his      appreciation for the acceleration of the freeway system and suggested that      on the San Tan and Red Mountain freeways that more right of way be acquired      so the center corridor could be used for some kind of rapid transit system.      Mr. Hawker stated he hoped that any interim ballot initiatives would be structured      so that if a regional one passes, the local initiative is then dropped.     Mr. Shultz asked if Mr. Hawker would support giving local      elected officials the authorization to make decisions rather than going to      public votes. Mr. Hawker stated he would not support that and didn’t believe      the public would either.     Ms. Barbara Ralston inquired as to the cost of the different      modes of rail transportation. Mr. Hawker stated he did not have those numbers      and felt there were others more qualified to answer that question.      Mr. Shultz asked that the City of Mesa provide a set of priorities      and be responsive to some of the issues that the task force has to deal with      to develop a comprehensive transportation plan for the state. Mr. Hawker agreed      and briefly described what his top priorities would be.     Mr. Hawker confirmed for Mr. Radicke that Mesa does utilize      impact fees, but not to the extent of the City of Chandler. He explained they      are trying to figure out a fair method for assessing those fees.     Mr. William Beyer described the findings of the Citizen Transportation      Oversight Committee. He explained that the public is split on many issues      and he feels it is due to the lack of public leadership in terms of transportation.      He stated his hope that the task force will provide a plan that the political      leadership in this state can get behind which will, in turn, start bridging      together the public on the issues which they are presently so strongly split.      Mr. Beyer warned not to base any opinions or recommendations on the psychological      speculation of what the public’s reaction may be. Mr. Beyer stated that he      did not believe the public would support putting a freeway through an area      that is already relatively settled. He cited the Paradise Freeway as an example.      He also explained that the public is vitally interested in getting a smooth      flow of traffic in their local communities. He touched on the need to have      city-to-city planning regarding cross street traffic. Mr. Beyer recommended      that future technology, both in forms of transportation and ways in which      that transportation can be handled, be taken into consideration when planning      for the future. He mentioned teleconferencing and computer controlled street      traffic as issues which could have a great impact on transportation in the      future. Mr. Beyer also explained that there is a strong element in the valley      of subregional interests and concerns. He recommended that any plan for the      future produce a sense of equity and fairness amongst the people.     Mr. Shultz asked that, in the interest of time, Mr. Beyer      provide additional input he may have in writing. Dr. Megdal suggested that      copies of maps indicating the changes that have been made in the valley be      distributed.     Mr. Fulton Brock, chairman of the Maricopa County Board of      Supervisors, spoke regarding mass transit and the possibility that it may      need to be subsidized. He questioned who would pay for it if a mass transit      system were created. He suggested allowing public authorization or right of      ways and then opening up mass transit to the private sector.     Mr. Bivens asked Mr. Brock if he would support privatizing      other components of the transportation system. Mr. Brock indicated he would.     Mr. Brock described various cities’ mass transit systems      which can be looked at as models. Mr. Shultz requested that Mr. Brock submit      copies of any data, documentation and/or articles he had regarding these transit      systems.     The meeting was recessed for a short break from 6:25 p.m.      to 6:36 p.m.     Mr. Roc Arnett suggested that the task force examine how      ADOT employees are paid. He expressed his concerned that ADOT has lost a tremendous      number of employees. Mr. Arnett requested that the task force respond to the      one person, one vote issue and when doing so, not only look at the state board,      but at all MAGs, PAGs and COGs. Mr. Arnett presented a written report concerning      this issue to the task force. He also submitted a map and presentation regarding      the CANAMEX Corridor. Mr. Arnett also suggested that a system of prioritization      for funds be created. He cited Yavapai County as an excellent model for matching      funds. Mr. Arnett also suggested the issue of privatization be looked at.     Mr. Shipman questioned Mr. Arnett as to the number of members      he feels the statewide transportation board should have in regards to the      one man, one vote issue. Mr. Arnett stated he believed there should be no      more than nine members.     Mr. Bill Reutter, Department of Public Safety requested that      the task force, in making its recommendations, form the best, most appropriate      and inexpensive way of managing the freeway system and supporting the law      enforcement people that need to be out there. He suggested partnering with      other boards including ADOT and the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety. Mr.      Reutter stated that a lack of manpower makes it physically impossible for      all of the highways to be covered 24 hours a day.     Ms. Peters offered her support of Mr. Reutter’s comments      that adequate enforcement is a vital issue.     Mr. Shultz requested that Mr. Reutter provide a more complete      list of partnering opportunities in writing.     Mr. Thorwald inquired as to the usefulness of cameras and      video camera systems for augmenting officers for enforcing laws. Mr. Reutter      stated the legal, moral and ethical issues involved in the use of cameras      needs to be addressed.     Ms. Gena Trimble introduced Mr. Carlos De Leon who presented      a brief description of the projects implemented in the City of Tempe as a      result of the 1996 transit tax. Mr. De Leon also submitted a pamphlet outlining      the details of the program. Ms. Trimble suggested the region and state would      best be served with an expansion of programs like Tempe’s and should be a      top priority. She stated that a balanced system of transit and roadways needs      to be developed throughout the state for quality growth to occur, and that      she would support state legislation including new funding for transit systems      statewide.     Mr. De Leon stated he would provide additional information      on the demographics of Tempe’s ridership pursuant to Dr. Megdal’s request.     Ms. Christine Simmons highlighted major points from the written      testimony she submitted. She stated there needs to be a comprehensive freeway      street system, signal synchronization, a solid infrastructure with an ongoing      maintenance plan as well as choices in transportation modes.     Mr. Redondo questioned Ms. Simmons as to whether Mesa and      Tempe coordinate to see that bus routes are aligned to work together. Ms.      Simmons indicated they do that as much as possible, but unfortunately riders      do have to change buses. This issue is being considered.     Ms. Debra Astin, transportation planner for the City of Scottsdale,      stated that growth and related issues of traffic are of highest concern to      residents of Scottsdale. Ms. Astin gave a brief description of the traffic      issues faced by Scottsdale both now and those projected for the future. She      highlighted the findings of a telephone survey conducted by West Group Research      and the conclusions of more than 20 meetings held by the Transportation Commission      and staff. She outlined Scottsdale’s ""Let’s Get Moving"" transportation      plan and provided committee members with a handout she described as a call      to action for the citizens of Scottsdale.     Mr. Paul Dunakin suggested looking to San Diego, San Francisco      and Boston for working models of a light rail system. He complimented ADOT      on allowing everyone to use HOV lanes during non-rush hour times. Mr. Dunakin      also suggested looking at the rapid transit monorail systems in Europe.     Ms. Fran Emerson stated her support for equitable funding      distribution for all modes of transportation. She explained that due to the      temporary status of current transit subsidies and matching funds programs,      individual municipalities have exhibited reluctance to rely on funding which      may not be there in another five years.     Mr. Gerald Spellman spoke regarding SkyTran. He also provided      members with handouts for their review. Mr. Spellman explained SkyTran’s proposal      to put up a 175 mile grid system linking Mesa and Tempe as well as Phoenix      and Glendale at no cost to taxpayers.     Mr. Rex Kent spoke of the deficiencies in transportation      for people with disabilities.     Mr. Charlie Deaton asked the committee to continue to look      at and share with the public exactly what the nine billion dollar shortfall      is and how it got to be there. He commented that a future transportation system      has to include more than just roads. He explains that mass transit and air      transportation also need to be taken into consideration. Mr. Deaton stated      that mass transit is necessary to deal with air quality issues even more so      than actually moving people.     Mr. Gareth Thorne stated he believes Amtrak service needs      to be restored to Phoenix. He recommended pursuing the development of a high      speed rail corridor between Phoenix and Tucson, and creating a rail transportation      system in northern Arizona as well.     Dr. Megdal requested that Mr. Thorne provide copies of the      cost information he has collected to members of the task force.     Ms. Stacy Howard gave a brief description of the air services      which use airports throughout Arizona. She listed delivery operations such      as Federal Express and UPS, the National Forest Service fire fighting unit,      the Department of Public Safety and Air Evac as examples. Ms. Howard asked      for the opportunity to provide a formal presentation to the task force in      the future to explore the needs and alternatives to preserve, develop and      refine Arizona’s aviation system. Ms. Howard offered to provide copies of      information for the task members pursuant to Ms. McCarthy’s request.     Mr. Toni Di Bonito spoke regarding the use of electric vehicles      and the impact they could have.     Closing comments and adjournment.

GX240-62-7463295	"TRANSIT TICKET SALES IMPROVEMENTS FACT SHEET  Proposal Summary: The Division of Mass Transportation (DMT), Transit Outreach & Enhancements Branch (TOE), in a joint venture with the Headquarters Building Operations Center (BOC), proposes to provide a TOE staff person for 2 1/2 hours a day for the 7 to 8 day period starting the last week in each month to sell transit tickets and also provide information to ticket buyers and the general public highlighting the convenience and benefits of transit. A key element of increasing transit ridership is public knowledge and understanding of available transit services. Information about transit should be available and easy to understand. Some specific activities that the TOE representative would perform include distribution of forms and information for a new payroll deduction option to purchase transit passes, the Guaranteed Ride Home Program (GRHP) application, Traveler Information and other transit-related programs. Information related to transit pass and ticket sales would be tracked and reported periodically. In addition, TOE is working with the BOC to relocate the monthly pass/ticket sales function from its present location, to a more convenient and visible area. This relocation planning is being done in conjunction with the BOC's plan to install new security kiosks in the center of the ""N"" and ""O"" lobbies instead of off to the sides like they are at present. During the first month of this new schedule, a survey of monthly pass buyers was conducted regarding the viability of payroll deduction. Two-thirds of those surveyed voted yes for the payroll deduction option for transit pass purchase. Deploying such innovative strategies and options, in partnership with our local transit agencies, and highlighting the convenience and benefits of transit will result in increased transit usage."
GX012-15-10811043	"Federal Transit Administration Report to Our Customers October, 1995 GORDON J. LINTON,  Administrator of the U.S. Federal Transit Administration (FTA), issued the following report on programs and activities of his agency on the occasion of the 114th annual meeting of the American Public Transit Association (APTA), held this year in San Antonio, Texas.  Administrator Linton's report represents a summary of key FTA activities since last year's APTA annual meeting.                                               IMPLEMENTING THE FTA'S STRATEGIC PLAN  Last year, on the occasion of the annual meeting of the American Public Transit Association, the Federal Transit Administration published its first annual  Report to Our Customers .   In that document, considerable emphasis was placed on the  development of a new strategic plan  for the agency.     Work on the plan began in late 1993; it was completed in early 1994.  Administrator Gordon J. Linton began his tenure at the FTA by declaring that its timely completion and implementation was his very first and most important priority.     Furthermore, as Linton noted a year ago; ""Our strategic plan won't be just a one-time report.  It will also be a permanent yardstick we will use to measure our own performance.""    Every accomplishment of the FTA over the past twelve months can be seen as the implementation of one or another recommendation proposed in the strategic plan.                                 (Copies of a 20-page booklet laying out all aspects of the strategic plan are still available by calling the FTA's Office of Public Affairs in Washington; 202-366-4043.)    REORGANIZATION  As a follow-up exercise to the development of the strategic plan, Administrator Linton impaneled a working group to review the question of what kind of organizational changes--if any--were needed to implement the strategic plan most effectively.  That work was carried out during the final months of 1994 and early 1995.  On May 3, 1995  a new organizational structure was unveiled ; it was implemented on June 30, 1995.   From the perspective of the FTA's customers, the biggest single change was the  creation of a new Office of Planning  at the highest level within the agency's organizational structure.  Previously, the planning function at the FTA was housed within the Office of Grants Management.  (The latter has been renamed the Office of Program Development; safety and procurement system review functions have been added to its responsibilities.)    ""Transportation planning deserves its own office, and that office should report directly to the Administrator,"" Linton said. ""This is consistent with the spirit of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), and it is absolutely essential if transit is to take maximum advantage of the new flexible funding provisions of that legislation.""   Another feature of the FTA reorganization is the creation of a  new oversight unit  within the Office of Program Development. In addition, several offices and units were renamed to reflect more accurately their new areas of responsibility.   To carry out guidelines laid down by Vice President Gore's National Performance Review (NPR), the FTA reorganization makes important changes in the agency's supervisor-to-employee ratio; it also reduces organizational ""layers"" to ensure improved efficiency in day-to-day operations.    FISCAL YEAR 1995  As is always the case, budgetary questions play a key role in understanding how the FTA has performed over any interval.     Unfortunately, as this Report to Our Customers is being prepared in mid-September 1995, it is not possible to know precisely what budget will be in force for Fiscal Year 1996.  We shall therefore cast this report simply as a factual account through FY 1995 only, and let FY 1996 be a subject for future consideration.      With respect to the fiscal year that recently ended, however, something very significant must be said;  The federal fiscal year that ended on September 30, 1995 saw the largest one-year budget in the 34-year history of federal assistance for mass transportation.      The total appropriation for FY 1995 for all purposes was $4.6 billion, up $26 million from FY 1994, the year that held the previous ""record.""  Including carryover from earlier years, plus about $800 million in ""flexible funds"" transferred from the federal highway program, FTA obligated more than $6 billion in FY 1995,  far more than in any year in the agency's history .        The following table displays and contrasts the FTA's annual appropriation for the last three years, that is to say federal fiscal years 1993, 1994 and 1995.              FTA Budget; FY 1993, FY 1994 & FY 1995                                        ($ = millions)     spending category FY 1993 FY 1994   FY 1995   Formula Grants (*) $1,700 $2,415 $2,492   Section 3 $1,725 $1,782 $1,725   Washington Metro  $170 $200 $200   All other programs (+) $204 $183 $189   totals $3,799 $4,579 $4,606      (*) = includes Section 9 (urban), Section 16 (specialized), and Section 18 (non-urban)        (+) = includes planning, research and administrative expenses    Clearly, the most important aspect of these figures involves what amounts to  fully-authorized ISTEA funding levels  for the  capital-only aspects of the basic formula assistance programs.  The fiscal year recently ended, FY 1995, represents a 47% increase in basic formula funding over FY 1993.   ""We don't know at this point what the future will bring,"" Administrator Linton said.  ""But we do know that during the first two years of the Clinton Administration we have been able to beef up the FTA's most basic and fundamental assistance programs and give our grantees an opportunity to make long-delayed capital  investments in transit infrastructure.""    FULL-FUNDING GRANT AGREEMENTS     Over the past 18 months, the FTA has negotiated and signed  more multi-year full-funding grant agreements  for the construction of new fixed guideway transit systems  than in any comparable period  in the agency's history.   ""Our policy with respect to investment in new transit systems is simple and straight-forward,"" Administrator Linton said.  ""We want to put the dollars that ISTEA has authorized into long term contracts.  Furthermore, we want to take advantage of the 'contingent commitment' provisions of the law to maximize the resources we have available.""     The following table displays the various full-funding grant Agreements--or amendments to earlier agreements--that have been signed over the past 18 months.                    Recent Full-funding Grant Agreements     City Project Federal Commitment Comments                       New York   subway link-up $328 Million Queens Connector                                                    Washington   rapid transit extension to Branch Avenue $563 million will complete 103-mile Metrorail system       Pittsburgh busway to airport $211 million ---          Baltimore light rail expansion $85 million three separate extensions       Northern  New Jersey commuter rail transfer station $440 million Secaucus Transfer       Chicago downtown Light Rail System $250 million ---       Boston tunnel for electric buses $331 million ---       Los rapid transit  completion $187 million Red Line Subway       Portland light rail  expansion $75 million Hillsboro Extension        Salt Lake City light rail system $241 million  ---       Atlanta rapid transit $305 million North Line extension       Houston busway &   HOV expansion $500 million Regional Bus Plan       total federal commitment ...... $3,516 million          ""These full-funding grant agreements provide multi-year investment resources for every transit mode and they represent projects in twelve different states,"" Administrator Linton said.   In Northern New Jersey and the City of New York--areas with a long and rich mass transit history--various kinds of new connections will enable existing transit systems to operate more efficiently.  In other sections of the country where recently opened rail systems are proving to be extremely popular, selected expansion will enable these systems to tap new markets.  In still other cases, cities will be constructing their very first fixed guideway transit project.   Last year's  Report to Our Customers  told of the FTA's executing the largest single full-funding grant agreement in the agency's history, $1.5 billion in federal dollars alone to continue construction of the Red Line subway project in Los Angeles.  This year's report follows up on that accomplishment by pointing out that recent months have seen another record-setting performance, the execution of more full-funding grant agreements than ever before.      IMPROVING CUSTOMER SERVICE     Over the past year, the FTA has made many important changes in the  day-to-day management of its grant program , changes that are intended to make the program more responsive to the needs of its customers.     Electronic grant-making:   something that was identified in last year's  Report to Our Customers  as an experimental pilot project has quickly expanded into a routine way of  doing business.  Over the past year, 22 grantees received  60 grant awards (for almost $1 billion) electronically.  By the end of next year, it is expected that all FTA grantees will be able to use this new system for post-award grant management milestone tracking, with ten new grantees per region phased in for electronic grant submission.   Timely grant payments:   funds are now typically deposited in a grantee's bank account  within 1.5 days  from the time an electronic request for payment is made.  Buy America:   significant streamlining was implemented in the enforcement of ""Buy America"" regulations.  Grantees now have a blanket waiver from ""Buy America"" requirements  for any procurements with a dollar value under $100,000.     Spare parts eligible for capital assistance:   the law has long allowed grantees to use federal capital assistance to purchase spare parts for transit vehicles if the cost of any such part was at least 1/2 of 1% of the cost of the vehicle.  In the past, the ""cost of the vehicle"" was interpreted to be an equivalent new vehicle.  Effective this year, grantees may use the average depreciated value of the entire fleet to determine the threshold, a change  that effectively reduces the cost of spare parts eligible for federal capital assistance from something in excess  of $1,000 to something lessthan $500 in most cases.     Third party procurement:   an internal FTA task force completed work and presented the Administrator with a  series of recommendations for streamlining and reforming the requirements the agency imposes on its grantees for ""third party"" contracts that involve federal funds.  A new formal guidance document, Circular 4220.1C, has been  issued.  The circular encourages grantees to rely more on self-certifications, rather than on time-consuming reviews by the FTA.  The new circular also gives grantees new flexibility in adding options to primary contracts, in the use of progress payments (and advanced payments) to vendors, and in the way of requiring vendors to post performance bonds.     Drug and alcohol testing for volunteer drivers:   the FTA issued a ""final rule"" in August 1995 that exempts certain volunteers who drive vans and other small transit vehicles  from drug and alcohol testing requirements.     New standardized grant assistance contract:   a new basic grant contract will be used beginning October 1, 1995. This new instrument includes terminology that has been updated and revised to reflect recent statutory changes.  The new contract was also designed to be fully compatible with the FTA's electronic grant-making initiative, noted above.         ""There is very little that can be called dramatic or glitzy about any of these improvements,"" Administrator Linton said.  ""Some of them are so technical and detailed that only a relatively few people at even the largest transit agencies will have any appreciation of the substantial benefits they represent.  The larger point, though,"" Linton continued, ""is that taken as a whole they clearly demonstrate a strong commitment to making the federal mass transit assistance program serve the needs of its real customers.""      POLICY AND PROGRAM EMPHASIS AREAS     Something that ties together a number of innovations and improvements that have recently taken place at the FTA is a program emphasis called  Livable Communities.   ""Our Livable Communities initiative is an effort to emphasize the human dimension in transportation,"" Administrator Linton said.     The assumption behind the Livable Communities initiative is this:  Mass transit facilities have to be tailored to serve more than the transportation needs of their customers, they also have to serve their community needs and their human needs.  As Administrator Linton noted in last year's Report to Our Customers: ""Just as transit vehicles have evolved over the years to provide the kind of comfort and convenience customers expect, so must transit facilities evolve to serve the expectations of their communities.  You wouldn't expect to find a transit bus today that isn't heated in the winter and air conditioned in the summer.  Why does it seem so strange, then, when we talk about including day care centers in subway stations, or making sure there are grocery stores adjacent to bus terminals?""     That was Administrator Linton speaking a year ago.  Now, twelve months later and with the FTA's Livable Communities initiative having gained stature and maturity, it no longer seems strange to talk about day care centers in subway stations and convenience stores in bus terminals.       Since last year, 12 separate grants have been awarded under  the Livable Communities initiative; they are displayed in the following table.  But the Livable Communities idea is far more pervasive than simply these 12 individual grants.  Concepts embodied in the Livable Communities effort are interwoven in virtually all the full funding grant agreements that were negotiated over the past year.  Making our communities more livable is a primary tenet of the FTA's Strategic Plan; it will continue to enliven the entire grant assistance program in the years ahead and give it new direction and new purpose.

A call was issued (via  Federal Register  announcement) to solicit innovative funding projects.  FTA assistance might involve financial or technical help in developing a financing plan for the proposed project, direct financial assistance for the project itself, or administrative relief from certain customary FTA project requirements.   Following the publication of this call, 69 applications were received:  direct financial assistance grants were awarded to eight of these, and regulatory flexibility will be provided in eight additional cases.  An FTA-retained contractor with expertise in municipal financing, bond issuance and other financial  techniques is also available to provide technical assistance to additional applicants.   The FTA also published an  Innovative Financing Handbook  outlining several of the more innovative or complex techniques that grantees may use to leverage additional capital investment from public and private sources.   Like the Livable Communities initiative, the use of innovative financing mechanisms can be expected to play a larger role within the FTA program in the years ahead.    DEFENSE CONVERSION       Through its research arm--renamed the Office of Research, Demonstration and Innovation in the recent reorganization--the FTA has become a very important player in the overall national effort to find new  domestic activities  for the  enormous industrial potential that was developed  in our country  during the cold war . This, of course, is in addition to on-going activities in traditional areas of transit research.        On Labor Day, President Clinton announced a grant of $2.5 million to help establish a production line for electric-powered vehicles at a former naval air station.  On September 18, 1995 a consortium of over 140 public and private organizations known as CALSTART rolled out an advanced 35-foot electric bus that had been built with FTA funds; it will now undergo perational testing in Santa Barbara, CA.  A unit of the Department of Defense called the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) has supplied the FTA with over $10 million to help develop a new generation of transit buses that will be powered by fuel cells, and almost $20 million to design a new automatic train control system for rail rapid transit.  To allow the transit industry to take maximum advantage of the informational capabilities represented by Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology, the FTA is arranging for  every bus route in the country  to be individually scanned into a GIS data base maintained at the John Joseph        Moakley Center at Bridgewater State College in Massachusetts.          Several publications are available that supply further information about these and other FTA's research activities;  Transit Planning and Research Reports; an Annotated Bibliography  [August 1995], and  Transit Planning and Research Programs; Fiscal Year 1994 Project Directory  [March 1995].  For copies contact the FTA's Office of Research Management; 202-366-3765 (fax) or 202-366-0201 (telephone).    OTHER FTA ACCOMPLISHMENTS     A number of additional FTA accomplishments from the past year deserve mention in this Report to Our Customers.    The 1996 Olympics:   last year's Report to Our Customers told of the FTA's assuming a leadership role in ensuring that the upcoming Olympic Games in Atlanta in the summer of        1996 will give mass transit an opportunity to showcase its ability to move people in and out of a concentrated area. Over the past year, commitments have been received from over two dozen U.S. transit systems to lease up to 2,100 new (or almost new) transit buses to Atlanta for the duration of the Olympics, and a grant for $14 million was awarded by the FTA to fund expenses associated with moving  this fleet to and from Atlanta.  In addition, the FTA has funded an extensive deployment of new passenger information        technology in Atlanta that will have applicability during the Olympics, but will remain in place afterward as               a permanent enhancement of the area's mass transportation system.  Art in Transit:   in addition to publishing a revised              circular, No. 9400.1A, that updates policy on when and how        artistic works may be included in federally-funded mass           transit projects, the FTA also began to promote the notion        that artistic treatment should be included in mass transit        vehicles and facilities.  Circular No. 9400.1A was                published in the form of an attractive 4-color brochure           that included ample illustrations of recent artistic work  at mass transit projects.  Bus Summit Conference:   in an effort to learn what are the        distinctive problems being faced by U.S. manufacturers of        mass transit buses, on September 22, 1995 the FTA held an        unprecedented ""summit conference"" of such manufacturers in        Washington.  Feed-back received at the meeting will assist        the FTA in crafting new policies and procedures in the        months ahead.   Memorandum of Understanding with South Africa:   in March,         Administrator Linton was one of the formal signatories, on        behalf of the United States Government, on a formal        Memorandum of Understanding with the Republic of South        Africa that will see technology sharing and information        exchange between the two countries on matters associated        with transportation.                IVHS Becomes ITS:   to emphasize its multi-modal character,        a major Department of Transportation research initiative          that was initially called IVHS--Intelligent Vehicle    Highway Systems --has been formally and officially renamed         ITS--Intelligent Transportation Systems.  Over the past           year, a ""coordinated system architecture"" for public              transportation vehicles was completed, thus ensuring full         participation by mass transportation in the overall ITS           initiative.    Americans With Disabilities Act:   during the year, the FTA         received and reviewed 530 paratransit plan updates,               conducted four additional ADA training sessions (bringing         the total to 21), negotiated 23 voluntary compliance              agreements with rail transit systems concerning timetables         for making key stations accessible, and through Project           ACTION, invited experts from the transit industry and the         disabled community to Washington in July 1995 for a two-        day conference on paratransit issues.    Passenger Security Conferences :  a series of conferences          were held to help focus attention on issues associated with        the personal security of passengers who ride mass transit         systems.     SUMMARY    Over the summer of 1995, issues associated with the FTA's  budget for FY 1996 generated a good deal of serious and oftentimes intense debate over what the federal role should be in mass  transit.   All this debate was just a warm-up,  however, for the  much more fundamental discussions that will necessarily take place  in the months ahead as we move closer to the time when  ISTEA must be re-authorized.   What should happen to federal transit operating subsidies?  How far can we extend the concepts of flexible funding that were begun in ISTEA?  Should other forms of surface  transportation besides highways and mass transit be made eligible for funding from existing trust funds?  What is the proper mix  between formula allocations and discretionary programs?   These are fundamental questions.  Furthermore, they are  questions that will necessarily have to be addressed within a  larger framework of constrained resources at all levels and  rapidly changing expectations about what the federal government  should be doing across a very broad spectrum of domestic activity.         The time between this APTA annual meeting in the fall of 1995 and next year's meeting in 1996 when the FTA will again issue a  Report to Our Customers promises to be very interesting.              http://www.fta.dot.gov/library/intro/cust/rep2cust.html"
GX240-31-1274242	"Regional Transit Planning   Summary  March 1992      The Twin Cities metropolitan area has a complex, multi-tiered structure for planning and implementing public transit improvements.  Agencies involved include the Metropolitan Council, the Regional Transit Board (RTB), ""opt-out"" communities, and the Metropolitan Transit Commission (MTC) and other transit operators.  In addition, the area's seven counties are responsible for acquiring right-of-way and planning for new light rail transit lines, and the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) is involved in planning and constructing highway improvements which may include transit components.   In spite of this level of agency involvement, there have been continuing concerns about transit performance and the adequacy of transit planning.  During the 1980s, the Twin Cities area has experienced a substantial decline in bus ridership, growing highway congestion, and only limited suburban transit expansions outside of opt-out communities.  In addition, the area has been split by disagreement over the desirability of implementing light rail transit.   This report examines transit planning in the Twin Cities area and addresses the following questions:   * What progress has the Regional Transit Board made in planning for and implementing cost-effective transit service improvements, as well as providing oversight of existing transit operations?   * Has the Metropolitan Council provided adequate long-range planning and policy direction for transit and highway improvements?   * Has the Minnesota Department of Transportation appropriately integrated transit into its highway planning and construction activities?   * Has transit planning become too fragmented and are structural changes needed to improve planning?   * What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Metropolitan Council's new Regional Transit Facilities Plan and the Regional Transit Board's new Vision for Transit?   In general, we found a planning process which has been dominated in recent years by light rail transit to the exclusion of other transit options such as improved bus service and high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes.  In addition, the growing costs of Metro Mobility have made it difficult for the Regional Transit Board to expand suburban bus service.   Over the last year, however, the Metropolitan Council has taken steps to reorient the planning process and more vigorously oversee the work of the Regional Transit Board.  The Council's new facilities plan and the RTB's new transit vision are steps in the right direction, although many of their details will need to be worked out in the next few years.    Regional Transit Board   In 1984, the Legislature created the Regional Transit Board to do short- and mid-range transit planning, contract for transit services, and review and approve transit budgets.  The Legislature wanted the RTB to control rising transit costs, respond to growing suburban transit needs, improve oversight of the Metropolitan Transit Commission (MTC), and more closely integrate transit into the region's highway planning.  In a 1988 evaluation, we concluded that RTB had not yet proven to be an effective problem solver.  Now, four years later, we conclude that:   * Although creation of the Regional Transit Board was a good idea, the Board's progress has not lived up to expectations in several key areas.   * Progress in some key areas has been slow and problems remain, but there have been some encouraging signs recently.  * The major problems with RTB's past performance are:   * There has been little progress in responding to growing suburban transit needs outside of opt-out communities.   * RTB has been slow to provide adequate oversight of the Metropolitan Transit Commission despite substantial declines in regular route ridership.   * RTB still does not have an adequate policy on competitive bidding of bus service and has allowed MTC to provide a significant amount of peak-hour express service outside MTC's exclusive service area despite significant questions regarding MTC's relative efficiency in providing that service.   * RTB has not provided needed leadership from a regional perspective on light rail transit, and has focused too much on expensive transit options and too little on relatively inexpensive solutions.   In part, these problems have resulted from factors external to RTB.  For example, state funding for transit has been relatively constant in recent years while Metro Mobility costs have grown significantly.  The increase in costs has limited RTB's ability to fund service improvements for suburban areas and in the existing regular route system.  Some of the increase in Metro Mobility costs is the direct result of RTB's decisions to expand and improve service.  However, RTB did not anticipate much of the growth in ridership and costs.  In addition, the planning process has been dominated by light rail transit (LRT) in recent years.  Considerable staff and board time devoted to LRT has taken time and attention away from other issues.   However, factors within RTB's control have been at work as well.  These include: 1) the board's promotion of LRT without adequate examination of the alternatives, 2) the board's attitude toward contracting transit services, 3) continuing internal tension due to the agency having both an executive director and a full-time chair, and 4) the board's unwillingness to control Metro Mobility costs, which led to an expenditure cap being imposed by the 1991 Legislature.   On the positive side, we found that:   * RTB recently adopted new plans which attempt to improve suburban transit service and control Metro Mobility expenditures.   * RTB is developing five transit hubs in suburban locations and has experimented with four new suburban services which are either circulators or general purpose dial-a-rides.   * Despite turnover, RTB has a strong staff which has laid a good foundation for the future with the work it has done on various planning projects and in contract management.   * Since mid-1991, the Board has shown more interest in overseeing MTC as well as assisting it in improving ridership and efficiency.   RTB recently completed a marketing study to determine reasons for the loss in MTC ridership and identify marketing strategies to address that concern.  In addition, RTB's budget for 1992 includes funds to conduct management audits of MTC and funds for MTC to perform a comprehensive operations analysis of MTC routes.    Metropolitan Council   The Metropolitan Council is responsible for long-range planning and policy making for both transit and highways in the Twin Cities area and for overseeing the work of the Regional Transit Board.  In our 1988 evaluation, we were critical of the Metropolitan Council's relatively weak oversight of RTB and lack of adequate policy direction for transit and highways.    Since 1988, with adoption of a new transportation policy plan, the Council's planning work and policy direction gradually improved and, in the last year, improved dramatically.  We found that:   * Until last year, the Metropolitan Council did not provide adequate oversight of the Regional Transit Board.   * Until this year, the Metropolitan Council did not provide sufficient leadership in formulating a long-range vision for transit in the region.   These recent improvements in Council oversight and leadership have come about in two ways:   * The Metropolitan Council and its staff provided significant oversight of RTB through the Council's review of the RTB's Five Year Plan in May 1991.   * The Metropolitan Council and its staff have provided significant leadership for future transit and highway improvements with the recent adoption of its Regional Transit Facilities Plan.   The plan is significant in that it recommends an even-handed approach to transit planning.  While LRT has dominated planning in recent years, the Council's plan calls for service improvements, minor capital improvements, and major capital projects according to their effectiveness in solving transit and highway problems in various parts of the region.   The plan's specific recommendations for transit improvements should not, however, be viewed as definitive.  In developing the plan, staff have not been able to analyze in detail all of the transit options in each highway corridor.  For example, staff did not have time to fully analyze the benefits and costs of LRT compared to bus and other options in the Central Corridor between St. Paul and Minneapolis.  However, the plan recommends a process -- an alternatives analysis -- through which this important consideration will be examined.    Minnesota Department of Transportation   The Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) plays an indirect, but important, role in transit planning.  Many transit services and car pools utilize the highways which Mn/DOT is responsible for planning and constructing.  As a result, Mn/DOT's cooperation with transit planning agencies is vital in helping them achieve their goals.   We found that:   * Mn/DOT has been receptive to transit issues and has incorporated various transit options into its highway plans.   Mn/DOT has worked with the Metropolitan Council in providing bus and car pool bypass ramps at freeway exits as called for in the Council's 1988 Transportation Policy Plan.  Mn/DOT is currently working with MTC on MTC's ""Team Transit"" project to provide lane and ramp improvements which could help buses reduce their travel time and potentially increase their ridership.  Finally, Mn/DOT has constructed high-occupancy vehicle lanes, park-and-ride lots, and transit stations in the I-394 corridor west of downtown Minneapolis and is analyzing HOV lanes, as well as light rail transit, in its planning process for improvements to I-35W from downtown Minneapolis south to the Minnesota River.    Recommendations    Legislature   We have five types of legislative recommendations, which address: 1) internal RTB structural problems, 2) LRT funding and governance, 3) financial disincentives for automobile use, 4) funding for transit improvements, and 5) the need for oversight of RTB.  Regarding RTB's internal structure, we recommend that:   * The Legislature should either make the position of RTB chair a part-time one or permit the chair to select the executive director with the board's approval.   Since its inception, there has been internal tension at RTB because the agency essentially has two heads: an executive director and a full-time chair.  This situation is not a viable one for an agency as small as RTB.  It will continue to struggle to meet expectations unless it goes forward under strong and consistent leadership.   Second, we recommend that:   * The Legislature should not fund construction of LRT in the Central Corridor until a satisfactory alternatives analysis has been prepared.   * The Legislature should change the governance structure for light rail transit planning to provide for more regional control of the process while continuing to involve county railroad authorities in a meaningful way.   The Metropolitan Council's facilities plan shows that, within the next 20 years, only two LRT lines -- the Central Corridor and the I-35W South lines -- have the potential to be cost-effective under reasonable assumptions.  Recent studies show that these two lines have a combined projected cost of just under $4.00 per rider -- the maximum permitted by Metropolitan Council policy in order for a line to be considered for implementation before the year 2010.  Furthermore, it has yet to be determined how the benefits and costs of a Central Corridor LRT line -- the Council's highest LRT priority -- compare to those for all-bus and other alternatives.  As a result, it is important that an alternatives analysis be conducted before more design work continues or construction work begins.  An alternatives analysis will also improve the region's chances of maximizing the amount of federal ""new start"" money which can be received and used to reduce the region's costs of building the line.   The current governance structure for light rail transit planning is dominated by the region's counties and their rail authorities.  Their only transit mission is to plan for light rail transit.  Considering the new cost per rider estimates for LRT, the need for objective analysis of alternatives, and the need to use regional or state funding to implement LRT -- there is a need to reorient the governance structure to ensure that regional goals are met and that spending on additional lines is not continued.  We are generally supportive of the Metropolitan Council's proposed governance structure.  That proposal would place RTB in charge of the alternatives analysis, Mn/DOT in charge of design and construction, and MTC in charge of operations.  However, given the counties' leadership on LRT issues, the Legislature should consider ways in which the counties can be given a meaningful role in the design and construction of LRT, while assuring regional control over important decisions.   We also recommend that:   * The Legislature should examine options for increasing automobile user costs to better reflect the costs to the region of automobile travel.   A modest increase in automobile user costs through additional gasoline taxes or other taxes or fees may help to limit future growth in automobile travel and would better reflect some of the regional costs of automobile use.  It would also make sense to use a portion of any tax or fee increase to help fund transit improvements or relieve some of the current burden on property taxes.  However, Constitutional limitations and budgetary constraints will affect the options available to the Legislature.   If transit programs are allotted funds from a new funding source, it is essential that the Legislature retain control over transit funding and not provide transit agencies with an unlimited source of dedicated funding.  Many of the recommendations in the Council's new facilities plan and RTB's new vision are conceptual and lack ridership estimates and other details which would help in determining their cost-effectiveness.  Legislative oversight of these agencies' recommendations is needed before transit funding is substantially increased.  The Legislature should take an incremental approach and fund some improvements while requiring the agencies to report back on their progress in developing more detailed plans and ridership estimates.  We recommend that:   * The Legislature should be generally supportive of the concepts contained in the Metropolitan Council's facilities plan.   * However, the Legislature should require RTB and the Council to provide information on the potential cost-effectiveness of the recommended service improvements and transit hub projects.   We also recommend that the Legislature strengthen oversight of RTB in the following ways:   * The Legislature should require RTB to prepare an annual performance report for existing transit services and submit the report to the Metropolitan Council for its review and comment.   * The Legislature should require RTB to report at least annually on its progress in implementing its five-year plan and submit the report to the Metropolitan Council for its review and comment.   * The Legislature should give the Metropolitan Council authority to review and approve RTB's annual capital budget and review and comment on RTB's annual operating budget.    Metropolitan Council   We recommend that:   * The Metropolitan Council continue the strong oversight and leadership it has shown over the last year.   In addition, even without specific legislative authorization, we recommend that:   * The Metropolitan Council should consider requiring RTB to prepare: 1) an annual transit performance report, 2) an annual progress report on plan implementation, and 3) cost per rider estimates for the new services and other mass transit improvements recommended in the Council's new plan and RTB's new vision.   Also, in formulating regional policy on highway and transit development, the Council should consider the extent to which automobile users are not directly paying the full costs of automobile use.  We recommend that the Metropolitan Council: 1) determine the extent to which automobile users do not directly pay for the costs imposed on the region from automobile use, 2) examine the potential effect on automobile and transit use from raising automobile ownership and operation costs through additional taxes or other methods, and 3) study the impact which such action might have on future development patterns.    Regional Transit Board   The Regional Transit Board has made only slow progress in achieving the goals envisioned when it was established.  Improvement has been made since mid-1991, but it remains to be seen whether such improvement will be sustained.  The RTB's Vision for Transit has conceptual appeal, but lacks important details.  It is unclear at this point how much of the vision should be implemented.  It is also unclear how the results of needs assessments and MTC's comprehensive operations analysis will affect the vision.   Despite reservations, we believe RTB should continue to exist in its current form.  The separation of planning and operations has had some desirable effects and remains a good concept.  However, RTB needs to continue the progress of the last eight months and demonstrate to the Legislature that RTB can be an effective problem solver.  RTB can best develop this trust by being a fair and objective planning agency.  Advocacy on behalf of transit is best based on sound and thoughtful analysis. Specifically, we recommend that:   * RTB should adopt a competitive bidding policy which adequately addresses the costing method MTC should use when bidding to provide transit services outside its exclusive service area.   * RTB should undertake the proposed management audits of MTC and review the comprehensive operations analysis of MTC when completed.  RTB should ultimately identify any resources which can be freed up to provide needed service improvements.   * RTB should examine the need for and potential cost-effectiveness of the service improvements and hubs recommended in the Metropolitan Council's facilities plan.  Not all of the hubs and accompanying circulator and express routes may be cost-effective.   * RTB should prepare an annual performance report which provides performance statistics for each route and type of service funded by RTB.   * RTB should continue its recent efforts to work cooperatively with the opt-out providers and assist them in competitively bidding out transit services when their current contracts end.   * RTB should work with MTC to strengthen the region's efforts to encourage ridesharing or consider moving Minnesota Rideshare to the Minnesota Department of Transportation.

Introduction and Executive Summary   Introduction and Executive Summary To meet the increasing demand for sound, safe and secure transportation, many in the transportation community believe that the next transportation authorization must build upon the successes of previous years. After all, transportation is vital to the state and national economy, as well as our way of life. Rural and urban interests alike equally depend on quality transportation to remain viable and competitive in a changing national and global economy. In 1998, Congress enacted the six-year Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21). TEA- 21 increased the federal investment in highways and transit 40 percent above the previous six-year transportation act, titled the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). This increase in federal assistance has enabled states, cities and counties to accelerate repairs to highways and to increase capacity. New and expanded transit services, including fleet modernization, have helped transit ridership to reach record levels. The intent of the reauthorization effort is to build upon the successes of ISTEA and TEA-21 by continuing to focus on maintaining and improving system condition and performance; project and process streamlining; minimizing ineffective policy requirements; and identifying a menu of options that Congress may use to increase the federal financial commitment to the nation's highway and transit systems. As impressive as the 40 percent increase in funding was from ISTEA to TEA-21, the needs of our growing economy, substantial increase in usage by the public and the deterioration of an aged system will require even more investments in the transportation system. The Federal Highway Administration's Condition and Performance Report has identified a need for an annual investment of $92 billion to maintain the national system and an annual investment of $125 billion to improve and expand the system. The national repair backlog for highways and bridges is estimated at $254 billion. To put this in perspective, the total federal highway program authorized in TEA-21 for fiscal year 2003 is approximately $28 billion. Although Minnesota's transportation infrastructure and transit system investments have exceeded that of many other states, Minnesota's transportation reauthorization issues are the same: a multi-year state and federal investment strategy designed to maintain and expand Minnesota's current system. Mn/DOT has worked with different customer, stakeholder and government groups to develop ten positions that offer policy recommendations on how to maximize the benefit to Minnesota and other states afforded by the reauthorization of TEA-21.  The TEA-21 reauthorization positions are organized in the following areas:  Financial Issues  Reviewing improvements in programs and systems needed to address highway fatalities  Security Issues  Promoting a focused approach to transportation infrastructure and systems security enhancements  Safety Issues  Recommending the further implementation of safety improvement strategies to serve one of Minnesota's top transportation priorities  Freight Transportation Issues Presenting multi-modal transportation integration proposals  Transit Issues  Proposing policy adjustments and examining funding needs  Statewide and Metropolitan Planning Programs  Streamlining and coordinating planning processes  Interjurisdictional and Institutional Issues Environmental Stewardship and Streamlining Issues  Enabling governments to work together better  Enhancing the commitment to environmental stewardship and streamlining as Mn/DOT pursues the goal of delivering faster, better transportation projects  Research Issues  Providing information to develop better, safer transportation programs  Operations/Intelligent Transportation Systems Issues  Developing and deploying technologies and techniques to make transportation systems operate more efficiently  2   Financial Issues ""The two financial focal areas for reauthorization are increasing levels of funding and program policy improvements."" A safe and efficient transportation system is key to economic health and personal mobility. Having the financial resources necessary to maintain adequate highway and system performance is a never-ending challenge. Current estimates for the funding necessary to maintain the existing system are more than triple current federal program levels. Many funding components of TEA-21 have worked well and need to be continued. Congress should: s s s s s Maintain the TEA-21 program structure, increase flexibility and expand program eligibility to address priority needs rather than establish new set-asides and sub-allocations. Preserve TEA-21's federal highway funding guarantees and budgetary firewalls. Refine the Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) to ensure that all funds collected for the Highway Trust Fund are returned to the states. Ensure no new funding sanctions or incentive programs are established. Maintain and enhance innovative project financing techniques including the expansion of State Infrastructure Bank (SIB) eligibility to all states and lowering the Transportation Infrastructure Financing Innovation Act (TIFIA) minimum loan amount. Address federal gasohol revenue issues that penalizes some states for its usage. Expand and authorize further development of alternative funding programs such as mileagebased user fees and value pricing as revenue sources for the Highway Trust Fund. Address the growing backlog of highway and transit program needs by increasing the federal program funding to $41 billion a year and at least $10 billion per year for transit programs by FFY2009.  s s s  To achieve this, Congress may utilize a mix of the following options: o o o o Draw down Highway Trust Fund reserves; Capture the interest on the HTF reserves; Capture gasohol tax revenues currently attributed to the general fund; and Expand innovative financing options and explore new funding mechanisms.  Security Issues ""All levels of government have responsibility to minimize the vulnerability of critical infrastructure assets and to prepare for transportation's role in emergency response and recovery."" The heightened threat of terrorism has introduced new security imperatives to the nation's highway and transit programs. While surface transportation infrastructure is robust and redundant, the consequences of a large-scale attack could be significant. Congress should: s s s Authorize a moderate increase and broaden eligibility in existing federal-aid highway programs to support security activities. Direct federal agencies to provide expedited environmental and planning processes for security-related projects. Direct the Federal Highway Administration to establish federal vulnerability assessment guidelines; and create a new program to protect critical, security-related infrastructure, facilities and equipment. Increase federal-aid highway funding for security, hazardous materials and safety-related incident response and management, and allow state DOTs to have access to general funds to develop improved nationally standard, inter-operable and hardened communications system.  s  3   Safety Issues Safety is and will remain a priority for Minnesota. The next federal transportation bill should include enhanced safety planning, flexible funding for infrastructure improvements and support for application of effective low-cost safety improvement strategies. Congress should: s Increase the highway safety program by $1 billion per year specifically to implement the state's comprehensive highway safety plan, with increased flexibility to transfer funds between sub-categories. Consolidate several safety grant programs into a single, flexible Section 402 highway safety program that would be goal-oriented and risk-based. Provide additional funding from other sources than the Highway Trust Fund for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Safety Assistance Program. Maintain a safety monitoring program for Mexican motor carriers and all new entrant American and Canadian-based carriers.  ""The increase in motor carrier and commercial vehicle traffic at the nation's borders since the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement has increased concerns about safety.""  s s s  Freight Transportation Issues During the past two decades, freight transportation by all modes has experienced tremendous growth. These increases have taxed the capacity of our ports, rail lines, highways and airports. Without increased investment in infrastructure, innovative financing, flexible funding and improved operational efficiency, the competitive advantage Minnesota and the nation enjoy in global markets will erode. Congress should: s s s Support the use of existing innovative financing tools and new financing mechanisms for investments in freight transportation infrastructure. Ensure that federal-aid highway programs are flexible enough to allow for planning, engineering and construction of intermodal connectors. Enact an increase in the Federal Highway Administration's research and technology program to allow for a greater emphasis on freight transportation research and create a Freight Transportation Cooperative Research program. Provide up to $10 million annually to support U.S.DOT and state DOT efforts to implement a training and capacity-building program. Establish a national Freight Advisory Group as the mechanism for the freight industry and public sector to communicate with ""one voice"" to the U.S.DOT freight transportation issues. The Minnesota Freight Advisory Committee may serve as a model to receive input from the freight community to advance freight issues.  ""It is estimated that even modest economic growth will double the volume of export/import tonnage and increase domestic tonnage by 70 percent in the next twenty years, which will tax the capacity of our ports, rail lines, highways, and airports.""  s s  4   Transit Issues ""Transit is one of several options to reduce highway congestion and improving air quality."" As with ISTEA and TEA-21, the upcoming reauthorization should focus on a balanced intermodal transportation system for the nation. Transit provides mobility, access to jobs, shopping, health care and many other services to Minnesotans. Transit is one of several options to reduce highway congestion and improve air quality. Congress should: s s s s s s Increase transit program funding up to $10 billion per year by FFY 2009, while: Maintaining transit funding guarantees established in TEA-21; Maintaining the 80/20 match requirements for transit projects; Continue to supplement Highway Trust Fund transit programs with general funds; and Continue transit funding flexibility and eligibility for innovative financing programs, such as TIFIA and SIBs. Allow for larger transit systems to self-certify compliance with the Federal Transit Administration's incidental charter service rules and allow the state DOT to certify for other transit agencies. Give the state more flexibility to determine the percentage of federal transit funds allocated to intercity bus service and allow the states to submit annual Section 5311 applications based on total needs of the state, including needs-based percentage of intercity bus services. Amend the Federal Transit Administration's ""Buy American"" provisions to allow bus and equipment manufacturers to self-certify that they are in compliance. Direct the Federal Transit Administration and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to consolidate drug and alcohol testing regulations to simplify the process and reduce the cost of compliance for small urban and rural transit operators.  s  s s  Statewide and Metropolitan Planning Issues ""Many in the transportation community consider Minnesota a model for cooperative, progressive planning and financial decision making with regional and local governments."" Building upon the success of ISTEA, the current framework for statewide and metropolitan transportation planning was established in TEA-21. This framework reflects significant changes in the transportation planning process that have strengthened stakeholder and public involvement, established multi-modal planning processes, and are sensitive to a multitude of factors from environmental, economic development and improved access to transportation facilities and services. Congress should: s s Change the update cycle requirements for metropolitan long range plans from three years to five years Increase the flexibility related to financial constraints in State and Metropolitan Transportation Plans and Transportation Improvement Plans(TIPs). Congress should permit projects for which discretionary funding is being sought to be included in financially constrained TIPs. This should only be allowed when both anticipated revenues and the costs are included in a way that they can be identified separately from the rest of the TIP. Continue to provide flexibility to states as to the content of long-range plans, performance measures and planning horizons, so long as a minimum 20-year horizon is maintained. Recognize the state DOT and Metropolitan Planning Organizations legitimate role in decision-making on connections to the national highway system or other highway facilities adjacent to ports, airports and freight terminals.  s s  5   Interjurisdictional and Institutional Issues States provide a central role in the development of the surface transportation system, even as other jurisdictions, institutions, local governments, metropolitan planning organizations, tribal governments and federal agencies themselves have come to play important parts. The current decision-making structure that recognizes the state's leadership in the development of transportation plans, programs and projects is essential in delivering a comprehensive transportation system in Minnesota. TEA-21 recognizes that the federal highway program is a federally assisted state program and Congress should maintain and affirm the state's leadership role and authority in reauthorization. Congress should: s Continue TEA-21's decision-making processes and procedures for transportation planning, programming and project selection. This involves retaining the balance of decision-making between the states and MPOs, and the states and rural officials. In addition, it is essential to retain the current definitions of planning as ""consultation, cooperation and coordination."" Protect state discretion, flexibility, innovation and accountability in the statewide planning process while affirming the importance of the federal-aid highway program's transportation mission, specifically: o o o o o Provide maximum flexibility to the states to apply the statewide planning provisions and interact with MPOs and extra-MPO organizations. Pursue creative solutions while honoring and striving to achieve the intent of the federal legislation. Retain the statutory provisions that protect state discretion and ensure state level flexibility, innovation and accountability. Congress should confirm in statute the requirement for state concurrence in the planning and selection of public lands highway projects, including forest highways. Congress should ensure that federal statutes continue to defer to state and local governments on whether and how to consider land use in the course of transportation planning. Congress should ensure that federal statutes support balanced transportation investment strategies that are based on statewide and metropolitan planning processes. Congress should support the concept that preservation of the existing system involves more than pavement preservation, including enhancing safety and modernizing highways and transit to bring them up to current design standards.  ""TEA-21 recognizes that the federal highway program is a ""federally assisted state program"" and it is important that Congress maintain and reaffirm the state's leadership role and authority in reauthorization.""  s  o  s  Congress should reaffirm the primary transportation mission of the federal highway program, while acknowledging support for multiple policy goals. Congress should oppose revisions to federal law that impose new cost components that detract from the primary transportation mission. Congress should promote enhanced coordination with Mexican and Canadian officials to speed international ports of entry and modify eligibility for the Coordinated Border Infrastructure Discretionary Program to include publicly owned landside access facilities at seaports and international inland ports of entry. Congress should help speed the flow of traffic at international ports of entry by making it easier for states to transfer federal highway funds to non-transportation federal agencies implementing improvements, providing new, nontransportation federal funding for inspection activities and promoting greater coordination and efficiencies at border crossings.  s  6   Environmental Stewardship and Streamlining Issues ""Help is needed to support transportation agencies efforts to ensure planning level decisions are not disregarded when the NEPA process begins."" Achieving the goal of delivering better and faster transportation projects requires a dual commitment to environmental stewardship and streamlining. This commitment to environmental stewardship involves proactive efforts to include environmental mitigation and enhancements in new projects, wider use of environmentally sensitive maintenance and operations techniques and the use of technology to improve the linkages between planning and project development. Congress needs to address environmental streamlining initiatives by modifying environmental review processes that too often fail to resolve conflicts that have delayed projects in the past. Help is needed to clarify agency roles and responsibilities in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process, so that projects do not become bogged down in endless interagency disputes. Help is needed to restore a degree of flexibility and common sense to Section 4(f) review, while preserving its essential elements. With help in these areas and others, the environmental process can become faster and more efficient, while producing better outcomes for our transportation system and environment. Congress can best promote environmental stewardship by preserving existing funding flexibility, streamlining administrative procedures for projects that enhance the environment and supporting increased funding, training, and outreach. This would speed up parts of the current processes, provide more local control and increase funding. Congress should: s Strengthen and expand the environmental streamlining provisions of TEA-21. The NEPA process for large, complex projects has become increasingly lengthy and complex. Previous efforts to streamline the process, including those in TEA-21, have yielded some results, but significant problems remain. Reform Section 4(f) to provide greater flexibility and reduce delays, while preserving protection for truly significant parks, recreational areas, wildlife refuges and historic sites. Mn/DOT supports a streamlined process with more flexibility that will, in turn shorten project time frames and use a more common sense approach to protecting environmental assets. Establish a specific, reasonable time limit within which lawsuits could be filed challenging federal approvals for surface transportation projects. This approach would save money and time because once a decision is made, the ability to proceed will be able to be determined.  s  s  7   Research Issues Research is crucial to advances in transportation that can save lives, time and money. While overall funding for highways and transit has grown considerably in recent years, federal funding for research has barely grown at all. Continued support for transportation research funding is strongly supported by Mn/DOT. Congress should: s Continue the State Planning and Research Program in its current, formula-based configuration, authorize the Future Strategic Highway Research Program, appropriate $75 million annually for six years and reverse the steady decline in Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) funding. In addition, Congress should increase funding for University Transportation Centers. Increase highway funding for the safety research programs supported by the Highway Trust Fund at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). These measures should be conditional, based upon an increase in overall program levels.  s  ""Mn/DOT in partnership with the University of Minnesota's Center for Transportation Studies and the Humphrey Institute continue the tradition of research and ultimately deployment of technologies that are improving the nation's transportation systems."".  Operations/Intelligent Transportation Systems Issues Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has emerged as a critical means to achieve a broader set of goals (security, safety, reliability) and to serve transportation users. ITS plays an important role in ensuring the security of America's transportation system and in facilitating post-disaster emergency response and evacuation. Congress should: s Continue the federal role, in partnership with the public and private sectors, to develop architecture and standards that will enhance interoperability, integration capabilities, centerto-center data sharing and data dissemination to third parties. Continue research and the development of additional security-related ITS technologies. Encourage the continued development and implementation of education and training programs necessary to ensure that transportation, safety, emergency response professionals are able to make use of the technologies for use in operations. Adjust funding for ITS research, standards and testing from the current level of $110 million annually to $125 million annually in order to maintain the current level of effort as an effective means of addressing many of the operational and safety challenges to the surface transportation network.  ""Intelligent Transportation Systems play an important role in ensuring the security of America's transportation system and in facilitating postdisaster emergency response and evacuation.""  s s  s  8   II. TEA-21 Reauthorization: A Detailed Review of Mn/DOT's Policy Positions  Financial Issues ""Current estimates for the funding necessary to maintain the existing system are more than triple current federal program levels.""  Overview A safe and efficient transportation system is key to the economy and to personal mobility. ISTEA and TEA-21 have had enormous impact on the nation's transportation system. Together they dramatically increased investment in roads and bridges, spurred growth in public transportation and helped to create a more efficient and interconnected transportation system. Failure to continue the gains made in the past decade will impact our global competitiveness, hinder access to jobs and services and will increase congestion and compromise highway safety. Having the financial resources necessary to maintain adequate highway condition and system performance is a never-ending challenge. Current estimates for the funding necessary to maintain the existing system are more than triple current federal program levels. State resources are equally inadequate. Many funding components of TEA-21 have worked well and need to be continued. To address the growing disparity between need and resources in the next federal transportation legislation, a variety of other financial options need to be either implemented or expanded. Similarly, funding generated by transportation that is not attributed to transportation programs needs to be captured into the Highway Trust Fund. In general, Mn/DOT's position on financial issues related to the federal transportation program mirrors that of other state DOTs and the transportation industry. Most would agree that TEA21 is working well but several policy adjustments are necessary. The two financial focal areas for reauthorization are increasing levels of funding and program policy improvements. Additional federal funding is essential to meet increasing program needs.  With that in mind, the following is a summary of financial issues that need to be addressed in the next authorization.  Policy principles Maintain funding guarantees and firewalls - To ensure that domestic discretionary spending caps do not prevent the use of all available revenues, a firewall provision was inserted in the Budget Enforcement Act to increase or decrease highway spending each year consistent with Highway Trust Funds receipts. Congress should preserve TEA-21's highway funding guarantees and firewalls. RABA - In TEA-21, Congress intended for all revenues in the Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund to be used solely for the federal highway program. To ensure full utilization of actual receipts in the HTF, the law created a new mechanism to annually adjust the original TEA-21 authorizations to reflect updated revenue estimates. Under the Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA), budget authority and obligation levels are increased or decreased to reflect changes in revenues. RABA adjustments are based on two calculations: a ""look back"" at actual receipts in the Highway Trust Fund (FFY 2003 is based on FFY 2001 receipts) and a ""look forward"" at projected anticipated receipts. The first four years of TEA-21 reflected a robust economy and increases in vehicle miles traveled and commercial vehicle sales, which contribute to HTF balances. This resulted in ""positive"" RABA and additional revenues for federal transportation programs. Minnesota has received $115 million in additional funding through the RABA provisions through FFY 2002. However, recent U.S. Treasury collections and revenue projections  ""Funding generated by transportation that is not attributed to transportation programs needs to be captured into the Highway Trust Fund.""  9   could result in a downward or ""negative"" RABA adjustment of $5 billion in FFY'03. In reauthorizing TEA-21, Congress should modify the RABA mechanism to avoid severe swings in revenue projections while preserving the principle of expending all funds available in the Highway Trust Fund. A refined RABA mechanism, coupled with guarantees and firewalls, is necessary to ensure that all receipts to the HTF are available for the program, excluding only what is necessary to maintain a prudent cash balance required by Congress. Basic program structure - TEA-21 programs that include the Interstate Maintenance, Bridge, National Highway System, Surface Transportation, and Congestion Mitigation/Air Quality Programs distributed by formula to the states are working well and should be retained. Increased flexibility - Greater flexibility and expanded program eligibility should be used to address priority needs, rather than establish new set-asides and suballocations. Program flexibility will allow states to tailor funding to individual state needs and avoid a cookie cutter approach to transportation program delivery. Innovative financing - Congress should maintain and enhance current innovative project financing techniques, including the expansion of State Infrastructure Bank (SIB) eligibility to all states and lowering the Transportation Infrastructure Financing Innovation Act (TIFIA) threshold from $100 million to $50 million. Incentives and sanctions - Congress should not establish any new funding sanctions and incentive programs, as well as convert any existing sanctions to incentive-based criteria. Many sanctioned activities are a direct result of state legislative action/inaction, not  under the control of state DOTs. Sanctioning of funding, particularly in the area of safety programs, works against safety efforts they are intended to support. If a specific program change is necessary, Congress may take action to address its concerns.  Funding issues Under TEA-21, federal transportation funding grew by approximately 40 percent. The transportation industry collectively agrees that a primary focus for reauthorization should be to ""grow"" the program. For federal fiscal year 2002, the transportation program was $31.8 billion nationally and approximately $408 million for Minnesota. With the current national economic conditions in mind, AASHTO recommends a minimum program size of $34 billion for FFY 2004 with a guaranteed annual increase of 4 percent, resulting in a program of at least $41 billion by FFY2009. For Minnesota, if current TEA-21 funding methods/formulas remain, the state could anticipate approximately $424 million for FFY 2004 and approximately $516 million for FFY2009 in federal funding. Alternative funding - Hybrid electric and other alternative fueled vehicles, such as fuel cell engines, are already entering the market. These and other advances in vehicle engineering offer solutions to the problems associated with fossil fuel consumption. However, they also create a new challenge for state transportation departments throughout the country; as fuel consumption decreases, the revenue stream from motor vehicle fuel taxes will be significantly impacted. Alternatives to the gas tax, such as mileage-based user fees, should be thoroughly explored. Mn/DOT has been leading a 15 state pooled-fund project that is suggesting possible policy options and technology applications to address this problem. A  ""Mn/DOT has been leading a 15 state pooledfund project that is suggesting possible policy options and technology applications to address the problems associated with the increase usage of alternative-fueled vehicles.""  10   ""Minnesota has seen a significant growth in congestion during the past decade and looks to innovative solutions like value pricing to reduce the impact of congestion and to optimize transportation system performance.""  national level demonstration of possible technologies should be authorized. Value pricing - The federal value pricing program currently provides grants to qualifying authorities to implement value pricing demonstration projects which use market based principles to manage the system. Minnesota, like many parts of the country, has seen significant growth in congestion during the past decade, with the prospect for more worse conditions in the coming decades. Innovative programs such as value pricing need to be expanded to provide more financial resources to encourage states to better utilize existing investments and to capture revenue for system improvements. AASHTO estimates that travel growth, which is projected at an average of 3 percent per year, will generate approximately $17.6 billion in additional gas tax revenues during the life of the act. Even with the anticipated growth in travel, the federal program will fall short of the funding necessary to achieve the $41 billion program level. Congress will have to implement changes to the current revenue stream for the transportation program. Any combination of the following list of funding options has been identified as possible ways to increase the program size without direct motor fuel tax increases. 1) Drawing down the Highway Trust Fund reserves- The current balance in the HTF is over $20 billion. The transportation industry believes that a minimum Highway Account balance of $7-8 billion is prudent. Even with anticipated decreases in HTF balances for the next few years, due in part to increased TEA21 spending, AASHTO estimates that it is possible to draw down the HTF by a total of $4.4 billion over the six-year reauthorization period while maintaining the mandated minimum HTF balance.  2) Capturing the interest on HTF reserves In writing TEA-21, Congress agreed that the interest on HTF balances would be credited to the general fund in exchange for guaranteed funding and budgetary firewalls. It is estimated that at an assumed rate of 5 percent, the interest would amount to approximately $2.6 billion over the six years of the next act. It appears that many transportation organizations are now pushing for the interest on the HTF balances to be credited to the HTF again. However, the administration has concerns that capturing the interest on the HTF would be an intragovernmental funding transfer that negatively affects on the federal deficit. 3) Gasohol a. Capture gasohol tax revenues currently attributed to the general fund - As part of deficit reduction efforts of the late 1980s, 2.5 cents of the current 13.1 cent per gallon gasohol tax is transferred from the HTF to the General Fund. There have been several recent legislative proposals to redirect the 2.5 cents per gallon of gasohol revenue from the General Fund to the Highway Account of the HTF. The basic principle is that all revenues generated by highway purposes need to be attributed to the HTF Highway Account. (Note: The Mass Transit Account in the HTF was not penalized when the 2.5 cents was deposited into the General Fund.)  11  The total projected revenues to the Highway Account from transferring 2.5 cents per gallon of gasohol tax revenue now deposited into the General Fund are estimated at $4.1 billion over the six years of the act. It is further estimated that if the 2.5 cents were attributed to the HTF, Minnesota would receive an   additional $11 million during FFY2003. b. Equalize the federal gasohol tax with that of gasoline by 5.3 cents per gallon by transferring an equivalent amount from the General Fund - Gasohol is federally taxed at a rate that is 5.3 cents per gallon less than gasoline. Mn/DOT supports the use of alternative fuels from economic and environmental perspectives, however, gasohol powered vehicles contribute to the same amount of wear and tear on the roads as gasoline powered vehicles. If federal ethanol production subsidies are necessary to support alternative fuel usage, they should be provided out of the General Fund and not at the expense of the HTF. It is estimated that over the six years of the act, capturing this 5.3 cents per gallon would generate approximately $8 billion. If gasoline and gasohol were taxed evenly, it is estimated that Minnesota would receive approximately $33 million more in federal funding for FFY 2003. 4) Creating new financial mechanisms such as a federally chartered Transportation Finance Corporation In order to close the sizable funding gap between transportation investment needs and projected resources in the HTF, AASHTO has  developed the concept of establishing the Transportation Finance Corporation, a new tax credit bond program. The TFC would be a Congressionallychartered, private, non-profit organization that would act as the issuer of the bonds. It is anticipated that the budgetary cost of the program would be paid from additional HTF receipts from new net sources of revenue. Over the life of the next authorization period, $19.3 billion could be leveraged into $34.1 billion for highways and $8.5 billion for transit. The TFC proposal has the potential to generate the revenues necessary to grow the transportation program to levels identified as the minimum needed, but comes with fundamental philosophical changes to federal transportation funding. The TFC would change the accepted practice of ""pay-as-yougo"" for federal funding to a longterm bond program based on anticipated new receipts. The sources of these receipts need to be further explored to determine the viability of this concept. The following chart identifies the potential revenue generated by each option. Any combination of these options can help achieve the goal of a $40 billion plus program by 2009.

Security Issues Overview The heightened threat of terrorism has introduced new security imperatives to the nation's highway and transit programs. While surface transportation infrastructure is robust and redundant, the consequences, both direct and indirect, of a large-scale attack could be significant. Roads, bridges, rail lines and waterways are the lifeblood of America and critical to economic vitality, particularly to Minnesota. Surface transportation infrastructure is important not only from the economic and mobility perspective but also for its emergency response utility in the context of a terrorist event on or off the system as witnessed in the September 11, 2001 events. All levels of government have responsibility to minimize the vulnerability of critical infrastructure assets and to prepare for transportation's role in emergency response and recovery. Additionally, there exists a need for improved capabilities to manage traffic during major events. Security issues will need to be considered for all aspects of the next federal transportation program. Mn/DOT supports the following AASHTO positions related to new security initiatives: 1) General security provisions The potential for the freight transportation system to be used as an element in a terrorism attack is based on clear precedent. Trucks can be used to transport weapons to targets or hijacked as weapons in and of themselves and containers can be used to smuggle weapons of mass destruction across borders. The large number of truck and container movements in combination with loosely controlled operator licensing and relatively open international borders presents a complicated mix for security. Currently, largely manual security screening methods are being used at borders, causing significant delays and added costs. The broader security challenge relates to tracking and credentialing for cargo security. The federal government is cooperating with a range of private entities to develop deployable sealing, tagging and tracking technology that can be applied, initially to hazardous materials vehicles and ultimately to all containers. Safety credentialing efforts now underway may, over time, require a security element as well. The federal intelligent transportation systems' commercial vehicle program (CVISN) could provide useful technology for these efforts. Mn/DOT's perspective is that cargo security measures are likely to result in improvements in cargo tracking, handling, and delivery as a byproduct. Congress should authorize a moderate increase and broadened eligibility in existing Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration federal-aid highway programs to support security activities (assuming that overall highway program funding is substantially above TEA-21 levels) as well as significant general funding from the Department of Homeland Security. The implication for Minnesota would be developing and implementing security-related activities in addition to those for safety. Commercial motor vehicle security should be a distinct and focused planning activity included in the program areas of those agencies dealing directly with credentialing, inspecting and auditing commercial motor vehicles and operators, motor carriers, shippers, freight brokers and hazardous material storage facilities. Additional or separate funding could specifically enhance projects dealing with cargo, vehicle, driver, shipper  13   security awareness, roadside screening and enforcement, enhanced data interchange and credentialing verification. It could fund technologies and programs that help states partner with local jurisdictions to monitor suspicious commercial motor vehicle activity that may pose a security threat. Such technologies could include X-ray screening machines and high-resolution imaging equipment that would be used at weigh scales and border check facilities to scan for contraband or weapons. It is appropriate to meet these objectives using emerging ITS technologies and improved cooperation between the public and private sectors and between DOTs and law enforcement. Also, funding for training such as the ""Terrorism and Trucks - Rapid Risk Recognition, Assessment and Response Seminar/Workshops"", etc., should be made available. Congress should direct that federal agencies provide an expedited environmental and planning process for security-related projects. Additionally, Congress should separate the statewide and metropolitan planning factors for safety and security into two distinct factors - one for safety and one for security. 2) Asset protection While the surface transportation system is characterized by a high degree of resilience and redundancy, there are critical metropolitan mobility links and critical national system links whose loss would have serious implications. The Federal Highway Administration, in cooperation with state departments of transportation, has conducted a process to identify critical transportation links above and beyond those associated with Department of Defense needs. Asset protection goes beyond bridges and tunnels, where damage would disrupt basic mobility. The broad array of assets includes those that may be directly  threatened, but also includes assets that might be instrumental or used as a weapon. Threatened assets include infrastructure (including bridges and tunnels), facilities (rest stops, border crossings, storage areas), equipment (vehicles, devices) and staff. No federal standards for vulnerability assessment, protective actions or infrastructure hardening have been developed. Individual state DOTs have undertaken protective measures that they judge sufficient, based on their own assessment of criticality and vulnerability, and have carried out such improvements without special federal funding. It is Mn/DOT's position that federal vulnerability assessment guidelines should be established as a ""minimum standard"" and that funding be available to regularly update/revise those guidelines. New protection program for critical, security-related infrastructure, facilities and equipment - Congress should authorize (drawing from the General Fund) a new program through the Department of Homeland Security for critical infrastructure/facility asset external protection (patrolling, camera surveillance, detection) of critical, security-related facilities (e.g., bridges and tunnels). Minnesota uses a significant level of surveillance and detection, including its use in tunnels and on bridges. Expansion of these systems or hardening of such facilities would require new federal funding. Any security-related surveillance or detection system must be integrated into the overall transportation system to ensure continued operation and maintenance of such systems when the perception of a security threat is low. That is, such systems must provide security plus enhanced traffic operations. Implement structural hardening and other measures - Congress should provide for state-selected structural  ""It is Mn/DOT's position that federal vulnerability assessment guidelines should be established as a ""minimum standard"" and that funding be available to regularly update/revise those guidelines.""  14   ""Mn/DOT believes that increase federal-aid highway funding for security activities such as detection, surveillance, traffic control, and traveler information improvements is critical.""  hardening and other security-related structural measures for new or reconstructed facilities through increased funding in the core federal-aid highway programs (National Highway System, Interstate, Bridge). Additional facility issues - The most difficult to fund will be those initiatives which ultimately lead to greater security at remote facilities where materials and equipment could be used for a terrorist attack (e.g., a Mn/DOT truck). There is typically little in the way of surveillance/security at these facilities. The same is true at rest stops. These areas could be used as a marshalling yard by people wishing to do harm. 3) Emergency response preparation The emergency response activities of state departments of transportation take place within an established federal/state emergency management institutional framework. While most emergencies start as local, major emergencies quickly become state- or multi-state declared emergencies. State departments of transportation and local governments participate in state emergency management agency-led activities as a support function within a formal framework established by the statewide emergency management plan. Following a model established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, these are ""all-hazard"" plans and generally define the authorities, chain of command, communications protocols and specific areas of responsibility of various agencies. Some state emergency management plans have specific components dealing with natural and industrial disaster responses. s  general funds to support continuing emergency response preparedness planning, training and special weapons of mass destructionrelated protection equipment for surface transportation, including transit. It is Mn/DOT's position that adequate funding for emergency preparedness is essential in order to provide state and local agencies the necessary resources above and beyond current operational demands. s  Increase federal-aid highway funding for security, hazardous materials and safety-related incident response and management. In order to support security, hazardous material and safety-related incident response and management, Congress should increase Highway Trust Fund funding with $500 million per year being directed to these activities. The activities that would be funded include detection, surveillance, traffic control and traveler information improvements for application on critical freeways and arterials, on and off the National Highway System and on critical transit facilities. This increase would be apportioned through existing categories of funding and could only be spent on projects and activities that are consistent with the security components of the statewide longrange transportation plan. Mn/DOT believes that increase federal-aid highway funding for security activities such as detection, surveillance, traffic control, and traveler information improvements is critical.  15  Provide new General Fund resources for emergency preparedness. Congress should enable access to $100 million annually in Department of Homeland Security or Federal Emergency Management Agency  s  Provide first responders with access to communications funding. Congress should enable state DOTs, together with other first responder associations, to have access to Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security or Federal   Emergency Management Agency general funds for development of improved nationally-standard, interoperable and hardened communications for interagency (police, fire, security, emergencymedical, transportation) communications. s  Case studies of various ""disasters"" show that it is always communication that breaks down thereby hampering an agency's ability to respond effectively. Integration and interoperability of communications systems among various agencies is key to success and should be strongly supported. In Minnesota, the Department of Public Safety has a coordinating role in the event of an emergency situation. It is also recognized and accepted that local law enforcement would have primary jurisdiction depending upon the location and magnitude of the emergency. Many Minnesota ITS activities would benefit from this proposal. Communications now used for traffic signals, message signs, meters, etc. are not hardened. Communications hardening would have to be defined and implemented on new projects.  16   Safety Issues Overview ""Safety is and will remain a priority for Minnesota."" A quarter century of progress in decreasing highway deaths began to slow in the early 1990s. During the past decade, between 530 and 650 Minnesotans died annually in highway crashes. Although government agencies, safety advocates and the automotive industry have introduced many initiatives, progress has been slowed. In response, Mn/DOT has implemented a number of targeted, highly efficient, low-cost safety improvement strategies, primarily involving infrastructure such as rumble strips and improved signage and pavement markings. Other state safety interests have focused on drinking and driving, improved driver education programs and stronger seat belt legislation. Safety is and will remain a priority for Minnesota. The next federal transportation bill should include enhanced safety planning, flexible funding for infrastructure improvements and support for application of effective low-cost safety improvement strategies. The increase in motor carrier and commercial vehicle traffic at the nation's borders since the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement has increased concerns about safety. Both the federal government and state agencies have taken steps to implement aggressive inspection programs to ensure that all such vehicles meet safety standards. Mn/DOT supports the following positions that address safety improvement issues: 1) s  being directed to safety-oriented roadway improvements and other safety activities. This increased funding would be apportioned through all existing categories of funding and could only be spent on projects and activities that are consistent with the safety component of the statewide longrange plan. This strategy is consistent with Mn/DOT's Statewide Transportation Plan performance targets. Continued safety improvements at railroad - highway grade crossings is important in Minnesota. Stable or increased funding is necessary due to the increased cost of physical safety improvements at crossings and potential train/vehicular conflicts are increasing with growth in traffic volumes, particularly on high density freight lines. s  Highway safety funding Increase funding: In order to support a policy to significantly reduce fatalities on the nation's highways, Congress should increase Highway Trust Fund by $1 billion per year of the additional funds s  Increase effectiveness of safety setaside funding: Congress should direct several improvements to increase the effectiveness of the Surface Transportation Program's 10 percent safety set-aside. Specifically, Congress should direct that funds be used exclusively to implement the state's comprehensive highway safety plan. Safety set-aside funds should be used consistently with the proposed comprehensive highway safety component of the state's transportation plan. States should also be given greater flexibility to transfer funding among the subcategories. NHTSA safety funding: NHTSA administers a series of safety grant programs. These programs have differing goals and guidelines. Examples include the Section 402 community highway safety grants as well as the grants offered  17   through Sections 405 (occupant protection), 410 (alcohol-impaired driving counter measures), 411 (state highway data improvement) and 2003(b) (child passenger protection education) and the Sections 157 (safety belts) and 163 (anti-drunk driving) grant programs. Congress should consolidate several safety grant programs into a single, flexible Section 402 highway safety program that would be goaloriented and risk-based. Although in Minnesota the Section 402 funds go directly to the Department of Public Safety, Mn/DOT needs to be involved in deciding safety strategies and the state needs to retain program flexibility. 2) Support of state and local safety statues TEA-21 includes a restriction on use of funds for certain lobbying activities. This provision prohibits the Secretary of Transportation from engaging in ""any activity designed to urge a State or local legislator to favor or oppose the adoption of any specific legislative proposal pending before any state or local legislative body."" The current restrictions limit the ability of transportation officials to advocate on behalf of new safety proposals, effectively compromising their ability to lend their professional expertise to the debates over these issues. Mn/DOT believes it is appropriate that the state's safety experts be allowed to testify and provide information to elected officials. Freeing transportation officials to enter into the discussions about these issues would benefit legislators by providing them with quality professional advice.  3) Motor carrier safety s  Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program: Congress should provide additional funding, from sources other than the Highway Trust Fund, for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP). Higher MCSAP funding will enable the FMCSA to promote detection and correction of commercial motor vehicle safety defects, commercial motor vehicle driver deficiencies and unsafe motor carrier practices before they become contributing factors to crashes and hazardous materials incidents. An increase in funding would enable Minnesota to provide additional educational and technical assistance, deploy new safety initiatives and improve data exchange. Mn/DOT's Office of Motor Carrier Services currently participates in the MCSAP safety program along with the Minnesota State Patrol's Commercial Vehicle Section. The basic operating grant requires a 20 percent match by the state agency for any MCSAP activity it conducts. If the basic grant were to increase to 100 percent federal funding, it would provide Minnesota greater flexibility to develop, initiate, and maintain specific safety programs and products. If 100 percent basic grant funding were offered, Minnesota could specifically promote or enhance interagency and multi-jurisdictional partnerships; provide easier and coordinated exchange of data and information of carrier/shipper/operator history to roadside enforcement from multiple jurisdictions; expand efforts that endorse, create and maintain uniform and cooperative arrangements on a regional scale to  ""If 100 percent basic grant funding were offered, Minnesota could specifically promote or enhance interagency and multi-jurisdictional partnerships, providing easier and coordinated exchange of data and information.""  18   improve data flow and safety information exchange across state borders; and provide training to Mexican and new-entrant US and Canadian carriers. s  Safety monitoring program: Congress should establish a safety monitoring program for Mexican motor carriers and all new entrant U.S. and Canadian-based carriers. A comprehensive North American safety-monitoring program would target resources at those less experienced carriers that would be at higher risk of safety violations. An increase in funding would enable Minnesota to increase training resources that would target the less experienced carriers in hopes of establishing a solid safety foundation. Mn/DOT's Office of Motor Carrier Services currently has a mandated training program for new Minnesota intrastate carriers called IMCC (Initial Motor Carrier Contact). This training was developed to educate carriers on commercial motor vehicle and driver safety requirements. The IMCC program could be modified to conform to FMCSA standards. If given additional resources, it could be given to new interstate entrants.  19   Freight Transportation Issues Overview During the past two decades, freight transportation by all modes has experienced tremendous growth. The value of freight and cargo moved by truck, rail, and air has skyrocketed. Ecommerce has contributed to expanded freight movements and turned transportation infrastructure virtually into moving warehouses. It is estimated that even modest economic growth will double the volume of export/import tonnage and increase domestic tonnage by 70 percent in the next twenty years. These increases have taxed the capacity of our ports, rail lines, highways, and airports. As a result congestion, capacity constraints, shipping delays and service reliability are increasing the cost of freight transportation. Without increased investment in infrastructure, innovative financing, flexible funding, and improved operational efficiency, the competitive advantage Minnesota and the nation have with global markets will erode. Mn/DOT supports the following AASHTO positions related to freight transportation: 1) Financing Congress should support the use of existing innovative finance tools and new financing mechanisms for investments in freight transportation infrastructure. In the aggregate, the need for investment in freight transportation infrastructure is substantial. It is neither possible nor appropriate to meet this need through standard sources of public investment. Existing financing mechanisms should be amended to and new mechanisms should be developed to increase investment in freight transportation projects: q TIFIA should be amended to lower the project threshold, expand eligibility for freight projects and relax repayment requirements. TIFIA eligibility requirements need to be softened, especially the $100 million threshold. Currently, TIFIA doesn't fit our needs in Minnesota. q The opportunity to establish State Infrastructure Banks should be made available to all states and multi-state SIBS should be facilitated where states consider them to be necessary to increase investment in freight corridors. q Tax incentives should be enacted for targeted investment in freight rail and intermodal infrastructure. q The Railroad Rehabilitation and Infrastructure Financing (RRIF) program requirements need modified to allow for more projects to qualify under the loan program. 2) Intermodal connections Frequently the ""last mile"" of a freight shipment is the longest mile because of deficiencies in roads that connect to freight hubs such as seaports, airports, and truck and rail terminals. Increased funding recommended for NHS, STP, and CMAQ will make it possible for states and MPOs to targeted increased investment in intermodal connectors. Existing and innovative financing techniques should be tailored to make increased investments in intermodal connectors possible in combination with increases in core TEA-21 programs. The next transportation bill needs to be explicit in its flexibility to fund the planning, engineering and construction of  ""Without increased investment in infrastructure, innovative financing, flexible funding, and improved operational efficiency, the competitive advantage Minnesota and the nation have with global markets will erode.""  20   ""Freight transportation involves the public and private sectors, all modes of transportation and virtually all the agencies of the US DOT but there is no established mechanism for communicating with one voice to `One DOT' on freight transportation issues.""  intermodal connections. For example, currently Mn/DOT could fund a highway connection to a river port but not a rail connection and TEA-21 does not currently provide any ability to fund improvements within an intermodal facility. 3) Capacity building process and research Up to $10 million annually should be provided to support an initiative through which the U.S. DOT and the state DOTs will jointly develop and implement a training and capacity-building program to strengthen the ability of state and local transportation agencies to effectively address freight transportation issues. ""Best practices"" should be disseminated as widely and quickly as possible with special emphasis on effective approaches to involving the private sector in public transportation planning processes. Congress should enact an increase in FHWA's research and technology program allowing greater emphasis on freight transportation research and create a Freight Transportation Cooperative Research Program (FTCRP). Transportation research has not kept pace with the changing character and significance of freight transportation in all modes. Research in the area of freight transportation must span the gap between public and private sector interests and perspectives and be relevant to both. Closely aligned to this is the need for a comprehensive freight data collection, analysis and dissemination strategy to support national, multi-state, statewide and metropolitan planning and investment.  4) National Freight Advisory Group Freight transportation involves the public and private sectors, all modes of transportation and virtually all the agencies of the US DOT but there is no established mechanism for communicating with one voice to ""One DOT"" on freight transportation issues. A national freight industry advisory group should be created as a means of communicating with the U.S. DOT and should be structured to provide for the significant involvement of state DOTs. This would have a very positive direction for the inclusion of freight as a consideration in our policy development and investment decision-making processes. The Minnesota Freight Advisory Committee may serve as a model to receive input from the freight community needed to advance much of this proposed freight strategy.  21   Transit Issues Overview As with ISTEA and TEA-21, the upcoming reauthorization should focus on a balanced intermodal transportation system for the nation. Transit provides mobility, access to jobs shopping, health care and many other service to Minnesotans. Transit is one of several options to reduce highway congestion and improving air quality. According to the American Public Transit Association (APTA), transit ridership has grown 23 percent nationally since 1995. Federal transit funding increased from $4.6 billion at the beginning of TEA-21 to $7.2 billion in the final year. State and local funding for transit has increased over the same period as well. Mn/DOT administered approximately $87 million in federal, state and local funds to 71 rural, small urban, urbanized and elderly/handicapped transit services in Greater Minnesota. These services provided more than 9.37 million rides. Mn/DOT supports the following transit policy recommendations: 1) Transit funding q Overall funding increases Mn/DOT supports transit funding increases similar to those proposed for highways. AASHTO supports increasing federal transit assistance from $7.5 billion in FFY 2004 to $10 billion by FFY 2009, increasing both transit and highway programs while striving to maintain their relative proportions under the six years of TEA-21. Transit funding should be supported at the highest possible level. Public transportation, which has been consistently under funded, will continue to be an important element in addressing travel and congestion concerns. Minnesota's demographicsaging population and population concentrating in urban areas-will increase the demand for transportation options and choices. Additionally, by providing additional funding we will be able to attain our transit goals while preserving some of the highway funds currently being transferred. q Funding guarantees In a major change to federal budget rules, TEA-21 established guaranteed funding levels for highway and transit programs. Transit funding is guaranteed at a selected fixed amount over the TEA-21 period. Since these provisions were implemented, transit funding has grown each year. Federal transit funding increased from $4.6 billion at the beginning of TEA-21 to $7.2 billion in the final year. The guarantees have not only led to higher funding levels, they have also provided transit authorities and Mn/DOT with certainty about the level of funding they would receive each year. In addition, this provision has ensured that transportation trust fund revenues are spent for transportation purposes. Mn/DOT supports continuing the provision in TEA-21 that guarantees the annual transit funding amount with a combination of mass transit account funds from the HTF and General funds. Funding  ""According to the American Public Transit Association (APTA), transit ridership has grown 23 percent nationally since 1995.""  22   guarantees for transit have been beneficial to Minnesota's transit systems. The higher levels appropriated under TEA21 have contributed to the state's ability to support new service and the expansion of existing operations, particularly in small urban and rural areas. Since 1996, 15 Greater Minnesota counties have implemented new transit service financed in part with federal funds. Guarantees are important because both the state and transit providers understand the level of available resources and are able to plan accordingly. q 80/20 match requirements As provided for in ISTEA and TEA-21, current matching shares for the transit program should be maintained. As long as this program is under funded to meet the demand and the money is granted on a competitive basis, states will have to buy into their project by increasing the local match. 80/20 makes this program look like the highway program and if we can get increased flexibility to flex funds, this will be beneficial to Minnesota. The suggestion to reduce the federal share to 50 percent would put an additional burden on Minnesota every time the state had to search for a way to provide the match on a transit project. With the problems we have encountered providing match under current law, we certainly do not want to see additional match required. Also, small rural providers would be forced to increase their fees substantially if the match was increased.  q General Fund investments Increased federal investment of General Funds in transit through TEA-21 has been successful, resulting in significant increases in transit ridership around the country. General funds in combination with HTF funds have been important for transit in reducing traffic congestion, and dealing with and preparing to deal with national emergencies, such as the September 11, 2001 use of transit to help evacuate New York and Washington, D.C. following the terrorist attacks. Mn/DOT supports an increase in General Fund assistance to provide additional resources to meet growing transit needs around the nation. This would have a positive effect on both transit and highways. By providing additional funding for transit, fewer highway funds would need to be flexed to transit, providing the ability to relieve congestion through the use of transit while at the same time protecting the investment we have in the highway infrastructure. q Funding flexibility Beginning with ISTEA and continuing with TEA-21, certain legislatively specified funds may be used for either transit or highway purposes. Flexible funds include FHWA STP and CMAQ funds (plus FTA urban formula funds). Flexed funds are crucial to Minnesota transit systems. Of particular note is the effect that flexed funds have on Greater Minnesota systems. Decisions to flex funds for transit capital have resulted in the significant improvement of the overall condition and life of the public  23   transit fleet. Small urban and rural systems rely almost exclusively on this source for new and replacement vehicles. Consideration should be given to allowing the highway categorical match provision to apply to funds flexed for transit projects. Currently, if funds that are categorically matched on the highway side are flexed to transit, we must re-match those funds under the FTA's rules (80/20 split). q Innovative financing eligibility Transit should continue to be an eligible beneficiary of innovative financing tools such as TIFIA, and State Infrastructure Banks, Provisions in current law should be continued and new approaches should be considered. Transportation in Minnesota can only gain by insuring that transit has the opportunity to participate in innovative finance procedures. Mn/DOT has made one transit related SIB loan and will likely make more. 2) Operational issues q Bus service Transit agencies operate incidental charter services to generate additional revenue to offset the costs of regular route service. Some also are combining school bus with regular route service to introduce cost-saving efficiencies. These initiatives should be encouraged, since they keep transit costcompetitive and attract new riders. It is Mn/DOT's position that Congress should not require direct Federal Transit Administration review of applications by public transit agencies wishing to perform  certain types of incidental charter service when such service does not jeopardize the economic vitality of individual private charter operators or detract from their private charter business. Congress should allow large transit agencies to self-certify compliance with Federal Transit Administration incidental charter rules and allow states to do this certification for other transit agencies. Incidental charter service can help public transit agencies provide regular route and paratransit services more affordably. Simplifying oversight procedures for such services will reduce the administrative burden on these agencies. Congress should direct the Federal Transit Administration to revise federal regulations to allow states more flexibility to combine public transit and school bus functions. Combining transit and school bus functions more easily will enable providers to offer these services more efficiently and at lower cost. q Intercity bus service Intercity bus transportation is essential in many of our states where little or no intercity rail services exist. In fact, given cutbacks in commercial air service in many markets, in many areas intercity bus service is the only option for travel, particularly among those who do not own or operate automobiles. Revisions to the FTA policies on the use of Section 5311 funds are needed to permit states to ensure that intercity bus services are adequately funded. It is  ""Transportation in Minnesota can only gain by insuring that transit has the opportunity to participate in innovative finance procedures.""  24   Mn/DOT's position that Congress should give state departments of transportation more flexibility to determine the percentage of federal transit funds allocated to intercity bus service under Section 5311(f). Congress should permit the state departments of transportation to submit the annual Section 5311 application based on the total needs of the state including a needs-based percentage for intercity bus services. Revisions to the FTA policies on the use of Section 5311 funds are needed to permit states to ensure that intercity bus services are adequately funded. q Transit Buy American certification The Federal Transit Administration's Buy American provisions require that all steel, iron and manufactured goods purchased with FTA funds be produced in the United States. FTA grant recipients are responsible for ensuring that their suppliers are in compliance with these requirements. Congress should amend the Buy American provisions of 49 USC to allow manufacturers to self-certify to the Federal Transit Administration. This measure would reduce burdensome administrative requirements without compromising the intent of the Buy America legislation.  q Drug testing Under the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991, recipients of specific federal funds are required to submit the results of their drug and alcohol testing programs to the Federal Transit Administration annually. Similar drug testing requirements apply to other commercial drivers license holders under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. Congress should direct the FTA and the FMCSA to consolidate drug and alcohol testing regulations to simplify the process and reduce the cost of complying with the requirements for small urbanized and rural transit operations. Consolidating and simplifying transit and motor carrier drug testing requirements will reduce the administrative burden of these programs without limiting their effectiveness in preventing illegal or improper drug and alcohol use by vehicle operators.  25   Statewide and Metropolitan Planning Issues Overview The current framework for statewide and metropolitan transportation planning was established in TEA-21, building upon success in ISTEA. This framework reflects significant changes in the transportation planning process that have strengthened stakeholder and public involvement, established multimodal planning processes and are sensitive to a multitude of factors from environmental, economic development and improved access to transportation facilities and services. While the planning processes within states and metropolitan areas are generally sound and should be retained, improvements can be made to improve efficiency and responsiveness to comply with new requirements and not hamper planning process improvements gained in the past decade. Federal planning requirements should continue to exhibit flexibility as no two states or metropolitan areas face the same issues. States need to be able to work with constituent groups to find the best solutions to specific situations. Financial planning can also be enhanced through increased flexibility in federal requirements as can state long-range plans. Many in the transportation community consider Minnesota a model for cooperative, progressive planning and financial decision making with regional and local governments. The relationship with other units of governments has served the citizens of Minnesota well. That said, Minnesota shares the same concerns related to flexibility and program/process streamlining to help deliver projects more quickly and efficiently. In terms of program flexibility, Mn/DOT supports the following reauthorization proposals:  Update Cycle for Metropolitan Long Range Transportation Plans TEA-21 requires that each Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) develop a Long Range Transportation Plan (LRP) with a minimum 20-year forecast period. Metropolitan planning provisions in TEA-21 establish general guidelines for MPOs, state departments of transportation (DOTs), and transit agencies to follow in updating MPO plans. The FHWA requires these updates every three years. A five-year cycle would be much more meaningful than an arbitrary three-year cycle. In Minnesota, three of the MPOs (Twin Cities, Duluth and St. Cloud) are maintenance areas and therefore must currently update their long-range plans every three years. The Twin Cities MPO typically updates its long-range transportation plan following an update of the regional blueprint. The blueprint sets out the overall development and policy framework for the region. Another benchmark for updating the transportation long-range plan is revising the transportation model following compilation of new census data and travel behavior data, which occurs every ten years.  ""Another benchmark for updating the transportation long-range plan is revising the transportation model following compilation of new census data and travel behavior data, which occurs every ten years.""  Fiscal Constraint in State and Metropolitan Plans and TIPS TEA-21 included requirements of financial constraint for State Transportation Improvement Programs (STIPs), and MPO Transportation Improvement Programs (TIPs). The intent of these requirements was to match project commitments to overall resources at the planning level. The states have responded to these requirements and no longer include projects in STIPs/TIPs that they can't afford to finance. Interpretation of fiscal constraint requirements varies among FHWA offices across the  26   ""State plans vary in scope and purpose across the country and reflect each State's individual transportation planning needs as well as each state's individual vision, goals and objectives for transportation.""  country, forcing some state DOTs and MPOs to comply with different standards to demonstrate financial constraint. Congress should increase the flexibility related to financial constraint in state and metropolitan transportation plans and TIPS. In Minnesota, the fiscal constraint issue works well. Increasing the flexibility would be useful, as would clarifying the interpretation of fiscal constraint requirements. The problem comes, as stated, in the lack of uniform interpretation from FHWA. Mn/DOT also supports permitting projects for which discretionary funding is being sought to be included in financially constrained TIPs, as long as both the anticipated revenues and the costs are included in a way that they can be identified separately from the rest of the TIP.  Modal Planning ISTEA and TEA-21 introduced a multimodal focus, although funding was still largely limited to highways and transit. Infrastructure and operational needs of the various modes are important, as is the way they interact with each other. Of increasing concern to state DOTs and MPOs are the safe integration and interaction of multiple users on the same system, or the interface between systems such as rail/highway grade crossings or NHS connections to multimodal terminals. During reauthorization, Congress should recognize the ability of state DOTs and MPOs to respond to the needs of their constituents and the legitimate role of state DOTs and MPOs in decision making on connections to the NHS or other highway facilities by ports, airports and freight terminals. Currently there are limitations on Mn/DOT and the MPOs for planning over ports, airports, and freight terminals. The freight industry is primarily privately owned and their freight movements have an impact on public infrastructure that the state and MPOs do not control. Thus Mn/DOT's and MPOs' ability to respond to the needs of their constituents, including those who use other than highway and transit modes, need to be retained and expanded.  State Long Range Transportation Plans Title 23 requires that each state develop a state long range transportation plan with a minimum 20-year forecast period. Statewide planning provisions in TEA-21 establish general guidelines for state DOTs to follow including the consideration of seven planning factors, which cover a broad range of transportation issues that have varying degrees of applicability to various states. State plans vary in scope and purpose across the country and reflect each State's individual transportation planning needs as well as each state's individual vision, goals and objectives for transportation. Mn/DOT's position is that Congress should continue to provide flexibility to states as to content of Long Range Plans, performance measures, and planning horizons so long as a minimum of a 20-year horizon is maintained.  Different Frequency Requirement for Transportation Plan and Conformity Updates Transportation plans must be updated every three years. Transportation Improvement Programs (TIPs) must be updated every two years. In addition, there are various SIP-related triggers in the transportation conformity rule that require plan and TIP updates within 18 months of various SIP actions. State Implementation Plans (SIPs) do not have a regular update cycle.  27   In Minnesota, three MPOs (Twin Cities, Duluth and St. Cloud) are currently required to update their long-range plans every three years as maintenance areas. This can be burdensome and not necessarily consistent with the availability of new data or the regional development plan. A five-year update cycle would be more reasonable, predictable and meaningful. Mn/DOT supports changes in the transportation conformity process that will enable MPOs to plan on a more predictable cycle and to have greater certainty with respect to when new transportation conformity determinations are required. Additionally, any changes to TIP conformity requirements would need to be revised in the transportation rules as well as in EPA's conformity rules.  Different Planning Horizons for Transportation and Air Quality Plans Metropolitan transportation plans are required to have a minimum of a 20year planning horizon. State Implementation Plans (SIPs) are for a period that extends to the attainment date with the latest being 2010. The mismatch in the time frames for transportation and air quality plans has placed an undue burden on the on-road mobile sector where there are very few measures remaining that can be implemented that will yield significant emissions reductions. Mn/DOT's position is that improved alignment of time frames for transportation and air quality planning horizons would streamline the process and should be supported.  Conformity Requirements after Maintenance Period Conformity requirements currently apply to non-attainment and maintenance areas. Some areas are approaching the end of the 20-year maintenance period. Yet, since these areas are still maintenance areas, they are required to do conformity analysis for the complete period of the transportation plan, which may extend far beyond the end of the maintenance period. Congress should clarify that conformity requirements apply only to the end of the maintenance period. In Minnesota, the Twin Cities became a maintenance area in 1999. Duluth and St. Cloud are both in the eighth year of their maintenance periods and are currently in the process of updating their maintenance plans with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. When the Twin Cities next updates its long range plan by November 2004, the plan will cover 2005-2030, while the conformity requirements will end with 2019. Clarification of the application of conformity in the long-range plans compared to the duration of the maintenance periods would be helpful.  28   ""Minnesota needs to be able to implement common-sense approaches and allocate funds where they are most needed.""  Interjurisdictional and Institutional Issues Overview States provide a central role in the development of the surface transportation system, even as other jurisdictions and institutions, local governments, metropolitan planning organizations, tribal governments and federal agencies themselves, have come to play important parts. The current decision-making structure that recognizing the state's leadership in the development of transportation plans, programs and projects is essential in delivering a comprehensive transportation system in Minnesota. TEA-21 recognizes that the federal highway program is a ""federally assisted state program"" and it is important that Congress maintain and reaffirm the state's leadership role and authority in reauthorization. Unfunded mandates and unwarranted sanctions reduce the state's discretion and resources available and the ability to respond effectively to transportation needs. Minnesota needs to be able to implement common-sense approaches and allocate funds where they are most needed. Mn/DOT supports the following positions related to interjurisdictional and institutional issues: 1) Decision-making authority The statewide transportation planning process focuses on longestablished institutional relationships between different governmental entities for decisions on plans, programs and project selection. These relationships were formalized with the enactment of ISTEA, and continued under TEA21. The existing transportation planning process, the result of a decade's worth of experience in creating collaborative models for involvement by all levels of government, has proven successful. The public interest has been well served by the present balance of responsibilities between the federal, state and local levels of government, and by the processes and procedures that have been put in place accordingly. The current model of ATP decision making in Minnesota has served the state well. Mn/DOT and local government partners would support retaining the existing balance of authority. To truly have decisions made around ""true needs,"" we do not support new set-asides. If the maximum percentage of federal funds per project is reduced below 80 percent, some agencies will have difficulty matching with local dollars along with the added requirements of a federal project. Congress should continue TEA-21's decision-making, processes and procedures for transportation planning, programming and project selection. This means retaining the balance of decision making between states and MPOs and states and rural officials; retaining the current definitions of planning ""consultation, cooperation and coordination"" and meeting needs through the existing program structure, rather than through new set-asides. 2) Statewide planning process Title 23 requires that each state develop a state long-range transportation plan with a minimum 20-year forecast period. Statewide planning provisions in TEA-21 establish general guidelines for state departments of transportation to follow including consideration of seven statewide planning factors. The seven factors cover a broad  29   range of transportation issues that have varying degrees of applicability to each state. Current proposals for changes to the planning process in reauthorization include a 25-year planning horizon, more frequent updates of plans and measures to require greater accountability on the part of states. It is Mn/DOT's position that Congress should protect state discretion, flexibility, innovation and accountability in the statewide planning process while affirming the importance of the federal-aid highway program's transportation mission, specifically: q Congress should provide maximum flexibility to the states to apply the statewide planning provisions and interact with MPOs and extra-MPO organizations, as well as pursue creative solutions while honoring and striving to achieve the intent of the federal legislation. q Congress should retain the following statutory provisions that protect state discretion and ensure state level flexibility, innovation and accountability. q Congress should confirm in statute the requirement for state concurrence in the planning and selection of public lands highway projects, including forest highways. q Congress should ensure that federal statutes continue to defer to state and local governments on whether and how to consider land use in the course of transportation planning. q Congress should ensure that federal statutes support balanced transportation investment strategies that are based on statewide and metropolitan planning processes. Congress should support the concept that preservation of the existing system involves more than pavement preservation, including  enhancing safety and modernizing highways and transit to bring them up to current design standards. q Congress should reaffirm the primary transportation mission of the federal highway program while acknowledging support for multiple policy goals. Congress should oppose revisions to federal law that impose new cost components that detract from the primary transportation mission. 3) International ports of entry The enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and unprecedented economic growth in North America during the past decade, are driving factors in the rapid expansion of trade between the United States, Mexico and Canada. In an increasingly global economy, it is critical that the flow of people, goods and commerce across international borders be as efficient as possible. Yet, the movement across borders is often beyond the control of transportation agencies to affect. Inadequate federal inspection staffing levels at many international ports of entry and the lack of coordination between federal inspection agencies and federal and state transportation agencies results in increased congestion and delays at international ports of entry. New security requirements at international ports of entry may result in long traffic delays causing major economic costs to shippers and businesses dependent on timesensitive deliveries as well as major impacts on local economies dependent on cross border passenger travel for tourism, recreation and entertainment and other related businesses. This should not be allowed to become another drain on already short highway funds.  30   It is Mn/DOT's position that Congress should promote enhanced coordination with Mexican and Canadian officials to speed international ports of entry and modify eligibility for the Coordinated Border Infrastructure Discretionary Program to include publicly owned landside access facilities at seaports and international inland ports of entry. Congress should help speed the flow of traffic at international ports of entry by making it easier for states to transfer federal highway funds to non-transportation federal agencies implementing improvements, providing new, nontransportation federal funding for inspection activities and promoting greater coordination and efficiencies at border crossings.  31   Environmental Stewardship and Streamlining Issues Overview Achieving the goal of delivering better and faster transportation projects requires a dual commitment to environmental stewardship and streamlining. This commitment to environmental stewardship involves proactive efforts to include environmental mitigation and enhancements in new projects, wider use of environmentally sensitive maintenance and operations techniques and the use of technology to improve the linkages between planning and project development. In terms of streamlining, it is necessary for Congress to fix environmental review processes that too often fail to resolve conflicts that have delayed projects in the past. Help is needed to support transportation agencies efforts to ensure planning level decisions are not disregarded when the NEPA process begins. Help is needed to clarify agency roles and responsibilities in the NEPA process, so that it does not become bogged down in endless interagency disputes. Help is needed to restore a degree of flexibility and common sense to Section 4(f) review, while preserving its essential elements. With help in these areas and others, the environmental process can become faster and more efficient, while producing better outcomes for our transportation system and environment. Mn/DOT supports the following positions related to environmental stewardship and streamlining: 1) Stewardship initiatives Environmental stewardship is a voluntary commitment made by individual state DOTs at their own discretion to go beyond the minimums require by law. It is not a new set of regulatory requirements. Environmental stewardship is commitment to a ""new way of doing business"" that affects all activities within Mn/DOT. It is not a separate program or activity. Many activities that are being undertaken as part of environmental stewardship efforts are already eligible for Federal funding, under existing law. Congress can best promote stewardship by preserving existing funding flexibility, streamlining administrative procedures for projects that enhance the environment and supporting increased funding, training and outreach. This would accelerate parts of the current processes, provide more local control and increase funding. 2) Reforming the NEPA process The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process for large, complex projects has become increasingly lengthy and complex. Previous efforts to streamline the process, including those in TEA-21, have yielded some results, but significant problems remain. It is Mn/DOT's position that Congress should strengthen and expand the environmental streamlining provisions of TEA-21. Specifically establish in statue: q That U.S. DOT and state DOTs, as co-lead agencies in the NEPA process, have the authority to define purpose and need and determine the range of alternatives considered, for purposes of all federal reviews for a surface transportation project. q That other federal agencies participating in the NEPA process for a surface transportation project are responsible for early disclosure of concerns that could delay or  32   prevent permitting or other approvals, timely submittal of comments and due consideration of transportation goals when making permit decisions. q That the ""purpose and need"" in a NEPA document for a surface transportation project may be based on policy decisions made outside the NEPA process - e.g., in federal legislation, state and MPO transportation plans and local land use plans. q That the alternatives analysis in a NEPA document for a surface transportation project is sufficient if the document considers a ""reasonable range of alternatives."" Reasonableness should be determined by taking into account the overall the scope and complexity of the project and other relevant factors. q That the alternatives analysis in a NEPA document is sufficient if it considers each alternative in a ""reasonable"" level of detail for that alternative. Reasonableness should be determined by taking into account the overall scope and complexity of the project and other relevant factors. q ""Default deadlines"" that must be followed in the NEPA process, unless the lead agencies and other participating agencies reach agreement on alternative deadlines. Allow lead agencies to grant limited extensions to the deadlines for good cause. Additionally, modify the dispute resolution process to enable it to be invoked by a project applicant. That places the decision to invoke dispute resolution in hands of the project applicant; U.S. DOT is not the sole arbiter of when to invoke dispute resolution, as was the case under TEA-21 procedures proposed by USDOT in March 2001.  In Minnesota, these efforts would provide more local authority and responsibility, shorten the overall process and decisions would be made quicker. 3) Section 4(f) reforms Section 4(f) protects significant public-owned parks, recreation areas, wildlife refuges and all significant historic sites - whether publicly or privately owned. Section 4(f) prohibits the ""use"" of protected lands unless there is ""no prudent and feasible alternative"" and the selected alternative incorporates ""all possible planning to minimize harm"" to resources protected by Section 4(f). Section 4(f) has become an increasingly rigid, cumbersome statute as more properties are protected (especially historic properties) and even minor impacts trigger application of Section 4(f) - no exemptions allowed. Finally, Section 4(f) adds two years to the review process. It also increases project costs. Congress should reform Section 4 (f) to provide greater flexibility and reduce delays, while preserving protection for truly significant parks, recreational areas, wildlife refuges and historic sites. Mn/DOT supports a streamlined process with more flexibility that in turn will shorten project time frames, and is a more common sense approach to protecting environmental assets. 4) Time limits for legal claims Under current law, lawsuits challenging an FHWA or FTA decision can be filed for up to six years after the end of the NEPA process. By contrast, challenges to FAA decisions must be filed within a 60-day deadline. Major expenditures can be made in this six-year period for final design, right-of-way acquisition and even construction. When lawsuits are  33   filed long after the end of the NEPA process, they can cause unnecessary disruption - which easily could have been avoided if the legal actions had been filed promptly after the NEPA process ended. Requiring lawsuits to be filed within a defined period after the end of the NEPA process (e.g., 60 or 90 days) would fully preserve citizens' rights to bring legal challenges, while also achieving closure more quickly on any disputed issues. Therefore, it is Mn/DOT's position that Congress should establish a specific, reasonable time limit within which lawsuits could be filed challenging federal approvals for surface transportation projects. This approach would save money and time, because, once a decision is made, the ability to proceed will be able to be determined.  34   Research Issues Overview ""Continued support for transportation research funding is strongly supported by Mn/DOT."" Research is crucial to advances in transportation that can save lives, time and money. While overall funding for highways and transit has grown considerably in recent years, federal funding for research has barely grown at all. Federally supported planning and research programs have been a model of state, federal and other stakeholder cooperation in developing more durable road material, improving highway safety and increasing the reliability of travel times. They have led to socially, environmentally and economically responsible highway and transit development. Minnesota is considered a national leader in the area of transportation research. Mn/DOT in partnership with the University of Minnesota's Center for Transportation Studies and the Humphrey Institute continue the tradition of research and ultimately deployment of technologies that are improving the nation's transportation system. Continued support for transportation research funding is strongly supported by Mn/DOT. Specifically, Mn/DOT is supportive of the following national research positions: Maintain the State Planning and Research Program Congress should continue the State Planning and Research Program in its current, formula-based configuration (i.e., 2 percent of federal-aid programs, with a 25 percent minimum for research). Any reduction in SPR funds will be devastating for Minnesota and other states research program. Initiate F-SHRP Congress should authorize the Future Strategic Highway Research Program and appropriate $75 million annually for six years using a set-aside of a percentage of all federal-aid highway apportionments in fiscal years 2004 through 2009. The Future Strategic Highway Research Program will be a specialpurpose, time-constrained research program in which a concentration of resources is used to accelerate progress toward a few, high-priority objectives. The F-SHRP program would focus on four goals: renewal of America's highways; significant improvement in highway safety; reliable travel times; and environmentally, economically and socially responsive highway development Increase funding for FHWA national research priorities Congress should increase funding for the FHWA's research program to approximately $300 million annually, which is $98.5 million above current levels. This should include funding for a new Surface Transportation Environmental Cooperative Research Program at $15 million annually. Funding at a level nearly 50 percent above current appropriations will ensure that the Federal Highway Administration has sufficient resources to carry out its research programs and restore funding to pre-TEA-21 levels. Complete Long-Term Pavement Performance Program (LTPP) To derive full benefit from the member departments' investment in the LTPP program, Congress should sustain this component of the Strategic Highway Research Program through 2009 to complete the process at an estimated cost of $20 million annually. This would be part of, and not in addition to,  35   the FHWA's research and technology funds. Increased effort will also be needed in data analysis and product development if the expectations for LTPP are to be met. The LTPP Advisory Committee estimates that $120-125 million will be required to support the work of the LTPP studies from fiscal years 2004 through 2009. Support transit research Congress should reverse the steady decline in Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) funding. Funds for the program should be authorized and appropriated at $15 million annually. Future levels should be based on a formula that ties program funding to the level of transit funding. During the last five fiscal years (FFY 1997-2001), a total of 539 problem statements were submitted for TCRP funding. Based on the funding available, 22, or 4 percent, were selected. The TCRP project selection process is not only highly competitive, but under funding results in many important transit research needs going unmet. University Transportation Centers (UTC) Congress should increase funding for UTCs from the current level of $32 million annually to $50 million annually. This program is funded from - and is not in addition to - the budget from FHWA, R&T and FTA research. Ten regional consortia (66 universities) were selected based on competition in 1988 and funded at $1 million per year. Their funding has not been increased. In addition, Congress has added 23 other universities since then.  Promote focused safety research programs Dependent upon an increase in overall program levels, Congress should increase funding for the safety research programs supported by the Highway Trust Fund at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). The programs should be increased from approximately $10 million annually to $30 million annually for FMCSA and from $16.3 million annually to $25 million annually for NHTSA. The programs should be focused on continuing to help reduce fatalities and injuries. The NHTSA and the FMCSA are responsible for the safety of large vehicles whose size and carrying capacity make their crashes potentially catastrophic. Their safety programs, focused on reducing collisions, fatalities and injuries, are a crucial element of all surface transportation safety efforts.  36   Operations/Intelligent Transportation Systems Issues ""Minnesota is nationally and internationally recognized as a leader in the research, and deployment of ITS technologies."" It is now widely recognized that providing an effective highway-based transportation system consists of three primary components - building the necessary infrastructure, preserving that infrastructure and operating and managing the system on a day-to-day basis. ITS has emerged as a critical means to achieving a broader set of goals (security, safety, reliability) in serving transportation users. Intelligent Transportation Systems play an important role in ensuring the security of America's transportation system and in facilitating post-disaster emergency response and evacuation. Using tools, technology and institutions working together to achieve security, safety and reliability for the user drives operating the system. Each of the initiatives and proposals is designed to make significant progress to creating a national network of system operations. The goal is to invest once to achieve maximum utility for the highway, transit, public safety and emergency response communities as they serve the public and user. Minnesota is nationally and internationally recognized as a leader in the research, and deployment of ITS technologies. Mn/DOT's educational, research and private sector partners continue to develop and utilize ITS programs that are reshaping traditional DOT responsibilities that reflect a transportation system operational focus necessary today. To continue this role in the development and deployment of ITS systems, there are three primary ITS issue areas that TEA-21 reauthorization needs to address: Policy Initiatives The focus of the policy initiatives is to expedite the delivery of deployment projects, facilitate interjurisdictional cooperation and sharing to speed the process of needed standards and ensure appropriate performance reporting against established performance targets. Specifically, reauthorization needs to create and support approaches, which will significantly expedite the deployment of proven and focused ITS technologies; minimize or eliminate barriers in the federal program to the creation of new innovative institutions and relationships for cross-jurisdictional deployment; encourage the development of tools and techniques to improve the planning and procurement for ITS deployment; recognize that funding and regulatory models are needed to accommodate private sector performance of traditionally public sector activities. ITS Deployment The focus of deployment is strengthening the safety and security of the transportation system by deploying tools and partnerships that provide the maximum amount of sharing across jurisdictions of state and local government. Reauthorization should support innovative organizations and relationships for cross-jurisdictional planning and deployment of regional transportation system operations and management through the cooperation and collaboration of transportation, public safety and emergency response agencies at the federal, regional, state and local levels. Support the creation of a National Transportation Information Network that will link all existing and future metropolitan and rural transportation systems into an integrated yet distributed data network capable of collecting, sharing and archiving transportation system operation, traffic condition and performance information. The network should be the foundation for security monitoring, infrastructure management and operation, traveler  37   information, freight management, and other aspects of transportation enabling the seamless and secure movement of people and goods. Increase funding to plan and expedite deployment of proven systems, to support operations and to hire and train skilled staff to manage the systems. There are several ITS areas where continued deployment nationally is essential: q 511 systems with the goal of making 511 service available to 80 percent of the population by 2005. q Nationwide deployment and enhancement of CVISN to ensure that the functionality of the program is uniform throughout the country. It is also envisioned that it is capable of tracking and monitoring critical cargo and operator locations. Performance would be studied and appropriately implemented. q Road weather data gathering networks and National Incident Reporting System (CARS) are key to the success of achieving the new model of transportation systems. Operation with new technology provides the ability to monitor and collect information about what is happening on the system. * Metropolitan congestion relief and incident response systems have emerged to be critical functions shared between transportation, public safety and emergency response communities. These systems include communication, information dissemination and support for critical incident response and system monitoring and management. q Safety initiatives supporting transportation and public safety professionals need to convey the right information at the right time and place. That information must  often be shared across system, organizational and jurisdictional boundaries. Inter-operable procedures and technologies for public safety and transportation operations will enable this vision of integrated information for safer communities. ITS Research There remains a need for a strong intermodal research program to perform basic research. The program would develop, test and evaluate new tools and strategies; develop and maintain the national ITS architecture and ITS standards; and provide technical assistance, guidance and training to deploying agencies. Mn/DOT supports the following positions related to ITS research: q A continued federal role, in partnership with the public and private sectors, to develop architecture and standards that will enhance interoperability, integration capabilities, center-to-center data sharing and data dissemination to third parties. q A need to continue research and the development of additional securityrelated ITS technologies. q The continued development and implementation of education and training programs necessary to assure that transportation, safety, emergency response professionals are able to make use of the technologies for use in operations. Increase Intelligent Transportation Systems funding Congress should adjust funding for ITS research, standards and testing from the current level of $110 million annually to $125 million annually in order to maintain the current level of effort as an effective means of addressing many of the operational and safety challenges on the surface transportation network.  38   This level of funding is necessary to continue essential programs of research, standards development and testing, but also to provide for a substantially increased level of activities leading to preparation of state agencies and users for the actual widespread deployment of ITS technologies.  39"
GX270-35-1063726	"OFFICE OF PUBLIC TRANSIT NEWSLETTER  SUMMER 2001  State Transit Assistance reduced for FY2002 State Transit Assistance  Transit's role in I-235 reconstruction By J.P. Golinvaux In 2002 the Iowa Department of Transportation will commence reconstructing Interstate 235 (I-235), the freeway that serves the Des Moines metropolitan area. ""The reconstruction work is scheduled to last for five years, starting in 2002 and ending in 2006,"" said Martin Sankey, I-235 project manager for the Iowa DOT. Significant traffic congestion is expected throughout this period. We felt it may be of interest to our readers that several transit initiatives are under consideration as ways of minimizing congestion and addressing traffic issues associated with this major project. I-235 construction, see page 5  By Kay Thede State Transit Assistance (STA) for Iowa's 35 public transit systems is estimated to be approximately $1.5 million less than projected in early January. The fund took a hit from two sides: the Iowa Legislature reduced the amount by $659,820 to help meet state budget shortfalls, and use tax projections have dropped due to fewer vehicles being sold. State transit assistance funds are generated from one-twentieth of the first four cents of the state's vehicle use tax, in the form of a standing appropriation. Because the transit funds flow through the general fund before the Iowa Department of Transportation distributes them to the transit systems, the fund became part of the 6 percent reduction realized by most General Fund programs. The transit fund reduction, part of House File 755 adopted in the 2001 Legislature, is a reduction for FY2002 only. STA projections for FY2002 declined from $10.9 in January to $10.1 in May. The use tax had been steadily increasing since 1992, but began the downward trend during FY2001. The projections for FY2002 reduce the STA to less than the 1999 levels. Monthly receipts show no sign of the trend reversing soon.

Efforts are in place to encourage the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to adopt these rules in place of the current Head Start rules. (See Page 10)  Worked with transit regions to develop new vehicle signage in response to FTA guidance. (See page 4) Communication  Held regional meetings with transit agencies.  Published Connections newsletters (electronic version available on our Web site, iatransit.com).  Reestablished more consistent transit updates via E-mail.  Entered into a contract to establish a new interactive Web site (iatransit.com). The new designs will not be posted until this fall; however, this link will currently take you to our existing site. Please save this location and give us your feedback when the new design appears this fall. Customer Service  Reorganized the Office of Public Transit based on input from transit agencies and FTA. (Spring 2001 Connections, page 1)  Monthly State Transit Assistance (STA) payments and Electronic Funds Transfers (EFT)  STA payments are now being made monthly instead of quarterly, and we are offering EFT. Currently there are 22 transit systems participating.  Streamlined agreement process; - Signing agreements prior to sending them from OPT to the transit agencies designated signatory to reduce the amount of handling required on both ends of the process; and - Drafting agreements immediately after grant approval to minimize delays in the process. Advocacy  Applied for, and received approval of, a $1.9 million ITS grant from FHWA. (Spring 2001 Connections, page 1)  Participated in APTA Legislative visit to Washington, D.C., and Iowa Transit Legislative Day. Compliance  Participated in and responded to the state management review regarding Iowa's compliance with Federal Transit Administration rules. Unfortunately, not everything that has happened over the last year has had a positive impact on transit. The significant losses in STA are outlined in Kay Thede's article on page 1. At the state level, budget cuts have led to the elimination of the vacant position in our office, and outof-state travel has been cut. Despite these setbacks, the Office of Public Transit will continue forward with the following agenda.  The Office of Public Transit (OPT) was reestablished during the Iowa DOT reorganization in March 2000. This has enhanced communications among the DOT employees who have been dedicated to transit for many years, and has allowed them to again provide more unified support to the public transit industry. I joined the Office in late July 2000 and will soon have been with the Office of Public Transit for a full year. This would, therefore, be an appropriate time to review the events of the previous year, and share with you some of our goals for the coming year.  Future Coordination  Develop vehicle signage guidance in response to FTA guidelines.  Establish greater cooperation/coordination with IPTA committees. Communication  Continue to work with the Web page consultant on development of the new design. Customer Service  Update Transit Manager's Handbook.  Continue to analyze processes used by the Office of Public Transit to make improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness.  Develop training programs in cooperation with IPTA training committee.  Previous Year Coordination  Reestablished Statewide Transportation Coordination Advisory Council (See article in Spring 2001 Connections, page 4).  Director's Column, see next page  2   CONNECTIONS Director's Column, from previous page Advocacy  Develop Transit Marketing/ Advocacy Plan -- The Iowa Public Transit Association is working on an image campaign, and we have committed to work together to make our total effort as effective as possible.  Move forward with ITS Plan development.  Make presentations to transit policy boards, chambers of commerce, etc.  Coordinate with IPTA, CTAA and APTA to ensure a commitment to transit in TEA-21 reauthorization -- The Public Transit Management System (PTMS) provides a process for analyzing the capital needs for bus replacement. In FY2001, PTMS included a list of 256 vehicles that were programmed for replacement, totaling $21 million dollars. We were only able to replace 64 vehicles, even after transferring a portion of the federal transit operating assistance funding to supplement the Congressional earmark for statewide capital. We need to emphasize in the federal reauthorization process that it is imperative to more effectively meet this need. If this trend continues, we will continue to add buses to the list without replacing an equal number of buses, and the backlog will continue to grow. (See Spring 2000 Connections, page 3) Compliance  Perform compliance reviews of transit agencies to assist them in understanding federal rules. Obviously, this is not an allinclusive list of the efforts of the office, or of our plans for the future; however, I wanted to bring you up to date on where we have been and where we are headed. Thanks to all of you who have worked with us over the last year, and especially to members of the Office of Public Transit for their dedication and commitment to making these things happen. I would also like to take this opportunity to offer my congratulations to Karlyne von Krog on her retirement, the Governor's Shining Star award, and winning the Urban Transit System of the Year Award (see articles on pages 6 and 7). Well done. What a way to make an exit!  IPTA hears update on ADA issues By Peter Hallock Cheryl Hershey, from the Federal Transit Administration's Washington, D.C., Office of Civil Rights, spoke at the Iowa Public Transit Training Conference held June 6-9 in Sioux City. Hershey reviewed the general requirements for transportation providers under the Americans with Disabilities Act. She also discussed the growing number of legal actions taken by both the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) against local agencies that have failed to comply with the ADA rules. While she stated that the rules require full compliance with the various standards set forth in the rules, Hershey also indicated the courts have taken into consideration local officials' demonstrated efforts to reach full compliance. She pointed out it has been agencies which have consciously decided to aim for less than full compliance that have, to date, been the primary targets of legal action. Hershey noted that most investigations begin as a result of a public complaint to either FTA or DOJ. FTA will investigate the complaint and, if they find violations but no flagrantly willful noncompliance, will try to work with the local provider to reach compliance before resorting to legal action. She indicated it is also possible for a transportation provider to voluntarily request an assessment of their efforts, and her office can provide advice and assistance on questions that may come up in trying to meet the requirements. The Iowa Department of Transportation's Office of Public Transit and Iowa Public Transit Association jointly sponsored this training conference. Funding for this conference was provided under FTA's Rural Transit Assistance Program.  3   CONNECTIONS New look, same great service By Donna Johnson After more than a quarter century, two regional transit systems have taken on new names and appearances. Peoplerides (formerly Region 6 Transit Services) is in the process of changing the signs on its buses and other vehicles to reflect its new name. ""Our goal is to encourage even more people to take advantage of our low-cost transportation services,"" said Marty Wymore, Peoplerides executive director. Peoplerides serves the counties of Hardin, Marshall, Poweshiek and Tama. Residents in the four-county area can ride or obtain service information by calling 1-888616-4298. All Peoplerides services are wheelchair accessible. Wymore encourages anyone in need of transportation in their service area to give Peoplerides a call. ""Peoplerides is committed to meeting the needs of the entire population in their service area,"" says Wymore. Heart of Iowa Regional Transit Agency (HIRTA) is also sporting a new name, color and striping on its vehicle fleet. HIRTA's board of directors unanimously voted to adopt a new look to market their services to all members of the general public. HIRTA contracts for service with individual service providers in the counties of Boone, Dallas, Jasper, Madison, Marion, Story and Warren. Blue, reflective striping with large, six-inch, white lettering prominently identifying HIRTA Public Transit is displayed on both sides of each vehicle. ""Contractors are continuing to get more calls for transportation services each week. The new signage has brought greater awareness to all members of the public that this service is there for them and not client specific,"" said Jeanette New look, see page 11  4   CONNECTIONS I-235 construction, from page 1 Traffic congestion has been addressed with an assortment of tools that have come to be known collectively as ""transportation demand management"" (TDM). In particular, TDM refers to strategies that aim to alleviate congestion by: 1) reducing demand for personal vehicle travel; 2) shifting personal vehicle trips away from congested corridors; and 3) shifting trips to high occupancy vehicles. More specifically, the Des Moines Area Metropolitan Planning Organization has adopted a congestion strategy that aims to reduce single occupancy vehicle trips to work by 10 percent. Known as TDM-10, this voluntary program's goal is to reduce trips, and hence congestion. One means of accomplishing this goal is to increase the percent of trips taken in high occupancy vehicles. Sverdrup Civil, who is serving the Iowa DOT as consultants, has subcontracted to Parsons Brinckerhoff, Quade & Douglas (PB) to, in part, assess transit initiatives that should be implemented to reduce congestion during reconstruction of I-235. One of the encouraging findings that Bryan Porter of PB has shared is that ""...the structure is in place."" Des Moines Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) has already established 10 service elements that constitute a foundation for building ""...an effective TDM program."" Elements of MTA's service that PB has identified as transit initiatives that are critical to the success of congestion management efforts include:  local routes that provide thorough coverage of the core area;  express and commuter services (including park and ride and a reverse commute route);  a downtown transit mall that focuses attention on transit;  an extensive system of downtown shuttles that provides midday mobility for bus and vanpool riders;  a system of transit passes with extensive third-party sales locations;  a well-developed program of employer incentives for transit and vanpool use, referred to by MTA as its Employer Support Program;  a ""guaranteed ride home"" program for vanpool and commuter bus riders;  a well established vanpooling program, known as Central Iowa Rideshare, that serves area commuters;  automated vehicle location (AVL) Intelligent Transportation technology is partially in place; and  fare payment ""swipe card"" technology, that is a payment option on Link services, could be expanded system wide to reduce boarding times. These elements of MTA's service will have a key role in reducing I-235 reconstruction traffic congestion because:  transit service is in place and, relative to roads, has more underused capacity; and  shifting work trips to transit actually removes vehicles from roads, while other measures under consideration may simply relocate congestion. Accordingly, MTA's management has undertaken a system redesign project aimed at determining how to best reconfigure its services. This project sought answers about how to improve transit service generally and, more specifically, what activities would best improve upon the elements identified by PB as being critical to the success of congestion mitigation strategies. Three of the 19 areawide transit service improvements identified have been determined to be both feasible and to hold real potential for easing traffic congestion related to I-235 reconstruction. They are:  improve on express services in suburbs currently receiving service, and expand to additional suburbs;  introduce high frequency cross-town service on at least the University Avenue corridor to reduce travel time and improve connectivity; and  introduce shuttle services to park-and-ride centers. In addition to these fixedroute service improvements, other transit measures that are viewed as essential to the success of TDM-10 strategies are:  expanding and improving employer support for, and expanding the fleet of, Central Iowa Rideshare;  fostering expanded and intensified employer participation in MTA's Employer Support Program, in which employers cover all or part of employee transit pass or vanpool fares; and  investigating implementation of ""bus priority corridor"" measures to improve the overall people-carrying capacity of certain streets (e.g., automated vehicle location hardware compatible with traffic signal controllers, bus priority at traffic signals through extended green, bus turnouts, and relocation of bus stops to the far side of selected intersections). ""Recent investments by the MTA to upgrade its fixed-route and vanpool fleets have been made mindful of these TDM-10 strategies, and the DOT's commitment to develop multimodal alternatives has been a key to getting the community focused on this issue,"" said K. Stephen Spade, general manager, Des Moines Metropolitan Transit Authority. ""However, additional federal, state and local funding is critical to the successful implementation of the TDM-10 Plan if stakeholders are to reach their goal of reducing vehicle trips by at least 2,200 trips per hour. Along with the need for additional funding, our success will almost certainly hinge on the partnering between local employers, service providers and other governmental agencies with MTA to implement appropriate transit initiatives,"" Spade added.  5   CONNECTIONS System of the Year Awards By Donna Johnson The Iowa Department of Transportation honored Marshalltown Municipal Transit and East Central Iowa Transit for their accomplishments during the 2000 fiscal year, which ended June 30, 2000. Marshalltown Municipal Transit (MMT), which provides public transit service in the city of Marshalltown, was recognized as the most improved urban transit system of the year. There are 19 urban transit systems in Iowa. East Central Iowa Transit (ECIT), which is a service of the East Central Iowa Council of Governments (ECICOG) based in Cedar Rapids, was acknowledged as being the most improved regional transit system of the year. ECIT contracts with individual transit providers in the counties of Benton, Iowa, Johnson, Jones, Linn and Washington, and is one of 16 regional transit systems in Iowa. The awards are based on a combination of ridership gains, and a decrease in the operational cost per ride. MMT, headed by Karlyne von Krog, posted a 22.6 percent gain in ridership. This helped to reduce the cost per ride by 12.4 percent. MMT attributes their gain in ridership to increased service to the elderly and persons with disabilities, as well as to students and plant workers. These improvements earned MMT the FY2000 ""Urban Transit System of the Year"" award. Remarkably, MMT has received the award three times previously, for the years of 1986, 1987 and 1992, making their fourth win a record. Ridership in the rural areas served by ECIT increased 16.4 percent, while the cost per ride dropped 2.4 percent. Robyn Jacobson, Transit Coordinator for ECIT, attributed the gains to better coordination efforts that resulted in significantly increased ridership statistics from their county service providers, coupled with reduced maintenance and administrative costs. This is the first time ECIT has been  Robyn Jacobson of East Central Iowa Transit, (right), receives the Regional Transit System of the Year Award from Iowa DOT Transit Program Administrator J.P. Golinvaux. honored as the ""Regional Transit System of the Year"" by the Iowa Department of Transportation. The awards were announced June 7, 2001, at the Iowa Public Transit Training Conference held in Sioux City. The Iowa Public Transit Association and Iowa DOT jointly sponsored this conference. At the conference DOT officials recognized other transit agencies that had also made noteworthy improvements. These included three urban transit systems: Des Moines Metropolitan Transit Authority with an 11.4 percent increase in ridership and 2.9 percent decrease in cost per ride; Ottumwa Transit Authority with a 3.9 percent increase in ridership and 7.6 percent decrease in cost per ride; and Keyline Transit in Dubuque with a 4.5 percent increase in ridership and 2.8 percent decrease in cost per ride. Two regional transit systems had significant increases in ridership for FY2000. North Iowa Regional Transit System (NIRTS), based in Mason City, increased its ridership by 12.9 percent. NIRTS contracts with individual transit providers in the counties of Cerro Gordo, Floyd, Franklin, Hancock, Kossuth, Mitchell, Winnebago and Worth. Mid-Iowa Development Association (MIDAS), headquartered in Fort Dodge, showed the greatest increase in ridership for all regional transit systems with a 20.9 percent increase. MIDAS provides service in Calhoun, Hamilton, Humboldt, Pocahontas, Webster and Wright counties.

After 12 years von Krog decided to take on some new projects and try some new things. Since von Krog will have more time at home now, she plans to build a patio and remodel her basement. It won't be all work for von Krog though. Along with her annual treks to Las Vegas, new travel destinations are in her future, starting with a trip to Florida to visit a former classmate. Rumor has it she may even take up golf. Von Krog had several noteworthy accomplishments during her tenure as transit administrator. Marshalltown Municipal Transit has had the honor of being the recipient of the Iowa Department of Transportation's ""Urban System of the Year Award"" twice during her administration. She was also recently selected as a recipient of the Shining Star Award by the Governor's Conference on Aging. Von Krog has done everything from organizing annual ""holiday lights"" tours for the community, to ensuring riders safe, convenient, responsive service. Although planning her own retirement, von Krog was earnestly working out detailed plans for refining existing service and developing a new subscription route service for members of her community right up to her last day. von Krog's dedication to a challenging job has been remarkable. Her ongoing commitment to public transit in Iowa, and to Marshalltown in particular, is exhibited by her willingness to provide consulting services to her replacement in an effort to ensure a smooth transition in management. Iowa DOT's staff have enjoyed supporting von Krog in her endeavor to upgrade the city bus fleet, implement new projects, and improve the high quality of service Marshalltown Municipal Transit riders deserve. Good luck in your retirement Karlyne. You will be missed.  Karlyne von Krog's last day at the helm of Marshalltown Municipal Transit was spent inspecting this new, ramp-accessible, raised-roof minivan.  Marshalltown Municipal Transit Administrator receives Shining Star Award By Donna Johnson Karlyne von Krog, transit administrator of Marshalltown Municipal Transit, was recently awarded the Shining Star Award presented by the Iowa Department of Elder Affairs, Governor's Conference on Aging. Governor Vilsack recognized von Krog for her dedication to making municipal transit services as userfriendly, dependable, and cost effective as possible for elderly residents and visitors. Shining Star Awards were presented at the 22nd Annual Governor's Conference on Aging, held in West Des Moines, May 21, 2001. Von Krog was selected for an award under the category of ""Existing Services."" Awards were also presented for New Services, Public and Private Resources Working Together, Ongoing Commitment, and Youth. In her tenure as administrator for the transit services offered by the city of Marshalltown, von Krog has had an ongoing commitment to public transit; particularly notable are efforts she has made to assist veterans at the Vetran's Home to more easily access venues throughout Marshalltown. The city of Marshalltown has a number of residential facilities that serve a large number of retirees dependent on the public transit system. Over the years, von Krog has found ways to offer more hours of service, and has encouraged intensified use of flexible or deviated fixed-route service, rather than the city's more costly paratransit (taxi type) service. Most recently, she has been attempting to increase service effectiveness by initiating a subscription  route for seniors to use for grocery shopping on specially designated days in partnership with local grocery stores. On her watch, von Krog has seen to it that the city's buses work well, and present a safe and clean public image that is both inexpensive and easy for elderly persons to use. Marshalltown Municipal  Transit currently has six, stateof-the-art, small vehicles with a very comfortable ""air ride suspension"" and ramp accessibility to make boarding and alighting using a wheelchair or other mobility aid as safe and easy as possible.  7   CONNECTIONS Public Transit Roadeo Winners By J.P. Golinvaux and Donna Johnson Driving skills earned three Iowa transit vehicle operators top honors in Iowa's 15th Annual Public Transit Roadeo held in Sioux City, June 9. Jean Dalsing of Dubuque was the winner in the competition for van operators, representing the Delaware, Dubuque and Jackson County Regional Transit Authority. Rob Littschwager of Iowa City was the winner in the competition for small bus operators and placed third in the van competition, representing East Central Iowa Transit and its contractor Johnson County SEATS. Paul Klimesh of Ames won the large bus competition and placed second in the small bus competition, representing Ames' CyRide. Dalsing and Littschwager will represent Iowa in the International Paratransit Roadeo sponsored by the Community Transportation Association of America (CTAA) at the association's annual meeting in Austin, Texas, next May. Klimesh will represent Iowa in the American Public Transit Association (APTA) Roadeo conducted in conjunction with its annual meeting in Philadelphia, Pa., this September. Four operators that have previously been roadeo division winners repeated wins or were strong competitors again this year. Jean Dalsing repeated this year her first place finish in the 2000 and 1999 roadeos' van competition. Dalsing placed eighth in the national CTAA roadeo competition held in Salt Lake City, Utah, last May. She had previously placed third in 1997 and won the 1996 van division statewide competition. Paul Klimesh repeated his first place finish at the 2000 and 1997 roadeos' large bus division. Klimesh has represented Iowa and Ames' CyRide at the APTA national roadeos and finished high in the ranking of national contestants. Carl Nelson posted third, fourth and fifth place finishes in the large bus division at previous state roadeos and repeated his second place finish in 2000 in this division at this year's roadeo, representing Iowa City Transit. Rob Littschwager had previously won and placed in past roadeos, representing East Central Iowa Transit. Four rookie contestants at this year's roadeo broke into the ranks of top finishers. Ron Schneider, representing East Central Iowa Transit and its contractor Johnson County SEATS, placed second in the van competition. Terry Winningham, representing University of Iowa Cambus, tied for third place in the large bus division with Chris Wisher of Ames' CyRide. Eric Williamson, also representing CyRide, placed third in the small bus division. The Iowa Department of Transportation and Iowa Public Transit Association jointly sponsor the annual roadeo with funding under a Federal Transit Administration program. The roadeo was held at the Western Iowa Technical Community College campus in Sioux City. The purpose of the roadeo is to promote and provide recognition for safe driving skills by Iowa's public transit vehicle operators. At this year's roadeo, 34 operators from 17 transit systems displayed their skills. Each operator performed a series of maneuvers that represent many of the actual situations they face as they carry out their daily duties. Some of the maneuvers included were: pulling up to the curb at a bus stop closely flanked by parked cars; making left and right turns in narrow lanes that might be created by parked cars along a route; stopping short of an obstacle; and backing into parking stalls. Transit Manager's Dan Jensen, Sioux City Transit, and Amber Clausen, Siouxland Regional Transit, co-chaired the Transit Roadeo Planning Committee. IPTA members and representatives of the Iowa DOT, as well as other local volunteers, judged the competition.  Making rural transit count By Peter Hallock As we look to the next reauthorization of the federal transportation program and seek to increase the funding for rural transit programs, one of the biggest barriers is getting recognition that there even is public transit outside of urbanized areas. Part of the problem is that the National Transit Database, which is compiled from Section 15 data collected from large urban transit systems receiving funding under the Federal Transit Administration's 5307 program, does not contain any data on what goes on outside large urban areas. Nor is there really any other consistent source of data on rural transit operations. This has made it difficult to argue the case that rural transit needs an increased share of the national transit program funding. FTA has been working with several states to try to develop a much-simplified data set for rural transit; one which would not be overly burdensome for transit operators, but would allow the inclusion of key rural transit statistics in the National Transit Database. The information collection tool is being developed to work over the Internet, with a series of templates that rural transit managers can bring up in their browser, fill in the blanks and submit. An electronic draft of the proposed data screens and definitions was shared with Iowa transit systems after the June Iowa Public Transit Association conference. It is expected the collection process will begin in the next few months so an accurate picture of rural transit across the country can be built up and ready for the coming battles over the reauthorization bill, which will be acted on in 2003.  8   CONNECTIONS  Flooding in eastern Iowa By Samil Sermet In early April flood predictions were released for Davenport calling for a near record-breaking flood. ""The water came up quickly, but fortunately, sandbags were filled faster,"" said Charles Lowery, Davenport CitiBus transit manager. As more and more streets were closed, it became necessary to alter the routing of the buses in the downtown area. The ground transportation center (GTC), downtown transit center, and the offices of Davenport CitiBus, were designed to act as a floodwall to protect portions of their downtown area. The GTC did not flood because it was built with the Mississippi river in mind; however, they were able to watch trees and trashcans float by their windows. ""It was a daily struggle to keep amateur photographers, tourists and school kids off of our floodwall, which is the area the buses drive through,"" said Lowery. The Mississippi River is receding now, but in April the river crested at 22.3 feet, just under the 1993 and 1965 records. In May the river delivered a second crest of 21.3 feet. Lowery reported at the time of the flooding, ""the most amusing aspect of this experience for us here in Davenport was the presentation of the flood by the media to the rest of the country. Believe it or not, we're not hanging in the trees or sitting  on our rooftops. The flood affected the downtown area only and it wasn't really that bad."" None of the Davenport CitiBus vehicles were reported as having received water damage during the flood. Fox News Live and CNN covered this story during the visit to Davenport by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  (Top photo) This is River Drive (literally!) in Davenport. No buses on this bus route. (Above) Flood waters lap against the wall of the ground transportation center in Davenport. The GTC is normally two blocks from the river bank. Note the ducks in the foreground.  9   CONNECTIONS Iowa's student transportation rule drawing national attention By Peter Hallock Iowa's new rule on transporting students aboard regional transit buses has now been in place for one school year. The rule came about after the Iowa Public Transit Association asked the Iowa Legislature, during the 1999 session, to confirm and clarify the right of regional transit systems to carry student riders. The legislature did so, but also specified that the Iowa Department of Transportation should, in consultation with the Iowa Department of Education, establish administrative rules covering this practice. In drafting the rule, Iowa DOT worked with a committee that included the Iowa Department of Education, Iowa Public Transit Association, and Iowa Pupil Transportation Association. The group agreed to establish standards for driver qualification and training, vehicles, safety equipment, maintenance, and operating policies. There were minor issues that needed to be worked out in each of these areas, but the primary point of contention was over the vehicle standards. The school industry representatives mostly took the position that students could only be safely transported in a yellow school bus, while the transit community felt that transit vehicles could provide an equivalent level of safety. After considerable discussion, it came out that-- although a few Iowa transit systems were using some standard 15-passenger vans that everyone agreed were less safe--the transit systems had for many years voluntarily incorporated many school bus safety standards into their specifications for both modified vans and light-duty (bodyon-van-chassis) buses. This included the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) for vehicle rollover, joint strength and fuel system integrity. Nearly all Iowa transit vehicles bought since at least 1990, and many from before that, had been built to meet these standards in addition to all the normal safety standards for commercial buses. The primary differences then between transit buses and school buses are seating, color scheme, and features like the lights and stop arms. Iowa law prohibits vehicles other than school buses from being painted with the ""school bus yellow"" color scheme, and also prevents them from being equipped with stop arms and strobe lights like a school bus. On the seating issue, the school industry representatives preferred the school bus style seating which is highly padded and closely placed. The transit community pointed out this style of seats makes it difficult to serve adult riders comfortably. They also pointed to the benefits of training young persons in the use of seat and shoulder belts since they are standard safety equipment in all other types of vehicles and are now even starting to be required on school buses in some parts of the country. In the end, it was decided that regional public transit vehicles carrying students could either be equipped with school bus seating complying with FMVSS 222 or with standard seating, and crash protection/ seatbelt systems complying with FMVSS 207, 208, 209 and 210. One additional provision agreed to was that each new regional transit vehicle will be purchased with a rear emergency exit door. Although transit vehicles have emergency egress windows, and some also have escape roof hatches, the inclusion of rear emergency exit doors on all transit vehicles used for student transportation would be an added safety feature similar to what is used on many school buses in Iowa. Among the other new features of the rule were requirements to add to the driver training curricula, course work which would match up with annual school bus training sessions, and to have vehicles inspected twice a year by the Iowa Department of Education to ensure compliance with the vehicle and safety equipment parts of the rule. Now that Iowa regional transit systems have gotten through the first year under the rule with only minor friction over scheduling of inspections and definitions of compliant first aid kits, there is a real desire to see whether the Iowa model can be used in other parts of the country. Iowa DOT's Office of Public Transit staff were asked to make presentations concerning Iowa's student transportation rule at two recent national conferences for community transportation providers and for state departments of transportation. Participants in these conferences expressed considerable interest in seeing the federal rules on Head Start transportation changed to something more in line with Iowa's rule, particularly with regard to the vehicle requirements. (Head Start's current rule requires use of either school buses or ""alternative vehicles"" which are school buses without yellow coloring, stop arms and strobes, but with the high floors and the close-spaced school bus seating.)  10   CONNECTIONS  August  2001  Transit training library Feature video ""Safe Transport of the Public Under ADA"" A good video that can be used as part of your safety and education program for drivers is ""Safe Transport of the Public Under ADA."" In 1990 the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) became law. ADA promotes equal opportunities and access to persons with disabilities in five major areas: employment, public services, public accommodations, telecommunications, and transportation. For transportation, this includes both public and private. This video covers topics such as: safe transportation with courtesy and respect; and working with passengers with mobility, communication, visual or other impairments. The program addresses some of the ADA requirements for public transportation and what passengers can expect in regard to assistance. The primary focus of this video is to remind everyone to ""just ask"" the rider if they need assistance. They will tell you what kind of assistance, if any, is needed. It also helps viewers obtain a greater awareness of obstacles facing persons with disabilities. There are opportunities to stop the tape for discussion or practice at various intervals. ""Safe Transport of the Public Under ADA"" is produced by University Research Corp. and Take One Productions for the Rural Transit Assistance Program (RTAP), Federal Transit Administration, U.S. DOT. The Office of Public Transit has a large selection of training resources available to loan at no charge to public transit systems and other passenger transportation providers.

It also incorporates guidance that FTA has issued administratively, or as a result of court rulings, since the testing programs were initially required. The proposed rule would affect all passenger transportation providers who received funding, either directly or indirectly, from FTA. Other agencies providing passenger transportation, but not receiving FTA funding, are subject to similar rules from Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). FTA also proposes changes to conform FTA's rule to the U.S. Department of Transportation's revised drug and alcohol testing rules promulgated at 49 CFR Part 40 and published Dec. 19, 2000. This change would make several aspects of FTA's rule more like that from FMCSA. The FTA proposal can be found in the April 30, 2001, Federal Register. Comments received from the public can be viewed electronically at http://dms.dot.gov/search/. FTA expects to issue its final rule quickly so that it can go into effect Aug. 1 to coincide with the effective date for a number of new procedural changes related to drug and alcohol testing done for all transportation providers, including those regulated by both FTA and FMCSA. Providers who receive FTA funding should watch for FTA's final rule. The Office of Public Transit will try to get word out via our electronic ""Transit Updates"" as soon as the final rule is published. All of the rules referenced here are part of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). FTA's existing rules are found at 49 CRF Part 653 and Part 654. The new FTA rule will be 49 CFR Part 655. FMC SA's existing rule is found at 49 CFR Part 382. The common procedural requirements are found at 49 CFR Part 40.

GX238-63-1829144	"Opportunity Opportunity  Public Transportation: Wherever Life Takes You  Public transportation creates a wealth of new opportunities for individuals and communities. It is a catalyst for economic and social opportunities that help make America more efficient and productive.  FACT: Public Transportation Provides Economic Opportunities. A transit coalition report, ""Dollars & Sense: The Economic Case for Public Transportation in America,"" found that every dollar taxpayers invest in public transportation generates $6 or more in economic returns. Transit capital investment is a significant source of job creation. Economic studies show that 314 jobs are created for each $10 million invested in transit capital funding and over 570 jobs are created for each $10 million invested in the short run. A $10 million investment in public transportation results in a $30 million gain in sales for local businesses (three times the public sector investment in transit capital). For every $10 million invested in public transportation, over $15 million is saved in transportation costs to both highway and transit users. Business output is positively affected by transit investment. A sustained program of transit capital investment will generate an increase of $2 million in business output. After 20 years, these benefits increase to $31 million. On average, a typical state/local government could realize a 4 to 16 percent gain in revenues due to the increases in income and employment generated by investments in transit.  FACT: Public Transportation Enhances Personal Opportunities. American families spent 18 percent of household spending on transportation, making it the second largest household expenditure after housing. Public transportation can significantly reduce the amount of money a family spends getting to work, school and other activities. The high cost of driving, insuring and parking a car results in a reduction in individual economic opportunities. It can make it hard for many to access high quality and high paying jobs. Public transportation provides an affordable, and for many, necessary alternative to driving. A sustained program of transit capital investment will generate an increase of $800,000 in personal income for each $10 million in the first year. After 20 years, these benefits increase to $18 million for personal income.  FACT: Public Transportation Expands Community Opportunities. Each year, public transportation systems across the country engage in community-based activities to introduce new riders to the system and say thank you to their employees, customers and communities. Public transportation systems work to become part of community residents' culture and lifestyle. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority hosted a ""late night concert"" in Washington's Adams Morgan neighborhood to promote its new late night weekend service and the new Metrobus shuttle that serves the area. Public transportation systems take an active role in promoting community issues. As part of the Annapolis, Maryland, ""Try Transit Week"" celebration, ""McGruff,"" the crime fighting dog, and ""Sparky,"" the fire dog, joined Annapolis police and firefighters on board a transit bus.   Other public transportation systems throughout North America have sponsored ""Try Transit Weeks"" with promotional events that have included: > Giveaways and prize drawings available to bus riders in Riverside, California; > An expanded multi-media marketing campaign to promote Connecticut's statewide toll-free transit information number; > Ten cent rides to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Santa Clarita Transit system in California; > ""Try Transit Festival"" and ""Customer Appreciation Day"" celebrations at New Jersey Transit rail stations and bus terminals sponsored by the New Jersey Transit Corporation; > Three days of free rides, specially-designed T-shirts for drivers, and refreshments for riders in Owensboro, Kentucky; > A week of special events in Springfield, Missouri including free rides and refreshments, and finger-painting for children; > Special promotions from the Stark Area Regional Transit Authority in Canton, Ohio, including discounted fares for senior citizens, special fares for two riders traveling together, lunches for the public, and a children's essay contest; > Free ""Dash About"" shuttle service and other promotional activities sponsored by the Alexandria Transit Company in Virginia.   Access Public Transportation: Wherever Life Takes You  Access Public transportation makes it possible for millions of people to access work, school, medical appointments and other everyday activities. It also provides access to new opportunities by fostering communities where people can drive less and walk more, by providing greater access to community events, and by meeting the needs of all citizens, particularly those who do not drive.  FACT: Public Transportation Helps People Get Where They Need to Go Everyday. Every weekday, public transportation takes an estimated 14 million people where they need to go. Work is the most popular destination with 54 percent of all trips ending at workplaces. Next, 15 percent of trips go to schools; 9 percent to shop; 9 percent to social visits; and 5.5 percent to medical appointments. Public transportation provides valuable options for suburban commuters who work in the city. In fact, the average annual income of rail commuters is more than $50,000 and most own two cars. Public transportation is a key force in moving former welfare recipients into the workforce as permanent wage earners. APTA's 1999 ""Access to Work Best Practices Survey"" revealed that an estimated 94 percent of welfare recipients attempting to move into the workforce rely on public transportation. Under the current $75 million federal ""Access To Jobs"" initiative, public transportation systems around the nation work with state and local agencies to identify and assess mobility needs and to improve employment accessibility. These new and expanded services will provide access to jobs for 8 million households without a car.  FACT: Public Transportation Helps All Community Members Stay Active, Mobile and Involved. Public transportation customers are diverse: People age 65 or older represent 7 percent of riders; 18 years and younger, 10 percent; women, 52 percent; White, 45 percent; African-American, 31 percent; Hispanic, 18 percent; and Asian and Native Americans, 6 percent. Eighty-three percent of older persons surveyed by AARP state that they want to remain independent as they age. Without public transportation, many seniors would be unable to move around the community to visit friends, get groceries or see the doctor. Printing large type and Braille maps and guides, providing reduced fares, and offering door-to-door van service allows those who are unable to drive to easily reach transit stations. Two-thirds of U.S. public transportation agencies provide service designed to meet the needs of senior citizens and persons with disabilities.  FACT: Public Transportation Provides Access to More Events and Activities, Creating Stronger Community Bonds. Public transportation makes it possible for people to live in all types of areas, including urban downtown areas, without owning a vehicle. Public transportation helps to preserve open spaces, enhancing a community's appearance while conserving recreational places where families spend time together. Public transportation provides convenient service to popular family and community events such as concerts and baseball games. Public transportation allows for the creation of ""pedestrian-only"" zones and other open spaces for community residents to enjoy and share. It means less noise and fewer cars traveling through pedestrian neighborhoods.   Choice  Public Transportation: Wherever Life Takes You  Choice Public transportation is an essential part of a balanced transportation system that includes buses, trains, walkways, bicycle paths, air service and highways. Every day transit allows Americans from every walk of life to make decisions that improve the quality of their lives, such as shortening commute times to spend more time with their families, doing their part to improve air quality, or avoiding dangerous driving situations.  FACT: Public Transportation Reduces Traffic Congestion and Lessens Commute Time. Drivers in one-third of U.S. cities studied by the Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) spent more than 40 hours a year -- an entire work week -- in traffic that was stopped dead. In one half of the 68 cities studied by TTI, drivers spent at least half as much time in traffic as they did on vacation each year. Traffic isn't just a problem in big cities. Roads and highways in small-to-medium size cities, as well as larger metropolitan areas are jammed across the nation. Building more roads isn't always the answer to this growing problem. Each of the cities in the TTI study would require an average of 37 more lane miles to keep pace with just one year of increased traffic demand. Public transportation takes drivers off the road and eases congestion for everyone. It also offers drivers a reliable, inexpensive and efficient transportation option. Recent public opinion polls sponsored by the Transit Cooperative Research Program suggest that 57 percent of people do not feel their commute will get better over the next three years, and nearly a quarter (24 percent) feel they will spend more time commuting. Public transportation offers a choice to Americans concerned about increasing commute times.  FACT: Public Transportation Allows People to Walk More, Stress Less. Walking more every day -- even if it is the short distance to the bus stop -- is good for a person's overall health. Using public transportation can eliminate the stress of driving in over-crowded, aggressive and even dangerous conditions. Stress is often a factor in a myriad of health problems.  FACT: Public Transportation Helps People Breathe Easier. Every year, public transportation prevents the emission of more than 126 million pounds of hydrocarbons, which cause smog, and 156 million pounds of nitrogen oxides, which can cause respiratory illness. Taking public transit to work every day instead of driving alone eliminates 3,300 pounds of vehicle exhaust emissions and pollutants every year. In 1999, public transportation vehicles used nearly 856 million gallons of fossil fuels and 5.2 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity -- less than 1 percent of all energy consumed in the U.S.   FACT: Public Transportation Helps People Avoid Dangerous Situations. Each year an estimated 284,000 distracted drivers are involved in serious accidents, according to the University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center. Public transportation offers drivers distracted by things such as cell phones, radio, and passengers with a reliable transportation option when they do not feel they can drive. Alcohol-related traffic deaths are on the rise. In 2000, 16,653 people were killed in accidents involving alcohol, representing 40 percent of the 41,821 people killed in all traffic crashes, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Public transportation helps to keep dangerous drivers off the road by providing a needed transportation choice. Aggressive driving has steadily increased by 7 percent every year since 1990, according to the American Automobile Association's Foundation for Traffic Safety. In a 2000 Highway Traffic Safety Administration study of 6000 drivers, 62 percent said the behavior of another driver has been a threat to them in the last year. Public transportation gives drivers concerned about aggressive driving access to other forms of transportation.   Freedom  Public Transportation: Wherever Life Takes You  Freedom Public transportation provides Americans with freedom to live their lives, pursue opportunities, make choices, and enjoy greater access and mobility. It helps create neighborhoods that are strong, an environment that is clean, and an economy that is prosperous. Ensuring this freedom requires safety and security. That is why every public transportation system in America has made the safety and security of passengers a top priority.  FACT: Public Transportation Gives People the Freedom to Go Wherever Life Takes Them. Public transportation use has increased 21 percent since 1995. In 2000, Americans took 9.4 billion trips using public transportation, an increase of 3.5 percent from the previous year -- the equivalent of more than a million new trips each day. During the same year, ridership grew twice as fast as the U.S. population and outpaced growth in other travel modes, including roads and airports. An estimated 14 million Americans ride public transportation each weekday and an additional 25 million use it on a less frequent but regular basis.  FACT: Public Transportation Provides the Freedom to Live and Work in Strong, Safe and Clean Communities. Public transportation helps people to create communities with strong job markets, thriving local businesses and expanding economies. It provides communities with new freedom in planning for future growth. Public transportation fosters community pride and spirit. People who take public transportation walk to the bus stop together. They get to know each other face-to-face on the train and they establish stronger ties to the community. Public transportation leads to cleaner air for everyone to breathe and fosters healthy habits and choices.  FACT: Public Transportation is Focused on Maintaining Freedom by Providing Security. Every major public transportation authority has comprehensive emergency plans in place. Public transportation employees receive routine disaster and emergency training, and work closely with fire and rescue crews, police and sheriff 's departments, and local power companies. Most large transit systems have their own specially-trained police forces. For nearly 20 years, APTA safety programs and related safety management audits have been helping America's public transportation systems institute security and safety precautions and plan for unpredictable crises. During 1999 - 2000, a record 53 public transportation systems participated in the rail, commuter rail or bus safety audit programs offered by APTA. These comprehensive programs examine all areas of operation to ensure the safety of passengers. The Federal Transit Administration and the Department of Transportation's (DOT) Office of Intelligence and Security work hand in hand with APTA on coordinating all of its safety programs and safety management audits.  FACT: Public Transportation is Ready to Protect Freedoms by Responding to New Challenges. To ensure that federal, state and local agencies are coordinating efforts to increase security and prepare for emergencies, U.S. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta created the National Infrastructure Security Committee (NISC). The Committee brings together the transportation industry, labor unions and the government to examine current security systems, set national standards, and ensure a high level of protection for all transportation assets.   Some major public transportation systems, including those in Washington, DC and Boston, are preparing to sound the first alert on bio-terrorist attacks or chemical accidents by readying state of the art scanners and detectors for their systems. After September 11, 2001, public transportation systems responded immediately to protect riders by instituting critical safety measures, making security personnel more visible, and removing trash receptacles where potentially dangerous packages could be hidden.  FACT: Public Transportation is Vital to America's Safety and Defense. On September 11, 2001, and the days that followed, public transportation in America showed that it is ready to assist when a crisis strikes a community. This isn't the first time public transportation has lent a helping hand in times of crisis. Public transportation has proven time and again that it is a vital resource for everyone in the community and a critical part of America's national defense and our country's freedom. Below are some recent examples of how public transportation has responded to crises: September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks New York: The Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) train system in New York, which ran under the World Trade Center complex, put in place an emergency response plan on the morning of September 11. This plan helped evacuate passengers from the complex and saved thousands of lives with no reported injuries. Public transportation was also used to transport rescue workers quickly and efficiently. Similar responses by the New York MTA services also saved lives. Washington, DC: Public transportation systems provided buses to transport those injured at the attack on the Pentagon to area hospitals. The Metrorail system operated at rush hour levels all day, transporting people out of downtown and away from areas near the Pentagon. Nationwide: When air service was suspended, transit systems throughout the country evacuated people from airports in major cities, including San Francisco, CA, Portland, OR, Denver, CO, Chicago, IL, St. Louis, MO, Atlanta, GA, Little Rock, AR and Boston, MA. Hurricane Floyd Local transit systems across North Carolina offered direct assistance to the victims of Hurricane Floyd in September 1999 by evacuating and rescuing hundreds of residents during and after the hurricane. Michigan Gas Explosion In November 1999, the Mass Transportation Authority of Flint, Michigan successfully evacuated residents and employees of a senior citizens housing complex after a gas explosion destroyed the facility. Calgary Oil Plant Fire In August 1999, Calgary Transit provided immediate and vital assistance to evacuate residents of southeast Calgary when a nearby oil recycling plant was consumed by fire after more than 40 explosions erupted at the site. Volusia County Wildfires In 1998, public transportation provided invaluable service in the Daytona Beach, Florida area when parts of Volusia County were ravaged by wildfires. Public transportation vehicles operated around the clock to transport firefighters to the site of the wildfires; to evacuate nursing homes, adult day care facilities, and hospitals; and to bring out-of-town firefighters from the airport.   The Campaign  Public Transportation: Wherever Life Takes You  ""Public Transportation: Wherever Life Takes You"" A Public Awareness and Education Campaign What Is the ""Public Transportation: Wherever Life Takes You"" Campaign? Public transportation organizations and corporations across the country formed Public Transportation Partnership for Tomorrow (PT) 2 to launch the ""Public Transportation: Wherever Life Takes You"" campaign. ""Public Transportation: Wherever Life Takes You"" is a nationwide education and outreach initiative designed to strengthen support for public transportation among the public and local, state and federal officials in order to positively impact funding decisions. The ""Public Transportation: Wherever Life Takes You"" campaign will educate the public about the many benefits public transportation provides to individuals and communities. By helping the American public to appreciate the full value and broad range of advantages, (PT) 2 partners hope to build broader support for increased investment and pro-public transportation policies.  Why Now? Public transportation is undergoing a resurgence -- ridership and federal funding are currently at a 40-year all-time high. Throughout the country, improvements are being made in service and in expanding public transportation options. Despite the great progress that has been made, perceptions of public transportation have not kept pace with the improvements. If public transportation is going to continue playing an important role in helping increase mobility, reduce congestion and improve the quality of life, private citizens and elected officials need to better understand how public transportation benefits everyone and builds stronger communities. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), which was enacted in June 1998, provides $41 billion over six years to transit systems in local communities and states throughout the country. In 2003, TEA-21 and its significant investment in public transportation will expire. Congress will need to reauthorize this vital program, which can benefit all communities. As Congress and the Administration deliberate on the extension of TEA-21 programs and funding levels, the ""Public Transportation: Wherever Life Takes You"" campaign will help build awareness and encourage support.  What's the Campaign's Message? The campaign will emphasize the American values that characterize the personal benefits of public transportation: opportunity, choice, access and freedom. These elements enable people to accomplish what is important to them, making communities stronger and more vibrant for riders and non-riders alike.  What Activities Will the Campaign Undertake? The ""Public Transportation: Wherever Life Takes You"" campaign includes the following activities: National and Local Advertising Print, radio and cable and local television will be used to motivate interest and action on the topic of public transportation among stakeholders. Venues include network cable television such as Fox News Channel, CNN, CNBC, MSNBC, and national magazines such as Money, Time and Smithsonian. Policy Research A strong base of information and policy research will be developed to provide statistics and facts to make public transportation's story compelling to opinion leaders. Advocacy and Coalition Building Activities will be initiated at the state and local levels by local transit coalitions. These coalitions will collaborate with other important interest groups to build support among key constituencies. Efforts will also focus on building coalitions among interest groups in key public transportation markets.   ""Public Transportation: Wherever Life Takes You"" Website A new Web site, www.publictransportation.org, has been created to help disseminate ongoing information about the ""Public Transportation: Wherever Life Takes You"" campaign and important transportation issues to public transit authorities and local coalitions, opinion leaders, government officials, the media and the public.  American Public Transportation Association (APTA) The (PT)2 campaign was conceived and implemented by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA), a non-profit international association of more than 1,400 organizations responsible for planning, designing, constructing, financing and operating public transportation systems. APTA members also include business organizations that supply products and services to the public transportation industry, as well as academic institutions, state associations, metropolitan planning organizations and departments of transportation. APTA members serve more than 90 percent of people who use public transportation in the United States and Canada. APTA's mission is to serve and lead its diverse membership through advocacy, innovation and information sharing to strengthen and expand public transportation.

Public transportation includes all multiple occupancy vehicle services designed to transport customers on local and regional routes. These services include: private and public buses; trolleybuses; vanpools; jitneys; demand response services; heavy and light rail; commuter rail; automated guideway transit; inclined plane; cable cars; monorails; tramways; and ferryboats.  Who Uses Public Transportation? Public transportation customers are diverse: People age 65 or older represent 7 percent of riders; 18 years and younger, 10 percent; women, 52 percent; White, 45 percent; African-American, 31 percent; Hispanic, 18 percent; and Asian and Native Americans, 6 percent. In 2000, Americans took 9.4 billion trips using public transportation, an increase of 3.5 percent from the previous year -- the equivalent of more than a million new trips each day. During the same year, ridership grew twice as fast as the U.S. population and outpaced growth in other travel modes. An estimated 14 million Americans ride public transportation each weekday and an additional 25 million use it on a less frequent but regular basis.  Where Do People Go on Public Transportation? Work is the most popular destination with 54 percent of all trips ending at workplaces. Next, 15 percent of trips go to schools; 9 percent to shop; 9 percent to social visits; and 5.5 percent to medical appointments.  How Many Public Transportation Providers Are There? There are approximately 6,000 public transportation systems operating in the United States and Canada, with the majority of these agencies operating more than one type of service. Many agencies typically contract additional services with private operators, further increasing the number of total public transportation providers.  How Large is the Public Transportation Industry? In 2000, America's public transportation systems employed 350,000 workers to operate, maintain and manage all modes of transit. A full 50 percent of this workforce serve as operators or conductors. In addition, 10,000 - 20,000 professionals work under contract to public transportation systems or are employed by companies and government offices that support these systems. The public transportation fleet is comprised of 129,000 vehicles in active service with the majority (58 percent) being buses.  How Much Energy Does Public Transportation Use -- and Save? In 1999, public transportation vehicles used 856 million gallons of fossil fuels and 5.2 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity -- which is less than 1 percent of all energy consumed in the U.S. Among fossil fuels, diesel ranks first and is used primarily by buses, but vehicles also use gasoline, compressed natural gas, propane, and liquefied natural gas. Most electricity (65 percent) is consumed by heavy rail vehicles, as well as commuter rail (25 percent) and light rail (8 percent).   Benefits  Public Transportation: Wherever Life Takes You  Benefits of Public Transportation: What We All Gain While transit clearly benefits those who use it, even larger benefits accrue to all citizens in the form of economic development, reduced congestion, more livable communities and cleaner air.  Stimulates Economic Development A transit coalition report, ""Dollars & Sense: The Economic Case for Public Transportation in America,"" found that every dollar taxpayers invest in public transportation generates $6 or more in economic returns. Every $10 million in capital investment in public transportation yields $30 million in increased sales. Every $10 million in operating investment yields $32 million in increased sales.  Saves Money It's more cost efficient to use public transportation, particularly in business and urban areas. For every $10 million invested in public transportation, more than $15 million is saved in transportation costs to both highway and public transportation users. According to the American Automobile Association, the estimated cost of driving a single-occupant vehicle is between $4,826 (for a small car) and $9,685 (for a large car), depending upon mileage. By contrast, the annual average cost for public transportation for one adult ranges from $200 to $2,000, depending upon mileage, time of day, type of vehicle or service.  Creates Jobs In addition to the 350,000 people directly employed by public transportation systems, thousands of others are employed in related support services (i.e., engineering, manufacturing, construction, retail, etc.). For every $10 million invested in capital projects for public transportation, more than 300 jobs and a $30 million gain in sales for business are realized.  Gets People To Work Public transportation is key to moving former welfare recipients into the workforce as permanent wage earners. An estimated 94 percent of welfare recipients attempting to move into the workforce do not own cars and rely on public transportation. The current $75 million federal ""Access To Jobs"" initiative provides grants to transit service providers to help low income residents get to work by providing transportation choices. Another $500 million for these programs is guaranteed by law for a five-year period. Public transportation provides valuable options for suburban commuters who work in the city. In fact, the average annual income of rail commuters is more than $50,000 and most own two cars.  Eases Traffic Congestion Nearly half of all Americans believe traffic is a serious problem where they live. Most (57 percent) do not feel their commute will improve over the next three years, and nearly a quarter expect to spend more time commuting. According to the Texas Transportation Institute (TTI), car drivers spent more than 40 hours last year stuck in traffic in onethird of the cities studied. Half the drivers spent the same amount of time stuck in traffic as they did on vacation, according to the same TTI study. These findings apply to small, medium and large cities. Public transportation helps to alleviate our nation's crowded network of roads by providing transportation choices.   Without transportation choices, there would be 64,413 more cars on the road in New Orleans, 167,061 more cars on San Diego roads, and 2,610,280 more cars on New York City roads, according to the Sierra Club. In Portland, Oregon, a study by the Sierra Club showed that when more transportation options are offered, people use their cars less, thereby cutting traffic by 6 percent and traffic delays by 66 percent.  Fosters More Livable Communities Public transportation facilities and corridors are natural focal points for economic and social activities. These activities help create strong neighborhood centers that are more economically stable, safe and productive. Studies have shown that the ability to travel in an area conveniently, without a car, is an important component of a community's livability. Public transportation provides opportunity, access, choice and freedom, all of which contribute to an improved quality of life. For example, Salt Lake City's new TRAX system has achieved nearly 20,000 daily riders since 1999 (41 percent of whom are new to transit), thereby helping to revitalize the downtown area by attracting new businesses, a community center, ice-skating rink and amphitheater.  Boosts Real Estate Values Public transportation fuels local development and in turn has a positive impact on local property values. Studies have shown greater increases in the value of properties located near public transportation systems than in similar properties not located near public transportation.  Improves Air Quality Public transportation helps promote cleaner air by reducing automobile use, which can exacerbate smog and public health problems. Each year, public transportation use avoids the emission of more than 126 million pounds of hydrocarbons, a primary cause of smog, and 156 million pounds of nitrogen oxides, which can cause respiratory disease. For each mile traveled, fewer pollutants are emitted by transit vehicles than by a single-passenger automobile. (Buses emit 80 percent less carbon monoxide than a car; rail, almost none.) According to the Sierra Club, 7 of the 12 cities with the highest grades for low car and truck smog per person (New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Sacramento and Washington, DC) are located in the states that spend the most on clean transportation choices, demonstrating the power of public transit as a tool to combat air pollution.  Reduces Energy Consumption Public transportation can significantly reduce dependency on gasoline, reducing auto fuel consumption by 1.5 billion gallons annually. For example, a person who commutes 60 miles each way daily could save an estimated 1,888 gallons of gasoline every year by switching from using a car to using public transportation. Many U.S. transit systems are continuing to invest in compressed natural gas, low-sulfur burning buses or diesel-electric hybrid buses.  Ensures Safety Public transportation continues to be one of the safest modes of travel in the United States. Riding a transit bus is 91 times safer than car travel. By train, passengers are 15 times safer. Every major public transportation system participates in annual safety audit programs that examine all areas of operation. Transit vehicle operators are highly trained to anticipate and avoid problems. Most transit vehicles are larger, newer and more substantial than autos or vans.  Enhances Mobility During Emergencies During many types of crises, both natural and man-made, people rely on public transportation. On September 11, 2001, the New York-New Jersey Port Authority transit systems moved people safely away from the Twin Towers disaster. Public transportation systems have operated around the clock to transport firefighters to the sites of wildfires; to evacuate nursing homes and hospitals; to move people to safety during storms; and to bring out-of-town police and rescue workers from the airport.   Funding  Public Transportation: Wherever Life Takes You  Public Transportation Funding: Who Pays for What Who Pays For Public Transportation? Public transportation is funded through two main sources: capital funds and operating fees. Capital funds finance infrastructure needs such as new construction and rehabilitation of existing facilities. The federal government contributes 44 percent of these funds, but this portion can be as high as 80 percent for some projects. The balance is made up of a combination of state and local government funds, with states contributing 10 percent and local governments, 13 percent. In 1999, public transportation received a total of $9 billion in capital funds from all sources. Operating funds provide income for operating expenses. Approximately 74 percent of these funds come from local sources. Passenger fares comprise 37 percent; local governments, 20 percent; and non-government agencies and taxes, tolls and fees, 16 percent. State and federal governments contribute 22 percent and 4 percent respectively. In 1999, an adult passenger paid an average of $1.09 per base fare.  Operating Expenses  How Much Does Government Contribute in Total? In fiscal year 2002, the fifth year of funding under the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), the federal government will invest $6.7 billion in public transportation. Total public expenditures (federal, state and local) to operate, maintain and invest in public transit systems in the United States have totaled $15.4 billion each year for the past four years.  46% 24% 12% 9% 9%  Salaries and Wages Fringe Benefits Purchased Transportation Fuel & Supplies Services, Utilities, Insurance & Other  How Is the Money Spent? For 1999 capital expenses: facilities cost 52 percent; vehicles, 36 percent; and equipment and services, 12 percent. Of these categories, heavy rail expenses accounted for 30 percent; bus, 36 percent; commuter rail, 18 percent, and light rail, 11 percent. For 1999 operating expenses: salaries and wages cost 46 percent; benefits, 26 percent; purchased transportation, 12 percent; and fuel and supplies, 9 percent. Services, utilities, insurance and other costs make up the balance. In 1999, public transportation spent $20.5 billion on operating expenses.  Operating Funds  Why Is More Funding Necessary? Public transportation usage is expected to experience the sharpest growth of any form of transportation this decade. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) reports that improvements to transit bus and rail facilities are not keeping up with the strain placed on systems by increased ridership. ASCE says public transportation spending must increase by 41 percent just to maintain current conditions. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, in today's dollars, $17 billion in capital investment is needed annually to maintain and improve performance of the nation's transit systems. 37% 22% 20% 17% 4%  Passenger Fares State Government Local Governments Non-Government & Transit Taxes Federal Government"
GX012-14-7398458	"WHAT IS THE XBL?      If you have questions or comments about the XBL, please call the customer connection line at 1-800-221-9903 weekdays, 10 am-4 pm, or Click on feedback in the navigation bar to your left.        The XBL (Exclusive Bus Lane) is a dedicated contra-flow bus lane that operates weekday mornings between 6:15 a.m. and approximately 10:00 a.m.  The XBL is part of a network of transportation facilities that includes the New Jersey Turnpike, the Lincoln Tunnel and the Port Authority Bus Terminal.  The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is responsible for the daily operation, maintenance and traffic enforcement of the lane from the point at which buses merge from the north and south, known as the ""teardrop,"" through the Lincoln Tunnel and into the Port Authority Bus Terminal.   The XBL's purpose is to facilitate the use of mass transportation.  In fact, commuting by bus has become so popular that the XBL is now operating at maximum capacity.  Each day approximately 1700 buses, carrying more than 60,000 commuters, use the XBL.  This amounts to approximately 419,000 buses annually carrying over 15 million passengers.     DID YOU KNOW   The XBL was the first contra-flow bus lane on a U.S. highway.  Since 1970, similar lanes have opened in our region and in other states.  The XBL was initially designed as a coordinated effort among The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, The New Jersey Turnpike Authority and The New Jersey Department of Transportation.  Following the successful completion of the first year, the XBL became a permanent operation under the jurisdiction of The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.   The XBL is 2.5 miles long and must be set up daily to prepare for the morning rush. Operation and maintenance of the XBL requires a highly coordinated effort and a consistent starting time to ensure reliability and safety.  Lane set up begins at 4 a.m. and includes positioning over 575 traffic delineators in place to mark the lane.  All overhead traffic devices are checked each morning to ensure that motorists can identify which lanes are available.   Access to the XBL is limited to buses with a seating capacity of sixteen or more passengers.  To ensure safety, reduce lane overload and maximize mass transportation capacity, access to the XBL is limited to regular ""for hire"" public buses.  School buses, vans, taxis, limousines and other multiple-occupancy vehicles are prohibited.   All empty buses are prohibited from entering the XBL during its entire period of operation. This restriction allows the maximum utilization of the XBL operation for peak period commuters.   Non-commuter charter buses are not allowed access to the XBL during peak period operating times. Charter Buses are only allowed in the XBL after 9:00 a.m., which is past the peak commuter hours.   All buses using the XBL must have US Department of Transportation operating authority.   Buses using the XBL must be equipped with E-ZPass.  This requirement has helped facilitate traffic flow.   The XBL keeps some 10,000 cars off the road each day, easing congestion and improving air quality.     FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS    WHAT CAUSES DELAYS AND CONGESTION IN THE XBL?   The XBL is part of a large and complex transportation network and disruption on any part negatively impacts the entire system.  For example, if an incident on the northbound New Jersey Turnpike causes delays to northbound traffic during the morning rush, vehicles will backup along westbound Route 495.  This backup will quickly reach the westbound Lincoln Tunnel, delaying traffic in New York.  As soon as the Lincoln Tunnel is impacted, empty buses are no longer able to exit the Port Authority Bus Terminal.  If empty buses cannot exit, full buses cannot enter.   A strong economy and increased overall traffic are contributing factors to XBL congestion.  From 1996 to 1998, we experienced a 4.9% increase in bus activity at the Lincoln Tunnel.  While the average number of buses using the XBL daily is 1680, the number of days of high demand has grown substantially.  In 1998, nearly one-third of the days the XBL served more than 1700 buses - only 3% of the days in 1995 experienced these volumes.    HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO CLEAR A BUS BREAKDOWN IN THE XBL?   Our goal is to identify and remove disabled buses from the XBL in less than ten minutes.  Most of the time this goal is accomplished.  Closed circuit television is used to monitor the XBL and staff is strategically placed along the route to respond to stoppages.  However, due to the extraordinary demand on the XBL, even a minor stoppage that is removed quickly can cause substantial residual delays.  For example, a single disabled bus stopped in the XBL for 10 minutes at 7:40 a.m. could easily cause residual delays of up to one-half hour for buses arriving at 8:40 a.m.    This condition is known as the ""accordion effect"" and results from the compression of buses stopping behind the disabled vehicle.  Buses will compress, lining up ""nose to end.""  When the disabled bus is removed, buses slowly start separating apart.  Given the slow acceleration characteristics of buses and the merge at the teardrop, the accordion effect impacts buses that arrive after a stoppage.    DO YOU REROUTE BUSES IF THERE IS A PROBLEM IN THE XBL?   We do reroute buses into the regular eastbound lane if clearance of an incident or disabled bus is expected to be lengthy.  With the technology we have available at this time, the length of a delay cannot be easily predicted, making it difficult to determine whether rerouting to the eastbound roadway is better than staying in the XBL.  However, we are presently installing new traffic monitoring systems that will allow us to make more precise routing decisions.   Also, bus drivers always have the option of using the regular eastbound roadway if there is a problem in the XBL.    WHERE CAN BUSES EXIT THE XBL?   There are two exits located in the XBL. One is at the beginning of the XBL where buses from the north and south merge.  The other is across from the entrance to Route 3 West.  However, once your bus passes this point, your driver will not be able to exit the XBL to take another route.  We cannot add more exit areas because the barriers that separate the XBL from opposing traffic cannot be removed.  Any openings or breaches of the divider would pose serious traffic safety hazards.   BUSES FROM THE NORTH (NJ Turnpike Interchange 17E and Route 3) MERGE TWICE TO ENTER THE XBL, WHILE BUSES FROM THE SOUTH (Interchange 16E) ONLY MERGE ONCE.  WHY IS THIS NECESSARY?   Unfortunately, geography and the lack of available space prevent elimination of the double merge.  However, we are presently investigating the feasibility of a new traffic metering system for the merge points.  This system uses traffic signals to control the flow of merging buses.  Traffic metering can increase traffic flow and reduce delays.    WHAT IS BEING DONE TO IMPROVE THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC IN THE XBL?   Our challenge is to find effective solutions to help maintain an efficient flow of buses into Manhattan and the Port Authority is working hard to meet that challenge.  We are installing electronic readers at various locations to help monitor bus movements and more accurately identify breakdowns and travel time, allowing us to make more informed routing decisions.  We are also planning an Intelligent Transportation System for the Lincoln Tunnel that will integrate traffic management functions and automate activities such as incident detection, customer information and inter-agency coordination.  Such approaches will help us manage the XBL as reliably and efficiently as possible.   We are currently discussing bus maintenance practices with bus carriers in an effort to minimize breakdowns that cause delays.  We are also discussing improvements in communication of delay information.  Along with The New Jersey Turnpike Authority, New Jersey Transit and The New Jersey Department of Transportation, the Port Authority is working to find ways to reduce congestion and expand capacity in the XBL and connecting roadways.  Some options will involve minor operational improvements, while others may involve more extensive physical improvements.  The objective is to immediately address the challenges of increased demand, while advancing solutions that will secure the effectiveness of mass transportation well into the future.  We will keep you informed of our progress.  Thank you for using mass transit."
GX235-98-15597330	This page last updated: 06/26/2000          Much has been written about global warming and how much private vehicles         contribute to air pollution. One of the best alternatives to using a         private vehicle is public mass transit. Using mass transit helps reduce         gasoline consumption and improve air quality.  Nationally, it is         estimated that traffic congestion accounts for 3 billion gallons of fuel         wasted annually!  Mass transit vehicles can also help reduce traffic         congestion considerably.                                          Public Transit Service in Baton Rouge                                      Transit service in the Baton Rouge Metropolitan Area is provided by         Capitol Transportation Corporation (CTC). CTC currently operates a fleet         of 45 passenger vehicles on 17 fixed routes ---- 6 university routes and         11 regular parish-wide routes. The regular CTC routes provide service         every 15 to 30 minutes during peak periods, and every 30 to 60 minutes         during off-peak periods. The university routes provide service while         school is in session, and headway on these routes varies from 12 to 25         minutes depending on the route and time of day. CTC also offers service         on 7 routes on Saturdays. To obtain scheduling details for particular         routes, call the CTC Information Line at (225) 336-0821.                     Fares:            The regular one-way fare is $1.25 for CTC riders. (Exact change is           required, as CTC drivers do not make change.) Students K through 12           who possess a valid ID can ride for 35 cents. Children under 5 years           of age are free.            Special Fare Structures:            Individuals may also purchase a Weekday Pass ($11.00) which is valid           Monday through Friday and good for an unlimited number of rides.           Saturday Passes may be purchased for only $1.50 and are also good for           an unlimited number of rides.                                                                             CTC LIFT                                              Under the Americans-with-Disabilities Act (ADA), persons with         disabilities are guaranteed access to all forms of public         transportation. CTC operates CTC LIFT for persons who cannot use the         regular transit service. This is a curb-to-curb service and has a fare         of $1.00. CTC LIFT is available to assist persons with work-related         commutes. Availability is determined on a first-come, first-served         basis. The ADA requires that all new vehicles purchased by CTC be         accessible to those with disabilities. This improved mobility will         better serve employee and employer alike.                                             Encouraging Transit Use                              There are two fundamental ways to encourage transit use. First, relay         the benefits of transit use to your employees in company newsletters or         through your personnel office. CTC can provide such information.          Second, encourage transit use through a subsidy program. Recent         legislation has made vanpool and transit subsidies of up to $60/month         per employee tax exempt.

GX146-60-9260868	"Hearing on ""Transit in the 21st Century: Successes and Challenges.""         Prepared Statement of The Honorable Norman Y. Mineta  Secretary of Transportation    10:00 a.m., Wednesday, March 13, 2002 - Dirksen 538       Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to speak about the implementation and reauthorization of the public transportation provisions of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st  Century (TEA-21).    With this Committees leadership, and with the active participation of our State, local and private sector partners, the Department of Transportation has worked to realize the purposes and objectives of TEA-21.  I would like to commend the Committee for continuing its leadership by scheduling this hearing on the reauthorization of TEA-21. We look forward to working with you in shaping proposals for the reauthorization of this legislation and establishing the base of resources necessary to meet the public transportation challenges facing the Nation.    Three decades ago, as Mayor of San Jose, California, I learned that the tool that made the most difference in my community was transportation.  Nothing else had as great an impact on our economic development, growth patterns, and quality of life. What I have found in the years since is that this is true not just locally, but also nationally. A safe and efficient transportation system is essential to keeping people and goods moving, and making cities and communities prosperous.  And public transportation has an important role to play in achieving these goals.    Like many members of Congress, I take great pride in the enactment of the predecessor of TEA-21, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), during my years in the House of Representatives. With that legislation we established new principles for the implementation of the Nations surface transportation programs, and built partnerships with local and State officials to advance the strategic goals for transportation capital investment.  ISTEA established flexibility in the use of funds; a commitment to strengthening the intermodal connections of the Nations transportation system; new investments in, and deployment of, information technologies for transportation services; and a heightened sensitivity to the impacts that public transportation has on our quality of life and on the shape and character of Americas communities.    TEA-21 built upon the programmatic initiatives of ISTEA, and, through its financial provisions, provided State and local governments and other transportation providers with greater certainty and stability in transportation funding. It achieved this in part through innovative financing mechanisms, including the budgetary firewalls, as well as record levels of transportation investment.     The programmatic and financial initiatives of these two historic surface transportation acts have provided us with a solid and balanced structure around which we can shape this reauthorization legislation. Yet, although we should continue and build upon ISTEA and TEA-21, we have an opportunity and an obligation to do more than that.      This is a time of extraordinary challenge and opportunity in the transportation sector.  On September 11, a determined and remorseless enemy challenged one of Americas most cherished freedoms, our freedom of movement.  The events of that day demonstrate how critical the Nations transportation system is to the freedom of every American and to the Nations security and economic well-being.  In fact, transit played a critical role at ground zero in New York City, in Washington DC, and in countless other cities across the country.  Transit systems safely transported millions of people out of harms way, as downtown areas, including New York and Washington DC, were evacuated with reliance on the quiet heroism of the Nations public transportation workers.      In shaping this surface transportation reauthorization bill, we must maximize the safety and security of all Americans, even as we enhance mobility, reduce congestion, and grow the economy.  These are not incompatible goals; indeed, the lessons of ISTEA and TEA-21 demonstrate that all are appropriate goals of national transportation policy and that they reinforce each other.  It is possible to have a transportation system that is safe and secure, efficient and productive.    TEA-21s Record    In five principal areas, TEA-21 has strengthened the Nations transportation system: the stability, equity and flexibility of funding; safety; mobility and system upgrading; the application of innovative technologies; and quality of life.    Funding Levels and Program Equity    TEA-21 revolutionized transportation funding and provided record amounts of spending for public transportation, a 50 percent increase over the period of ISTEA.  Funding of a significant share of the public transportation program came from the Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund, and the new budgetary firewalls created confidence among grantees regarding program funding.  Funding stability has been one of the most important features of TEA-21, as States and local communities have relied upon these assurances and increased their own funding levels to match the commitments made in TEA-21.     Equally important is funding flexibility, first allowed under ISTEA and continued in TEA-21.  Flexible funding allows States and communities to tailor their transportation choices to meet their unique needs, and enables State and local decision-makers to consider all transportation options and their impacts on traffic congestion, air pollution, urban sprawl, economic development, and quality of life. Indeed, since ISTEA, over $7.7 billion has been transferred from title 23 programs to public transportation programs, providing critical resources to supplement the basic public transportation authorization levels.  During the same period, less than $50 million has been transferred from transit programs to the highway programs.    TEA-21s innovative loan and grant programs have further augmented both the highway and transit programs. The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) has provided almost $3.6 billion in Federal credit assistance to eleven projects of national significance, representing $15 billion in infrastructure improvements. These loans, loan guarantees, and lines of credit for highway, transit, and rail projects have encouraged private investment to strengthen transportation infrastructure.  Public transportation projects have included support for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authoritys Capital Improvement Program, the Tren Urbano project in San Juan, and improvements to the Staten Island Ferry.    Safety and Security    The Departments paramount concern is to assure the American public that the Nation has the safest, most secure system possible, as our transportation system works to meet the needs of the American economy.  The United States has an enviable transportation safety record, and public transportations record is an important part of this picture.  TEA-21s increased funding allowed public transportation agencies to make public transportation even safer by enabling agencies to make improvements to the transportation infrastructure that enhance safety and security.      Our world, however, changed abruptly on September 11 th .  In the week immediately following the terrorist attacks, I established the National Infrastructure Security Committee (NISC) to evaluate security in the surface modes of transportation and make recommendations for improvements.  NISC created six ""Direct Action Groups"" (DAGs) to handle specific modes of transportation.  The DAGs interviewed industry representatives, studied transportation system vulnerabilities, evaluated security protocols and procedures, and developed recommendations to improve security across the transportation network.    Any discussion about security in transportation today, of course, must begin with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).  As you know, TSAs initial focus is on aviation security.  However, we know that security does not end at the airport perimeter.  We are fundamentally committed to creating a system, together with States and local governments, which works to protect the  entire  transportation network in America.  The underlying management structure and operating guidelines are being developed to address the full scope of transportation security needs because, from the traveling publics point of view, we are  one  system.     Even as TSA focuses on its initial mission of enhancing aviation security, other modes are stepping up to the new security challenges that we, as a Nation, face.  For example, the Federal Transit Administration launched a major security initiative shortly after September 11, working with transit agencies across the Nation to enhance transit security.  Using state-of-the-art threat and vulnerability assessment techniques, we are working hand-in-hand with the Nations major transit providers to identify high risk/high consequence assets and determine how best to mitigate those risks.  In addition, transit operators across the Nation are taking advantage of new security awareness and response training opportunities for their employees.    This new security initiative added to the overwhelming success of the transportation systems supporting the 2002 Winter Olympics last month.  While providing enhanced security, transit systems in the Salt Lake City area simultaneously moved record levels of users to and from multiple Olympic venues over a 17-day period without a serious security incident.  DOTs partnerships with the Utah Transit Authority, Utah Department of Transportation, and others were crucial to this internationally significant success.  In partnership with Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials, we formed new security relationships during the Olympic experience that will serve as a benchmark for future efforts.  While I am on the subject of the Olympics, I would also like to take this opportunity to commend the transportation community for providing superb accessibility for the elderly and people with disabilities during the Games.    Mobility and System Upgrading    ISTEA and TEA-21 placed an unprecedented emphasis on developing a seamless, intermodal transportation system that links highways, rail, transit, ports and airports. The dramatically increased funding under TEA-21 also enhanced mobility by upgrading the condition of public transportation systems.  As a direct result of the increased spending provided in TEA-21, overall public transportation conditions have improved dramatically.      TEA-21 also permitted a significant increase in transit service levels and capacity.  As of 2000, the Nations public transportation infrastructure included over 105,000 vehicles, 759 urban bus and rail maintenance facilities, 10,572 miles of track, and 2,825 rail stations.  Between 1997 and 2000, the number of transit vehicles increased by 10.3 percent, track mileage grew by 3.6 percent, the number of stations increased by 2.3 percent, and the number of maintenance facilities grew by 4.1 percent.        The substantial investment in the Nations transit systems has also resulted in an increase in transit ridership.  Preliminary estimates indicate that more than 9.6 billion public transit trips were taken in 2001, an increase of 2 percent over 2000.  Since 1993, public transportation use has increased by nearly 28 percent, the fastest growth rate among all forms of surface transportation.    TEA-21 also authorized the Job Access and Reverse Commute (JARC) Program to address transportation gaps in public transit systems and reduce barriers for those moving from welfare to work. This program has made transit services available to many who previously did not have access to adequate transportation and, thus, to jobs. As of FY 2000, the JARC program had made new transit service available at more than 16,000 job sites.    New Technologies    The Department of Transportation has made significant strides in research under TEA-21.   Important research programs include the development and deployment of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), public transportation vehicle improvements, and the development of new operating concepts such as Bus Rapid Transit.      TEA-21 authorized a total of $603 million for ITS research for FY 1998 to 2003, and significant progress has been made in applying this technology to our surface transportation system.  ITS technology, for example, helped to bring real-time improvements in transportation to the just-completed Winter Olympic games.  Thanks to TEA-21, the Utah Transit Authority partnered with the Utah Department of Transportation to invest $78 million in TEA-21 funds to develop a model multi-modal Intelligent Transportation System, including a state-of-the-art, voice-activated  ""511"" system that provided information on public transportation, Olympic travel, road conditions, and other subjects that was vital to moving hundreds of thousands of people in and around Salt Lake City.      Throughout America, communities are calling for more energy-efficient and clean public transportation vehicles.  Through the resources of TEA-21, the Department has been able to work with local agencies and their private partners to take advantage of developments in automotive electronics, clean fuels, and aviation engineering to introduce vehicles with hybrid electric engines, integrated computer management systems, and light-weight, durable composite materials.  As a result, public transportation vehicles are being deployed around the Nation with increased fuel economy, more efficient operations, and less polluting engines.  We are not, however, resting on these achievements.  TEA-21 provided $29.1 million to bring fuel cell technology to public transportation.  The California Fuel Cell Partnership is one example in which public transportation agencies, bus manufacturers, and auto companies are working together to move this zero-emission, highly efficient propulsion technology to market.          Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) has also benefited from technological advances made possible, in part, through TEA-21.  Combining exclusive transit-ways, modern stations, high-tech vehicles, and frequent service, BRT provides  at a fraction of the cost  the high level of service that people want and expect from more expensive transit systems.  And investments in Intelligent Transportation System projects have made BRT even more convenient, fast, reliable, and safe.  For example, Automated Vehicle Location technologies such as satellites or roadside sensors can now track the location of BRT vehicles, providing information for electronic ""next vehicle"" displays at stations and on-board automated stop announcements. Signal priority systems also use vehicle location information to control traffic signals cycles to give priority to BRT vehicles, while transit operators use it to achieve more consistent passenger wait times.      Continued Federal investment in the development of new transportation technologies will have enormous benefits for America  reducing congestion, improving air quality, and making public transportation an attractive travel alternative.     Quality of Life    TEA-21 has given States and communities across America additional tools and opportunities to enhance the environment and quality of life for their residents.  It continued and increased funding for several programs originally authorized in ISTEA, broadened eligibility for others, and established the new Transportation and Community and System Preservation Pilot (TCSP) program.     Authorized at $120 million under TEA-21, the TCSP program is a discretionary grant program intended to strengthen the linkages between transportation and land use. The grants have provided funding for planning and implementation, as well as technical assistance and research to investigate and address the relationships among transportation, community and system preservation, and private sector-based initiatives.      The Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) program has focused on improving air quality.  Under TEA-21, it has provided more than $8 billion in funding for use by State and local partners to support traffic flow projects, cleaner fuels, improved transit services, and bicycle and pedestrian programs that reduce congestion and emissions, and improve the quality of life.  A significant share of the title 23 program funds transferred for public transportation use came from the CMAQ program.     TEA-21 directed the Department to streamline environmental reviews.  With this directive in mind, we are working to assist States and communities in building infrastructure more efficiently, while retaining important environmental protections that maintain our quality of life.  Since the enactment of TEA-21 in 1998, streamlining of the planning and approval process for projects has taken root throughout the country, producing interagency personnel funding agreements that result in faster, concurrent reviews; a merged process for wetland permits with the Army Corps of Engineers; and delegated authority for historic resources.  While most of the focus on ""environmental streamlining"" has been on improving the process for highway projects, public transportation projects can also benefit from streamlining the environmental clearance process.  While we have begun the job, more can and will be done.    Building on TEA-21    The Department of Transportation looks forward to working with both Houses of Congress, State and local officials, tribal governments, and stakeholders in shaping the surface transportation reauthorization legislation.  We have established an intermodal process to develop surface transportation legislative proposals for reauthorization.  A number of intermodal working groups have already identified key issues and programmatic options, and, over the next few months, the Department will be working with stakeholders and Congressional committees in shaping the reauthorization legislation.     In that effort, the Department will be motivated by the following core principles and values:         Assuring adequate and predictable funding for investment in the Nations transportation system. This funding can contribute to the long-term health of the economy and, by enhancing the mobility of people and goods, promote greater productivity and efficiency.   Emphasizing the security of the Nations surface transportation system by providing the means and the mechanisms to perform risk assessment and analysis, incident identification, response, and, when necessary, evacuation.    Preserving funding flexibility to allow the broadest application of funds to transportation solutions, as identified by States and local communities.   Building on the intermodal approaches of ISTEA and TEA-21.   Fully utilizing innovative financing programs, in order to encourage greater private sector investment in the transportation system, and examining other means to augment existing trust funds and revenue streams.    Strengthening the efficiency and integration of the Nations system of goods movement by improving international gateways and points of intermodal connection.   Making substantial improvements in the safety of the Nations surface transportation system.  It is not acceptable that the Nation suffers 41,000 deaths and over 3 million injuries annually on our highways.   Simplifying Federal transportation programs and continuing efforts to streamline project approval and implementation.   Developing the data and analyses critical to sound transportation decisionmaking.   Fostering ""intelligent everything"" in the development and deployment of technology, such as pavement monitoring, message systems, remote sensing, and toll collection.   Focusing more on the management and performance of the system as a whole rather than on ""inputs"" or the functional components such as planning, development, construction, operation and maintenance themselves.    Ensuring an efficient infrastructure while retaining environmental protections that enhance our quality of life.      This is a moment of great opportunity.  As was true when Congress considered the landmark ISTEA and TEA-21 legislation, we now have the prospect of creating a legacy that will serve the transportation needs of the American people for decades to come.  I am confident that, working together, the Administration and Congress can preserve, enhance and establish surface transportation programs that will provide not only for a safer and more secure system, but also for one that is more efficient and productive and that enhances the quality of life.      From major urban centers to small communities, TEA-21 has created a revolution of sorts in transportation, through stable funding, innovative financing, and investments in new technology.  This, in turn, has resulted in increased mobility, more transportation choices, and more economically vital communities for millions of Americans.  Today, as we continue to respond to the events of September 11, we should strengthen, not diminish, Americas freedom of movement, and we should enhance our transportation systems to effectively grow the economy.  The reauthorization of our surface transportation programs provides us with the opportunity to do that even more effectively.      Mr. Chairman, thank you again for the opportunity to testify before you today.  I look forward to responding to any questions you may have.

GX146-56-9129803	"Opening Statements of Committee Members        Opening Statement of Senator Jon S. Corzine (D-NJ)   Oversight Hearing on ""Perspectives on America's Transit Needs.""    10:00 a.m., Tuesday, October 8, 2002 - Dirksen 538      Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this latest hearing on reauthorization of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century - TEA-21, and I'd like to join you in welcoming Administrator Dorn and the other witnesses.      Mr. Chairman, as the Banking Committee focuses on the state of the nation's mass transit infrastructure, it is clear that the amount of funding Congress is providing for mass transit does not meet the demands that are being made.  It's true that TEA-21 greatly increased the amount of funding available for mass transit.  But the Department of Transportation shows us in its report on the status of the nation's transit system that we need much more just to maintain transit at the level it is currently at.      As a Senator who represents a state with the third largest mass transit system in the country, I can attest to the need that is out there.  New Jersey's transit system has been impacted by the events of September 11th as well as by the fact that is home to many of the people who work in Philadelphia and New York and crowd road and rail every day.  As a 25-year commuter to New York City myself, I can testify that things are getting worse and a dramatic increase in funding is necessary,   As I have testified to this committee in the past, New Jersey is working hard to create mass transit opportunities to get more drivers off the road.  Rail lines such as the Hudson-Bergen and Newark-Elizabeth Light Rail lines are being built to alleviate traffic congestion as well as help revitalize New Jersey's urban areas.   I will fight to secure sufficient federal funding for these projects in the next TEA-21 legislation.  I will also work hard to secure funding for an additional rail tunnel under the Hudson River.   Mr. Chairman, I look forward to working with you to develop legislation that will meet the needs of New Jersey and the other states in the nation.  Thank you for holding this hearing and I look forward to hearing from our witnesses."
GX146-53-14566840	"Hearing on ""Transit in the 21st Century: Successes and Challenges.""         Prepared Statement of Mr. William Millar  President  American Public Transportation Association    10:00 a.m., Wednesday, March 13, 2002 - Dirksen 538       The American Public Transportation Association (APTA) appreciates the opportunity to testify on the upcoming reauthorization of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st  Century (TEA 21).     APTA's 1,400 public and private member organizations serve the public and the public interest by providing safe, efficient, and economical public transportation service, and by working to ensure that those services and products support national energy, environmental, community, and economic goals.  APTA member organizations include transit systems and commuter railroads; design, construction, and finance firms; product and service providers; academic institutions; and state associations and departments of transportation.  More than ninety percent of the people who use public transportation in the U.S. and Canada are served by APTA member systems.    TEA 21 Has Sparked a Transit Renaissance           ""The car was over crowded, folks were hanging on the straps,  Girls had bundles in their laps, came from Macys store perhaps;  You couldnt carve your way out with a carving knife or ax  Remember I am telling honest facts, . . .  Hold fast! Dont you lose your nerve! > Grab your lady by the arm, were going round the curve  Keep your wits about you and youll never get a jar,  If you listen to the man who runs the trolleycar!""             Mr. Chairman, the above lyrics are from a 1901 song entitled "" Hold Fast !"" by Jerome and Schwartz, which is featured in the exhibit on transit and its unique relationship to the American City now at the National Building Museum.  The lyrics come from a time when public transportation was the lifeblood of the American City and people packed onto transit cars as tight as sardines in a can.  It has now been a century since "" Hold Fast""  was published, and thanks in no small part to Congress investment in the TEA 21 federal transit program, once again the songs lyrics ring true. Public transportation is experiencing a renaissance in the United States and is enriching the lives of our citizens by giving them mobility and freedom of transportation choice.  However, if transits resurgence is to continue, we need to increase investment in public transportation infrastructure, maintain the TEA 21 guaranteed funding provisions, and streamline delivery of the transit program.    Transit Ridership is at Record Levels    Americans used public transportation a record 9.6 billion times in 2001 and transit ridership has grown 23 percent since 1995 according to preliminary ridership figures just released.  This represents the highest level in more than 40 years.  Over the last six years, transit usage has grown faster than the population (4.5%), highway use (11.8%), and domestic air travel (12%).  In 2000, ridership was up in all modes and in all parts of the country. In the light rail category, Denver (41%), San José (34%), and New Jersey Transit (38%) experienced tremendous ridership success.  New light rail service in Salt Lake City is exceeding estimates and was a big success during the recent Olympic Games.  The commuter rail operations in Dallas (39%) and in Baltimore (7.5%) have had continued success. Heavy rail ridership increased by more than 7% in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia, and it rose by nearly 4% in Chicago and by almost 13% in San Francisco.  Bus service was up in large cities like Washington, D.C. (8.4%) and New York City DOT (6.7%), as well as in cities across the country like Birmingham, AL (5.7%) and Spokane, WA (5.1%).     INVESTMENT IN THE TEA 21 TRANSIT PROGRAM HAS PAID-OFF    The record transit ridership increases are a direct result of the increased federal investment in TEA 21.  TEA 21 authorized $41 billion for public transportation, and guaranteed $36 billion, a significant increase over the previous funding.  This funding increase benefited transit systems in both urban and rural areas.  In 1997, before TEA 21, total funding for the rural program was $115 million.  In 2002, the rural program is funded at $223.4 million, an increase of 95 percent.  This compares with a 65 percent increase in the overall growth of the federal transit program over the same period.  A crucial provision of TEA 21 has been the budgetary ""firewalls,"" which guarantee that Transportation Trust Fund monies are used for transportation purposes.  The transit funding guarantee provision has been instrumental in insuring that transit funding has increased as intended by TEA 21.  Since the federal transit program is now primarily a capital investment program, the predictability and reliability of funding under the guarantee has been a big plus for transit agencies that must develop long-term-capital plans.  It lets them operate in a businesslike fashion, and the private markets are much more interested in public/private innovative investment plans with an assured level of federal funding.    The additional TEA 21 transit and highway investments have been put to work wisely and expeditiously on an existing array of state-of-the-art  transportation improvements.  Nearly 200 new or expanded rail or bus or rapid transit projects were authorized under TEA 21 for 88 areas in more than 40 states.  The TEA 21 investments have enriched the lives of Americans by giving them mobility and the freedom to do what they want and need to do, and created real success stories.  To capture some of these success stories, APTA and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) jointly published a report called "" Money at Work ,"" which we are pleased to submit for the record.     Transit Plays Key Role in National Emergencies    Perhaps one of the best illustrations of the benefits of the investment in the transit program was the role that transit played during the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.  On September 11, citizens in New York and Washington relied on public transportation as the mode of choice to evacuate from the urban core.  In New York, hundreds of thousands of citizens were evacuated quickly and without injury.  Here in Washington, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) proved its value as a regional evacuation system running the equivalent of two rush hours back-to-back and moving thousands of citizens out of harms way.  This same story was true all across the country as transit systems helped evacuate citizens from shut down airports and center cites. We have a report in this regard , ""America Under Threat: Transit Responds to Terrorism ,"" which we are pleased to submit for the record.    THE TEA 21 Transit Investment Has Made Positive Contributions to the U.S. Economy    In addition to significant increases in transit use, TEA 21 investments in the transit program have generated significant economic benefits. APTA has produced a publication, "" Public Transportation Means Business ,"" which highlights the significant economic benefits of transit investment.  The report illustrates how investment in transit sparks an economic chain reaction that generates business activity, creates jobs, boosts property values and tax earnings, maximizes transportation spending, and gets people to work.  We would also like to submit that report for the record.    Not only is the TEA 21 transit investment spurring economic growth in the nations major metropolitan areas, but it is boosting the economy in smaller towns and rural areas as well.  For example, investment in transit systems nationwide has fueled the growth of Chance Coach in Wichita, Kansas.  With a new manufacturing plant opened in 2000, the company has increased its staff, production and sales, and created a successful public transportation business which contributes over $15 million annually to the local economy.  There are numerous other examples of bus manufacturers operating in the nations heartland.  Neoplan USA buses are built in Lamar, Colorado and Brownsville, Texas; New Flyer buses in St. Cloud, Minnesota; Nova buses in Roswell, New Mexico; North American Bus Industries buses in Anniston, Alabama; Champion buses in Imlay City, Michigan ; MCI buses in Pembia, North Dakota; and Orion buses in Oriskany, New York.  In addition, Kawasaki will be building rail cars in Lincoln, Nebraska.    Transit Investment and the Environment    The TEA 21 transit  investment is also helping to protect the environment. Mr. Chairman, let me tell you about something in our own backyards.  An article in last weeks  Washington Post  (3/4/02) said that Marylands population of Baltimore Orioles, long in decline, could vanish altogether late this century due to dramatic changes in migration patterns and declining habitats strongly influenced by global warming.  The article cites as study by the American Bird Conservancy which suggests that the effects of global warming may be robbing Maryland and a half-dozen other states of an important piece of their heritage by hastening the departure of their state birds.  The report says the earths rising temperature, which scientists attribute to carbon dioxide and other green house gases, is already shifting songbird ranges, altering migration behavior  and perhaps diminishing some species ability to survive.  The good news is that transit use can help reduce green house gas emissions.  For example, here in the Washington region alone, the Metrorail system removes 325,000 vehicles from the road and helps to keep approximately 1,400 tons of hydrocarbons, 9,000 tons of carbon monoxide and 700 tons of nitrogen oxides out of the regions air on an annual basis.    The Demand for Public Transportation is Soaring    The consistent annual ridership growth in nearly every mode of transportation sends a message loud and clear: people are leaving their cars at home and using public transportation more and more. As new systems open doors and existing systems expand their service, demand is exceeding the speed at which new service can be funded and implemented. Now more than ever, steadily growing congestion is causing people to seek alternative forms of transportation to commute to work, complete errands, make health care visits, and to get to and from sports and entertainment events.     Voters Demanding More Transit    It's no wonder that so many American cities have recently voted to start or expand light rail, commuter rail, or bus service in their communities.   Just last week, on March 5, in a statewide election California voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 42, which changes state law to require that all state gasoline tax revenue be devoted to transportation beginning in 2008. Under the provision, 20 percent of the gas sales tax funds will be used for public transportation. Voters have also supported recent transit initiatives in Pierce County, Washington; Salt Lake City, Utah; Seattle, Washington; Toledo, Ohio; Providence, Rhode Island; King County, Washington; Houston, Texas; Glendale, Arizona; and in Portage County, Ohio, among others.    The nations mayors also recognize the growing demand for public transportation.  In February, at a meeting of more than 300 mayors from across the country, a survey was released that showed that 80 percent of respondents agreed that the idea of building light rail is a viable alternative to driving.      TEA 21 REAUTHORIZATION    Without question, the TEA 21 investment in transit has paid-off by helping the economy and enriching the lives of millions by giving them mobility and freedom of choice to do what they want to do.  However, the current level of federal investment in the nations public transportation system is inadequate to keep up with the steadily growing demand for additional transit services and the need for improved maintenance of the core transit system.  This is why reauthorization of TEA 21 is critical and why we urge Congress to preserve a strong and growing federal investment in the surface transportation system.    APTA has formed a reauthorization task force with broad representation from a cross section of the industry.  The task force is working on a balanced reauthorization proposal for the entire transit industry.  Overall, APTA supports retention of the basic principles of TEA 21, including a needs-based transit program. APTAs reauthorization proposal centers around three themes: 1) Increasing Investment in the Program; 2) Maintaining the TEA 21 Funding Guarantees; and 3) Streamlining Transit Program Delivery.       Increasing Needs Means Increasing Investment in the Transit Program    APTA supports increasing investment in public transportation infrastructure.  Additional funding is needed to maintain the existing capital investment and to expand core capacities in order to meet growing demand for service and support national policy goals.  Overworked bus and rail fleets paired with increasing ridership have taken their toll over the years.    APTA has compiled a Transit Needs Synthesis Report, which summarizes and makes projections based upon estimates of transit capital needs studies conducted by APTA, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), and the Community Transit Association of America (CTAA).  A copy of the report is attached for the Committees review.  Based on the study, preliminary estimated total transit industry needs from FY 2004 through FY 2009 will be $253 billion.  This is an average of $42 billion per year, in FY 2003 dollars.  The $42 billion annual amount includes: $12.4 billion annually to complete 208 transit new start projects authorized in TEA 21; $7.4 billion annually for buses and bus facilities to replace over vehicles and to expand bus fleets to increase service; $6.5 billion annually to expand the core capacity of existing transit infrastructure to meet existing demand and prepare for continued growth in demand; $6.2 billion for Fixed-Guideway modernization; and $3 billion for small urbanized and rural areas.    The Department of Transportation (DOT) is expected to release its biennial ""Conditions and Performance"" report this summer.  The 1999 DOT report recommends an annual transit investment of $16 billion in order to improve both transit conditions and performance.  However, the 1999 Conditions and Performance report is outdated because it is based on anticipated transit ridership growth of 1.9 percent.  Yet, actual ridership growth has far outpaced the 1999 estimate.  Adjusting to an annual ridership growth of 4.5 percent and in 2003 dollars, the DOT needs amount becomes $27.4 billion annually.  AASHTO is also expected to release its ""Bottom Line Report"" in Fall 2002.  The Bottom Line report has been compiled prior to each recent reauthorization bill and assesses surface transportation capital needs for highways and transit.  APTA also plans to do another survey of its members funding needs later this year.    Maintain Transit Program Funding Guarantees     APTA supports maintenance of the transit program budgetary funding guarantees.  TEA 21 included a significant budget act amendment which created new discretionary ""mass transit"" and ""highway"" spending categories under the discretionary budget cap.  These discretionary funding ""firewalls"" for surface transportation spending have ensured that the transit program has grown at an average rate of about 9 percent since passage of TEA 21. Most importantly, the guarantees have provided transit authorities, states, and urbanized areas with certainty as to the level of funding they would receive each year.  This is important because a stable funding stream is essential for transit authorities and states and metropolitan areas, who need to develop long-term transportation plans and to efficiently manage capital projects.  The reliability of the TEA 21 transit funding has prompted faster project implementation, and innovations in financing, building and operating transportation facilities.  Transit authorities, states and metropolitan areas have put in place aggressive new transportation measures to take advantage  of the funding guarantees and to fully accelerate critical, often delayed projects.    In addition, the provision has ensured that transportation trust fund revenues are spent for transportation purposes.  This is critical because transit needs exceed $42 billion annually.  Since federal transit capital assistance now funds about half of all annual transit capital spending, this means that the federal program when coupled with non-federal matching funds is addressing less than one third of those needs.  In this regard, APTA urges the Congress to fund the transit program at no less than the $7.2 billion guaranteed level in FY 2003.    Streamlining Program Delivery    From streamlining the drug and alcohol testing program to simplifying the federal procurement process, APTAs reauthorization task force is recommending a host of changes that would significantly simplify and improve existing federal program mechanisms.  We are organizing our efforts under four broad categories: Streamlining Program Delivery; Improving the Planning Process; Simplifying the Procurement Process; and Revising Other Federal Programs.  We look forward to sharing these many initiatives with the Committee.      CONCLUSION: HOLD FAST! PRESERVE AND EXPAND TEA 21    Mr. Chairman, the song "" Hold Fast "" ends with these words,  Keep your wits about you, and youll never get a jar, if you listen to the man who runs the trolleycar !""  In light of this admonishment, I urge the Committee to listen to the operators of the nations trolley cars and  Hold Fast !   Hold Fast  by recognizing the many successes of TEA 21 which have enhanced the American quality of life;  Hold Fast  by increasing investment in the TEA 21 transit program;  Hold Fast  by preserving the transit guaranteed funding provisions; and  Hold Fast  by streamlining delivery of the transit program.    APTA appreciates this opportunity to testify on the development of legislation to continue programs authorized under the expiring Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st  Century.  We believe that public transportation is an essential element of the nations transportation network, an element that can enhance and improve the entire system.  We look forward to working with this Committee during the reauthorization process and would be pleased to provide additional information to assist you in your deliberations.

GX033-28-4167089	DOT Performance Plan (FY 2002) and Report (FY 2000)                        Transit Ridership :  Public transit offers many benefits; it is one of the safest ways of traveling, relieves road congestion, and often mitigates air pollution.  To achieve these benefits, people must be encouraged to use public transit.                                       Performance Measure : Passenger-miles traveled (in billions) by transit.                  1999     2000     2001     2002           Target:     ---     40.56     44.8     47.5           Actual:     43.3(r)     45.3              (r) Revised           External Factors:  Communities are spreading farther away from the central cities, and jobs are increasingly located in the suburbs.  This creates longer commutes and more scattered travel patterns.  Rural areas and small communities are shifting from an agricultural to a service and manufacturing economy, creating a demand for public transportation.  As more women enter the labor market, a larger share of workers will need to travel to childcare centers as well as work locations.  All these factors will challenge traditional transit systems.       2000 Results:  DOT met the performance target. Transit ridership and service levels continue to grow, commensurate with recent capital investments and system improvements. Capital investment levels in recent years have allowed transit operators to maintain transit infrastructure and make modest increases in the amount of transit service provided.   Further growth in ridership is expected as the substantial increases in Federal funding under TEA-21 are translated into new investment.  Rail transit ridership growth has been particularly strong, reflecting recent expansions in the Nations urban rail networks, both through new systems and expansions of established systems.  New procurement and refurbishment of transit vehicles has improved the level of service provided on the expanding routes, as vehicle-miles have increased at a greater rate than route-miles.                                Transit passenger-mile growth has been stronger still, meaning that, even with the recent expansions in transit route mileage and transit vehicle mileage, transit vehicles are carrying more passengers, thus making better use of the capacity that they have. Annual transit passenger miles now exceed the goals set for 2000 and 2001.   One important factor in the increase in transit travel has been the overall strength of the economy, particularly in central business districts. While most job growth has been in suburban locations, central cities have also seen an increase in employment, and transit is particularly well suited for commuter travel to central business districts. Indeed, transit passenger-mile growth in urban areas in recent years has been on par with, and even exceeded, urban auto passenger travel.   System management improvements such as the introduction of unlimited-ride weekly and monthly passes have been another important factor in improving transit capacity utilization. By reducing the incremental cost associated with a particular transit trip to zero, such passes encourage transit usage for short, discretionary trips (such as for shopping or leisure) that would otherwise be made by taxi or private auto. The combination of a fixed fee and no additional per-ride cost encourages high-volume usage by transit riders, making transit a lifestyle choice rather than simply an occasional convenience and enabling urban residents to limit their auto usage while maintaining an active, productive, mobile lifestyle.    FY 2001 Performance Plan Evaluation:  DOT expects to meet the performance target.    Strategies and Initiatives to Achieve 2002 Target:  DOT resources attributable to this performance goal are depicted below:                                [  Previous  ]     [ Contents ]     [  Next  ]          Page 103

An additional $25 million is expected to be included in the FY 2004 transportation spending bill.                      Getting mass transit in the Dulles corridor is a top priority in which I have been involved for several years.  This additional federal funding will help to lay the groundwork for bringing mass transit to Tysons Corner and eventually out to Washington Dulles International Airport.                              Rail transportation officials from the Commonwealth of Virginia are working with local officials and organizations on a final plan for the transit project, which will help bring traffic congestion relief in the Dulles corridor and provide a transit link to Dulles airport.

""Drivers in New Jersey lose 261 million hours a year to                          congestion - an average of 45 hours per driver,"" said                          Governor James E. McGreevey. ""New Jerseyans deserve a                          quality of life that is not diminished by congestion and                          endless sprawl. That is why we are improving transit                          villages throughout the State and providing assistance                          to towns like Rutherford who are planning around mass                          transportation, and not the automobile.""                                                    From its creation of a pedestrian-friendly downtown to                          its encouragement of the use of public transportation,                          Rutherford has thrived since its designation as a                          Transit Village, said Lettiere. Displaying a true                          cooperative effort between public and private entities,                          Mayor McPherson and the Borough Council have revitalized                          their community and stayed true to the principles of                          smart growth. Rutherford stands as a model for all                          communities that wish to ease congestion and improve the                          quality of life for New Jerseys residents.                                                     In his State of the State address, Governor McGreevey                          outlined ways to improve the overall quality of life in                          New Jersey, such as fighting sprawl, preserving open                          space and protecting our drinking water. The Governor                          has made New Jersey a leader in farmland preservation                          with over 112,000 acres permanently preserved, and has                          moved aggressively on his promise to improve 200 local                          parks. He has also taken the unprecedented action of                          applying the highest protection possible-C1                          designation-to over 40 percent of the State's drinking                          water.                                                     The $420,000 will allow Rutherford to finalize plans to                          address pedestrian and vehicular safety issues at                          Station Square in front of the Rutherford Train Station                          through the completion of a modern roundabout.                          Approaches will be yield controlled which allows for                          free flow movements in the roundabout and slows vehicle                          speeds. Pavement markings and raised landscape islands                          used to form traffic lanes will also provide safe                          passage for pedestrians crossing to the station, bus                          stop and nearby businesses.                                                    Since its designation as a Transit Village in 1999,                          Rutherfords central business district has a variety of                          changes including enhanced streetscapes with new                          lighting fixtures, decorative trash receptacles, wide                          brick sidewalks and plantings to create a more                          attractive pedestrian environment, as well as raised                          pedestrian islands and pavement markings for safe                          crossing near the rail station. A community shuttle                          service that transports people from various                          neighborhoods right to the train station was also                          initiated to encourage the use of bus and rail                          transportation.                                                     In addition to the public sector investment, Rutherford                          Borough gained support local businesses including                          Boiling Springs Bank, which is constructing a mixed-used                          project near the train station. The project calls for a                          new structure with retail space, a day care center,                          medical offices, 48 up-scale apartments, and parking                          facilities to accommodate 510 vehicles.                                                     The Transit Village concept in Rutherford is a clear                          cut example of smart growth and moving New Jersey                          forward, said Senator Paul Sarlo. The boroughs                          downtown Renaissance has come to fruition through a                          strong public-private partnership and a commitment to                          encouraging the use of public transportation. These                          efforts have further enhanced the sense of community and                          improved the quality of life for area residents.                                                    The Transit Village program is designed to spur economic                          development, urban revitalization and private-sector                          investment around public transportation. A designated                          Transit Village is a community with a bus, train, light                          rail or ferry station that has developed a plan to                          achieve its goals.                                                     A municipality must demonstrate a commitment to smart                          growth planning and transit-oriented development, as                          well as a commitment to maintain the architectural                          history of the area, and create housing, cultural and                          commercial opportunities within walking distance of the                          facility.                                                     Rutherford is among eight municipalities in New Jersey                          to have the Transit Village designation. The other                          municipalities are Metuchen, Morristown, Pleasantville,                          South Amboy, South Orange, Riverside and Rahway.                                                     The Transit Village initiative seeks to provide                          much-needed congestion relief on New Jersey roadways                          through the promotion of public transit expansion and                          partnerships with the private sector. Municipalities                          designated as Transit Villages will be given priority                          consideration for funding and technical assistance by                          the participating agencies.

The                          service is part of ongoing improvements associated with                          South Oranges designation as Transit Village.                                                    ""Drivers in New Jersey lose 261 million hours a year to                          congestion - an average of 45 hours per driver,"" said                          Governor James E. McGreevey. ""New Jerseyans deserve a                          quality of life that is not diminished by congestion and                          endless sprawl. That is why we are improving transit                          villages throughout the State and providing assistance                          to towns like South Orange who are planning around mass                          transportation, and not the automobile.""                                                    Through the revitalization of its downtown and the                          increased promotion of public transportation, South                          Orange has become one of New Jerseys model communities                          for smart growth, said Lettiere. It is through the                          support and commitment of local officials, like                          President Calabrese and the Village trustees, that this                          administration is able to make good on its promise to                          ease congestion on our roadways and improve the quality                          of life for New Jerseys residents. Transit Villages,                          like South Oranges, are an integral component of                          Governor McGreeveys Smart Growth initiative.                                                    In his State of the State address, Governor McGreevey                          outlined ways to improve the overall quality of life in                          New Jersey, such as fighting sprawl, preserving open                          space and protecting our drinking water. The Governor                          has made New Jersey a leader in farmland preservation                          with over 112,000 acres permanently preserved, and has                          moved aggressively on his promise to improve 200 local                          parks. He has also taken the unprecedented action of                          applying the highest protection possible-C1                          designation-to over 40 percent of the State's drinking                          water.                                                     The South Orange Commuter Shuttle Service began in                          August 2002 and has been an overwhelming success. Each                          weekday morning and evening, commuters are picked up in                          two Village neighborhoods and transported to and from                          the South Orange Train Station  increasing access to                          mass transit and reducing the need for parking in the                          downtown area. The shuttle service coincides with the                          Midtown Direct and Hoboken Express train schedules.                                                    The $720,000 award allows the Village to expand its                          shuttle service further into the evening and purchase                          four new buses. The new evening routes will transport                          residents to the performing arts center and the expanded                          retail stores, while also alleviating traffic and                          parking issues downtown.                                                    We believe South Orange Village is a model for suburban                          living in the new millennium, said Village President                          Bill Calabrese. Thanks to our partnership with New                          Jersey Transit, South Orange commuters are able to                          access our train station with ease, while at the same                          time improving air quality and alleviating traffic                          congestion. We hope that other municipalities will have                          the opportunity to follow our lead and have the benefit                          of working with agencies like NJT and NJDOT.                                                    ""The grant being awarded to South Orange today is in                          recognition of the municipality's hugely successful                          community shuttle service,"" said Democratic Senate                          President Richard J. Codey (D). ""The shuttle allows                          residents easy access to NJ Transit rail lines, and is a                          prime example of smart growth initiatives in practice,                          cutting down on commuter congestion in South Orange and                          improving air quality. These funds will help expand the                          shuttle service to more of South Orange's residents, and                          are important in maintaining this popular program.""                                                    The Transit Village program is designed to spur economic                          development, urban revitalization and private-sector                          investment around public transportation. A designated                          Transit Village is a community with a bus, train, light                          rail or ferry station that has developed a plan to                          achieve its goals.                                                     A municipality must demonstrate a commitment to smart                          growth planning and transit-oriented development, as                          well as a commitment to maintain the architectural                          history of the area, and create housing, cultural and                          commercial opportunities within walking distance of the                          facility.                                                     South Orange is among eight municipalities in New Jersey                          to have the Transit Village designation. The other                          municipalities are Metuchen, Morristown, Pleasantville,                          Rutherford, South Amboy, Riverside and Rahway.                                                     If we are to encourage the use of Smart Growth                          principles within our states communities, then we must                          provide the necessary tools and build upon successful                          initiatives such as the Transit Village program, said                          Assemblyman John McKeon (D). I commend South Orange for                          its vision and commitment to making New Jersey a better                          place work and live.                                                    The Transit Village initiative seeks to provide                          much-needed congestion relief on New Jersey roadways                          through the promotion of public transit expansion and                          partnerships with the private sector. Municipalities                          designated as Transit Villages will be given priority                          consideration for funding and technical assistance by                          the participating agencies.

""Drivers in New Jersey lose 261 million hours a year to                          congestion - an average of 45 hours per driver,"" said                          Governor James E. McGreevey. ""New Jerseyans deserve a                          quality of life that is not diminished by congestion and                          endless sprawl. We need to spend our precious time with                          our families, not stuck traffic jams. By adhering to the                          Smart Growth principles and building upon our mass                          transit system, and expanding the Transit Village                          program, we are succeeding.                                                    Lettiere joined with State and local officials near the                          Collingswood PATCO Station this morning and announced                          six new Transit Villages and a $200,000 grant for each                          community. They included: Collingswood, Bound Brook,                          Belmar, Bloomfield, Matawan and Cranford. The monies                          will be used for a range of improvements including                          streetscaping, traffic calming measures, road                          improvements, bicycle paths and station improvements.                                                    If we want to take cars off our highways, we must make                          mass transit a viable option, not a last resort, said                          Lettiere. Under Governor McGreeveys leadership, were                          doing just that  by creating 20,000 new parking spaces                          at our bus and rail terminals, by adding 20,000 new                          seats on our NJ TRANSIT trains, and now by designating                          six new Transit Villages that will allow people to live,                          shop and reach work without a car.                                                    In his State of the State address, Governor McGreevey                          outlined ways to improve the overall quality of life in                          New Jersey, such as fighting sprawl, preserving open                          space and protecting our drinking water. The Governor                          has made New Jersey a leader in farmland preservation                          with over 112,000 acres permanently preserved, and has                          moved aggressively on his promise to improve 200 local                          parks. He has also taken the unprecedented action of                          applying the highest protection possible-C1                          designation-to over 40 percent of the State's drinking                          water. The Governor also vowed to double the number of                          Transit Villages by FY04.                                                    ""Collingswood has a long-standing history of promoting                          environmentally-friendly alternative modes of                          transportation and mass-transit to reduce congestion in                          the Borough,"" said Senator John H. Adler (D-6). ""The                          Transit Village grants being announced by the DOT today                          reflect the State's growing emphasis on controlling                          automobile congestion and the recognition that the                          pattern followed by Collingswood will ultimately do just                          that in New Jersey.""                                                    Collingswood is experiencing a rebirth, said                          Assemblyman Lou Greenwald (D-6). This Transit Village                          designation and the addition of a bike path will further                          enhance this great community. This will help ease                          traffic congestion and aid in the help against sprawl.                                                    The Transit Village program is designed to spur economic                          development, urban revitalization and private-sector                          investment around public transportation. A designated                          Transit Village is a community with a bus, train, light                          rail or ferry station that has developed a plan to                          achieve its goals.                                                     A municipality must demonstrate a commitment to smart                          growth planning and transit-oriented development, as                          well as a commitment to maintain the architectural                          history of the area, and create housing, cultural and                          commercial opportunities within walking distance of the                          facility.                                                     New Jerseys six new Transit Villages join a list eight                          others including: Rutherford, Metuchen, Morristown,                          Pleasantville, South Amboy, South Orange, Riverside and                          Rahway.                                                     The Transit Village initiative seeks to provide                          much-needed congestion relief on New Jersey roadways                          through the promotion of public transit expansion and                          partnerships with the private sector. Municipalities                          designated as Transit Villages will be given priority                          consideration for funding and technical assistance by                          the participating agencies.

Combined, the projects will create over 5,700                            new parking spots in six counties and 17 municipalities.                                                                                   “To                            reduce the sheer number of cars on our roads, we must                            make mass transit the ticket to lessening traffic,”                            said McGreevey. “In January, I promised New Jersey’s                            commuters that I would create an additional 20,000 park                            and ride spaces. Today, we are making a major installment                            on that promise with 5,796 park and ride spaces at five                            locations all over the State.”                                                       Included                            in this announcement are plans to build an $8 million                            parking deck in West Orange adjacent to the South Mountain                            Arena on Northfield Avenue. Creation of the garage is                            a cooperative effort between NJDOT and Essex County                            officials. Joining the Governor were Transportation                            Commissioner Jack Lettiere, Senate Co-President Dick                            Codey, Assemblymen Mims Hackett and John McKeon, and                            Essex County Executive Joseph DiVincenzo.                                                        ""In                            the 27th district and in West Orange in particular,                            this initiative will especially have a large impact,""                            said Codey, D-Essex. ""Where we stand now has become                            a sort of makeshift park and ride, a meeting place for                            commuters to meet to carpool. With official designation                            and the construction of a parking garage on premises,                            this site will serve many more commuters, and be a commuter                            meeting place for drivers throughout the region.""                                                       “The                            ability to use mass transit has become an overwhelming                            concern for Essex County residents,” said Hackett                            (D-Essex). “The creation of this facility will                            help ease the horrendous congestion on our area roadways.”                                                       “Hundreds                            of residents commute to New York City daily from West                            Orange, Livingston and South Orange,” said McKeon                            (D-Essex). “I’m pleased to see the state commit                            to continuation of the ‘park and ride’ at                            South Mountain Arena. Building a 500-spot parking garage                            here is good public policy from an environmental and                            transportation perspective.”                                                       ""I                            applaud Governor McGreevey's initiative to promote the                            use of mass transportation. By providing funds to upgrade                            the parking facility at South Mountain Arena, our Governor                            recognizes that established park and rides help alleviate                            the traffic on our roads and reduce harmful vehicle                            emissions, which will benefit our environment,”                            said DiVincenzo. “The parking deck will eliminate                            the congestion and traffic hazards, creating a safer                            environment for the commuters and children who visit                            Turtle Back Zoo and South Mountain Arena. It also will                            help stimulate economic development in an area that                            has the potential to grow.""                                                       The                            deck will serve bus commuters throughout the region,                            primarily those commuting into New York City. A partnership                            between the State and Essex County, construction on                            the three-story deck will begin in October and be completed                            by May 1, 2004. An existing parking lot at the site                            now serves NJ TRANSIT and private bus carrier customers.                                                                                   West                            Orange is just one of five initial locations that are                            a part of the Governor’s Park & Ride program                            created in Executive Order #43, which will increase                            park and ride spaces from 95,000 to 115,000 over the                            next five years.                                                        The                            Governor also announced today the creation of additional                            park and rides at the following locations: Atlantic                            Highlands Ferry Station (400 spaces), Waterview Boulevard                            in Parsippany (275 spaces), Montclair State University                            Station (1,500) and 13 stations along the South Jersey                            Light Rail Line (3,121 spaces) – Trenton, Bordentown,                            Roebling, Florence, Burlington City, Beverly/Edgewater                            Park, Delanco, Riverside, Cinnaminson, Riverton, Palmyra,                            Pennsauken and Camden.                                                        Since                            taking office, the Governor has already announced Park                            and Rides at Union Rail Station (480 spots), Washington                            Township (300) in Gloucester County, Hamilton Rail Station                            (320 spots) and Route 46 Mount Arlington (235 spots)                            in Morris County.                                                       “In                            recent years, we’ve seen a dramatic increase in                            the number of people who rely upon public transportation,”                            said NJDOT Commissioner Jack Lettiere. “Some spend                            years waiting for parking spaces.

They also presented the Borough of Metuchen with                            a $600,000 check for improvements to its transit village.                                                       “In                            order to improve our quality of life and to combat sprawl,                            we must implement smart growth planning that includes                            the expansion of transit villages,” said McGreevey.                            “Over the next year, our goal will be to double                            the number of transit villages in New Jersey from seven                            to fourteen, with Metuchen being our first step.”                                                       “We’re                            very pleased to present this check to the Borough of                            Metuchen,” said Lettiere. “Mayor O’Brien                            and Borough officials have not only made a strong commitment                            to the betterment of their community, but also to relieving                            congestion on our roads and improving safety for pedestrians.                            Transit Villages, like Metuchen’s, are an integral                            component for the Governor’s Smart Growth initiative.”                                                       “Governor                            McGreevey’s visit to Metuchen to announce upgrades                            to our Transit Village status is greatly appreciated,”                            said Metuchen Mayor Ed O’Brien. “It will add                            to our efforts to promote our transportation hub not                            only for the people of Metuchen but for a large portion                            of Central Jersey who use our station.”                                                       ""As                            a former councilwoman and long-time resident of Metuchen,                            I've participated in promoting the township's long-standing                            commitment to ensuring pedestrian safety and promoting                            alternative means of transportation,"" said Senator                            Barbara Buono, D-Middlesex. ""Metuchen has done                            much to make environmentally friendly modes of transportation                            like walking and bicycling viable choices for its citizens,                            and the money spent today by the state confirms that                            offering alternatives to automobile traffic benefits                            a municipality in so many ways.""                                                       “Residents                            in this small, commuter community already rely upon                            the train station to get to and from work,” said                            Barnes, D-Middlesex. “Creating a transit village                            around the existing Metuchen Train Station will increase                            residents’ access to the station and increase train                            ridership. Like most of Middlesex County, Metuchen struggles                            with traffic congestion on a daily basis. Encouraging                            residents to use public transportation would get cars                            off the road but help people travel to work, to school,                            or to visit friends and family.”                                                        “Metuchen’s                            charm lies within its historic houses and quaint downtown                            district,” said Diegnan, D-Middlesex. “Once                            created, the transit village would preserve the town’s                            historic ambiance while addressing its traffic congestion                            problem. This generous state grant will help move construction                            of the transit village along without placing any additional                            burden on Metuchen commuters or residents. It is a win-win                            situation for the town and those who call it home.”                                                       The                            State’s Transit Village Program:                                                       The                            State’s Transit Village program partners communities                            with 10 State agencies to help implement redevelopment                            and smart growth goals. The $600,000 awarded to the                            Borough today will fund the follow measures: flashing                            pedestrian crosswalk signals; traffic calming improvements                            for Central Avenue; bike lanes; pedestrian bridge for                            Myrtle Park; three new bus shelters; and new bike racks.                                                       The                            Transit Village program is designed to spur economic                            development, urban revitalization and private-sector                            investment around passenger rail stations. A designated                            Transit Village is a community with a bus, train, light                            rail or ferry station that has developed a plan to achieve                            its goals.                                                       A                            municipality must demonstrate a commitment to smart                            growth planning and transit-oriented development, as                            well as a commitment to maintain the architectural history                            of the area, and create housing, cultural and commercial                            opportunities within walking distance of the facility.                                                       Metuchen                            joins seven other municipalities that have the Transit                            Village designation.

The                            Transit Village initiative seeks to provide much-needed                            congestion relief on New Jersey roadways through the                            promotion of public transit expansion and partnerships                            with the private sector. Municipalities designated as                            Transit Villages will be given priority consideration                            for funding and technical assistance by the participating                            agencies.

GX052-61-7306742	"News Release     PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION MARKETING CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED  GOAL IS TO INCREASE NEW HAMPSHIRE AWARENESS AND RIDERSHIP            Improving public transportation in New Hampshire is the goal of a marketing campaign recently begun by the New Hampshire Department of Transportation in cooperation with transit providers around the state.            ""New Hampshire Transit - The Ride Choice"" is the theme of the campaign, which will include an effort to educate students about transit as well as provide information to the general public on transit options available to provide access to work, services, and tourist destinations.            Ridership on several local transit systems, and especially on commuter buses, has been on the rise in New Hampshire.  The Department of Transportation hopes that increased public awareness of the benefits of transit and of local bus schedules will convince more people to ride the buses.   ""We are working to give the residents of New Hampshire more transportation choices.  Public transportation can help thousands of people get to their jobs more easily, ease congestion and reduce pollution,"" Gov. Jeanne Shaheen said.    ""By helping communities promote their public transportation systems, we are increasing the public's awareness of their transportation options and working to make public transportation more efficient and effective for everyone.""    The statewide marketing campaign has produced a workbook that local transit systems will be using to educate middle school students around the state about public transportation and how it can provide a safe way for them to get around.  Local transit managers will arrange field trips for school groups using the book and materials about their bus routes.   The other products of the marketing program are:           A statewide public transportation map illustrating transit options, from intercity bus routes to local transit systems          A park and ride brochure listing all 28 of the state's official park and ride lots, with a location map and details on services at the lots          Posters promoting ridesharing as a better way to get to work and promoting transit for young people         A ""New Hampshire Transit"" logo to be placed on transit buses and vans         Radio and print advertising that will raise awareness of transit in the state             As part of the campaign, Governor Shaheen and the Executive Council have approved funds for local and intercity bus systems to begin their own marketing efforts that will improve public awareness of transit as an alternative to driving alone.   Local marketing grants will support a variety of activities, including developing web sites,         purchasing ads to spread the word about bus schedules, and designing and producing improved bus schedules, route maps, and information displays at seven local transit systems:          Advance Transit in the Hanover-Lebanon area         City Express in Keene         COAST in the Seacoast area         Concord Area Transit         Greater Laconia Transit Agency         Manchester Transit Authority         North Country Transportation in Berlin-Gorham             Similar marketing efforts for intercity and commuter bus services operating from park and ride lots and transportation centers have been approved for Concord Trailways and The Coach Company.

Southeast Michigan is clearly in need of a new mass       transportation system. Representative Dingell is pleased that in October       2001, the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) approved a 25       year, $2 billion plan to address the areas mass transit needs. SEMCOG       recommended that the region approve a system of bus rapid transit (BRT)       and light rail to move people around Southeast Michigan. The BRT plan       would require 12 lines totaling more than 250 miles in Wayne, Oakland and       Macomb Counties. The new plan would be in addition to the current SMART       and Detroit Department of Transportation buses.         Mass transit is most important for       individuals who do not have a choice in how they get from one place to       another. However, having an effective mass transit system will also enable       people to choose to utilize the system rather than driving, thereby       reducing pollution and congestion on area roads.         However, Representative Dingell maintains       that Southeast Michigan must not focus solely on bus and light rail       systems. Improved Amtrak service, rail service between Detroit and       Lansing, stopping at the airport, and high-speed rail service between       Detroit and other Midwest cities are also necessary parts of an effective       mass transit system that will help our region to continue to grow and       prosper. Representative Dingell has fought for years to increase the       amount of federal funding for Amtrak. In a 1994 transportation funding       debate, Dingell chided House leaders for not providing more funding for       Amtrak. ""If we were to spend our money well, we would put money into       investing in additional facilities for Amtrak so it could begin to make       money [and] provide the kind of service that people want."" Dingell       went on to add, ""the bill which is before us gives them [Amtrak] less       than they requested and less than the administration sought, and if we had       spend the money that Amtrak asked, we might conceivably have come up with       a situation where we could begin to actually provide the service that the       people need and to eliminate congestion on the highways and air       pollution.""         Representative Dingell continues to fight       for increased federal funding for Southeast Michigan transit programs. In       December 2001, Dingell cosigned a letter to House and Senate leaders       requesting that Congress permit a limited tax credit for holders if High       Speed Rail Investment bonds as a way to incentivize the private sector to       support the construction of high speed passenger rail corridors,       especially in the Midwest.         Representative Dingell was disappointed       President Bush proposed an $8.5 billion cut in FY 2003 funding that is       used by states for road repairs and mass transit. Michigan would lose       approximately $222 million and 9,320 jobs under Bushs plan. In an       effort to reverse some of Bushs cuts, Representative Dingell       cosponsored a bill that would restore $126.6 million to Michigan. The bill       is supported by a majority of the House of Representatives.                                                                                                                      Contact Offices   •  Search  :      •                                         Home   |      Biography  |  Constituent     Services  |  Photo Album  |  News  |  Issues  |  Legislation  |  Links"

GSFC Civil Service employees are eligible to                participate in a mass transit subsidy called the NASA Transportation                Fringe Benefit Program (TFBP), which was effective October 1, 2000.                This is authorized by Executive Order 13150, ""Federal Workforce                Transportation,"" dated April 21, 2000. The Logistics Management                Division, Code 230, manages the TFBP. Under this program, participating                employees can receive ""transit passes"" in amounts equal                to personal commuting costs, not to exceed $100/month. This benefit                applies to both mass transit and authorized vanpools. The TFBP does                not include carpools. The transit passes are in the form of Metrocheks                issued by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA).                They can be used on the Metrorail system or can be used as a cash                equivalent to purchase other fare media such as bus or train tickets                (e.g., MARC). They can also be used to reimburse the driver of an                authorized vanpool.

                                        (4)               Provide proof of use of qualified transit facilities or commuter                                                   highway vehicles, e.g., fare card, train ticket, etc., to the                                                    Commuter Transit Subsidy Benefit Program Coordinator when receiving                                                   cash reimbursement for these qualifying expenses.    If such proof is                                                  not available, the employee's initial certification will suffice;                                                       (5)               Use the fare media provided only for commuting to or from work;                                         (6)               Not give or sell fare media to others, purchase fare media from                                                  another, or otherwise abuse this benefit.    False claims may be                                                  investigated and prosecuted; and,                                         (7)               Immediately notify the Commuter Transit Subsidy Benefit Program                                                  Coordinator in writing when he/she becomes ineligible for transit                                                   subsidy benefits for any reason.     Unused vouchers must be returned                                                  with this notification.       7                 PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION                                         a                Commuter Transit Subsidy Benefits:                                        (1)               Employees in the NCR who commute using qualified transit facilities                                                   or commuter highway vehicles will receive up to $65 per month (or                                                   the subsequent statutory limit), or their actual commuting cost                                                  whichever is less, in the form of a transit voucher, i.e., Metrochek                                                   supplied by the agency.                                        (2)               Outside of the NCR, employees who commute using qualified transit                                                   facilities or commuter highway vehicles will receive $30 per month,                                                   or their actual commuting cost whichever is less, in the form of a                                                   transit voucher supplied by the agency.    Agencies may elect to                                                  provide a greater subsidy amount for qualified expenses (up to $65                                                   per month or the subsequent statutory limit).                                        (3)               Outside of the NCR, where a voucher or similar item is not readily                                                   available for direct distribution and exchange, qualified employees                                                   will receive cash reimbursements at the end of the month.    This                                                   includes locations where the lowest denomination monthly transit                                                   voucher costs more than the normal amount of monthly benefits                                                  provided to employees.                                         (4)               Commuter transit subsidy benefits become effective on the date of                                                   the employee's signed application.     However, if the application is                                                   received after the 15th in any month, actual distribution of the                                                   faremedia will not be until the next month's distribution.                        b                Eligibility:                                         (1)               Participants must be USDA employees (i.e., full-time, part-time,                                                   temporaries, stay-in-school, etc.) who use qualified transit                                                  facilities or commuter highway vehicles for at least 50 percent of                                                   their regular monthly commuting trips, and who do not receive a free                                                   Federal Parking Benefit except as noted in b(2).                                        (2)               Drivers, alternate drivers, and passengers of qualified vanpools                                                   receiving a free Federal parking benefit are eligible for transit                                                   subsidy benefits.                         c                 Recordkeeping and Reporting:                                        (1)               Mission areas/agencies/staff offices must maintain records to                                                  ensure recording of and accounting for expenditures (i.e., transit                                                   passes or vouchers ordered, dispensed, accounted for, etc.) to                                                  ensure protection against loss and possible abuse.    Recordkeeping                                                  for those mission areas/agencies/staff offices participating in a                                                   Department-wide service agreement will be provided by the service                                                   provider to the Director of SHEWD;

Who is eligible to receive the  transit benefit?     The transit subsidy is for all  Federal employees, whether part-time, or temporary as long as the Federal  government is paying them. However volunteers are not permitted to participate,  nor are temporary employees who are assigned from private temporary services.     2.How do I apply for the transit  benefit?      Complete Form AD 1147. Prior to  completing this form you must make sure you meet the eligibility requirements.     3.What are the eligibility  requirements for transit subsidy?    Participants must be USDA employees  who use qualified transit facilities (subway, train, bus, ferry, or etc.) or  commuter highway vehicles (vanpool) for at least 50 percent of their regular  monthly commuting trips, and who do not receive a free Federal parking benefit  (vanpools are exempted from the free Federal parking).     4. What authority allows transit  subsidy to be provided to eligible employees within Department of Agriculture?     Public Law 102-486, Section 1911,  Treatment of Employer Provided transportation Benefits, effective December 31,  1992. Public Law 103-172, Federal employees Clean Air Incentives Act, effective  January 1, 1994. Internal Revenue Service Notice 94-3 dated 1994, Qualified  Transportation Fringes Under Code 26 USC, Section 132(f). Public law 105-178,  Transportation Equity Act of the 21st Century, dated June 9, 1998. Executive  order 13150 dated April 21, 2000. 26 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1,  Qualified Transportation Fringe Benefits.    5. Who administers the transit  subsidy program?    The Department of Transportation  (DOT).    6. Who should I contact when I have  a question about the transit subsidy program?    Your mission area/agency/staff  office transit coordinator. The list of coordinators can be obtained on this  website:  http://www.usda.gov/da/shmd/transitcoord.html      7.  Do I receive the monthly  maximum of $100.00 a month even though my actual monthly commute amount remains  $60.00?     No, the law states you will receive  the maximum amount of $100.00 or the actual commute cost, whichever is less. So,  your amount would remain $60.00 per month. For example: Mary Smith's monthly  commuting cost is $110 (so Mary would receive the maximum benefit of $100 per  month). Mary would receive $300 quarterly. Bob Dulles' monthly commuting cost is  $50. Bob would receive $150 quarterly.    8. When does the transit subsidy  become effective?     Commuter transit subsidy benefits  become effective on the date of the employee's signed application. However, in  the National Capital Region (NCR) if the application is received by DOT after  the 15th in any month, actual distribution of the fare media will not be until  the next month's distribution. Field applications received by DOT after the 5th  of any month will not receive benefits until the following month.     9. Are carpoolers eligible to  receive transit benefits?    No    10. Can employees apply for this  program at any time?     Yes, the program is open  continuously for new, change, or cancelled applications.     11. What is fare  media?      Fare media is the type of ticket or  pass you will receive to be used for monthly transit expenses.     12. When computing my monthly cost  how many working days should I use and can I include other  expenses?      You should use the exact number of  days you actually use mass public transportation or commuter highway vehicle  (vanpool). Do NOT include parking fees, gasoline costs, mileage, or etc. on the  AD-1147.    13. How, when, and where will fare  media be distributed to employees?     In the NCR fare media is distributed  quarterly and the distribution schedule is available on the following website:   http://www.usda.gov/oo/subsidyschedule.htm .  Distribution can occur monthly or quarterly based on arrangements made with  local mass transit companies and it is done by the procedures set by the local  coordinator.    14. When do I have to fill out a new  form?      If you have a change of name,  address, or monthly commuting cost you should fill out a new form. If you are  leaving the Agency, you should fill out the form and check the space for  cancellation. You should return any Metrocheks or Vouchers you have in your  possession with your application. Attach them to the form with a paperclip, not  a staple, and submit them to the transit coordinator. It is best if they are  returned in person and not through the mail system. If you are new to the  Agency, but have been in a Federal transit subsidy program before coming here,  you must still fill out a new transit application, and check the space for new  employee.    15.In the NCR, if I am not at work  during the quarterly distribution and I miss it, what can I do about  it?      After the quarterly distribution has  taken place, you can go to the DOT on the Plaza level and pick up your subsidy  at their TASC office. Take the subway to L'Enfant Plaza. Exit at the 7th & D  Street, S.W exit (DOT exit). Go up the escalator to the Plaza Level. Veer  slightly to the right and straight ahead, and go through the glass doors that  say Southwest Entrance. The guard will direct you to the TASC office on the  entry level. Show the clerk your USDA badge and provide the last 4 digits of  your social security number and you will receive the subsidy. Additionally, the  Department holds monthly make-up sessions in the rear of the South Building  cafeteria.    16.    Can another individual pick-up my fare  media for me?     No, you must pick-up your own fare  media.    17.    Do I need to present any identification  to pick-up my fare media?     Yes, you need either your Government  ID or driver's license.    18. Can I be reimbursed for prior  months when I am unable to pick-up my fare media during a particular  month?      No. If you miss a month, you may  only receive fare media for any remaining months in the quarterly distribution.  For example, if the quarterly distribution is for March-April-May and you miss  the March distribution dates, you can only receive fare media for April-May  during the make-up distribution dates.    19. What can I do if I am disabled  and have some difficulty picking up my subsidy?     USDA has made arrangements with the  TARGET Center on the first floor South Building to have your subsidy picked up  and distributed directly to you. You just need to contact them at 202-720-0600,  identify that you are a disabled user, and follow through on their instructions  for obtaining the quarterly subsidy.    20. Am I permitted to transfer my  subsidy to other family members, such as my husband or  children?      No, transfer of the transit subsidy  benefit is not permitted to anyone, whether family member, co-workers, or  others. Along the same lines, you may not sell the transit benefit to another  person. If you cannot use the subsidy, you should return it to your transit  coordinator. If you need to withdraw from the program, you should fill out a  form and note that you are canceling. You can always sign up for the program  again.    21. I am a disabled employee who  rides Metro Access. I need tokens to ride Metro Access; can I get tokens from  DOT?      No, actually you obtain your  Metrocheks and then take them downtown to Metro Center and get the Washington  Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) cashier to exchange the Metrocheks  for tokens. You can then use the tokens to pay Metro Access.     22. When I leave the Agency what do  I do about my transit benefit?     You must cancel your transit  application through your transit coordinator and they will calculate what you  need to return to the agency in unused fare media and it should be turned in at  that time.    23.What if I don't have enough fare  media to cover what I owe the government in fare media?     You will need to write a check to  the  Department of Agriculture  for the balance of your fare media.     24. What if I get a job in another  agency within the Department can I keep my unused transit  subsidy?      No, you must cancel your transit  application through your program coordinator and they will calculate what you  need to return to the agency in unused fare media and it should be turned in at  that time. When you get to your new agency the Human Resources staff will be  able to get you in contact with their transit coordinator to sign up in your new  Agency.    25.How should I return unused fare  media?      In person is the best option for  returning fare media. If this is not practical use a private shipping company  such as Federal Express, of United Parcel Service so you will have a receipt and  be able to track the delivery of your package. Regular mail is irradiated and  Metro will not accept irradiated cards, so if you use the regular mail to return  fare cards your Agency may hold you financially liable for your returned cards.  Remember that until your coordinator receives your fare media you are  financially responsible.    26. Will I be held financially  responsible for returned fare media that is damaged and cannot be returned to  the DOT for a refund to the agency?     This is up to the individual Agency  and will depend on the circumstances that caused the damage to the fare media.     27. Can I use my fare media to  travel between the USDA buildings during the day?     No, fare media is to be used for  traveling from your residence to your place of employment and return.     28. What do I do with my fare media  if I transfer within the same Agency but go to the field from the NCR or vice  versa?      If you use a form of mass transit at  your new location, you must change your transit application through your transit  coordinator and they will calculate what you need to return to the agency in  unused fare media and it should be turned in with the application. You must  return fare media because it is not interchangeable between systems. If you are  not going to use mass transit at your new location, then you must cancel your  application through your program coordinator and they will calculate what you  need to return to the agency in unused fare media.    29. Can I use my fare media on  travel from airport to hotel and vice versa?     No.    30. Are fare media replaced if lost  or stolen?      No, unless the agency authorizes to  pay a second time for the same fare media.    31.Can I put all my fare media I  receive for the quarter on my Smart Card, to my vanpool driver, or to VRE at one  time?      No, you may only use the fare media  for one month at a time. The application you signed when you entered the program  stated that: ""I certify that in any given month, I will not use the Government  provided transit benefit in excess of the statutory limit."" By using your fare  media at one time you are violating the agreement you signed when you applied  for the program.    32.In the NCR standing in line to  receive fare media is cumbersome. Can disbursement be done in a less time  consuming way?     No, not at this time. DOT and USDA  have set the procedure for distribution of fare media. They have worked together  to create more distribution points and expand times to reduce wait times and  this seems to be working.    33. My spouse drops me at work but I  take mass transit home am I eligible to receive a  benefit?      Yes, as long as you use a form of  mass transit for 50% of your regular commute between work and your residence.     34. If a person only uses mass  transit during bad weather or occasionally are they eligible for the  program?      No, unless the use of mass transit  makes up 50% of their commute regularly they are not eligible.     35. What if I have a change in the  way I commute or the cost, what do I need to do if  anything?      It is your responsibility to submit  an updated application to your program coordinator as soon as possible.     36. What should I do if I commute  less days in a month than I stated on the form for reasons of vacation, extended  sickness, etc.?     You will reduce your next quarterly  pick-up amount by the amount you have left. You will be required to inform the  DOT agent that you should receive less and tell them the amount. It requires you  being honest.    37. Some areas receive a cash  reimbursement, who determines who gets cash and who gets fare  media?      DOT has entered into agreements with  mass transit companies all over the country and anywhere that fare media is not  available we are authorized to pay a cash reimbursement to eligible employees.  DOT determines who will get cash and who will get fare media.     38. Can fare media be provided more  than 3 months in advance?     No, the IRS code only authorizes a  3-month advance of fare media.    39. How do I replace a demagnetized  metrochek?      You can ask a metro station  attendant for an envelope to mail the tickets back to Metro for replacements;  or, you can take them to Metro Center Sales Office.    40. Will DOT replace a demagnetized  metrochek for USDA employees?     No, USDA does not have an agreement  with DOT to replace demagnetized metrocheks. There would be an additional charge  to the organization to replace them.    41. Where can I exchange Metrocheks  for the Marc train or other fare media?     Go to the website  http://www.wmata.com/ and across the top of the  screen select  FARE ; then click on  Metrocheks  ; and then click  on  Metrochek exchange sites                 PRE-TAX PARKING                        GUIDANCE           United States   Department of   Agriculture     Office of the   Assistant Secretary   for Administration     Office of   Human  Resources   Management     1400 Independence   Avenue SW   Washington,  DC   20250-9600     February 28, 2002     TO:                 Deputy Administrators for Management     FROM:           Donna D. Beecher/signed by Joseph Colantuoni                          Director     SUBJECT:     Pre-Tax Parking      The Office of General Counsel has provided guidance that  clarifies the authority and eligibility for employees to exclude certain parking  expenses from their taxable income (pre-tax parking).  This benefit is  provided for by Executive Order 13150, Code of Federal Regulations 1.132.9, and  5 United States Code 7905.     Based on the above, any mission area/agency/staff office  may authorize pre-tax parking for their eligible employees.  Where there is  bargaining unit representation, mission areas/agencies/staff offices must  fulfill any labor/management obligations.     For simplicity, we are providing this guidance in the  attached questions and answer format.  If you have any questions please  contact Marge Adams at (202) 720-3286 or e-mail:   marjoriea.adams@usda.gov.     Attachment           PRE-TAX PARKING FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND  ANSWERS           Q: Which employees are eligible for pre-tax parking?      A: Employees who park at eligible parking locations and who  also meet any of the additional qualifying criteria as presented here.      Q: What are eligible parking locations?     A: A metro-parking lot, commercial lot, privately owned  parking lot, parking garage, parking meter, or employer provided parking.      Q: What are the additional qualifying criteria?     A: An employee must either take mass transportation, or  ride in a vanpool, or in a carpool of two or more persons from the parking  location to work.     Q: Can an employee driving a vanpool or carpool and parking  in an eligible location be authorized pre-tax parking?     A: Yes.  Example:  The primary driver of a  vanpool or carpool that parks in a commercial lot (or other eligible parking  location), and whose members then walk to work is eligible for pre-tax  parking.     Q: Can a single occupant of a vehicle who drives to work,  parks at an eligible parking location, and does NOT take mass transportation,  and does NOT ride in a vanpool or carpool from that location be authorized  pre-tax parking?     A: No.  The intent of the program is to encourage  employees to use mass transportation, a vanpool, or carpool and to discourage  the use of single occupancy vehicles to travel to work.     Q: How do employees apply for pre-tax parking?     A: Eligible employees should submit an application to their  designated transit subsidy coordinator.  The transit subsidy coordinator  will submit the approved application to the servicing personnel office for  inputting into the National Finance Center personnel/payroll system.     Q: Is a written policy required to implement pre-tax  parking?     A: No.     Q: Is proof of the cost of parking required?     A: Yes.  It may be in the form of a parking lot  receipt or, if no receipt is provided, the application itself will  suffice.     Q: Is the National Finance Center able to process pre-tax  parking applications?     A: Yes.  NFC instructions were previously provided to  operating personnel offices   on August 31,  1999, and remain in effective.  The entry is done through the Allowance  Screen of PRES (Payroll/Personnel Remote Entry System).     Q: What document is used to report the amount of an  employee’s pre-tax parking to the Internal Revenue Service?     A: The W-2 Form.     Q:    How is the pre-tax parking benefit  computed in the personnel/payroll system?   A:    The answer is based on an example of a  GS-15, Step 5 in the 30% Tax Bracket and claiming $180.00 a month for pre-tax  parking.   You  would take $180 x 12 (months) divided by 26 pay periods.    This would equate to $83.07.    The GS-15, Step 5 gross salary is  $3,881.60 (depending on locality).     Subtract the $83.07 from the $3,881.60 ($3,798.53).    Taxes are then calculated on the  $3,798.53, if this was the only allowance the employee had.                                       RESOURCE LINK           IRS Final  Regulation on Qualified Transportation -(PDF)           United States Department of  Agriculture  |  Departmental  Administration   USDA Privacy  Policy  |  Accessibility  Statement     For further information contact  marjoriea.adams@usda.gov     Last updated: 10/18/02"
GX045-65-2045612	"Albuquerque's Environmental Story   Environmental Topic:   Transportation:  Its Role in the City   by Dawn Matson and Mary Hardison       Background and Problems    Two of the most serious problems that the Albuquerque area faces today are transportation issues: traffic congestion and air pollution.  Since 1960, the local population has doubled, yet transportation capacity, in all of its forms, has not doubled.  The result has been increasing traffic congestion.  Traffic congestion creates problems because it lengthens and makes uncertain the amount of time required to drive from one place to another; creates extra pollution since cars stuck idling in heavy traffic pollute more than cars that are moving; causes more traffic accidents; and burdens drivers and their passengers with increased levels of stress.     Residents of Albuquerque cherish this area's wide open spaces.  In recent years, more and more of these spaces have been developed for residential use.  As the local population has increased, and as the need for affordable housing has become more acute, more people have chosen to live on the fringes of the city.  Yet because the rapid growth on the fringes has been primarily residential, most of those residents must commute to jobs in more densely populated areas of the city.  This necessity has not only added to the traffic congestion in the major employment centers (Kirtland Air Force Base, UNM, Uptown, Downtown, and the north I-25 industrial corridor), it has also lengthened the average daily trip, sending additional air pollutants into an already sensitive environment.      Five-Part Solution    Solution of the city's two-pronged transportation problem  consists of five components:  moving traffic more efficiently on existing roads, building new roads,  increasing mass transit ridership, expanding use of alternate forms of transportation such as carpooling and bicycling,  and reducing the number of (or changing the timing of) work trips. Pursuing any one of these components individually will not solve the problem in the long term; each part must be carefully weighed and balanced with the others to create a solution that meets Albuquerque's transportation needs while taking into account local geography, values, and lifestyles.     Road Building    Road building is the most commonly used method for improving transportation in an area.  When they are not at full capacity, roads provide easy and direct movement between areas.  But building another road is becoming an increasingly difficult way to provide greater transportation capacity.  Albuquerque has some major natural barriers to road expansion--the Rio Grande, the Sandia Mountains, the western escarpment, and many arroyos.  More important, unfettered road building can erode the quality of life in an area and ruin the livability of neighborhoods.  Roadway noise, automobile emissions, and traffic diverting through side streets in search of a short-cut can quickly strip away the serenity of a neighborhood.  While a basic level of roadway capacity is required in Albuquerque, building more roads is not always the best transportation solution.     Tools for Better Use of Roads    Making efficient use of existing roads is easier today with a wide range of congestion management tools. Congestion management tools are designed to smooth traffic flow and reduce stop-and-go traffic.  The tools can be as simple as synchronizing signals along a busy stretch of road to allow traffic to move at the posted speed with few stops.  The tools can be as sophisticated as designating some freeway lanes as high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, for use only by mass transit and carpools during peak commuting periods or throughout the day.  Ramp metering--using a traffic signal near the beginning of a freeway on-ramp--may be used to prevent cars from entering the freeway in bunches and causing the traffic to slow dramatically or stop.  Albuquerque is working to improve traffic signal synchronization and continues to research other congestion management techniques for keeping traffic, particularly peak-hour traffic, moving smoothly.     Mass Transit    Mass transit is a very effective method for moving large numbers of people quickly with few vehicles and reduced air pollution.  Albuquerque currently has a mass transit service that includes buses for general ridership (Sun Tran) and by-reservation vans for those with impaired mobility (Sun Van).  Mass transit is particularly useful in meeting the transportation needs of those who do not own cars, whether due to economic hardship, by choice, or because of physical limitations.      In an effort to expand the role and effectiveness of mass transit in Albuquerque, the city is now putting an emphasis on intermodal transportation.  Intermodal  transportation centers around mass transportation in all of its forms (light rail, heavy rail, city bus, and intercity bus), allowing connections between them and with other modes of transportation such as walking, bicycling, and driving.  As part of the emphasis on intermodal transportation, the city is investigating possibilities for future light-rail development in Albuquerque. Additionally, more Park & Ride lots are being developed to meet the particular needs of commuters in outlying areas of the city.  Park & Ride lots are becoming increasingly popular, allowing those who do not live near a bus stop to drive to a lot, park their car for free, and ride a bus to their destination.       Mass Transit Hampered    Albuquerque's existing land development patterns in many ways hamper the efficiency of mass transit.  Sprawling, low-density development increases the number of vehicles needed to serve an area with mass transportation.  Neighborhoods with numerous cul-de-sacs and enclosed by high walls prevent pedestrians from walking short distances to a bus stop.  All but private automobile use is dissuaded by  wide streets lacking amenities such as safe crosswalks, shade trees, benches, and simply a pleasant atmosphere.  Streets lined with large parking lots discourage transit trips to the stores located deep behind the parking lots.  For mass transit to work effectively, land use and development must progress with the transit rider in mind.     More Alternatives      Use of alternate forms of transportation is not new.  Until the 1960s, many American households owned one vehicle, and carpooled with neighbors to stretch that one vehicle to meet every family member's trip needs.  Today, carpooling is a cheap, easy, and relatively popular commuting method.  On the large scale, carpooling reduces traffic congestion and air pollution, on the personal scale, it saves money, time (in some cases), and stress.  The city of Albuquerque Transit & Parking Department administers RIDEPOOL, a free ride-matching service to the community.  RIDEPOOL participants can be matched with someone who has a similar schedule, home address, and travel destination who can travel with them by carpool, vanpool, or even bicycle.  Carpooling is a very versatile tool for increasing transportation capacity in the area.    Other forms of alternate transportation that work well in the Albuquerque area are bicycling and walking.  Because of the dry, relatively mild climate, walking or biking to work is feasible most days of the year.  Bicycle commuting is most likely to occur when the travel distance is ten miles or less.  Walking to work can be difficult in Albuquerque, since it is increasingly unlikely that one will live a mile or less from work.  Walking, however, serves as a terrific link to other modes of transportation, such as riding the bus or carpooling.  Of course, walking and bicycling to work are very healthful forms of transportation that give something back to the commuter.    Bicycling Comes Into Its Own    The bicycle is a low-cost and effective means of transportation. It is quiet, non-polluting,  and energy efficient. In the pre-automobile era, the bicycle was popular as a transportation  mode in the United States. The bicycle geared to short trips lost its popularity with the  mass production of the automobile, which gave people opportunities to live further from  employment centers.    Today, local, State and Federal agencies are incorporating bikeways (i.e., bike lanes/routes and trails) into the existing transportation system as a means of providing travel choices.  Bicycle studies have revealed that more people are willing to bicycle more frequently if  better bikeways are provided that link destinations as such employment centers, schools,  shopping centers, parks, and entertainment/recreational activity centers.   For the first time, the City of Albuquerque has taken a more comprehensive approach in  meeting bicyclists needs for on-street bikeways. A Comprehensive Bike Plan is being  prepared which will address reduction of automobile use and increase in bicycling. The  goal of the plan is to significantly increase the bicycle commute mode share and reduce  the number of bicycle fatalities and injuries by 2020.   To accomplish this task, the existing bikeway system was inventoried to determine which  bike lanes/routes needed improvements. In addition, all collectors and arterials were  inventoried to determine the feasibility of bike lanes and connections to destinations.  The  National Bicycling and Walking Study, Case Study 1  revealed that communities  with more bike lanes on collectors and arterials would increase bicycling since these  bikeways connect into destinations. (A collector is a street that funnels traffic from  local/residential streets to the main thoroughfares, the arterials.) As the future bikeway  system is developed, funding to implement both bike routes/ lanes needed to be identified.  Currently, five percent of the local transportation funds are dedicated to on-street  bikeways and off-street paths/trails. Additional funds are available from Federal  transportation and air quality funds, which compete with other transportation construction,  service, or enhancement projects. At the current funding level, it will take the City of  Albuquerque a minimum of 40 years to complete its on-street bikeway system.   The trail network is an integral part of the bikeway system and can not be overlooked due  to the numerous barriers within the metropolitan area such as rivers, interstates, drainage  channels, and arroyos. Like the on-street bikeway system, the trail network serves both  commuting and recreational travel. Many times on-street bikeway facilities are not viable,  but development of a trail system that interconnects to the street system and vice versa  provides access to and from destinations for bicyclists. This can be seen with the Paseo  del Bosque Trail and the North Diversion Channel Trail that are primary north/south  bikeways connecting the city. Approximately half of the identified primary trails proposed  in the  Bikeways Master Plan  have been constructed. Other trails are identified in  the  Trails and Bikeways Facility Plan  that interconnect both the primary trails and  the on-street bikeway system. These trails can be paved or unpaved trails meeting the  needs of equestrians, pedestrians and bicyclists. At historic funding levels, it is estimated  to take approximately 10 years to complete the primary trail network not including major  grade-separated crossings, which are very expensive.   While the provision of bikeways is an essential component to increase both commuting  and recreational bicycling in the community, other elements are important. Other issues  include bicycle connectivity to transit corridors and centers, park and ride lots, and  on-site bicycle facilities. Efforts are underway to encourage developments to provide  secure, short and/or long-term bicycle parking. In addition, showers/lockers are  recommended during the commercial and recreational development proposals and  in the City's work with existing and future employers.    Other Alternatives    Reducing the need for trips or changing their timing are other valuable tools for reducing air pollution and freeing up roadway capacity.  Telecommuting and condensed work weeks allow employees to put in full work weeks, yet make fewer trips to the office.  Businesses using a four-day, ten-hour work week reduce their commuting trips by twenty percent.  Flexible work hours allow employees to travel at times of the day when traffic congestion is lower, reducing the time they spend on the road and the resulting auto emissions.      Reducing auto emissions and traffic congestion in Albuquerque requires a careful balancing and application of each transportation tool available.  Thoughtfully applied, land use and development patterns can allow those tools to work as they were designed.  No single mode of transportation meets the needs of every individual in the city; most would benefit from using a combination of the modes.  By making all transportation modes available and as effective as possible, the city can block the one-two punch of air pollution and traffic congestion in the future.        Options and Opinions     Discussion Questions     1.   Should we spend a larger percentage of our tax money on development of facilities for alternative sources of transportation?   2.   What forms of mass transportation would best serve the needs of the people of Albuquerque?   3.   How can people be made aware of the problems associated with overuse of the family car?  How can they be encouraged to change their transportation habits?   4.   How could more people be encouraged to use bikes for transportation?     Possible Solutions/Devil's Advocate Opinions     A.   A high priority should be given to funding an improved public transportation system.   B.   Cars are the most convenient form of transportation, and people do not want to cut back on their use, so we should build new roads to relieve congestion.   C.   We should improve and maintain existing roads, but not build new ones.   D.   We should build more roads and develop facilities for improved public transportation.   E.   Drivers could benefit from education about alternatives to driving alone in their cars  (single occupancy vehicles or SOVs).   F.   Driving alone is an American freedom and should be protected at all costs including air pollution, traffic noise, and energy consumption.   G.   Since air pollution causes illness and death, SOVs should be outlawed.   H.   Road building and mass transportation improvements should be considered together.     Activities     1.   Prepare a questionnaire to determine attitudes concerning automobile use versus public transportation for adults and teenagers.  Distribute this questionnaire to a statistically selected sampling of students, parents, and teachers.  Discuss findings.  Prepare a summary to be shared with the school population and with the entire community.   2.   Set up a chart to show the impact of the automobile on us as individuals and on society.  Consider cost of purchase and operational costs; all automobile-related taxes; land-use effects; all effects on health, including accidents and air pollution; noise; congestion; and psychological effects on the community.  Is a non-polluting car a sufficient solution to the problem of overuse of the automobile?  In a similar way, set up a chart showing the role the automobile plays in our economy, and how the economy might be affected if we decreased sharply our use of cars.   3.   Find out if a transportation corridor is currently under consideration for development or improvement. Have the class do research to prepare its own Environmental Impact Statement concerning this corridor. Compare their statement with the one prepared by public agencies.  Find out in what ways the public is involved in decisions about the corridor.   4.   Devise alternative transportation plans for Albuquerque metropolitan area.  Consider such approaches as: rearranged traffic flow patterns; new approaches to our present bus system; innovative forms of mass transportation; increased use of bicycles.  Present promising plans to the governmental entity responsible for transportation in your area.   5.   Have student prepare a rebus game about alternatives to the automobile.   6.   Write Public Service Announcements about ride sharing, biking, riding public transportation, or walking as alternatives to use of the family car.  Make up jingles, slogans, or 10-second remarks.   7.   Take a trip by public bus.  Use a map of the city to trace the route used.  List all the interesting, attractive, and unattractive places passed by the bus.  Discuss.  Write ""blurbs"" for the school paper telling other classes why they should use Suntran for class trips.   8.   Contact the Transit and Parking Department for a map of existing bike ways.  Have students use the map to answer the following questions:    What symbols are used for bike lanes?  Bike trails?  Bike routes?  Name two streets that have bike lanes.  How many bike trails does Albuquerque have at this time?  What are their names?  Using the mileage scale, approximately how many miles are there at present of bike trails, bike routes, and bike lanes?   What bike routes would you use to get from your house to Winrock or Coronado?  To the University of New Mexico?  To Downtown?
