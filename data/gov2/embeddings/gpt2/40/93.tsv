GX244-12-13779335	"Chesapeake Bay                           Chesapeake Bay Monitoring       ""Monitoring for Management Actions""                          1. introduction        The State of Maryland is actively pursuing a management policy to protect       and restore the economic and recreational value of Chesapeake Bay. To       assist in this goal, the Maryland Office of Environmental Programs (OEP)       has designed and implemented a Chesapeake Bay Water Quality Monitoring       Program. The purpose of this program is to provide State managers and       policy makers with accurate, timely and comprehensive information about the       Bay's existing condition and how it is responding to management       initiatives. This information is required to evaluate current management       policies and to formulate new goals and policies in the future. Perhaps       most importantly, the results of the monitoring effort will provide a       yardstick with which to measure progress towards the ultimate goal of       protecting and restoring Chesapeake Bay.

Measurable       progress can be expected only when this information is used in the       development, implementation and evaluation of management actions.       Furthermore, the struggle toward progress will be difficult in the face of       mounting population pressures. A long-term commitment to develop and       maintain technically sound management plans is the only real hope for       success in restoring vitality to Chesapeake Bay.              Presented here are the results of the first two years of the monitoring       program.  During this period (summer 1984 through summer 1986) a major       campaign has been initiated to reveal the present condition of the Bay in       quantitative terms, to assess how the Bay is changing in response to       management decisions, and to determine the causes of the current decline.       At this early stage in the program, an unprecedented understanding of the       Bay's current condition has already been achieved. It is this developing       understanding of current conditions that will be the focus of this report.       Future reports will examine in more detail the Bay's response to management       actions and some of the underlying causes of the Bay's problems.               PROGRAM FORMULATION              In order to insure that the OEP effort is capable of supporting effective       management actions, it is imperative that the program be logically       formulated. Past experiences indicate that the probability of success in       satisfying this program's objective will be enhanced because the following       elements were considered during the initial program design:          A clear statement of the relevant  management      issues  to be addressed,           The development of specific  management      questions  that define the information needed      for management actions,          The  design  of a technically sound and practical sampling program,          A timely  analysis, interpretation  and presentation of  results,  and         The development of  management policies       and actions.   The remainder of this chapter will present a discussion of each of these       five elements using examples to demonstrate the actual processes that were       followed. A further discussion of the last step, development of management       actions and policies, will be presented in the  final chapter .            MANAGEMENT ISSUES              The first task that managers and scientists face before they can initiate       efforts to restore the health of the Chesapeake Bay and its major       tributaries is to clearly define what the major management issues are.       Success in restoring the Bay will logically depend on a clear       conceptualization of the problems we are trying to correct. This       conceptualization of the management issues will then lead to specific       actions that are perceived as necessary to bring about a recovery. Of       course, the definition of management issues and management actions will       significantly impact the design of the monitoring program and the ultimate       application and utility of the monitoring results.              In 1983, the Environmental Protection Agency and the States of Maryland and       Virginia completed a seven year, $27 million program to characterize the       existing state of the Bay, to study the causes of the observed declines in       the Bay, and to propose strategies needed to begin corrective measures.       Relying on available historical data and supplemental information collected       by the EPA/States program, the major management issues were identified as:            Declining levels of oxygen in Bay waters,          Increasing levels of phytoplankton (microscopic plants) due to nutrient       enrichment,          The presence of toxic materials, and          Declines in living resources.   Once the broad management issues were defined, there was a need to develop       more specific questions that would guide future management actions and       serve as a focus for evaluating their success or failure. Answers to these       management questions are the pieces of information necessary to develop       technically sound actions and policies.               MANAGEMENT QUESTIONS              Management questions were formulated for each of the major management       issues presented above. Consideration was given to the information already       available from existing monitoring and research programs. Some of the       management questions were relatively well studied by the State, and       sufficient information was available to continue existing management plans.       For several of the management questions, the available data was determined  to be insufficient to develop revised or new management strategies.              To illustrate the concept, examples of management questions formulated for       each of the management issues are given below:              Decreasing Oxygen Levels:            Where are the major areas of low dissolved oxygen waters in the Chesapeake       Bay      System?       Is the areal extent of low dissolved oxygen water expanding over time?       Which pollutant inputs are most responsible for the low oxygen conditions?        Increasing Phytoplankton Levels:            Where are phytoplankton blooms a major problem?       Has the severity of phytoplankton blooms in impacted areas, such as the      Potomac and Patuxent Rivers, decreased since 1980 when management       initiatives      were being implemented?       What is the relationship between nutrient levels and phytoplankton biomass?   Toxicants:            Where are the major concentrations of heavy metals in the sediments of the      Bay?       Are toxicants levels in the sediments of historically impacted areas, such       as      Baltimore Harbor, decreasing?       Are toxicants that are accumulating in the sediments also entering the food      chain?   Resources:            Where is striped bass spawning succeeding or failing in the Bay system?       Are oyster stocks declining?       What environmental factors, for example food resources and acidity, are      correlated with spawning success of fish in nursery regions?                                                Examination of the spectrum of major management questions revealed that       they could be separated into 3 major categories:            Questions about the spatial and temporal characterization of each problem          Questions about observed trends in time          Questions about processes and causes relating to the major management       issues   These three categories of management questions thus became the guiding       objectives for designing the monitoring program. The specific physical,       chemical and biological components of Bay water quality that were chosen       for monitoring were those considered necessary to adequately address the       major management issues.              The first two objectives of the monitoring program - characterization and       trend - were considered to be goals that were fully-achievable by the       monitoring program. At this time an initial characterization using the       monitoring results is possible, although we will achieve greater confidence       and reliability in this assessment with several years of data. The initial       characterization is the subject of this report. The identification of       trends will be an ongoing objective as management actions are continually       being evaluated. The third objective - processes and causes - requires a       synthesis of monitoring data with research and modeling programs to achieve       definitive answers to most management questions in this category. There are       also management questions that are not fully covered under the water       quality program such as those related to living resources; these questions       are being addressed by other State programs specific to this problem.       Nonetheless, there are important questions relating to living resources       that cannot be answered without the comprehensive perspective of the       current water quality monitoring program.               DESIGN OF SAMPLING PROGRAM                The design of the present monitoring program is predicated upon the       management issues and questions discussed above. The program will only be       successful to the degree that it can ultimately respond with sound answers       to the management questions being posed. Thus, in assembling the program       details, the attainment of these answers was always the foremost       consideration.              To reach its stated goals, it is essential that the program be technically       sound. State-of-the-art scientific knowledge was incorporated into all       phases of the monitoring design to assure technically defensible results.       For each discipline contained in the monitoring program, OEP scientists       solicited technical reviews from recognized experts.              To be implemented effectively and sustained for the time necessary to yield       results, the monitoring program also needs to be logistically and       economically practical. This means that the program is scaled properly, is       efficient, measures the minimum number of the meaningful variables, and is       flexible enough to change when necessary.              Finally, the complex physical, chemical and biological processes       characteristic of estuarine systems must be considered in the design of an       effective monitoring program. Without a solid understanding of how these       processes influence the selection of variables to be measured, sampling       frequencies, measurement methods, and data analyses techniques, the results       will have limited application to management policy formulations. A       description of these important processes and how they influence the       problems facing Chesapeake Bay is contained in the    next     chapter .              A brief description of the overall program design is presented in         Chapter       3 . In each subsequent chapter that addresses elements of the monitoring       program, more specific aspects of the program design are discussed prior to       the presentation of results.               ANALYSIS, INTERPRETATION, AND RESULTS              A critical step that determines the usefulness of the monitoring program is       the analysis of date, interpretation of the findings and presentation of       results. This final link is necessary to bring the wealth of information       collected under the monitoring program into coherent and usable products.       These products complete the sequence of events that allow the program to       fulfill its objective of providing management with a valuable planning and       assessment tool. Too often, ambitious and well-intentioned programs have       floundered at this crucial final stage.              In order for the monitoring data to be used in the decision making process,       it must first be meaningfully analyzed by one or more objective techniques.       For some applications, a simple graphical analysis may suffice because the       patterns are obvious or the analysis is exploratory in nature such as       examining potential cause and effect relationships. Graphical analysis is       also valuable for the preliminary phases of data analysis when, in many       cases, insufficient data is available to warrant specific statistical       tests. Graphical representations of the data are the principal products in       this report because we are presently in the preliminary phases of data       analysis.              In more rigorous levels of data analysis, objective statistical techniques       are applied to evaluate hypotheses. Hypotheses, in the context of the       monitoring program, are simply a formulation of the management questions       into a statistically testable statement. For example, one of the management       questions stated above concerning increased phytoplankton levels and the       effectiveness of management initiatives since 1980 could be formulated into       the following specific hypothesis: Phytoplankton levels in the tidal fresh       area of the Potomac River during summer have not changed since 1980. An       appropriate statistical test could then be applied to either accept or       reject this hypothesis. If the hypothesis was rejected and levels actually       were shown to decline since 1980, the management question concerning trends       in phytoplankton for this region would be answered. The use of statistics       must be very carefully applied, however, paying particular attention to the       assumptions of each technique in relation to the data that is available       from the monitoring program. In fact, the requirements of statistical       testing was one of the critical factors considered in the program's design       to insure that appropriate data would be collected.              Once the monitoring data has been analyzed, the results must be interpreted       in the context of the management decisions that will depend upon this       information. Often, there will be numerous specific results from several       different monitoring elements that must be synthesized into a unified       finding about a particular management issue. It is also important that the       results from the monitoring data be accompanied by some statement of the       confidence, or scientific uncertainty, that should be associated with a       particular finding. Confidence in the findings could include limits on the       estimates of particular measurements of the Bay's condition or limits on       the geographical locations to which a result may apply.              Finally, the interpretation of results should conclude with recommendations       for management policies. This is the culmination of the sequence of events       upon which that entire program is based. It presents managers with a       suggested course of action based upon the careful evaluation of monitoring       results. Of course, there are other considerations, as will be discussed in       the following paragraphs, that also influence the final decisions on       management policies and actions.               MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND ACTIONS              The degree to which OEP's monitoring program results are incorporated into       the formulation of management policy and actions directed towards Bay       restoration will determine the true efficacy of the program.              In almost all management decisions aimed at restoring the Bay, several       issues must be considered. First, there is the technical foundation for the       decision. This is where the monitoring program is expected to be a powerful       tool. Sometimes the monitoring data will be used in conjunction with       computer models to provide an added dimension of forecasting the outcome of       a variety of potential management strategies. Results from research studies       may also provide technical input in the area of cause-and-effect       relationships.              Other important considerations that will bear upon a final management       policy are the priorities of citizens who could be affected by the       decision, the economics of the decision and the available technology to       support the implementation of a particular management policy.              In the end, however, it is the monitoring program that will provide the       verdict on the success of individual or collective management decisions.       These evaluations will either lead to a strengthening of our original       management positions or to a reformulation of strategies to provide more       effective measures aimed at restoring the Bay's health.              A more detailed description of the strategies that will be used in the       development of policies and management actions will be the subject of the        final chapter .

GX268-78-7245938	"MARYLAND COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT P ROGRAM SECTION 309 STRATEGY (2000-2005)  May 3, 2001  Prepared by: Coastal Zone Management Division Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service Maryland Department of Natural Resources Tawes State Office Building, E-2 Annapolis, MD 21401   Introduction The Maryland Coastal Zone Management Program has identified two general areas to concentrate efforts for the Section 309 Coastal Enhancement Strategy: (1) Coastal Hazards - shore erosion, hazard mitigation strategies, and sea level rise and (2) Cumulative and Secondary Impacts - watershed restoration action strategies. Each of these areas were identified as a high priority during the State's Section 309 Assessment, which reviewed and commented on all nine enhancement areas found in the Coastal Zone Management Act. This strategy focuses on filling gaps recognized under these enhancement areas in the Assessment. In addition, the Assessment identified two areas where future Section 309 Strategies may be appropriate: Cumulative and Secondary Impacts - Marine Protected Areas and Public Access. At this time, there is not enough information to develop complete strategies for these initiatives; however, Maryland feels that these initiatives are important. With this in mind, the Maryland CZM Program will use other resources to begin research into these enhancement areas. The State reserves the right to add these initiatives to the 2001-2005 Section 309 Strategy at a later date, if deemed appropriate. Overview of Proposed Budget The following table is an overview of a Strategy. Section 309 Enhancement Area Coastal Hazards - Shore Erosion, Hazard Mitigation Planning and Sea Level Rise Cumulative and Secondary Impacts - Watershed Restoration Action Strategies Totals Strategy Format The remainder of this strategy will be divided into the two Section 309 enhancement areas. For each, the following components are included: (1) summary of problem, (2) proposed program changes, (3) anticipated effects, (4) appropriateness of program change, (5) fiscal and technical needs, (6) budget, (7) workplan, and (8) likelihood of success. proposed budget for the 2001-2005 Maryland Section309 FY 2001 $250,000 FY 2002 $250,000 FY 2003 $250,000 FY 2004 $250,000 FY 2005 $250,000  $270,000  $270,000  $270,000  $270,000  $270,000  $520,000  $520,000  $520,000  $520,000  $520,000  2   C S Issue Summary HORE  OASTAL  E  ROSION  HAZARDS AND SEA LEVEL R  ISE  The coastal zone in Maryland comprises 66% of the total land area of the State. Bordering this coastal area is over 4,300 miles of shoreline along the Atlantic Ocean, coastal bays and Chesapeake Bay, and its tributaries. These shoreline areas are affected by a variety of hazards, particularly coastal erosion and sea level rise. Coastal hazards represent significant threats to resources and infrastructure in Maryland's coastal zone. Shoreline erosion is an ongoing problem; Maryland loses approximately 260 acres of land each year to shore erosion. The unconsolidated nature of many shoreline sediments make them particularly susceptible to erosive forces. In addition, extensive stretches of shoreline are exposed to a large fetch and thereby are threatened by both storm-induced erosion and chronic wave action. The impacts of erosion include the loss of land and its associated economic, cultural and ecological values and degraded water quality resulting from increased sediment and nutrient loads. Reduced water quality, in turn, impacts living resources. Shore erosion is compounded by the effects of sea level rise, which increases the areas exposed to and affected by erosion. The historical average rate of sea level rise in Maryland is between 3-4 mm per year or 1 foot per century, a rate nearly twice the global average. However, current scientific research shows that continued climate change will accelerate sea level rise rates, resulting in a rise of two to three feet along Maryland's shores by the year 2100 (Leatherman et al., 1995). Currently, the State does not have a comprehensive approach to either managing shore erosion or addressing the impacts of sea level rise. A coordinated approach to coastal hazard mitigation is necessary to effectively and efficiently manage coastal resources and plan future development. Proposed Program Changes The proposed Coastal Hazards Strategy includes three main components: (1) development of a comprehensive shore erosion management plan; (2) adoption and implementation of sea level rise response recommendations; and (3) development or update of local hazard mitigation plans. A statewide Comprehensive Shore Erosion Management Plan will be developed for adoption by Maryland. This will be a multi-year effort requiring the collection of new data and the development of new products from existing data sets. Development of a comprehensive plan will be accomplished by: (1) collecting and interpreting critical data and information; (2) developing a sea level rise predictive model; (3) developing and executing regional management strategies; and (4) continuing and expanding public outreach and education activities. 3   Second, the Department of Natural Resources recently adopted the 2000 document entitled Sea Level Response Strategy for Maryland as a guideline for addressing sea level rise issues in the state. The Strategy outlines a number of key activities which could be undertaken to further sea level rise planning, including: outreach and engagement; technology, data, and research support; targeting ongoing state initiatives to include sea level rise response mechanisms; and amending existing state and local statutes related to coastal hazards and resource management. This four-pronged approach will result in an integrated policy to mitigate the effects of sea level rise. Concurrent with state-level planning for shore erosion control and sea level rise, local governments will identify areas at risk for coastal flooding and storm surge events through development of Local Hazard Mitigation Plans. Very few coastal communities currently have hazard mitigation plans because they lack either the resources or the expertise to develop effective plans. The few plans that have been developed need to be updated and reviewed for sufficiency and effectiveness. In coordination with the Maryland Emergency Management Agency, the Maryland Department of the Environment and coastal counties, Coastal Zone Management Section 309 funding will be used to aid in the development of approximately two Local Hazard Mitigation Plans at the county level per year. These plans will serve as a mechanism to further state planning for shore erosion control and sea level rise mitigation and will reduce future local impacts associated with coastal hazards. Anticipated Effects of Program Change The efforts described in this strategy address critical and long term issues including future coastal development and land use; natural resource protection; public safety; and infrastructure repair and replacement cost management. The initial collection of data and information and the subsequent development of a comprehensive shore erosion control plan and local hazard mitigation plans and the adoption and implementation of sea level rise strategy recommendations will provide critical tools to state and local managers. Anticipated outcomes include:  Regional Shore Erosion Control Planning: Partnerships between DNR and local governments will be expanded to include all counties in Maryland. Through these partnerships, Maryland CZM will prioritize stretches of shoreline for erosion control activities, review ongoing planning initiatives, create impact pilot studies, develop ranking criteria, and utilize modeling tools to evaluate stretches of shoreline for shore erosion control. The final product will identify strategies for shore erosion control to be used along particular stretches of shoreline. These strategies may include: structural and non-structural erosion control devices, designation of natural erosion areas, land acquisition, and establishment of local erosion-based setback requirements.  Development of a Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan: The regional plans described above will be combined and incorporated into a statewide Comprehensive Shore Erosion Management Plan. The Comprehensive Plan will provide statewide focus for managing state financial and technical support for local communities and identifying local areas of state concern. The Plan will also provide the opportunity for information sharing between similarly affected 4         counties. Sea Level Rise Data Collection and Modeling: LIDAR data will be collected to provide detailed elevation contours for coastal counties. The newly-acquired topographic data will be used to create a model that will identify areas potentially vulnerable to increased erosion due to sea level rise and other on-going coastal processes. Implementation of Sea Level Rise Response Mechanisms: The Maryland CZM will follow through on appropriate recommendations outlined in the Sea Level Rise Response Strategy for Maryland, including increased public outreach and technical assistance as well as working to target ongoing state initiatives to include sea level rise response mechanisms. Development of Local Hazard Mitigation Plans: Several state agencies will coordinate with local communities to develop Local Hazard Mitigation Plans to identify and plan for an assortment of hazards including coastal hazards.  Improved planning in all these areas will result in reduced financial losses to both public and private entities, fewer losses of natural resources through habitat protection, increased emergency management information, and improved coordination and cooperation between management entities. Appropriateness of Program Change A number of documents recently completed by the Maryland Coastal Zone Management Program and other state agencies highlight the need for improved planning for shore erosion control and sea level rise. First, the Final Report of the Governor's Shore Erosion Task Force (2000) and the Sea Level Rise Response Strategy for Maryland (2000) both found deficiencies in Maryland's current management framework to control shore erosion and plan for sea level rise. Problems included: use of a site-by-site approach; lack of coordination and duplication of effort among agencies with jurisdiction; lack of information and understanding of the issues associated with shore erosion and sea level rise; lack of public outreach; and, lack of funding. Second, the State of Maryland Hazard Mitigation Plan (2000) identified and summarized environmental hazards throughout the State, reviewed the existing capacity to deal with these hazards and outlined suggestions for additional efforts. Finally, the Maryland CZM Section 309 Assessment for Coastal Hazards built on the findings of the documents described above and identified the need to continue to plan for and manage coastal erosion, to further develop response strategies to mitigate the impacts of sea level rise, and to support development of local hazard mitigation plans. The Section 309 Strategy for Coastal Hazards is designed to further develop the findings in these reports through coordination with on-going state initiatives and to implement many of their recommendations. The most effective way to promote and implement these recommendations is to use the reports as working documents, implementing some recommendations as opportunities develop and modifying others as conditions require. Section 309 funding will aid in both the creation and identification of these opportunities. Continuing the work represented by these reports will provide continuity and momentum for efforts related to coastal hazard management. 5   Fiscal and Technical Needs Although state, federal, and local resources have already been allocated toward aspects of or precursors to the activities and needs outlined above, additional funding will be needed to ensure completion the Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan, implementation of sea level rise response strategies, and development of local hazard mitigation plans. Currently, both State and local governments lack critical data and information needed to develop accurate and defensible coastal hazards related plans for shore erosion control and sea level rise. Both the Final Report of the Governor's Shore Erosion Task Force and the Sea Level Rise Response Strategy for Maryland identified gaps in knowledge regarding shore erosion and sea level rise. These documents outlined the need for the following information:  updated shore erosion rates and associated maps;  boat wake impacts on shore erosion rates;  role of submerged aquatic vegetation in mitigating erosion impacts;  development of a database to manage dredge material need and availability;  evaluation of durability and effectiveness of shore erosion control methods;  benefit-cost analysis of construction projects identified in the Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan;  development of long-term funding strategies to manage shore erosion;  detailed coastal elevation data (i.e., LIDAR data);  impact of groundwater withdrawal on land subsidence and sea level rise; and  development of a sea level rise predictive model. These data will be used to develop analytical tools used to complete the Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan and to implement the sea level rise response measures. Additional funding will be required to provide support and technical assistance to communities developing local hazard mitigation plans. Budget Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan Support for this activity will include data and information collection (as outlined above), development and implementation of the Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan, public outreach and workshop development, organization and implementation. Approximately $150,000 per year would be funded under the Coastal Zone Management Act Section 309 Strategy. The remainder would be funded through other sources. Expenditures over five years may include: Updated erosion rates: Boat wake data SAV study Dredge database Sea level rise model $160,000 $ 40,000 $ 30,000 $ 20,000 $ 60,000 6   Outreach Staff Staff support  $ 31,500 $123,000 $ 35,500  Please see Attachment A, Six Year Budget for Implementation of the Recommendations of the Governor's Shore Erosion Task Force, for a complete, detailed Shore Erosion Planning budget for Maryland. Sea Level Rise Recommendations No specific funding is requested for this activity at this time. However, activities involving sea level rise will be part of the development of the Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan and development of local hazard mitigation plans (see below), including the development of a sea level rise predictive model and incorporation of sea level rise projections in hazard mitigation planning. Specific recommendations listed in the Sea Level Rise Response Strategy will be pursued as conditions warrant and opportunities are presented but will largely require only staff time. Hazard Mitigation Planning Planning and outreach costs will be approximately $100,000 per year to support working with two counties or municipalities. Workplan Following is a general workplan and description of activities for the three main components of the coastal hazards strategy the Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan, implementation of sea level rise recommendations, and development of local hazard mitigation plans. Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan The initial analysis of information and data along with the methodologies developed through the ongoing partnerships with two coastal counties will provide templates for developing broader regional and statewide approaches. Additional county partners will be sought and plans will be developed for the remaining coastal areas in Maryland. The project will occur in five phases: (1) shore erosion data collection and modeling, to ensure that planning is based on up-to-date, comprehensive information; (2) sea level rise data collection and modeling; (3) creation and implementation of the Comprehensive Plan; (4) on-going public outreach to ensure the input of local communities into the development of these plans; and (5) analysis of long-term financial needs for shore erosion control. The estimate above includes the costs of data acquisition, staff time and public outreach activities outlined by the Task Force. Implementation of the Task Force recommendations is not possible without the required data, nor without the associated staff time and public outreach. Sea Level Rise Recommendations Issues related to sea level rise will be incorporated into the local hazard mitigation plans as well as the 7   development of the Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan. Since these two efforts are statewide in scope and will address all of the coastal areas in Maryland likely to face significant impacts from sea level rise, consideration of sea level rise in these two planning activities will serve as an invaluable initial response to this issue. In addition to the above initiatives, efforts will be made to continue developing incentives for including consideration of sea level rise in local land use plans and ordinances and to work to protect coastal habitats, such as wetlands, from the impacts of climate change. Modifications of local and/or state statutes may be required to include such provisions. The recent adoption of the Sea Level Rise Response Strategy for Maryland as a working document by the Department of Natural Resources provides added visibility and support to furthering specific recommendations outlined in this document. Hazard Mitigation Planning The Maryland Emergency Management Agency's State of Maryland Hazard Mitigation Plan rated 14 counties and municipalities at a high to medium risk for coastal flooding and/or storm surge impacts. Section 309 funding will be utilized to develop local hazard mitigation plans in these localities. Local and state hazard mitigation planning teams will be convened to collect information and develop strategies based on local conditions and resources. The hazard mitigation planning teams will include both state and local government representatives as well as local citizens to ensure local input and ultimate acceptance of the plan elements. Public outreach will also be conducted during the development of the local plans to collect a wide range of public input, address local concerns and include additional information or data. The local plans will incorporate available data, including that from the Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan and sea level rise predictive model, as well as other information developed over the course of this strategy. Likelihood of Success Interest and concern for sea level rise, coastal erosion and other coastal hazard issues are increasing both nationally and locally. In Maryland specifically, the Governor's Shore Erosion Task Force was formed in response to citizen concern about erosion. Sea level rise was incorporated into the new Chesapeake Bay 2000 Agreement, which includes provisions for examining global climate change and the potential impacts on wetland habitats. And in general, heightened emphasis on mitigative solutions in lieu of post-disaster relief efforts points to the need to better plan for coastal hazards. With public input, significant accomplishments in planning for coastal hazards have already been achieved in Maryland and a number of state agencies and their local partners are poised to maintain the momentum to include coastal hazard issues in state and local plans and ordinances. For example, coordinated efforts and partnering between the Department of Natural Resources, the Maryland Emergency Management Agency, the Maryland Department of the Environment and several counties will be used to address specific mitigation measures for sea level rise.  8   Continuing visibility of sea level rise, shore erosion and coastal flooding issues in the local and national press provide increased popular understanding and exposure to issues related to this strategy. Outreach is being developed for federal, state and local legislators, their staff, and the public to improve understanding of coastal hazards issues in Maryland and generate widespread support for related initiatives. Planning for shore erosion control is underway. Currently, the Department of Natural Resources has partnered with two coastal counties and local citizens groups to begin creation of the Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan. The tools and methodologies developed under these partnerships were designed to be easily transferrable to a statewide planning process and will serve as models for implementation of the Shore Erosion Task Force recommendations statewide. Sea level rise issues were recently identified as a priority area for the Coastal and Watershed Resources Advisory Committee, a standing advisory group developed to provide the Maryland Coastal Zone Management Program with citizen, local government, and business input. This group has reviewed the Sea Level Rise Response Strategy for Maryland and has recommended that the issues continue to be pursued by the state. Combining shore erosion management planning with sea level rise management and local coastal hazard mitigation planning efforts increases the efficiency of both planning and outreach efforts. This coordination also results in the development of comprehensive products that are multidimensional and more effective in habitat and resource protection. References Johnson, Z. 2000.

These include increased growth, conversion of land to development, and a variety of point and nonpoint source pollution problems. Because of the wide range of issues facing the State and the cumulative nature of their effects, it is important to use a comprehensive approach in addressing these issues. Maryland's waterways already show signs of degradation from cumulative and secondary impacts. These can be seen in high nutrient loads, loss of habitat and excess sedimentation. In 1998, the Maryland Clean Water Action Plan identified 43 watersheds within the coastal zone in need of priority restoration (see Maryland Section 309 Assessment). In addition, 21 watersheds were identified to be in need of protection and preservation. There was some overlap between the two categories. It is expected that between 1990 and 2020 population in Maryland will increase by 28 percent, with much of this increase falling within the coastal zone. A watershed approach will enable the State to look holistically at the wide range of issues effecting its land and waterways. The Department of Natural Resources has begun partnering with local communities and other agencies to develop local Watershed Restoration Action Strategies (WRAS). The WRAS Program is a multiyear, multi-program approach to integrated watershed protection and restoration. The goal of WRAS are to comprehensively design and implement water quality and habitat improvement activities on a local watershed scale. This is accomplished by providing local governments with the financial and technical assistance necessary to develop and implement the strategies. Components of the planning process include watershed characterization, stream corridor assessment, public participation, goal setting and action plan development. The Maryland WRAS Program builds upon the 1998 Federal Clean Water Action Plan (CWAP), which proposed an expanded collaborative effort by state, federal, and local governments, the private sector, and the public to address all aspects of watershed health. The WRAS Program incorporates Maryland's Clean Water Action Plan goals, including: restoration of watersheds not meeting clean water and other natural resource goals, and sustaining healthy conditions in watersheds currently meeting those goals. Maryland has several initiatives that support and/or require a ""holistic"" watershed approach to looking at issues such as stream buffers, land use, growth, and habitat. The watershed restoration action strategies are an opportunity to combine and coordinate these multiple programs and projects. Increased coordination will strengthen the networked nature of Maryland's CZM Program. A list of state initiatives that have incorporated a watershed approach is attached (Attachment B). These major efforts are all vital components of Maryland's coastal environmental restoration and 10   protection strategy. Clearly, these efforts are closely related, many have similar goals and approaches, and can be implemented in a coordinated manner that will strengthen all of the related programs. Closer integration of watershed planning will help achieve more cost-effective pollution control and habitat restoration efforts, for example, by coordinating various program requirements and time lines for a single water body and selecting the most effective implementation mechanisms. Additionally, linking watershed efforts will increase stakeholder confidence and certainty. Proposed Program Changes / Implementation Plan The WRAS will serve as agreements between local governments, the Maryland CZM Program and appropriate state agencies. These strategies will identify areas of concern, monitoring strategies, gaps in information, mitigation options, and restoration and protection opportunities. Specific program changes can be found at both the state and local level. These are described in greater detail below: This Section 309 strategy will provide for the adoption of program changes at the local level. Local governments are required to meet state guidelines regarding growth and planning. As local governments lead efforts to create watershed strategies, outcomes could include: incorporation of strategy elements into local comprehensive plans; adoption of local implementing tools, such as zoning ordinances and environmental codes; modification to sensitive areas elements; and alterations to Smart Growth Priority Funding Areas. The WRAS Program reinvents Maryland's program delivery process and includes partnerships with other state agencies. Currently, this coordination includes the review of watershed characterizations, sharing of relevant information and data, and cooperation on specific topics of concern. In the future, this partnership could be increased to support prioritization of some technical and financial assistance based on the availability of a watershed strategy. The WRAS initiative will be included in the updating of Memorandum of Understanding between networked CZM agencies. Anticipated Effects of Change This effort will lead to the development of approximately 18 Watershed Restoration Action Strategies, with three started in FFY2000 (See Assessment for details), for priority watersheds located within Maryland's coastal zone boundary. Using public participation, these plans will take a comprehensive look at the watersheds and result in a defined implementation plan for each one. Anticipated improvements include:  A comprehensive strategy to improve the watershed: The final product in this initiative is a comprehensive goal that when implemented will improve watershed health and water quality. This can include reduction in nonpoint source pollution and sedimentation, increased buffer habitat, improved water quality, preservation of land, and improved aquatic systems.  Effective delivery of DNR services: DNR technical services, including GIS-based conservation and restoration targeting, field analysis, habitat restoration, monitoring and funding, 11          are currently delivered on a site by site basis. The WRAS initiative enables the Department to target these resources to priority areas where watershed plans are in development or completed. Innovative management projects: Implementing watershed plans require creative approaches to managing pollution and preserving resources. This initiative promotes demonstration projects that can be applied in other watersheds. Increased coordination and partnerships: The WRAS initiative demands cooperation at both a local and state level. This partnership can include technical knowledge, financial assistance, planning expertise, and implementation. Increased capacity: By working with state agencies and other partners, local governments are increasing their capacity to do watershed planning. Marketing Tool: The final watershed strategy can serve as a marketing tool to leverage funds and technical assistance.  The long-term goal is to have the WRAS serve as a template for improving coastal land and water resources throughout the coastal zone. Not only will the strategies improve coordination and program focus, there will be resource improvements as the strategies are implemented. Appropriateness of Program Change Cumulative and secondary impacts were identified as a high priority in the Maryland Section 309 Assessment. In the past, Maryland's Section 309 efforts under this enhancement area have focused on strengthening the sensitive elements associated with local government comprehensive plans. With the identification of priority watersheds and scientific recognition of a comprehensive watershed management, the state recognized the need to take a watershed-based approach to restoring and protecting its resources. A WRAS is largely an intergovernmental plan of work which identifies the most important causes of water pollution and resource degradation, details actions needed to address these problems, and sets milestones by which to measure progress. It coordinates and improves existing programs and planning capacities based on the assessment of natural resource conditions and scientific monitoring data -increasing capacity to address environmental problems at a watershed level, and strengthening existing organizations charged with assessment, planning, and implementation. WRAS are also designed to address the limitations of traditional planning and restoration approaches, including: (1) potential for independent projects to duplicate or undermine other projects at various levels of government or citizen activity; (2) lost opportunities to deliver integrated financial, technical, public participation and other services; and (3) need for state or federal restoration and preservation projects to obtain local buy-in and sponsorship to address communities' real priority environmental challenges. Experience has shown that a key to making this locally-based program a success is DNR's provision of financial and technical resources to local governments in exchange for local sponsorship of watershed 12   strategy development, and assumption by local authorities among others of the responsibility for its implementation. By providing local governments with funding to develop their watershed planning efforts, Maryland is promoting the watershed approach while getting local buy-in to the process. This is critical to a successful initiative. Finally, as the lead partners, local governments have a great interest in ensuring that the final strategies are implemented. During strategy development, local stakeholders will focus on areas of concern to them. Implementation will be done on the local level with the appropriate financial and technical support from state agencies. This implementation could include additions to local comprehensive plans, modification in planning and zoning, or specific restoration efforts. In order to promote this approach, It is anticipated that as efforts move forward the CZM Program will include WRAS as a component in their revised MOUs between networked state agencies. Fiscal and Technical Needs A key to watershed planning is an accurate assessment of the resources and issues. Not all data is available at a watershed scale and specific monitoring and surveying would provide valuable information for decision making. Data needs could include water quality monitoring, stream surveys, or fish and benthic data collection. As appropriate, these assessments should be completed prior to finalizing the watershed strategy. In addition, it is important to monitor the success of strategy implementation. There is also a great need for the sharing of technical information. The Department has technical expertise and information that is key to developing an accurate characterization and watershed strategy. Relevant state data include land use maps, environmental indicators, sensitive areas and green infrastructure. In addition, the State has technical expertise not available in all counties, including geographical information systems (GIS), restoration planning, and mitigation banking planning. The WRAS Program will be the means for providing this critical state-level information to localities in an integrated fashion. Budget Task Strategic Planning - Local Government Data Collection, Analysis and Demonstration Projects Strategy Implementation Total Work Plan 13 FY 2001 $120,000 $ 90,000 $ 60,000 $270,000 FY 2002 $120,000 $ 90,000 $ 60,000 $270,000 FY 2003 $120,000 $ 90,000 $ 60,000 $270,000 FY 2004 $120,000 $ 90,000 $ 60,000 $270,000 FY 2005 $120,000 $ 90,000 $ 60,000 $270,000   Strategic Planning - Local Government: The strategy proposed will span five years. However, WRAS pilot projects are underway in three counties using FY2000 funds. The WRAS framework includes an eighteen-month watershed management planning process for each watershed, followed by local implementation of priority actions. The WRAS development process includes:  bringing together stakeholders;  characterizing the watershed;  conducting stream corridor assessment surveys;  identifying and prioritizing of issues of concern;  developing environmental management goals and actions;  creating a financial plan; and  developing a strategy to monitor effectiveness of the WRAS. An interim product is the Watershed Characterization Report, which includes the assessment of the current condition of the watershed and establishment of baseline data including, for example:  areas of population growth;  sensitive coastal resources;  impacts (threats) to resources;  regulatory and planning programs that can be used to address impacts;  trends in the health of the watershed; and  application of restoration targeting tools to identify potential restoration and protection opportunities. Based on the findings of this report and additional information, a public outreach and visioning process is conducted in each locality to define problems, and set goals and objectives. Implementation priorities, for restoration and protection projects, as well as funding mechanisms, roles, responsibilities, and time frames are established. Data Collection, Analysis and Demonstration Projects: Funding under this component will focus on meeting information needs for strategy development and supporting innovative analysis tools and management techniques that can be applied in multiple watersheds. Data collection and monitoring would be focused on needs identified by the selected WRAS counties. An example would be a stream corridor assessment where trained teams from the Maryland Conservation Corps walk (or paddle) an entire watershed, documenting stream corridor or shoreline problems and restoration opportunities, rate them as to accessibility, severity, and correctibility. A database and report of the findings would then be used in strategy development. Demonstration projects would be funded based on innovativeness and need. These projects would not necessarily fall in watersheds selected for complete WRAS development, but could be in areas identified as priority 1 (in need of restoration) or priority 3 (in need of preservation) by the Clean Water Action Plan. This enables other counties (e.g. with watershed plans in place and more pristine 14   watersheds) to demonstrate and share lessons they have learned and the challenges they have addressed. The key component of these projects would be the ability to share the information with other local governments. Strategy Implementation: Finally, some Section 309 funds would be reserved for implementation priorities identified in the final WRAS. These implementation projects will focus on achieving coastal resource protection and enhancement, incorporation of coastal resource protection policies into local master plans and ordinances, and improved coordination among agencies responsible for land use programs, water quality, and habitat protection. Likelihood of Success The WRAS process is an excellent opportunity to foster the State CZM Program's transition to a more holistic, comprehensive, watershed-based approach. Such deep programmatic change is a necessary step toward greater local investment and empowerment with regard to the unique natural resources and environmental heritage that distinguish and shape local communities. It is also important in the implementation of new Clean Water Act TMDLs. The degree of support for this type of strategy is strong in Maryland. The Department of Natural Resources, in conjunction with a number of federal and state agencies, has committed to implement watershed management planning. As mentioned earlier, other ongoing initiatives that support strategy development include Tributary Strategies, Chesapeake Bay Program, the Coastal Bays National Estuary Program, Total Maximum Daily Loads, and Smart Growth legislation. This strategy builds on the coordination at all levels of government, and allows stakeholders to be involved in the planning, design and implementation of strategies for the regions in which they live. Upon completion of the strategies a key to success will be implementation. Efforts are underway to ensure that funding and technical expertise are available to see the strategies through to fruition. Only a small portion of implementation funds would funnel through CZM Section 309. The majority would come from other programs including Clean Water Act Section 319 which provides nonpoint source pollution control funds. To aid county's in finding appropriate funding sources, a part of the WRAS initiative is the development and distribution of a financial assistance guide. In summary, this strategy proposes building on support for a watershed planning approach to address the cumulative impacts of development on coastal resources. The strategy will continue momentum among the public, interest groups and governmental agencies who strive to bring about both program changes to Maryland's Coastal Management Program, as well as changes in land-use decision-making at all levels of government to protect Maryland's coastal resources.  15"

Two Maryland 8-digit watersheds in the WRAS project area are State-identified priorities for restoration: Bush River and Bynum Run. The WRAS project area encompasses nearly 119,600 acres including about 10,845 acres of open water. As part of WRAS project, the Maryland Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) is providing technical assistance. For example, DNR is working with the County to prepare a Watershed Characterization which is a collection of available water quality related information and identification of issues that may be used as the County generates its Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. Water Quality Five of the six Maryland 8-digit watersheds in the Bush River Basin are identified in the State's 303(d) list for not supporting their designated use. The causes appear to be related to four general categories of water quality problems: 1) nutrients in tidal waters and lakes, 2) suspended sediment in both tidal and nontidal waters, 3) toxics substances found near Aberdeen Proving Ground, and; 4) biological limitations identified in specific nontidal stream segments. As one step toward remedying these problems, Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) projects will be conducted over the next several years. TMDLs for nitrogen and phosphorus have been established for Swan Creek. During the years 1985 to 2000, one long term monitoring station (WT1.1) in the tidal Bush River shows trends for two parameters -- long term measurements for both total phosphorus and algae abundance suggest a worsening of conditions. All other long term water quality measurements at this station show no significant trend (total nitrogen, dissolved oxygen, total suspended solids and water clarity as measured by secchi disk). Land Use Land in the Bush River Basin has significant concentrations of development. Overall, the River Basin is about 35% developed. The most developed 8-digit watershed is Bynum Run (53% developed) and the least developed is Bush River (nearly 25%). Agriculture is a significant land use across the Bush River Basin except for Aberdeen Proving Ground. Agricultural land use involved 16 to 40% of the land in the other 8-digit watersheds. Overall, forest land covers more than one third of the Bush River Basin. Large concentrations of forest are found in the Aberdeen Proving Ground and Bush River watersheds. Relatively little remains in the Bynum Run and Atkisson Reservoir watersheds (about 23 and 28% respectively). Wetlands cover large acreage of Aberdeen Proving Ground (about 16%) and significant acreage in the Bush River 8-digit watershed (over 7%). Compared to other Bush River Basin watersheds, Bynum Run watershed has the highest percent developed land and greatest extent of land identified for Smart Growth in a Priority Funding Area. It also has the least protected land and forest interior. viii Sept. 2002   Living Resources and Habitat The Upper Chesapeake Bay is considered to be very important for fish spawning and nursery. Estuarine areas of the Bush River Basin may contribute to the overall productivity of the area but specific information on Bush River Basin fisheries is not available. In nontidal streams, about half of the fish populations assessed by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) were rated as good and most of remainder were rated fair or poor. MBSS sites rated as very poor were all within the Aberdeen Proving Ground watershed. Fish consumption advisories have been issued for two tidal fish species (channel catfish and white perch) due to PCBs and pesticides and for some species commonly taken from lakes due to methyl-mercury. In nontidal streams, benthic populations assessed by the MBSS across the Bush River Basin were commonly rated fair or poor. Locations assessed by MBSS as good were all found in the Swan Creek watershed. In the Aberdeen Proving Ground watershed, most areas assessed were rated as very poor. Sensitive species areas identified for project review purposes are found in all of the 8-digit watersheds in the Bush River Basin. However, Wetlands of Special State Concern, which are subject to regulatory review requirements for sensitive species, are concentrated in a few areas: Bush River Watershed (Otter Point Creek, North of Sod Run, Church Creek), Atkisson Reservoir, and Swan Creek watershed (Swan and Gasheys Creeks, Chesapeake Bay shore area, Swan Harbor Farm Park). Habitat for the Federally Endangered Maryland Darter is located in the Swan Creek watershed (Gashey's Run). Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) populations in the Bush River are very sparse compared to the potential physical habitat. The factors inhibiting SAV locally are believed to be associated with poor light penetration, elevated algal populations, nutrients and suspended solids. Restoration Targeting Tools Otter Point Creek in the Bush River watershed is designated as part of the National Estuarine Research Reserve. This designation provides for protection of over 900 acres of water, wetlands and uplands. The designation has also fostered long term efforts for estuarine research, monitoring and education relating to the local estuary. DNR conducted a stream corridor assessment on Church Creek in 2002. This information augments earlier work by DNR on Bynum Run and Swan Creek and by Harford County in other Bush River Basin watesheds. These surveys identify the status of stream buffers, stream bank erosion and other measures of stream condition. This information provides a ground-truthed foundation for targeting restoration projects. Computerized mapping was used to demonstrate concepts for restoration targeting and to help identify areas for additional site investigation for restoration of stream buffers and wetlands. For example, one GIS scenario suggests that opportunities for stream buffer restoration targeted to areas of poorly drained hydric soils to maximize nutrient uptake may be found upstream of Bel Air and in several headwater streams in the Bush River watershed.  ix  Sept. 2002   CONTRIBUTORS TO THE WATERSHED CHARACTERIZATION Harford County Director of Department of Public Works Department of Public Works, Water Resources Engineering Department of Public Works, Water and Sewer Department of Planning and Zoning Department of Parks and Recreation Health Department Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service Coastal Zone Management Division Watershed Restoration Division Watershed Management and Analysis Division Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve Fisheries Service Resource Assessment Service Upper Western Shore Tributary Team Aberdeen Proving Ground U.S. Army Environmental Center Maryland Department of Agriculture Maryland Department of the Environment Maryland Department of Planning  Maryland Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) Others  Editor and Primary Author Ken Shanks, Watershed Management and Analysis Division Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service Department of the Natural Resources  x  Sept. 2002   INTRODUCTION Watershed Selection Maryland's Clean Water Action Plan, completed in 1998, identified water bodies that failed to meet water quality requirements. As part of the State's response, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is offering funding and technical assistance to Counties willing to work cooperatively to devise and implement a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) for the impaired water bodies.1,2 Harford County is one of five Counties participating in the second round of the WRAS program.

Swan Creek is not part of the County's WRAS project area included to allow comparison of subwatersheds across the entire Bush River Basin.  Purpose of the Characterization One of the earliest steps toward devising a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy is to characterize the watershed using immediately available information. This Watershed Characterization is intended to meet several objectives:  briefly summarize the most important or relevant information and issues  provide preliminary findings based on this information 1 Sept. 2002    identify sources for more information or analysis  suggest opportunities for additional characterization and restoration work. Additional Characterization Recommended The Watershed Characterization is intended to be one starting point. It is part of a framework for a more thorough assessment involving an array of additional inputs:  self-investigation by the local entity  targeted technical assistance by partner agencies or contractors  input from local stakeholders  Stream Corridor Assessment, i.e. physically walking the streams and cataloguing important issues, is part of the technical assistance offered by DNR  Synoptic water quality survey, i.e. a program of water sample analysis, can be used to focus on local issues like nutrient hot spots, point source discharges or other selected issues. This is also part of the technical assistance offered by DNR.  Identifying Gaps in Information It is important to identify gaps in available watershed knowledge and gauge the importance of these gaps. One method is to review available information in the context of four physical / biological assessment categories that have been successfully applied in other watershed restoration efforts. These are the main categories that impact aquatic biota:  Habitat: physical structure, stream stability and biotic community (including the riparian zone)  Water Quantity: high water - storm flow & flooding; low water - baseflow problems from dams, water withdrawals, reduced infiltration  Water Quality: water chemistry; toxics, nutrients, sediment, nuisance odors/scums, etc.  Cumulative effects associated with habitat, water quantity and water quality.  Adaptive Management In addition, the Watershed Characterization and the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy should be maintained as living documents within an active evolving restoration process. These documents will have to be updated periodically as new, more relevant information becomes available and as the watershed response is monitored and reassessed. This type of approach to watershed restoration and protection is often referred to as ""adaptive management.""  2  Sept. 2002   WATER QUALITY  Priority for Restoration and Protection The 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan established priorities for watersheds in the State water quality restoration and protection. In the Plan, Category 1 Priority watershed (highest State priority for restoration) was applied to three subwatersheds in the Bush River basin as shown in Map 4 Category 1 Priority Watersheds: - Bush River, watershed 02130701 - Bynum Run, watershed 02130704 - Swan Creek, watershed 02130706 (outside of the WRAS project area) As the basis for the prioritization, indicators of water quality, landscape and living resources were developed for all watersheds in Maryland. These indicators are described in greater detail in separate sections in this watershed characterization.  Designated Uses All waters of the State are assigned a ""Designated Use"" in regulation, COMAR 26.08.02.08, which is associated with a set of water quality criteria necessary to support that use. Map 5 Designated Uses shows the distribution of designated uses across the Bush River Basin. In the simplified summary below, designated uses requiring the better water quality are listed first and the least restrictive (Use I) is listed last. In general, Use I water quality requirements apply everywhere unless superceded by criteria necessary for other designated uses. (The Department of the Environment should be contacted for official regulatory information.) 3 - Use III Natural Trout Waters: Bynum Run and all tributaries - Use IV-P Recreational Trout Waters and Protection of Public Water Supply: Winters Run and all tributaries - Use II Shellfish Harvesting: All estuarine portions of tributaries except: (a) Bush River and tributaries above a line from Fairview Pt. to Chillbury Pt. (b) Romney Creek above Briar Point (c) Swan Creek and tributaries above mouth - Use I-P Water Contact Recreation, Protection of Aquatic Life and Protection of Public Water Supply: Winters Run and all tributaries, including Atkisson Reservoir from Otter Point Creek to upstream boundary of Atkisson Reservoir. - Use I Water Contact Recreation and Protection of Aquatic Life: All water bodies not otherwise designated above. 3 Sept. 2002   Not Supporting Designated Use  303(d) Listings The table 303(d) List of Impaired Waters shows that there are 13 listings within the Bush River Basin. These listings mean that pollution associated with nutrients, suspended sediment and/or toxic materials are preventing full use of these waters based on State criteria. A statewide assessment of water quality is required under Section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act. As part of the assessment, Maryland tracks waterways that do not support their designated use in a list of ""impaired waters"" and in a prioritized list of ""Water Quality Limited Basin Segments"" also known as the 303(d) priority list. Information considered in setting the 303(d) list priorities include, but is not limited to, severity of the problem, threat to human health and high value resources, extent of understanding of problem causes and remedies.5 Each impairment identified in the 303(d) List is assigned a priority which is intended to help communicate the need for correcting the impairment relative to all impairments listed Statewide. Waterways with impairments having the greatest potential impacts to human health, high value resources, etc. are ranked numerically 1 through 25. All other impairments that are not ranked in the top 25 are ranked high, medium or low. Potential Next Steps. A potential goal for a WRAS could be elimination of 303(d) listings for the watershed and/or mitigation of the causes contributing to the listings. Shellfish Harvesting Restrictions As shown in Map 5 Designated Uses, a large portion of the Bush River are designated for shellfish harvesting. However, the entire area shown as Use II waters for shellfish harvesting on the map is ""restricted."" This restriction applied by the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) ""means that no harvesting of oysters and clams is allowed at any time."" Use II (shellfish harvesting waters in this basin are technically restricted because only minimal monitoring is being done due to the lack of a commercially harvestable resource.26 There are relatively few oysters in the Bush River because it typically has less than 0.5 parts per thousand (ppt) salinity but oysters grow best in water with greater than 12 ppt. Consequently, the State's shellfish area monitoring efforts are not invested in low salinity areas like the Bush River where oysters can not be commercially harvested. In the absence of regular monitoring, the restriction is necessary to protect human health because oysters and clams are filter feeders that are readily contaminated by even brief or intermittent exposure to animal and human waste.  4  Sept. 2002   303(d) List of Impaired Waters for the Bush River Basin4 from 2000 Maryland Section 305(b)Water Quality Report, Appendix F Watershed Bush River: Cranberry Run & Broad Run Bush River Number 02130701 -1129 02130701 Impairment Biological Sources Unknown Priority low  Nutrients Suspended Sediment  NPS, natural NPS, natural  low low  Winters Run Atkisson Reservoir Bynum Run  02130702 02130703  impairment not listed Nutrients Suspended Sediment NPS, natural NPS, natural NPS, natural NPS, natural NPS, natural Point Source, NPS, natural Point Source, NPS, natural Point Source, NPS, natural NPS, natural NPS, natural low low low low 18 low low low low low  02130704  Nutrients Suspended Sediment  Aberdeen Proving Ground  02130705  Toxic Substances Nutrients Suspended Sediment Toxic Substances  Swan Creek  02130706  Nutrients Suspended Sediment  5  Sept. 2002   Total Maximum Daily Loads The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) uses the 303(d) priority list to help set State work schedules for various programs including establishment of Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). The intent of establishing one or more TMDLs for a water body is to estimate a pollutant load that the water body can assimilate and still meet water quality standards. Then a waste load allocation is generated to identify appropriate pollution reduction needs among current pollutant sources. Based on January 2002 work load projections, MDE has set several target years for establishing TMDLs for water bodies in the Bush River watershed. (Note 1: work load scheduling is subject to change.

Biological. Within selected stream segments, populations of benthic macroinvertebrates and fish and their associated physical habitat have been assessed by the Maryland Biological Stream Program. Based on criteria developed for each physiographic/ecological zone in Maryland, each stream segment is rated as either good, fair, poor or very poor. Ratings of poor and very poor were listed as biological impairment for the first time in Maryland in the draft 2002 303(d) list of impaired waters. Nutrients . In Maryland, most water bodies naturally have low levels of the nutrients nitrogen or phosphorus. These nutrients enter waterways from all types of land and from the atmosphere. Nutrient pollution or over-enrichment problems may arise from numerous sources. For example, residential land can be an important contributor of nutrients depending on fertilizer use, extent of lawn and the status of septic systems. Many farmers carefully manage nutrients using different approaches, so nutrients entering waterways from crop land varies greatly depending on management techniques. Typically, smaller amounts of nutrients reach surface waters from an acre of forest land than from an acre of other types of land. The atmosphere can contribute various forms of nitrogen arising from the burning of fossil fuels in power plants and from automobile exhaust. Suspended Sediment . Most unpolluted streams and tidal waters naturally have limited amounts of sediment moving ""suspended"" in the water. Excessive amounts of suspended sediment in waterways are considered pollution because they can inhibit light penetration, prevent plant growth, smother fish eggs, clog fish gills, etc. Sediment in streams tends to arise from stream bed and bank erosion and from land that is poorly vegetated or disturbed. Suspended sediment pollution may arise from construction sites, crop land, bare ground and exposed soil. The amount of sediment contributed varies greatly site to site depending upon stream stability, hydrology, management controls and other factors. Toxic Substances. A wide array of materials may be considered toxic substances because they exhibit poisonous or lethal affects or otherwise harm aquatic life. These materials are very diverse in their sources and effects. Sometimes toxic substances can occur naturally. However, toxic substances of concern for water quality restoration are those types that are the product of human activity. For regulatory purposes, the US Environmental Protection Agency maintains a list of substances that are considered to be toxic. A few examples are heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), asbestos and many other materials.  7  Sept. 2002   National Academy Press, Clean Coastal Waters (2000) What Are the Effects of Nutrient Over-Enrichment? 6 The productivity of many [lake, estuary and] coastal marine systems is limited by nutrient availability, and the input of additional nutrients to these systems increases primary productivity [microscopic organisms including algae]. In moderation in some systems, nutrient enrichment can have beneficial impacts such as increasing fish production; however, more generally the consequences of nutrient enrichment for coastal marine ecosystems are detrimental. Many of these detrimental consequences are associated with eutrophication. The increased productivity from eutrophication increases oxygen consumption in the system and can lead to low-oxygen (hypoxia) or oxygen-free (anoxic) water bodies. This can lead to fish kills as well as more subtle changes in ecological structure and functioning, such as lowered biotic diversity and lowered recruitment of fish populations. Eutrophication can also have deleterious consequences on estuaries even when low-oxygen events do not occur. These changes include loss of biotic diversity, and changes in the ecological structure of both planktonic and benthic communities, some of which may be deleterious to fisheries. Seagrass beds and coral reefs are particularly vulnerable to damage from eutrophication and nutrient over-enrichment. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) harm fish, shellfish, and marine mammals and pose a direct public health threat to humans. The factors that cause HABs remain poorly known, and some events are entirely natural. However, nutrient over-enrichment of coastal waters leads to blooms of some organisms that are both longer in duration and of more frequent occurrence. Although difficult to quantify, the social and economic consequences of nutrient over-enrichment include aesthetic, health, and livelihood impacts.  8  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Indicators The Clean Water Action Plan's 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment established priorities for watersheds in the State for restoration and protection. In the Plan, three watersheds in the Bush River Basin watershed were listed for action under the highest priority for restoration (Category 1 Priority):  Bush River 02130701  Bynum Run 02130704  Swan Creek 02130706 As the basis for the prioritization, indicators of water quality, landscape and living resources were developed for all watersheds in Maryland. Other approaches to assessing water quality have been in use for several years and are further described below. In general they do not look comparatively at watersheds as the Unified Assessment did in an effort to set priorities. The Unified Assessment also considered a range of living resource and landscape indicators described a little later. The Unified Assessment used water quality indicators to compare the State's 138 watersheds which were applied to help characterize the Bush River Basin. The findings for the water quality indicators are summarized in the table below and are more thoroughly explained in the following text. Lower Winters Run  Bynum Run  State 303(d) List Impairment Number Modeled TN Load Modeled TP Load Tidal Habitat Index Tidal Eutrophication Index  2 27.88 1.14 4.3 7.0  0 11.54 0.38  2 9.18 0.49  2 10.94 0.47  2 9.32 0.32  NOTES: Click on the indicator name to link to its description and interpretation. Unshaded indicators in the table mean that average watershed conditions measured by this indicator are better than the Statewide benchmark. Shaded indicators grid mean that average watershed conditions measured by this indicator are worse than the Statewide benchmark, i.e. water quality problems are more likely to arise due to the conditions represented by the indicator.  9  Swan Creek 2 15.28 0.67 Sept. 2002  Bush River  APG  Water Quality Indicator  Atkisson Reservoir   1. State 303(d) Impairment In the Bush River Basin, all of the watersheds in the Basin are on the 303(d) list with the exception of Lower Winters Run. For this indicator, presence on the 303(d) list means that the following watersheds have one or more water quality problems that need correction or restoration: Bush River, Atkisson Reservoir, Bynum Run, Aberdeen Proving Ground and Swan Creek. 2. Modeled Total Nitrogen Load For the Bush River Basin, the total nitrogen (TN) load reaching the Chesapeake Bay was estimated using a computer model to be relatively low for Atkisson Reservoir and Aberdeen Proving Ground watersheds. Compared to other watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, these watersheds ranked among those transporting less TN to the Chesapeake Bay. All the other watersheds in the river basin has relatively high estimated total nitrogen loads reaching the Chesapeake Bay. Compared to other watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, the Bush River, Lower Winters Run, Bynum Run and Swan Creek watersheds ranked among those transporting high TN to the Chesapeake Bay. Nitrogen Load is a measure of how much of this important nutrient reaches streams and other surface waters. For each type of land use in the watershed, on average, stormwater tends to carry or transport a characteristic amount of nitrogen from the land to nearby streams. Based on these averages, computers can be used to estimate (model) how much nitrogen is likely to be reaching Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay is receiving too much nitrogen, so higher TN loads from watersheds contribute to the water quality problems in the Chesapeake Bay. To create a benchmark for this indicator, the modeled TN loads for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. Four watersheds in the Bush River Basin (Bush River, Lower Winters Run, Bynum Run and Swan Creek) exceeded this benchmark. 3. Modeled Total Phosphorus Load For the Bush River Basin, the total phosphorus (TP) load reaching the Chesapeake Bay was estimated using a computer model to be relatively low for four watersheds: Lower Winters Run, Atkisson Reservoir, Bynum Run and Aberdeen Proving Ground. Compared to other watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, these watersheds ranked among those transporting less TN to the Chesapeake Bay. The TP load reaching the Chesapeake Bay from two Bush River Basin watersheds was estimated to be relatively high according to the computer model. Compared to other Chesapeake Bay watersheds in Maryland, the Bush River and Swan Creek watersheds ranked among those transporting high TP to the Chesapeake Bay. Total Phosphorus is a measure of how much of this important nutrient is reaching streams and other surface waters. The ranking for modeled TP Load was performed in parallel to the ranking for modeled TN Load above. The Chesapeake Bay is receiving too much phosphorus, so higher TP loads from watersheds contribute to the water quality problems in the Chesapeake Bay. 10 Sept. 2002   To create a benchmark for this indicator, the modeled TP loads for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Bush River and Swan Creek watersheds did exceeded this benchmark. 4. Tidal Habitat Index In the Bush River Basin, the Bush River watershed had sufficient data available to be assessed for the Tidal Habitat Index. The other two watersheds in the Basin that include tidal waters, Aberdeen Proving Ground and Swan Creek, did not have sufficient data for assessment. Compared to other Chesapeake Bay watersheds in Maryland, the Bush River watershed ranked among those having poorer tidal habitat based on an index combining three measurements of water quality: algae populations as measured by surface chlorophyll a, water clarity as measured by secchi depth and summer bottom dissolved oxygen (July-Sept.). Using data collected 1994-1996, the Bush River watershed ranked ""4.3"" on a scale of 1(worst) to 10(best). To create a benchmark for this indicator, the index scores for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Bush River watershed exceeded this benchmark. 5. Tidal Eutrophication Index In the Bush River Basin, the Bush River watershed had sufficient data available to be assessed for the Tidal Eutrophication Index. The other two watersheds in the Basin that include tidal waters, Aberdeen Proving Ground and Swan Creek, did not have sufficient data for assessment. Compared to other Chesapeake Bay watersheds in Maryland, the Bush River watershed ranked among those having less eutrophication problems based on an index combining of three measurements of water quality (in surface mixed-layer water): total nitrogen, total phosphorus and total suspended solids. Using data collected 1994-1996, the Bush River watershed ranked ""7.0"" on a scale of 1(worst) to 10(best). To create a benchmark for this indicator, the index scores for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Bush River watershed did not exceed this benchmark.  Water Quality Background 1950s to 1988 Slow flushing characteristics of the Bush River tend to accentuate water quality problems there. It typically takes 48 days for this tidal fresh estuary to flush.8 Salinity in the tidal Bush River varies from about 5 parts per thousand (ppt) at the Chesapeake Bay to about 0.1 ppt in the upper Bush River to less than 0.05 ppt at the mouths of tributary creeks like Otter Point Creek.14 11 Sept. 2002   1. Tidal Bush River The earliest available water quality records covering the 1950s through 1965 noted high bacteria levels in the tidal Bush River. This a period before public sewerage services were offered in the Bush River watershed. The sources of this bacterial problem were believed to be existing discharges directly into the river including Bata Shoe, Edgewood Arsenal and probably effluent from private septic systems. Sampling in 1965 verified high bacterial populations in the river including E. Coli. These high bacterial populations were found in extensive areas of the upper tidal reaches of the Bush River and along the western shore of the Bush River toward the Chesapeake Bay. 11 1970s and 1980s In General Bacteria problems began to cause swimming closures in the Upper Bush River beginning in 1971. These problems were in-part associated with failing septic systems.8 Several projects gathered water quality data in the 1970s and 1980s: 1972 Goucher College Environmental Studies Program had sampling stations in the open tidal waters of the Bush River and near the mouths of Bush Creek and Cranberry Run. 9 1977 DNR had sampling stations in the tidal waters of the Bush River.9 1980-82 CH2M Hill, a consultant working for Harford County had most sampling stations in open tidal waters of the Bush River with the exception of two stations near the tidal interface in Otter Point Creek and James Run. 9 1987 Harford County Dept. Of Public Works10 1988 Harford Community College12 Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations measured at all stations by CH2M Hill and DNR were higher than the minimum standard of 5.0 mg/l. However, 1972 dissolved oxygen sampling data showed several DO standard violations near the mouths of Bush Creek and Cranberry Run. 9 In 1987, DO concentrations below the standard were recorded at Church Creek, the upper Bush River and Otter Point Creek.10 Additional DO problems were reported in 1988 for Greys Run, Cranberry Run and Bynum Run.12 High fecal coliform bacteria populations were found by DNR in July 1977 up and down the tidal Bush River. 1982 monitoring by CH2M Hill found the highest fecal coliform bacteria populations and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) tended to be from their two stream stations. The next highest findings were found near Otter Point.9 Specific sources of these problems were believed to be associated with remaining failing septic systems even though about one-half of the watershed's population was now served by public sewer service.8 1987 sampling found four sites with fecal coliform bacteria greater than 200 MPN (most probable number): 2 stations in the upper Bush River, Winters Run at Rt 40 and James Run at Rt 40. Additionally, Bynum Run and Church Run were considered likely contributors.10 Winters Run was identified again for a high fecal coliform count in 1988.12 Algae blooms reported in the upper tidal Bush River were believed to be driven by nutrient inputs from tributary streams.9 In 1987, algae blooms in the upper Bush River north of the AMTRAK railway bridge was identified as a continuing issue. Nutrient concentrations in the tidal Bush River were high. For total phosphorus, concentrations 12 Sept. 2002   greater than 0.01 mg/l were considered to highly enriched. Monitoring in 1972-73 for DNR Power Plant Siting found total phosphorus concentrations were nearly always greater than this benchmark with peak concentrations between 0.05 and 0.07 mg/l. 19 1987 monitoring data found that the orthophosphorus fraction alone averaged between 0.04 and 0.08 mg/l. 10 For total inorganic nitrogen (which is collectively ammonia, nitrite and nitrate), concentrations greater than 0.5 to 1.5 mg/l were considered very high. 1972-73 data gathered for the DNR Power Plant Siting Program found organic nitrogen concentrations occasionally above 0.5 mg/l.19 Monitoring data found that ammonia nitrogen ranged from 0.01 to 0.11 mg/l and nitrate nitrogen ranged from 0.02 to 0.77 mg/l. Data for the two streams sampled supported the belief that tributary streams were a significant nutrient source for the Bush River. Additionally, 1972 data collected by the Goucher College Environmental Studies Program reported high nutrient concentrations near the mouths of Bush Creek and Cranberry Run. In 1987, high nutrient concentrations tended to found at all sampling sites.10 In 1988, elevated nutrients were found at all sampling sites including Bynum Run, James Run, Greys Run and Cranberry Run. Additionally, a trend toward increasing nitrate concentrations was reported.12 Sedimentation problems were believed to be associated with urbanizing areas of the watershed.9 High sediment loads were reported in Lower Winters Run. 8 The County Dept. of Public Works identified several streams as the major sources of sediment to the upper Bush River in 1987: Otter Point Creek, James Run/Bynum Run, and Church Creek. Then, again in 1988, turbidity levels exceeding the State standard were reported for Bynum Run (the highest), Winters Run and James Run. 2. Atkisson Reservoir13 During the 1970s, excessive sediment movement in streams above the Reservoir was known to be a problem based on water intake records maintained by Maryland Water Works. Sampling in 1980 in the 38-year old Atkisson Reservoir found that 81% of its original volume had been lost to deposited sediment. That same year, stream surveys conducted upstream of the Reservoir found excessive sediment in Winters Run and Plum Tree Run near the Reservoir. However, turbidity in the reservoir in 1980 was not found to be a problem. [These findings may suggest that sediment mobilized upstream of the Reservoir tended to be larger particles that readily settled out in slack water, ed.] The Reservoir was characterized as eutrophic with algae blooms commonly occurring in summer. The blooms were believed to be caused by high total phosphorus concentrations in the Reservoir ranging from 0.07 to 0.52 mg/l. At the time, EPA criteria was 0.025 mg/l total phosphorus. Low dissolved oxygen concentrations were identified in deep waters of the Reservoir below the 13 foot depth. Bacterial problems in the Reservoir were identified in the 1960s and 1970s. Sampling in 1980 verified that fecal coliform counts were typically high. Temperature, pH, metals or pesticides were not identified as concerns in the Reservoir.  13  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Assessment 1989 to the Present In the Bush River Basin (021307), there is one regularly scheduled long-term water quality monitoring effort for one station (WT1.1) in the tidal Bush River. All other monitoring is short term and special purpose. For example, the Maryland Biological Stream Survey collects water quality information in nontidal streams as part of its program. Additionally, MDE collected water quality data in 1999 to support permitting decisions and anticipated work on Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs).26 Cheseapeake Bay Program Tributary Monitoring Station WT1.1 shown on Map 6 Monitoring Stations is the best source of long term water quality data for the tidal Bush River. DNR Resource Assessment Service has analyzed data from this station and a summary of their findings appears in the table below. The status for each parameter in the table is a relative ranking at three levels: good, fair and poor. For example, the ranking of ""fair"", which is the most common ranking in the table, means that the Bush River ranking is fair compared to comparable Chesapeake Bay tributaries with comparable salinity. Additional discussion follows the table in this section. A more detailed look at the historic water quality record for this monitoring station is presented in Appendix A Selected Water Quality Historic Record for Bush River Station WT1.1. As part of DNR's work of the Upper Western Shore Tributary Team, this relative water quality assessment for the tidal Bush River and nearby tidal tributaries is presented in DNR's Internet site www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/tribstrat/index.html. 1, 9 For additional information on water quality in general and Station WT1.1 specifically, see http://www.chesapeakebay.net/wquality.htm and www.dnr.state.md.us/irc/datasets.html Parameter Nitrogen: total Phosphorus: total Algae: Abundance Dissolved Oxygen (summer, bottom waters) Water Clarity: secchi depth Suspended Solids: total Status 1998 -2000 data Fair Fair Poor Good Poor Fair Trend 1985 through 2000 No Trend Degrading (46%) Degrading (117%) No Trend No Trend No Trend  14  Sept. 2002   1. Nitrogen Total nitrogen concentrations for 1998 through 2000 from station WT1.1 in the Bush River suggested ""fair"" water quality. For the period 1985 through 2000, there was no trend toward significant change. During 2001, the graph shows total nitrogen concentrations varied slightly more than 1 mg/l averaging 1.2 mg/l for the year.

Phosphorus Total phosphorus concentrations for 1998 through 2000 from station WT1.1 in the Bush River suggested ""fair"" water quality. For the period 1985 through 2000, there was a trend toward increasing concentrations suggesting worsening conditions. During 2001, the graph shows total phosphorus concentrations varied about than 0.1 mg/l averaging 0.074 mg/l for the year.

Algae Abundance of algae as measured by chlorophyl a Chlorophyll A concentrations for 1998 through Station WT1.1 for 2001 2000 from station WT1.1 in the 50 Bush River suggested ""poor"" 40 water quality. For the period 30 1985 through 2000, there was a trend toward increasing 20 concentrations suggesting 10 worsening conditions. During 2001, the graph shows total 0 nitrogen concentrations varied Months January Through December more than 40 ug/l averaging about 25 micrograms per liter (ug/l). The year 2001 average chlorophyll a concentrations suggest that algae abundance is typically high enough to inhibit health of submerged aquatic vegetation during the growing season. MG/l  4. Dissolved Oxygen Dissolved oxygen Dissolved Oxygen concentrations for 1998 through Station WT1.1 for 2001 2000 from station WT1.1 in the 12 Bush River suggested ""good"" water 11 quality. For the period 1985 10 through 2000, there was no trend 9 toward significant change. During 2001, the graph shows dissolved 8 oxygen concentrations varied about 7 5 mg/l averaging 9.2 mg/l for the 6 year. Measurements at this station Months January Through December have consistently met the State water quality standard of 5.0 mg/l during the past several years. Data collected from this station, due to its location in the middle of the Bush River's open tidal waters, probably does not reflect dissolved oxygen conditions in tidal waters in more restricted areas.

Water Clarity The measurement of water clarity for 1998 through Station WT1.1 for 2001 2000 at station WT1.1 in the 0.6 Bush River using secchi disk depth suggested ""poor"" water 0.5 quality. For the period 1985 0.4 through 2000, there was no trend toward significant change. 0.3 During 2001, the graph shows secchi disk depth varied less 0.2 than one half meter averaging Months January Through December 0.4 meters for the year. Measurements from this station indicate that water clarity is too limited to support submerged aquatic vegetation. However, water clarity conditions in other parts of the tidal Bush River may differ significantly. MG/l  Secchi Disk Depth  6. Suspended Solids Total suspended solids concentrations for 1998 through 2000 from station WT1.1 in the Bush River suggested ""fair"" water quality.

Chemical Contaminants Overall, the Bush River is identified by the US EPA Chesapeake Bay Program as an area with insufficient or inconclusive data.30 Sampling of sediment and the water column in the Bush River has not been conducted to support a more definitive statement. However, limited data in the Aberdeen Proving Ground watershed has identified toxic substances of concern in small areas. Additionally, the most recent Fish Consumption Advisory from the Maryland Dept. of the Environment identified PCBs, pesticides and methyl mercury in fish tissue as concerns.  MG/l  17  Sept. 2002   Point Sources Discharges from discrete conveyances like pipes are called ""point sources."" Point sources may contribute pollution to surface water or to groundwater. For example, waste water treatment discharges may contribute nutrients or microbes that consume oxygen (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) that reduce oxygen available for aquatic life. Stormwater discharges may contribute excessive flow of water and/or seasonally high temperatures. Industrial point sources may contribute various forms of pollution. Some understanding of point source discharges in a watershed targeted for restoration is useful in helping to prioritize potential restoration projects. Permit information from the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) permit data base for the Bush River basin is summarized in the table below and on Map 7 MDE Permits. Characteristics of the these permitted discharges (volume, temperature, pollutants, etc.) are tracked by MDE through the permit system. Most of this information is accessible to the public and can be obtained from MDE.

Sod Run Waste Water Treatment Plant The the Sod Run Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) began operating in 1969 with a discharge to Romney Creek. By the late 1970s, the plant had expanded capacity from 4 million gallons per day (MGD) to 10 MGD. In October 1982, the discharge averaging about 5 MGD was moved to the Bush River in response to tightened discharge requirements for Romney Creek.9 In the Bush River watershed (02130701), the discharge from the Sod Run WWTP is the most important nutrient point source. For the year October 2000 to October 2001, the average effluent flow from the plant was 11 million gallons per day. The monthly average total phosphorus concentration for the period was 1.1 mg/l. For the same period, The monthly average total nitrogen concentration was 9.0 mg/l.27  21  Sept. 2002   MDE Permits Listing  Page 4 of 5 (Sept. 2001 data) Lower Winters Run Watershed 02130702 Atkisson Reservoir Watershed 02130703 Type / MDE Category Surface Water / Industrial Groundwater / Industrial Facility Name Tollgate Landfill Permit(s) MD/NPDES 96DP2887 MD0065765 95DP1318 96DP2890 97SW1247 97SW0539 00MM2282 00HT9423 MDG679423 95MM9708 MDG499708 00HT9510 MDG679510 Winters Run Edgewood Osburn Lane, Joppa Winters Run Lake Vista Drive, Joppa Old Mountain Rd, Joppa Winters Run Bel Air Road Receiving Stream / Location Winters Run North Tollgate Road, Bel Air Norrisville Rd, Jarrettsville Bel Air Rd, Bel Air  Jarrettsville Elementary Village Volvo Alcore, Inc.

However, nutrients and sediment are a significant issue in the watershed based on several sources:  Listing of the river under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act  Modeled nitrogen summary in the Water Quality Indicators section in this Watershed Characterization.  The Maryland Biological Stream Survey identified evidence of nonpoint source problems including erosion in the riparian area, streambank erosion and sedimentation. Several potential approaches for addressing nonpoint source pollution in the Bush River WRAS were identified in discussions between local representatives and DNR representatives:  Supporting development of nutrient management plans.  Promoting the marina pumpout program  especially for summer visitors on the Bush River.  Identification of septic system problems: existing and potential.  Supporting development of comprehensive conservation plans for agricultural operations.  Urban stormwater management  Lawn maintenance issues  Potential stream maintenance projects 1. Erosion and Sedimentation Some Soils in the Bush River basin are prone to erosion. (See the Soil Erodibility Indicator in the Land Use section.) Based on this limited assessment, the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy may incorporate projects for education and/or incentives for erosion and sediment control.  Sedimentation Research Findings From Otter Point Creek The presence of the Otter Point National Estuarine Reserve Research in the Bush River watershed has facilitated understanding of the relation between sediment deposition and local marshes. A brief summary of recently completed research is included below. Sediment deposition from upstream areas created river delta areas of Otter Point Creek. The physical dynamics of this tidal freshwater delta area have been extensively quantified and modeled.14 Research on the historic conditions indicate that pre-settlement sedimentation rates were about half of rates from later times when agriculture covered 40 to 50% of the watershed. The long term sediment accumulation rate in Otter Point Creek was as high as 5 cm-yr during the 1840 to 1900 period. This rate is comparable to other delta areas in the Upper Chesapeake Bay. 14 Recent sedimentation cycle study found that marsh areas are growing due to sediment accumulation and incorporation into the marsh matrix.15 Study of marsh areas that were previously sewage lagoons at Otter Point Creek indicates that they tend to act as nitrogen sinks.16 This action is similar to that of other marshes and suggests that these areas act to improve water quality in their vicinity. 24 Sept. 2002   2. Shorelines Wherever land and open water meet, change in the form of erosion or accretion of land is typically the inevitable result of natural processes. Human activity in these areas either tends to inadvertently accentuate these natural processes or purposefully attempts to control movement of water and/or loss of land. Erosion of shorelines can contribute significant amounts of nutrients (mostly phosphorus) and sediment (water column turbidity, habitat loss.) Historic records show that very large areas of land on the Bush River's western shore appeared since the arrival of the Europeans.8 This new land includes most of the Edgewood Area of the Aberdeen Proving Ground and the southern shores of Otter Point Creek. It may be inferred that formation of this land was caused by extremely high erosion and sedimentation rates associated with the land clearing and management of the past 300 years. Countywide shoreline erosion is summarized in the following table. 25 Harford County Shore Erosion Rate Summary (Miles of Shoreline) Total Shoreline Total Eroding Shoreline Erosion Rate 0 - 2 feet / year 30 2 - 4 feet / year 11 > 4 feet / year 5  140  46(33%)  Maps of historic shoreline change were produced by the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) in a cooperative effort between DNR and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Maps produced for Harford County in 1995 included digitized shorelines. Copies of these 1:24000 scale maps are available from the MGS. Updates of these maps should be available by the end of 2002.  25  Sept. 2002   Water Supply In the Bush River Basin, there are eight providers for community water supply systems. The majority use groundwater as their source water but two have surface sources as shown on Map 8 Water Supply. Information for the surface water systems are summarized in the table below. The community systems served by groundwater in the Bush River Basin are summarized in the table Groundwater Community Water Supply Permits. The groundwater sources serving these systems are mostly unconfined aquifers with the exception of the Potomac Group Aquifer which is tapped by the Harford County Dept. of Public Works. Well head protection areas have been established for the wells operated by Harford County and the City of Aberdeen as shown on the map.23 The groundwater sources used for community systems in the Bush River Basin do not employ near-surface groundwater, which is subject to potential local pollution sources. In general, near surface groundwater is credited with carrying nutrients, particularly nitrogen, from land sources to surface waters where nutrient over-enrichment is occurring. Potential Next Steps. A potential goal or objective for a WRAS could be augmentation of existing programs to protect community water systems by targeting projects or controls in watersheds above surface water intakes.

In an effort to gauge the affects of land use on water quality, and to allow comparison between watersheds, DNR has developed a series of Landscape Indicators. These indicators can be used to portray landscape conditions on a watershed scale that tend to support good water quality or that tend to degrade water quality. The 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan included a unified watershed assessment that used a number of landscape indicators to assess the State's 138 watersheds.2 Most indicators are relative measures by which a watershed like those in the Bush River Basin can be compared with the other 137 watersheds of similar size that together cover the entire State of Maryland. The following sections identify the findings for the watersheds in the Bush River Basin, with the exception of the population density indicator, which is based on 2000 Census data not available when the Unified Assessment was done.

Unshaded indicators in the table mean that average watershed conditions measured by this indicator are better than the Statewide benchmark.

Impervious Surface Based on estimates of imperious cover for each 8-digit watershed in the Bush River Basin averaged across each watershed, the percent of impervious surface cover varies from about 10% to over 30%. These findings for average imperviousness do not compare well with similar watersheds in Maryland.2 Roads, parking areas, roofs and other human constructions are collectively called impervious surface. Impervious surface blocks the natural seepage of rain into the ground. Unlike many natural surfaces, impervious surface typically concentrates stormwater runoff, accelerates flow rates and directs stormwater to the nearest stream. Watersheds with small amounts of impervious surface tend to have better water quality in local streams than watersheds with greater amounts of impervious surface. The Maryland Biological Stream Survey has related the percent of impervious surface in a watershed to the health of aquatic resources. For areas with less than 4% impervious cover, streams generally rate ""Fair"" to ""Good"" for both fish and instream invertebrates. Beyond about 12% impervious surface, streams generally rate ""Poor"" to ""Fair"" for both. Side-effects of impervious surfaces become increasingly significant and negative as the percentage of impervious area increases. Examples of related problems include reduction of groundwater infiltration, increased soil and stream bank erosion, sedimentation, destabilization or loss of aquatic habitat, and ""flashy"" stream flows (reduced flow between storms and excessive flows associated with storms.) The impervious surface estimate used for this indicator was generated for the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action report. Each land use type in the 1994 Maryland State Planning land use data was assigned an estimated imperviousness taken from the TR-55 manual used by the former Soil Conservation Service. To create a benchmark for comparing impervious area among Maryland watersheds, the percent of impervious area for 8-digit watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. All of the Bush River watersheds exceeded this benchmark. 2. Population Density According to 2000 Census data, the population density in the watersheds in the Bush River Basin varied from less than one person per acre in the Aberdeen Proving Ground watershed to more than three people per acre in the Bynum Run watershed. The figures in the table differ from those that appeared in the 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment . A comparison with other watersheds in the state has not been completed using the 2000 census data.2 While population density may be beyond the scope of a WRAS, directing growth is a potential WRAS component. As human population increases, effects of human activity that tend to degrade, displace or eliminate natural habitat also tends to increase. Watersheds with higher populations, assuming other factors are equal, tend to exhibit greater impacts on waterways and habitat. However, growth can be directed in ways to reduce negative impacts.  29  Sept. 2002   3. Historical Wetland Loss The estimated historic loss of wetlands in watersheds in the Bush River Basin varies from a relatively very small 258 acres in the Aberdeen Proving Ground watershed to over 9700 acres in the Bush River watershed. This range of estimated wetland loss in Bush River Basin watersheds is relatively small compared with other similar Maryland watersheds.2 This interpretation is based on the assumption that the hydric soils in the watershed were all, at one time, wetlands. Thoughtful selective restoration of historic wetland areas can be an effective WRAS component. In most of Maryland's watersheds, extensive wetland areas have been converted to other uses by draining and filling. This conversion unavoidably reduces or eliminates the natural functions that wetlands provide. To create a benchmark for comparing impervious area among Maryland watersheds, the historic wetland loss acreage for 8-digit watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. All of the watersheds in the Bush River Basin did not exceed the benchmark because they were not found to be in the highest quartile. 4. Unbuffered Streams According to data used for the 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment , only the Bynum Run watershed in the Bush River Basin had a relatively high percentage of unbuffered streams compared to other similar Maryland watersheds.2 DNR recommends that forested buffer 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream, is typically necessary to promote high quality aquatic habitat and diverse aquatic populations. Replacement of natural vegetation adjacent to streams can be a valuable and relatively inexpensive WRAS element. In most of Maryland, trees are key to healthy natural streams. They provide numerous essential habitat functions: shade to keep water temperatures down in warm months, leaf litter ""food"" for aquatic organisms, roots to stabilize stream banks, vegetative cover for wildlife, etc. In general, reduction or loss of riparian trees / stream buffers degrades stream habitat while replacement of trees / natural buffers enhances stream habitat. (For this indicator only ""blue line streams"" were included. Intermittent streams were not considered.) This estimate of streams lacking forested buffer was generated for the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan by using Maryland Department of State Planning GIS data for streams and for 1994 land use. To create a benchmark for comparing impervious area among Maryland watersheds, the percent of unbuffered streams for 8-digit watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Bynum Run watershed exceed the benchmark because it was in the highest quartile. The other watersheds in the Bush River basin did not exceed the benchmark because they were not in the highest quartile.  30  Sept. 2002   5. Soil Erodibility For four of the watersheds in the Bush River Basin (Lower Winters Run, Atkisson Reservoir, Bynum Run and Swan Creek), the average soil erodibilty of lands within 1000 feet of streams is greater than 0.30 value/acre which suggests that control of soil erosion is particularly important in these watersheds.2 For the Bush River watershed and the Aberdeen Proving Ground watershed, the average soil erodibilty of lands within 1000 feet of streams is 0.18 and 0.01 value/acre which suggests that control of soil erosion is particularly important here.2 This estimate of soil erodibility was generated through an analysis of GIS data that incorporated the soil erodibility factor (K), slope steepness, land area within 1000 feet of streams and cropland within that 1000 feet buffer based on 1994 Maryland Department of State Planning land use data. Watersheds with more highly erodible soils are naturally more susceptible to surface erosion, sedimentation, streambank erosion and other problems related to soil movement. These negative effects of soil erodibility on water quality can be minimized through careful management. The soil erodibility indicator accounts for natural soil conditions but not for management of the land. (Existing crop land management was not considered.) The naturally erodible soils in the watershed are addressed by techniques called Best Management Practices (BMPs) to prevent soil loss that are typically in use on local farms. BMPs like no-till, reduced till, cover crops, field strips, and others significantly reduce erosion and sediment movement. These BMPs can be seen in use in many places in the watershed. A WRAS can reasonably promote a reduction in disturbance of erodible soils and/or effective soil conservation practices like planting stream buffers. Because soils can vary significantly within very small areas, a generalized erodibility indicator must be used with caution and supplemented with site-specific evaluation prior to implementing any management action. To compare Maryland watersheds for this index, the benchmark of 0.275 value/acre was used, i.e. less than 0.275 was considered relatively beneficial for water quality and 0.275 or greater was considered to be a likely factor for water quality problems.  31  Sept. 2002   2000 Land Use / Land Cover The following table and pie chart summarize the Year 2000 land use for the Bush River Basin. Viewing these land uses as potential nonpoint sources of nutrients, agricultural lands are likely to dominate loads to local waterways. Map 9 2000 Land Use / Land Cover shows the distribution of lands in the watershed. Just under 37% of the Bush River Basin is forest. This is up from the estimated 20% forest cover in the same area at the beginning of the 20th Century, which was the peak of deforestation in the area.14  Bush River Basin 2000 Land Use, 6-Digit Watershed  Agriculture (23.30%) Urban (34.74%)  Wetlands (4.92%) Other (0.45%)  Forest (36.59%)  2000 Land Use / Land Cover Bush River Basin in Harford County Watershed Area in Acres (Md Dept. of Planning) Lower Winters Run Bynum Run Bush River Swan Creek 5,350 5,481 5,117 99 84 16,131 16,862 Category Aberdeen PG Atkisson Reservoir  Agriculture Forest and Brush Urban Wetlands Other Land & Land Water Only Watershed Total  7,318 17,395 9,169 2,683 402 36,967 45,837  1,370 3,406 3,444 163 16 8,399 8,468  11,488 7,569 9,913 28 23 29,021 29,076  3,345 3,413 7,780 0 39 14,577 14,583  219 8,426 7,959 3,176 0 19,780 21,625  29,090 45,690 43,382 6,149 564 124,875 136,451  32  Sept. 2002  Total   Bush River Basin 2000 Land Use  8-Digit Watershed Pie Charts  Bush River 8-Digit Watershed Agriculture (19.80%)  Lower Winters Run 8-Digit Watershed Agriculture (16.31%) Urban (41.00%)  Urban (24.80%)  Wetlands (7.26%) Other (1.09%) Forest (47.06%) Wetlands (1.94%) Other (0.19%) Forest (40.55%)  Atkisson Reservoir 8-Digit Watershed  Bynum Run 8-Digit Watershed  Agriculture (22.95%)  Urban (34.16%)  Agriculture (39.59%) Urban (53.37%)  Wetlands (0.10%) Other (0.08%) Forest (26.08%)  Forest (23.41%) Other (0.27%) Wetlands (0.00%)  Aberdeen PG 8-Digit Watershed Agriculture (1.11%)  Swan Creek 8-Digit Watershed  Urban (31.72%)  Agriculture (33.17%)  Urban (40.24%)  Forest (42.60%) Wetlands (0.61%) Other (0.52%)  Wetlands (16.06%)  Other (0.00%)  Forest (33.98%)  33  Sept. 2002   Large Forest Blocks / Forest Interior Large blocks of forest land cover are incorporated into the Green Infrastructure of the landscape. Within large blocks of forest, habitat is available for species that are specialized for conditions with relatively little influence by species from open areas or humans. For example, forest interior dwelling birds require forest interior habitat for their survival and they can not tolerate much human presence. Map 10 Forest Interior shows blocks of contiguous forest that are at least 50 acres in size with at least 10 acres of forest interior (forest edge is at least 300 feet away). This size threshold was chosen to help ensure that the forest interior is large enough to likely provide significant habitat for sensitive forest interior dwelling species. While blocks of forest interior cover about 22% of the entire Bush River Basin, the amount of large-block forest interior varies significantly among the 8-digit watersheds in the river basin as summarized in the table below:  About one third of the two watersheds abutting the Chesapeake Bay (Bush River and Aberdeen PG) are covered by large blocks of forest interior.  Bynum Run watershed has the least forest interior cover relative to other Bush River watersheds.  The three remaining 8-digit watersheds in the Bush River Basin have similar amounts of forest interior cover (between 14% and 18%).

In the GIS application developed by Maryland DNR and its partners, Green Infrastructure refers to areas of natural vegetation and habitat that have statewide or regional importance as defined by criteria developed by DNR. The criteria for identifying of lands as Green Infrastructure is limited to considering natural resource attributes currently found on those lands. One example of the criteria is that interior forest and wetlands complexes at least 250 acres in size are considered as part of Green Infrastructure. As a second example, sensitive species habitat that is located within areas of natural vegetation at least 100 acres in size is also counted as Green Infrastructure. Other potential attributes of Green Infrastructure lands, such as ownership or if the current natural conditions are protected in some way, are not criteria for Green Infrastructure but they may be considered independently. Within the Green Infrastructure network, large blocks of natural areas are called hubs and the existing or potential connections between them are called links or corridors. Together the hubs and corridors form the Green Infrastructure network which can be considered the backbone of the region's natural environment. Protection of Green Infrastructure lands may be addressed through various existing programs including Rural Legacy, Program Open Space, conservation easements and others. The 2001 Maryland General Assembly approved $35 million for the Green Print program which is targeted primarily to protecting Green Infrastructure areas. This funding category is administered by Program Open Space. Map 11 Green Infrastructure shows several significant local characteristics of Green Infrastructure:  Bush River Basin Green Infrastructure hubs tend to be located in lowlands near the Chesapeake Bay in two 8-digit watersheds: Bush River and Aberdeen Proving Ground. These hubs appear to exist because of the protection from development pressure afforded by Federal ownership/management. Another large hub is located in the northern central portion of the Bush River watershed.  Lower Winters Run and Atkisson Reservoir watersheds have small Green Infrastructure hubs adjacent to major streams.  Bynum Run watershed has a small portion of a Green Infrastructure hub near its confluence with the Bush River. All other areas of natural vegetation in the watershed did not meet Green Infrastructure criteria (generally too small in size).  Swan Creek watershed has several Green Infrastructure hubs that are separated by the major highways serving the Baltimore / Philadelphia areas. Potential Next Steps. Green Infrastructure, Forest Interior Dwelling Species and other views of the landscape could be integrated into various local landuse planning and management scenarios.  35  Sept. 2002   Protected Lands As used in the context of watershed restoration, ""protected land"" includes any land with some form of long term limitation on conversion to urban / developed land use. This protection may be in various forms: public ownership for natural resource or recreational intent, private ownership where a third party acquired the development rights or otherwise acquired the right to limit use through the purchase of an easement and other mechanisms. The extent of ""protection"" varies greatly from one circumstance to the next. Therefore, for some protected land, it may be necessary to explore the details of land protection parcel by parcel through the local land records office to determine the true extent of protection. For purposes of watershed restoration, a knowledge of existing protected lands can provide a starting point in prioritizing potential restoration activities. In some cases, protected lands may provide opportunities for restoration projects because owners of these lands may value natural resource protection or enhancement goals. The table Protected Lands Summary and Map 12 Protected Land and Smart Growth summarize the status of protected lands in the Bush River basin.  In the Bush River Basin, Federal land ownership accounts for nearly one third of the land. Federal Land dominates land ownership in two watersheds: Bush River and Aberdeen Proving Ground.  Non-Federal land protection in the Lower Winters Run watershed is the highest percentage (9%) among watersheds (8-digit) in the Bush River Basin. This relatively high percentage of protection is mostly associated with the Otter Point Creek Park. This property has been designated as a component of the Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve in Maryland. A total of 261 acres of open water and 672 acres of adjoining wetlands and uplands are protected for long-term estuarine research and monitoring and for estuarine education. 4 Potential Next Steps. Existing protected lands could be assessed as potential contributors or hubs for WRAS implementation. Various types of opportunities could be explored:  Watershed location should be a factor in considering land protection opportunities.  Potential sites for implementation projects and/or demonstration projects.  Opportunities for management enhancement or additional protection.  Opportunities for expanding protection from currently protected land to adjacent parcels.  36  Sept. 2002   Protected Land Summary * Bush River Basin in Harford County Watershed Area Protected in Acres Lower Winters Run Bynum Run Bush River Swan Creek 247 0 136 0 0 719 2% 7% Category Aberdeen PG Atkisson Reservoir  Conservation Easements DNR Land County Parks Agricultural Easements Agricultural Districts Federal Land Percent of Watershed Protected  435 530 132 359 189 13,390 4% 41%  362 0 62 312 0 0 9% 9%  15 0 804 710 361 0 5% 7%  73 70 30 0 35 0 1% 1%  0 0 0 0 0 19,795 0% 100%  33,904 3% 31%  The percent on top excludes agricultural districts and Federal land.

In Rural Legacy Areas, protection of land from future development through purchase of easements (or in fee simple) is promoted. In Priority Funding Areas, State funding for infrastructure may be available to support development and redevelopment. Both are shown in Map 12 Protected Land and Smart Growth: - Harford County's Rural Legacy Area is located entirely outside of the Bush River Basin, which is mostly in the Deer Creek watershed. - Priority Funding Areas (PFA) in Harford County are mostly in the Bush River Basin with relatively small areas of PFA located in other County watershed areas. The table below shows the relative PFA area for the Bush River watersheds. Priority Funding Areas (PFA) Summary Bush River Basin Watershed PFA Acres Name Bush River Lower Winters Run Atkisson Reservoir Bynum Run Aberdeen PG Swan Creek Bush River Basin Total Acres 36,967 8,399 29,021 14,577 19,780 16,131 124,875 12,834 5,160 5,860 12,066 2,016 3,965 41,901 Percent of Watershed In PFA 35% 64% 20% 83% 10% 25% 34%  Note: Data is from 2000. Acreage in PFAs and protected land acreage are not mutually exclusive. It is common for park land, which is commonly considered to be protected, to be in a PFA to facilitate receiving State funding for park infrastructure. For example, Otter Creek Park is protected from development but it is entirely within a PFA. Therefore, protected land acreage and percentage of a watershed should only be used as an indicator of general direction for development.  38  Sept. 2002   Soils of the Bush River Basin 1. Interpreting Local Conditions with Natural Soil Groups Soil conditions, like soil type and moisture conditions, greatly affect how land may be used and the potential for vegetation and habitat on the land. Soil conditions are one determining factor Natural Soil Groups for water quality in streams and rivers. Local soil Bush River Basin conditions vary greatly from site to site as published information in the Soil Survey for Harford County shows. This complicated information can be effectively summarized using (27.21%) (29.91%) Natural Soil Groups to help identify useful generalizations about groups of soils. The pie chart shows the distribution of percentages of soils based on broad categories: (16.14%) -- Yellow - prime agricultural soils (26.74%) -- Green - all other well drained soils including stony/rocky soils -- Blue - all poorly drained soils including wetlands and marshes and soils with perched watertables. -- White - unclassified soils including all of Aberdeen Proving Ground The Map 13 Soils shows that prime farmland, depicted in yellow or yellow with crosshatching, is widely distributed across the Bush River Basin. 2. Soils and Watershed Planning Local soil conditions can be a useful element in watershed planning and for targeting restoration projects. Using Prime Farmland as an example, the scattered location of prime agricultural soils in the Bush River Basin suggests that agricultural preservation efforts need to be targeted to selected areas and prioritized for action to help ensure that protection efforts result in viable agricultural communities. Additionally, prioritization of agricultural cost share funding to these areas could provide additional incentive for local land owners to participate in agricultural preservation programs. Comparing Map 13 Soils with Map 9 2000 Land Use and Map 11 Green Infrastructure suggests other potential watershed planning approaches. For example, two Green Infrastructure hubs are located north of the tidal Bush River along upper James Run and Grays Run. In these areas, land owners tended to leave poor soils in natural vegetation because the soils were wet or stony. Targeting natural resource protection efforts to areas like this, which offer poor suitability for active use, could benefit both land owners and natural resource protection.  39  Sept. 2002   Wetlands 1. Introduction to Wetland Categories 26  The Bush River Basin has a great diversity of wetland types relative to other Maryland physiographic regions because it includes both Piedmont and Coastal Plain physiographic areas and it has both tidal and nontidal freshwater waterbodies. Map 14 Wetlands In The Bush River Basin shows the general distribution of wetlands based on the National Wetlands Inventory. The majority of the wetland acreage in the river basin is on Federal land Brief descriptions of the major wetland categories found in the River Basin are listed below. Estuarine Wetlands. These systems consist of brackish tidal waters and contiguous wetlands where freshwater runoff from the land receives some saltwater influence. Estuarine wetlands are abundant throughout the Bush River Basin's Coastal Plain covering nearly 5,700 acres. Brackish marshes are found along the shores of Chesapeake Bay and they are the predominant estuarine wetland type in Maryland. Estuarine shrub swamps are common along the Maryland coastal zone. Aquatic beds, comprised mostly of submerged aquatic vegetation, are abundant in shallow water zones of Maryland's estuaries, especially Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Palustrine wetlands. These systems are freshwater wetlands that are not associated with streams or lakes. In the Bush River Basin, this wetland type covers slightly more than 3,700 acres. These wetlands are found on floodplains along the freshwater tidal and nontidal portions of rivers and streams, in upland depressions, and in broad flat areas between otherwise distinct watersheds. Tidal freshwater swamps occur along coastal rivers in areas subject to tidal influence. Scrub-shrub swamps are not abundant but are represented in the Bush River Basin. Emergent wetlands on the Coastal Plain are characterized by a wide range of vegetation, depending on water regime. (Adapted from Wetlands of Maryland, Tiner and Burke, 1995.) Lacustrine wetlands (associated with lakes) and Riverine wetlands (associated with rivers) cover relatively small areas of the Bush River river basin: 54 acres and 21 acres respectively. 2. Wetland Studies In the Bush River Basin The presence of the Otter Point National Estuarine Reserve Research in the Bush River watershed has facilitated understanding of plant populations in local marshes. During the 1990s, a plant list for Otter Point Creek compiled by William Hilgartner identified 133 species of herbaceous plants and 39 species of woody plants.17  40  Sept. 2002   3. Tracking Wetlands Oversight of activities affecting wetlands involves several regulatory jurisdictions. The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) is the lead agency for the State and cooperates with DNR, the Army Corps of Engineers and other Federal and local agencies. As part of its responsibility, MDE tracks State permitting and the net gain or loss of wetlands over time. As the Wetlands Regulatory Status table shows, changes tracked in the State regulatory program have amounted to a small net increase in nontidal wetland acreage in the Bush River watershed. Research findings from Otter Point Creek associated with the Otter Point National Estuarine Reserve Research in the Bush River watershed has facilitated understanding of the changes over time in local marshes. According to research reported in 1998, the mix of wetland types in the upper Otter Point Creek tidal freshwater marshes has changed greatly since early colonial times. In about 1730, nearly the entire marsh area here was subtidal, i.e. the marsh was mostly underwater. By 1990, the same marsh area had changed so that its area was roughly one third subtidal, one third intertidal and one third forested.14 The change appears to be associated with sediment deposition and incorporation into the marsh.15 Tracking Nontidal Wetland Change In The Bush River Basin In Acres 1/1/1991 through 12/31/2001 20 Basin Code 02130701 02130702 02130703 02130704 02130705 02130706 021307 Watershed Bush River Lower Winters Run Atkisson Reservoir Bynum Run Aberdeen Proving Ground Swan Creek Permanent Impacts -8.01 -3.43 -3.55 -8.37 -0.13 -5.27 Permittee Mitigation 10.19 8.47 9.03 6.15 0 7.85 Programmatic Gains 0 0 0 0 0 2.20 Other Gains 0.76 0 0 0 0 0 Net 2.94 5.05 5.48 -2.22 -0.13 4.78  Bush River -28.75 41.71 2.20 0.76 15.91 Basin Notes: Only nontidal wetland changes are shown, tidal wetland changes are excluded. Acreage presented for each watershed is not normalized. Regulatory tracking for authorized nontidal wetland losses began in 1991. Comprehensive tracking of voluntary wetland gains began in 1998.  41  Sept. 2002   4. Interpreting Wetland Distribution Wetlands in the Bush River Watershed (02130701) are shown in Map 15 Wetlands On NonFederal Land: Bush River Watershed. The table below accompanies the map with a summary of wetland categories and acreage. Based on the DNR wetlands data used for the map, forested fresh water wetlands are the largest category of wetlands in this area. The data source used for this interpretation has not been completed for the entire Bush River Basin. In the context of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS), wetlands serve valuable water quality and habitat functions that may not be provided by other land uses. Therefore, protection and enhancement of existing wetlands, and restoration of past wetland areas, can be a valuable element in the WRAS. (Also see the Wetland Restoration section.)

However, coverage for the Bush River Basin (021307) is incomplete. The National Wetlands Inventory is available for the entire Bush River Basin but it has a lower resolution and, therefore, identifies a smaller wetland acreage for the same geographic area. In comparison, the generalized land use / land cover data presented earlier in this chapter is the lowest resolution data that identifies wetlands and, therefore, identifies even fewer wetlands in the same geographic area. See the Sensitive Species Section for discussion on Wetlands of Special State Concern.  42  Sept. 2002   Floodplains and Low Elevation Areas Subject to Sea Level Rise Floodplains and associated riparian areas are naturally important areas for habitat and hydrologic functioning of streams. Map 16 Floodplain shows that the most 100-year floodplains in the Bush River Basin are located on Federal land. On non-Federal land, two of the largest 100-year floodplain areas are on lower Winters Run and near the confluence of Bynum Run and James Run. Most floodplain areas are too small to be seen at the basin-wide scale and require subwatershed scale or smaller assessment. Most areas of the Bush River Basin have sufficient elevation to be unaffected by any potential for sea level rise in the next 50 to 100 years. As a gauge of potential sea level rise risk, a Marylandwide assessment of land with an elevation of 1.5 meters or less was first published in 1998 and then repackaged in a 2000 State report. According to this report, all the at-risk areas identified in the Bush River Basin are on Federally managed land.24 Currently, DNR is considering sea level rise as it works to improve prediction of shoreline erosion. New information that may be generated by this effort will be shared with local jurisdictions and other stakeholders as it becomes available. Potential Next Steps. Protection of people and property has always been the core of floodplain management. Additional objectives for watershed management relative to floodplains may include conservation of habitat, targeting for restoration of wetlands and stream buffers, and prioritization for protecting selected areas from development or inappropriate uses. Using information gathered in the Stream Corridor Assessment, restoring natural floodplain and wetland function can be one criteria for prioritizing stream restoration projects. Maintaining stable floodplains on a watershed-wide basis can be a factor in determining stormwater management requirements including control of impervious area in a watershed.  43  Sept. 2002   LIVING RESOURCES AND HABITAT  Overview Living resources, including all the animals, plants and other organisms that call the land and waters of the Bush River watershed home, are being affected by human activity. The information summarized here suggests that some of the significant stresses on living resources in the watershed are manipulation of habitat, excessive movement of sediment and excessive availability of nutrients. The Living Resource information summarized here should be considered a partial representation because numerous areas of potential interest or concern could not be included due to lack of information, time or resources. For example, information on many forms of aquatic life, woodland communities, terrestrial habitats and other factors should be considered as watershed restoration decisions are being made. Therefore, it is recommended that stakeholders in the watershed identify important living resource issues or priorities so that additional effort can be focused where it is most needed. New information should be added or referenced as it becomes available.  44  Sept. 2002   Living Resource Indicators Aquatic organisms are sensitive, in varying degrees, to changes in water quality and aquatic habitat. This association offers two perspectives that are important for watershed restoration. First, improvements for living resources offer potential goals, objectives and opportunities to gauge progress in watershed restoration. Second, the status of selected species can be used as to gauge local conditions for water quality and habitat. This second perspective is the basis for using living resources as an ""indicator."" The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan published in 1998 listed the following living resource indicators for the Bush River Basin.2 In the table below, ""attain"" means watershed conditions are at least as good as the benchmark. ""Exceed"" means that watershed conditions are not as good as the benchmark. An empty box in the table """", means that an indicator could not be generated. Several of these indices rely on index rankings generated from a limited number of sampling sites which were then generalized to represent entire watersheds. Considering this limitation on field data, it may be beneficial to conduct additional assessments to provide a more complete understanding of local conditions as part of the WRAS.  Lower Winters Run  Bynum Run  SAV Abundance Index SAV Habitat Requirement Attainment Non-Tidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity Non-Tidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity Non-Tidal In-stream Habitat Index  1.0 2.0 ----  ------  --4.4 8.50 5.98  ---8.30 6.01  ------  NOTES: Click on the indicator name to link to its description and interpretation. Unshaded indicators in the table grid mean that average watershed conditions measured by this indicator are better than the Statewide benchmark. Shaded indicators mean that average watershed conditions measured by this indicator are worse than the Statewide benchmark, i.e. water quality problems are more likely to arise due to the conditions represented by the indicator.  45  Swan Creek ---- Sept. 2002  Bush River  APG  Living Resource Indicator  Atkisson Reservoir   1. SAV Abundance For tidal areas of the Bush River watershed, the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) scored ""1.0"" for the Abundance Indicator which means that SAV covered 10% or less of the potential SAV habitat. This indicator is designed to allow comparison of watersheds based on actual SAV acreage versus potential SAV acreage. To generate the score for this indicator, two measurements of SAV area were estimated: 1) area covered by SAV in the year 1996 was measured using aerial survey data, and 2) the potential SAV area was measured based on water depth (up to two meters deep), physical characteristics and historic occurrence of SAV. The benchmark used in the Unified Watershed Assessment of the Clean Water Action Plan for the SAV Abundance Index was 10%. If less than 10% of the potential SAV area in a watershed was covered by SAV in 1996, then the watershed was listed in the category ""needs improvement"". If more than 10% of the potential SAV area in a watershed was covered by SAV in 1996, then the watershed was listed in the category ""needs preventative action"" to protect or enhance SAV abundance. No watershed in the State scored higher than 2, reflecting a maximum observed coverage of 20%. 2. SAV Habitat For tidal areas of the Bush River watershed, the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) scored ""2.0"" for the Habitat Index which means that SAV habitat requirements were not met based on 1994-1996 data. This index is designed to allow comparison of watersheds based on several measurements of habitat conditions: water clarity as measured by secchi depth, dissolved inorganic nitrogen where applicable, dissolved inorganic phosphorus, abundance of algae as measured by Chlorophyll a and total suspended solids. The benchmark used in the Unified Watershed Assessment for the SAV Habitat Index was 7. A score less than 7 means that the watershed's habitat conditions were not favorable for SAV and the watershed was listed as being in need of restoration (Category 1). A score of 7 or higher means that 1994 through 1996 data showed that habitat conditions for SAV in a watershed were sufficient and the watershed was listed in the category for ""restoration needed"". 3. Nontidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) 21 The Coastal Plain stream benthic IBI looks at the insects and other invertebrates, like crayfish, living on the bottoms of streams, considering the overall community composition, the number and diversity of species and the presence of sensitive species. To calculate the benthic IBI, for the Unified Watershed Assessment , reference conditions were established for minimally-impacted streams. IBI values are relative to conditions in these minimally-impacted streams. To create a benchmark for this index, local stream scores in the watershed were compared to reference conditions established for minimally impacted streams. An average benthic IBI less than 6.0 for a watershed caused it to be listed as ""needs restoration"". The Atkisson Reservoir watershed's ranking of less than 6.0 caused it to be listed as ""needs restoration"" for this index.  46  Sept. 2002   4. Nontidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) 21 As interest in whole ecosystems, and ecosystem health, has grown, Indexes of Biotic Integrity (IBIs) for fishes have been developed for small (first- to third-order) non-tidal streams. Several characteristics of the fish community are measured-- numbers of native species, of benthic species and of tolerant individuals; the percent of tolerant species, of dominant species, and of generalists, omnivores and insectivores; the number of individuals per square meter; biomass in grams per square meter; percent of lithophilic spawners; and percent insectivores. These characteristics are scored and summed to calculate a fish IBI for each sampled stream. Scores for watersheds are reported as means for the sites within each watershed (one most degraded, 10 best condition). To create a benchmark for this index, local stream scores in the watershed were compared to reference conditions established for minimally impacted streams. An average fish IBI less than 6.0 for a watershed caused it to be listed as ""needs restoration"". The Atkisson Reservoir and Bynum Run watersheds both had higher index ranks higher than 6.0. 5. Nontidal In-stream Habitat Index 21 In the Bush River Basin two watersheds had sufficient data for assessment in the nontidal instream habitat index. Both the Atkisson Reservoir and Bynum Run watersheds received a score of 6 out of a possible range of scores from 1 (worst) to 10 (best). Of 138 watersheds in Maryland, the 34 (25%) with the lowest nontidal in-stream habitat index received a rank of ""exceed"" and were designated as Category 1 watersheds in need of restoration. This index allows comparison of streams based fish and benthic habitat as measured by in-stream and riparian conditions. For each stream site that was assessed, visual field observations are used to score the site for substrate type, habitat features, bank conditions, riparian vegetation width, remoteness, aesthetic value and other factors. These scores are then integrated to generate a single rank for each stream site.  47  Sept. 2002   Fish and Shellfish 1. Tidal Waters The Bush River is an important spawning and nursery ground for many fish species.19 A survey conducted during the period March 1972 to June 1973 found that the Bush River has considerable spawning by several anadromous, semi-anadromous and local species. These included the commercially important species of striped bass, white perch and herring. It found a wide range of types of fish inhabiting the area. However, two species were clearly dominant in numbers: white perch were said to be ubiquitous and anchovy were found seasonally. 19 Commercial fisheries harvest information is tracked by Maryland DNR Fisheries Service. This information is available on DNR's Internet site. The Bush River's data is reported for several important commercial species as part of the Upper Chesapeake Bay geographic area (above Worton Point). Reporting for other commercially harvested species is not summarized here because reports are for even larger geographic areas.  Blue Crabs: Commercial harvest reporting for blue crabs groups Bush River data with the Upper Chesapeake Bay above Worton Point. For this wider area, commercial blue crab harvest for the 1992 to 1999 was significantly higher than in previous years. Since 1992, the annual harvest tended to be greater that 1 million pounds with a significantly higher peak in 1995 of 2,266,000 pounds.  Oysters: There is no commercial oyster harvest in the Bush River because the regulatory shellfish harvesting restrictions prevent oyster harvest. Even so, the commercial harvest in the entire Upper Chesapeake Bay is a minuscule percentage of the Bay-wide harvest. The very low salinity of the area inhibits oyster habitat and survival.  Striped Bass: The reported annual harvest for striped bass in 1999 from the Bush River was 5,583 pounds. Prior to 1999, Bush River data was reported as part of the Upper Chesapeake Bay (north of Worton Point). During the late 1990s, the annual harvest for the Upper Bay including the Bush River was typically around 70,000 pounds with one exception in 1998 with a larger harvest of 97,000 pounds. The Chesapeake Bay's most important striped bass spawning and nursey area is considered to be the Upper Chesapeake Bay based on area size and productivity. The estuarine areas of the Bush River Basin may contribute to the productivity of this area but the relative value of the Bush River is not well understood. 2. Nontidal Areas General information on fish in nontidal streams is primarily gathered as part of the Maryland Biological Stream Survey. See MBSS Findings for summary information. The Designated Use of Bynum Run as Use 3 Natural Trout Waters suggests that brook trout where found here. However, DNR Fisheries Service has no records that naturally reproducing trout populations exist anywhere in the Bush River Basin.28 48 Sept. 2002   3. Fish Consumption In late 2001, MDE issued revised fish consumption advisories including significant limitations on consumption of some fish species in the Bush River area. The advisory recommends not eating channel catfish and severely limiting meals of white perch caught in the Bush River mainstem. The concern in these fish is contamination from PCBs and/or pesticides. Methylmercury is also a contaminate of concern primarily for some fish species caught in lakes. The table below summarizes advisory for areas in the Bush River Basin. More complete information is available at www.mde.state.md.us/fish_tissue/index.html In issuing the 2001 advisory, MDE cited changes in the EPA's recommended daily consumption estimates, new sampling data and improved analytical techniques, which led to advisories to limit consumption of 13 species of fish recreationally caught in 14 Maryland waterways. While contaminant levels have not changed, the consumption advisories are especially important for children and women of child-bearing age who are or may become pregnant or are nursing.

The survey found nothing peculiar, special or unusual regarding the phytoplankton community. Of the six most common species found, five were diatoms and one was a bluegreen algae. As an indicator of the extent of green algae populations, chlorophyll a concentrations only occasionally reached high levels above 50 ug/l. The highest chlorophyll a concentration reported during the study was 139 ug/l.19  Maryland Biological Stream Survey  21, 22  Assessment of biological communities in nontidal streams, like macroinvertebrates, fish and their physical habitat can help with interpretation of aquatic conditions from the perspective of living resources. The Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) has been conducting these assessments Statewide since 1994. More recently, beginning in the year 2000, MBSS has also facilitated collection of benthic macroinvertebrate information by citizen volunteers in the Stream Waders program. The MBSS approach involves assessment of each site using a suite of criteria including identification of fish and benthic macroinvertebrate species present. The findings from the criteria are then combined to generate an index for benthic organisms, fish and for physical habitat. The table below shows the scales used to rate findings for the sites shown on the accompanying maps and the table MBSS Findings Summary for the period 1994 through 2000. Additional explanation of the purpose and value of assessing benthic organisms is presented in the text box Why Look At Benthos In Streams . More complete information on the MBSS program and findings for each sampling site is available at http://mddnr.chesapeakebay.net/mbss/search.cfm . Map 17 Benthic Index Scale of 1 to 5 1 to 1.99 2 to 2.99 3 to 3.99 4 to 5 Map 18 Fish Index Scale of 1 to 5 1 to 1.99 2 to 2.99 3 to 3.99 4 to 5 Map 19 Physical Habitat Index Scale of 0 to 100 0 to 11.99 12 to 41.99 42 to 71.99 72 to 100  Category Very Poor Poor Fair Good  The surveys reported in the map were conducted by the Maryland Biologcial Stream Survey (MBSS), a program in DNR. Each symbol on the map characterizes a stream segment (about 100 feet) based on the fish/benthic population and habitat conditions. An index of ""good"" means that the stream segment that was sampled has conditions that are close to those found in a comparable 50 Sept. 2002   ""reference"" stream. Reference streams are found to have the most natural, least impacted stream conditions found in the area for a particular type of stream. Other index findings varying from fair to poor to very poor deviate further and further from reference stream conditions. Additional monitoring by MBSS is scheduled for the Bush River Basin to assess the in-stream aquatic community and habitat conditions in 2002 (10 sites) and in 2003 (10 sites.)10 Sampling by citizen volunteers in the MBSS Stream Waders program is anticipated to continue during this time. Potential Next Steps. MBSS provides site-specific information on nontidal streams that can be considered in the WRAS process to prioritize potential restoration and protection projects. Additionally, for selected streams or project areas, before and after monitoring using MBSS methods can provide a gauge of success for individual projects. MBSS methods can also provide a measure of progress toward water quality improvement goals based on biological indicators.

Benthos are sometimes called ""stream bugs"" though that name overly simplifies the diverse membership of this group. Unimpaired natural streams may support a great diversity of species ranging from bacteria and algae, to invertebrates like crayfish and insects, to fish, reptiles and mammals. Benthic macro-invertebrates, collectively called benthos, are an important component of a stream's ecosystem. This group includes mayflies, caddisflies, crayfish and similar creatures. that inhabit the stream bottom, its sediments, organic debris and live on plant life (macrophytes) within the stream. The food web in streams relies significantly on benthos. Benthos are often the most abundant source of food for fish and other small animals. Many benthic macroinvertebrates live on decomposing leaves and other organic materials in the stream. By this activity, these organisms are significant processors of organic materials in the stream. Benthos often provide the primary means that nutrients from organic debris are transformed to other biologically usable forms. These nutrients become available again and are transported downstream where other organisms use them. Benthos are a valuable tool for stream evaluation. This group of species has been extensively evaluated for use in water quality assessment, in evaluating biological conditions of streams and in gauging influences on streams by surrounding lands. Benthos serve as good indicators of water resource integrity because they are fairly sedentary in nature and their diversity offers numerous ways to interpret conditions. They have different sensitivities to changing conditions. They have a wide range of functions in the stream. They use different life cycle strategies for survival.  52  Sept. 2002   Sensitive Species Sensitive species are most widely known in the form of Federally-listed Endangered or Threatened animals such as the bald eagle. In addition to these charismatic rare animals, both US EPA and Maryland DNR work through their respective Federal and State programs to protect numerous endangered, threatened, or rare species of plants and animals and the habitats that support those species. For the purposes of watershed restoration, it is valuable to account for known locations of habitat for these species. These places are often indicators, and sometimes important constituents, of the network of natural areas or ""green infrastructure"" that are the foundation for many essential natural watershed processes. Protecting these species and/or promoting expansion of their habitats can be an effective foundation for a watershed restoration program. 1. Habitat Protection Categories DNR's Wildlife and Heritage Division uses three designations for areas providing habitat for sensitive species. These designations are described in the text box Maryland's Sensitive Species Protection Areas. As shown in Map 20 Sensitive Species, two of the three sensitive species designations are found in the Bush River Basin. The purpose of these designations is to help protect sensitive species and their habitat through the review of applications for State permits or approvals, and review of projects that involve State funds. For the types of projects potentially described above, DNR makes recommendations and/or requirements to protect sensitive species and their habitat. These categories do not place requirements on any activities that do not require a permit/approval or do not involve State funds. However, there are State and Federal restrictions that address ""takings"" of protected species that apply more broadly. In addition, many counties have incorporated safeguards for these areas into their project and permit review processes. In all instances, property owners are encouraged to seek advice on protecting the sensitive species / habitat within their ownership. More details and guidance can be requested from DNR Natural Heritage Division staff.  53  Sept. 2002   2. Wetlands of Special State Concern The Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) in the Bush River Basin are shown in Map 20 Sensitive Species though most are difficult to see at the scale of the map. The largest groupings of the WSSCs are listed in the summary table below. Wetlands of Special State Concern  Areas of Concentration In The Bush River Basin Watershed Name Bush River Watershed 02130701 Acres 28 Stream Vicinity Otter Point Creek North of Sod Run Church Creek Atkisson Reservoir 02130703 Swan Creek 02130706 Bush River Basin 021307 37 44 109 Atkisson Reservoir Swan and Gasheys Creeks, Chesapeake Bay shore area Community Vicinity Flying Point Road / Willoughby Woods area South of Perryman Road, ""Perryman Woods"" area North of Rt 40, ""Church Creek Pond"" Harford Glen Center and Aberdeen PG property Oakington Road, Swan Harbor Farm Park  3. Maryland Darter In the Swan Creek watershed (02130706), Gashey's Run was declared critical habitat for the Federally endangered Maryland darter by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 1984. This designation, in part, means that the US Fish and Wildlife Service reviews activities that meet two conditions 1) a federal permit, license and/or funding in involved, and; 2) there is a potential to impact the species or its habitat.26  54  Sept. 2002   Sensitive Species Protection Areas in the Bush River Basin  Sensitive Species Project Review Area (SSPRA) At least 26 SSPRAs are identified in the Bush River Basin. Each SSPRA contains one or more sensitive species habitats. However, the entire SSPRA is not considered sensitive habitat. The SSPRA is an envelope identified for review purposes to help ensure that applications for permit or approval in or near sensitive areas receive adequate attention and safeguards for the sensitive species / habitat they contain. Also see Map 20 Sensitive Species.  Natural Heritage Area (NHA) No NHAs are located in the Bush River basin (Md 6-digit wateshed). NHAs are rare ecological communities that encompass sensitive species habitat. They are designated in State regulation COMAR 08.03.08.10. For any proposed project that requires a State permit or approval that may affect an NHA, recommendations and/or requirements are placed in the permit or approval that are specifically aimed at protecting the NHA. To help ensure that proposed projects that may affect an NHA are adequately reviewed, an SSPRA is always designated to encompass each NHA and the area surrounding it.  Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) There are three concentrations of WSSCs designated in the WRAS project area and several are designated elsewhere in the Bush River Basin. These wetlands are associated with one or more sensitive species habitats that are in or near the wetland. For any proposed project that requires a wetland permit, these selected wetlands have additional regulatory requirements beyond the permitting requirements that apply to wetlands generally. To help ensure that proposed projects that may affect a WSSC are adequately reviewed, an SSPRA is always designated to encompass each WSSC and the area surrounding it. For a listing of designated sites see COMAR 26.23.06.01 at www.dsd.state.md.us  55  Sept. 2002   Submerged Aquatic Vegetation The well-defined link between water quality and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) distribution/abundance makes SAV communities good barometers of the health of estuarine ecosystems. In addition to its value as a water quality indicator, SAV is also a critical nursery habitat for many estuarine species. For example, blue crab ""post-larvae"" are up to 30 times more abundant in SAV beds than adjacent unvegetated areas. Additionally, several species of waterfowl depend on SAV for food when they over-winter in the Chesapeake region. Map 21 Submerged Aquatic Vegetation shows that during the 1980s and 1990s distribution of SAV in the Bush River basin is generally very sparse. Within the WRAS project area, all the SAV areas that were large enough to identify using aerial photography were located adjacent to Federal land. Elsewhere in the Bush River Basin, the largest concentration of SAV has been near Swan Creek. Experience obtained through years of monitoring SAV demonstrates that acreage in the Bush River fluctuates from year to year. For example, SAV acreage in Bush River during the year 2000 was at least 17% and 12 acres greater than acreage in 1999.29 The map also shows that potential SAV habitat area based on a water depth of two meters or less. This shallow depth covers extensive areas of the Bush River and the perimeter of the Bush River Basin adjacent to the Chesapeake Bay. It is believed that the limitations exhibited by historic SAV distribution compared to potential habitat relate in part to excessive nutrient and suspended sediment loads in the Bush River and the Upper Chesapeake Bay. The nutrient loads appear to be driving algae growth that competes with SAV for sunlight. Additionally, suspended sediment also blocks the sunlight which reduces the light that reaches SAV leaves. Potential Next Steps. Beginning in early 2002, Harford County and numerous Federal and State agencies began cooperating to pool their information on SAV and to generate a consensus on SAV management for the Bush River. The findings and results of this effort can be integrated into the local watershed management strategy. The Anita C. Leight Estuary Center and Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (CBNERR) will begin a long term research and restoration project to restore native SAV species to Otter Point Creek and surrounding waters. The staff are using innovative ""SAV planting grids"" and will be using multiple species of SAV to determine the most suitable species, or combination of species, for restoration to the site.

In partnership with Harford County, DNR is conducting a Stream Corridor Assessment on Church Creek in the Bush River watershed in 2002. Trained teams from the Maryland Conservation Corps will walk along streams to identify and document potential problems and restoration opportunities such as the items listed below: DNR will provide a report for County use. Stream Corridor Assessment Data Collection Categories Pipe Outfalls Pond Sites Tree Blockages Inadequate Buffers Erosion Fish Blockages Exposed Pipe Unusual Conditions Trash Dumping In or Near Stream Construction  Potential Next Steps. Harford County has demonstrated success in using Stream Corridor Assessments to identify restoration projects. For the WRAS, this information can be used as a foundation to prioritize/target geographic areas for restoration and/or types of projects for implementation in a watershed-based management strategy.  Recent Stream Corridor Assessments Harford has completed several Stream Corridor Assessments in the Bush River Basin including Bynum Run (1995-1996), Swan Creek (Spring 1994 - Spring 1995) and Winters Run (1998). Each report identifies each site where problems are identified and ranks its severity relative to other sites. Each report also singles out specific sites that are considered particularly severe. As an example of this work, the table below summarizes the findings from the Bynum Run effort.7  57  Sept. 2002   Bynum Run Stream Corridor Assessment Findings Matrix for Winter 1995-1996 Potential Problems Identified Count Length Est. feet / miles 86,818 / 16.4 Severity Frequency 1 23 24 45 62,954 / 11.9 12,554 / 2.4 14 15 1 6 2 3,100 / 0.6 2 132 2 50 8 26 22 3 5 5 1 -120 3 82 33 35 47 20 9 6 4 2 238 4 49 43 22 22 19 2 1 2 -160 5 11 64 15 13 14 7 5 1 5 135  Erosion (stream banks) Pipe Outfalls Fish Blockages Inadequate Buffers, Unshaded Streams Channel Alternation Exposed Pipe Unusual Conditions Trash Dumping Livestock TOTAL  214 172 143 118 71 24 23 10 9 784  2002 Synopic Survey and Benthic Community Assessment Based on 2002 sampling in the Bush River watershed, DNR staff will report on water quality in nontidal streams to supplement knowledge of local conditions. Based on parameters listed below, the survey findings will help identify problem areas and relative conditions among local streams. It will also help rank subwatersheds by their nutrient load contributions to tidal areas of the Bush River. For the same 2002 sampling sites, DNR staff will also report on benthic organism populations in nontidal streams as a gauge of water quality and habitat conditions. DNR's report of 2002 findings will include assessment of water quality, benthic organism populations and the potential relationships that may be drawn from the 2002 data. Synopic Survey Data Collection Parameters Dissolved Oxygen pH Nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) Conductivity  58  Sept. 2002   Aricultural Conservation Programs Harford County has a high level of participation in agricultural conservation programs. Farmers in the county willingly implement management systems that address nutrient runoff and infiltration, erosion and sediment control, and animal waste utilization. The Harford Soil Conservation District (HSCD) works with farmers and landowners in the development of Soil Conservation and Water Quality plans that recommend best management practices that will prevent nutrient and sediment impact on surface and ground water. Some of the conservation practices installed were grassed waterways, riparian herbaceous and riparian forested buffers, conservation cover, cover crops, shallow water wildlife areas and grade stabilization structures. The Maryland Agricultural Cost-Share program (MACS), the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP and CREP) and the Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) are some of the state and federal programs promoted and administered by the Harford SCD and NRCS. 28 Farmers in the watershed who are already using good management practices that benefit water quality could provide examples to promote adoption of similar practices by other farmers. Potential Next Steps. Encouraging implementation of BMPs, nutrient management, participation in conservation programs and other agricultural approaches to protecting water quality are important elements in local water management strategy that can be augmented through the WRAS process.  Marina Programs Discharges of sewage from boats are a concern for water quality because they contribute nutrients, biochemical oxygen demand, pathogens, etc. These discharges are preventable if a sufficient number of pumpout facilities are locally available and boat operators take advantage of these services. Three of the five marinas in the Bush River offer pumpout facilities as shown in Map 22 Marinas. None of these marinas is currently participating in Maryland's Clean Marina Program. The Clean Marinas Program is a way for marina owners to gain certification and public recognition for voluntarily undertaking a number of actions related to marina design, operation, and maintenance intended to properly manage all kinds of marine products and activities, and to reduce and properly manage waste. Information is available at DNR's website, www.dnr.state.md.us/boating. DNR also funds installation and maintenance of marine pumpout facilities, including those at certified Clean Marinas. Information may be obtained from the Waterway and Greenways Division at DNR. One potential element of a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) is to encourage and/or support adding marina pumpout facilities serving the local area and increasing participation in the Clean Marina Program.  59  Sept. 2002   Fish Blockage Removal Many fish species need to move from one stream segment to the next in order to maintain healthy resilient populations. This is particularly true for anadromous fish species because they spawn and hatch from eggs in free flowing streams but live most of their lives in estuarine or ocean waters. Blockages in streams can inhibit or prevent many fish species from moving up stream to otherwise viable habitat. To help prioritize stream blockages for mitigation or removal, the DNR Fish Passage Program maintains a database of significant blockages to fish movement. A summary of blockages listed in the database for the Bush River Basin appears in the Fish Blockages / Removal Opportunities Table and Map 23 Fish Blockages. The listings in this database should be considered as supporting information for Stream Corridor Assessments that have been completed or are planned. Based on experience in other watersheds, it is likely that an assessment would identify additional potential fish blockage problems. Of the more than twenty fish blockages listed in the database, one on Lower Winters Run known as Van Bibber Dam was mitigated in 1990. Correction of this blockage reconnected a large segment of Lower Winters Run to the Chesapeake Bay. Potential Next Steps. In general, mitigation or removal of a blockage to fish movement is recommended if the change would open a significant stream segment containing high quality habitat with existing or potential return of significant fish populations. DNR Fisheries Service can provide technical advice and potentially funding for mitigation projects. Some blockages to fish movement may be structural components of lakes, farm ponds or drainage ditches. If a blockage is found in any of these categories, circumstances like requirements for public recreation needs, drainage control function, land owner needs and other factors are considered in determining the potential for a restoration project.  60  Sept. 2002   Fish Blockages / Removal Opportunities in the Bush River Basin -- Page 1 of 2 Watershed (8-Digit) Bush River 02130701 Station Blockage Corrected Stream Name / Location  BU010 BU011 BU012 BU013 BU014  Gray's Run James Run James Unnamed Tributary Unnamed Tributary yes Otter Point Creek Lower Winters Run Lower Winters Run Winters Run Bynum Run Bynum Run Bynum Run Bynum Run Bynum Run Bynum Run Bynum Run Bynum Run  Carsins Run Road 0.25 miles above I-95 James Run Road Gulf Road 0.3 miles below Rt. 159 0.1 miles above Edgewood 50ft below Atkisson Dam 0.2 miles above Singer Road 25 yards above Rt 1 1 mile below Wheel Road 1 mile above Wheel Road 0.8 miles above Wheel Road 0.5 miles below St. Andrews Rd. 0.1 mile below St. Andrews Rd. 0.6 miles below Rt. 1 0.7 miles below Rt 23 Rt 23  Lower Winters Run 02130702 Atkisson Res. 02130703 Bynum Run 02130704  BU016 BU017 BU018 BU019 BU001 BU002 BU003 BU004 BU005 BU006 BU007 BU008  Aberdeen PG 02130705  no blockages listed in database  Note: Fish Blockage Database records may not include findings from Stream Corridor Assessments.  61  Sept. 2002   Fish Blockages / Removal Opportunities in the Bush River Basin -- Page 2 of 2 Watershed (8-Digit) Swan Creek 02130706 Station Blockage Corrected Stream Name / Location  CW010 CW011 CW030 CW031 CW032 CW063 CW064  Gashey's Creek Gashey's Creek Swan Creek Swan Creek Swan Creek Unnamed Trib to Gashey's Creek Unnamed Trib to Gashey's Creek  0.2 mile below Chapel Road Chapel Road 0.1 mile above Rt. 40 100 ft. above Oak St. 130 yards above Oak Street 0.33 mile below Chapel Road Chapel Road  Note: Fish Blockage Database records may not include findings from Stream Corridor Assessments.  62  Sept. 2002   Stream Buffer Restoration 1. Benefits and General Recommendations Natural vegetation in stream riparian zones act as stream buffers that can provide numerous valuable environmental benefits:  Reducing surface runoff  Preventing erosion and sediment movement  Using nutrients for vegetative growth and moderating nutrient entry into the stream  Moderating temperature, particularly reducing warm season water temperature  Providing organic material (decomposing leaves) that are the foundation of natural food webs in stream systems  Providing overhead and in-stream cover and habitat  Promoting high quality aquatic habitat and diverse populations of aquatic species. To realize these environmental benefits, DNR generally recommends that forested stream buffers be at least 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream. Therefore, DNR is promoting this type of stream buffer for local jurisdictions and land owners who are willing to go beyond the minimum buffer standards. The DNR Watershed Restoration Division and other programs like CREP are available to assist land owners who volunteer to explore these opportunities. 2. Using GIS Identifying the areas that need buffer restoration and prioritizing them for action can be a timeconsuming expensive project. Fortunately, use of a computerized Geographic Information System (GIS) to manipulate remote sensing data can help save limited time and funds. To assist in this technical endeavor, DNR Watershed Management and Analysis Division is offering assistance, including GIS work, to help target restoration of naturally vegetated stream buffers, wetlands and other watershed management projects that may be identified locally. With these tools, information generated by a Stream Corridor Assessment and additional on-the-ground verification or ""ground truthing,"" local government may more efficiently and confidently consider stream buffer restoration as part of a local Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. Several scenarios are presented here to help consider potential areas for stream buffer and wetland restoration. These scenarios can be used alone or in combination as models for targeting potential restoration sites for field verification. These maps are intended to demonstrate a methodology that can be used to locate sites having a high probability of optimizing certain ecological benefits of stream buffers. The resolution of the data used to generate these maps is not sufficient for an accurate site assessment, but can be used to identify potential candidate sites for more detailed investigation. The streams presented in the maps are perennial (blue line) streams as generally shown on US Geological Survey Quadrangle Maps. Intermittent streams were not considered in the stream buffer scenario maps.  63  Sept. 2002   3. Headwater Stream Buffers Headwater streams are also called first order streams. These streams, unlike other streams (Second Order, etc.), intercept all of the surface runoff within the watersheds that they drain. In addition, for many watersheds, first order streams drain the majority of the land within the entire watershed. Therefore, stream buffers restored along headwater streams (First Order) tend to have greater potential to intercept nutrients and sediments than stream buffers placed elsewhere. In targeting stream buffer restoration projects, giving higher priority to headwater streams is one approach to optimizing nutrient and sediment retention. Restoring headwater stream buffers can also provide habitat benefits that can extend downstream of the project area. Forested headwater streams provide important organic material, like decomposing leaves, that ""feed"" the stream's food web. They also introduce woody debris which enhances in-stream physical habitat. The potential for riparian forest buffers to significantly influence stream temperature is greatest in headwater regions. These factors, in addition to positive water quality effects, are key to improving aquatic habitat. 4. Land Use and Stream Buffers One factor that affects the ability of stream buffers to intercept nonpoint source pollutants is adjacent land use. Nutrient and sediment loads from different land uses can vary significantly. The loading rates shown in the table here were calculated for the Lower Potomac River Tributary Basin from the model of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model. Restoration of stream buffers is a valuable agricultural Best Management Practice Annual Nonpoint Source Pollution Load Rates (BMP). By identifying land uses By Land Use in riparian areas with inadequate Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model (2000) stream buffers, like crop land Land Use Nitrogen Phosphorus Sediment adjacent to streams, the potential (lbs/ac) (lbs/ac) (tons/ac) to reduce nutrient and sediment loads can be improved. To Crop land 17.11 1.21 0.74 assist in finding areas with crop Urban 7.5 0.7 0.09 land adjacent to streams, the same land use data shown in Pasture 8.40 1.15 0.30 Map 9 2000 Land Use / Land Cover can be filtered using GIS. Forest 1.42 0.00 0.03 The new scenario shown in Map 24 Stream Buffer Land Use Scenario focuses on the land use within 50 feet of a stream. This view, supplemented with the land use pollution loading rates, suggests potential buffer restoration opportunities that could minimize nutrient and sediment loads. (Note: DNR is encouraging stream buffers 150 feet wide on each side of the stream, which is significantly greater than minimum buffer requirement, to enhance nutrient and habitat benefits beyond minimum buffer requirements.) 64 Sept. 2002   5. Nutrient Uptake from Hydric Soils in Stream Buffers In general, the nutrient nitrogen moves from the land into streams in surface water runoff and in groundwater. In watersheds like the Bush River Basin, a significant percentage of nitrogen enters streams in groundwater. Stream buffers can be used to capture nitrogen moving in groundwater if buffer restoration projects have several key attributes:  Plant with roots deep enough to intercept groundwater as it moves toward the stream  Plants with high nitrogen uptake capability, and  Targeting buffer restoration projects to maximize groundwater interception by buffer plants. Hydric soils in stream riparian areas can be used as one factor to help select stream buffer restoration sites. Siting buffer restoration on hydric soils would offer several benefits:  Plant roots are more likely to be in contact with groundwater for longer periods of time  Hydric soils tend to be marginal for many agricultural and urban land uses  Natural vegetation in wet areas often offers greater potential for habitat. Map 25 Stream Buffer Hydric Soils on Open Land Scenario identifies lands adjacent to streams that are composed of hydric soil and also have insufficient stream buffers in the central part of the Bush River Basin. The map suggests that several areas north of Bel Air have unbuffered streams on hydric soils. This type of area could offer opportunities to restore stream buffers and intercept nitrogen in near-surface groundwater before it reached the nearby stream. To generate the map, hydric soils (Natural Soils Group of Maryland, MDP) were grouped into two classes and rated in terms of their potential to maximize groundwater/root zone interaction: poorly drained hydric soils (high nutrient retention efficiency), and moderately well drained hydric soils (moderately high nutrient retention efficiency). An important next step in using this information is verification of current field conditions. Care must be taken during field validation to evaluate any hydrologic modification of these soils, such as ditching or draining activities, which would serve to decrease potential benefits. 6. Optimizing Water Quality Benefits by Combining Priorities Strategic targeting of stream buffer restoration projects may promote many different potential benefits. To maximize multiple benefits, site selection and project design need to incorporate numerous factors. For example, finding a site with a mix of attributes like those in the following list could result in the greatest control of nonpoint source pollution and enhancement to living resources:  land owner willingness / incentives  marginal land use in the riparian zone  headwater stream  hydric soils  selecting appropriate woody/grass species  adjacent to existing wetlands / habitat  Additionally, selecting restoration projects that are likely to produce measurable success is an important consideration in prioritizing projects for implementation. In the early stages of a watershed restoration program, measurable water quality improvement can be one of the strongest ways to demonstrate project success. 65 Sept. 2002   In general, targeting restoration projects to one or a few selected tributaries or small watersheds will tend to offer the greatest probability of producing measurable water quality improvement. By selecting small areas like a small first order stream for restoration, there is greater likelihood that water quality problems arise locally and that they can be corrected by limited investment in carefully selected local restoration projects. In the Bush River Basin, available water quality data reinforces the premise that targeting restoration projects to locally generated problems is an important consideration. Because significant inputs to water quality in tidal portions of the Bush River arise from multiple tributary streams and tidal exchange with the Chesapeake Bay, it be will difficult for local projects to demonstrate water quality improvements in tidal waters. However, if watershed restoration projects are targeted to selected tributary streams, improvement in in-stream water quality are more likely to be measurable in terms of water quality parameters, benthos populations or other parameters. Water quality improvements achieved in the tributary will also inevitably contribute to improving the river mainstem. However, improvement in the mainstem of the river may not be measurable if the magnitude of the problem is as great as the data suggest.  Wetland Restoration Wetlands serve important environmental functions such as providing habitat and nursery areas for many organisms, facilitating nutrient uptake and recycling, and providing erosion control and sediment trapping. However, most watersheds in Maryland have significantly fewer wetland acres today than in the past. This loss due to draining, dredging or filling has led to habitat loss and negative water quality impacts in streams and in the Chesapeake Bay. Reversing this historic trend is an important goal of wetland restoration. One approach to identifying candidate wetland restoration sites involves identifying ""historic"" wetland areas based on the presence of hydric soils. This process can be accelerated by using GIS to manipulate soils information with other data like land use. The GIS products can then assist in initiating the candidate site search process, targeting site investigations and helping to identify land owners. To promote wetland restoration, DNR Watershed Management and Analysis Division has developed GIS capability for these purposes. For the Bush River and Bynum Run 8-digit watersheds, GIS was used to map and prioritize areas of hydric soil for potential wetland restoration. The steps and priorities used to generate the map are listed below:  Data used: Hydric soils (Natural Soil Groups), existing wetlands (National Wetlands Inventory), land use (DOP 1997).  Identify candidate hydric soil areas based on land use. Hydric soils on open land (mostly agricultural fields or bare ground) are retained while those underlying natural vegetation and developed lands are excluded.  Explore hydric soils based on land ownership and proximity to existing wetlands or streams. 66 Sept. 2002   Two of many possible scenarios for finding potential wetland restoration sites are presented on the accompanying maps:  Map 26 Wetland Restoration Opportunities shows that there are numerous concentrations of hydric soils that are near existing wetlands. These areas could be candidates for wetland restoration. The areas identified on the map along Lower Winters Run near the existing protected land at Otter Point could offer both restoration and natural resource protection opportunities within an existing management program.  In comparing Map 26 with Map 25 Stream Buffer Hydric Soils on Open Land , several areas appear in both the stream buffer and the wetland restoration scenarios. For example, the headwaters area of Broad Run, James Run and Grays Run may be candidates for restoration projects that could meet multiple natural resource and water quality protection objectives. The potential wetland restoration sites suggested in these scenarios can be filtered further by using more accurate wetlands and soil information, considering landownership and other factors. Additional steps would be beneficial in applying this information such as considering additional criteria like habitat enhancement opportunities, sensitive species protection, targeting specific streams or subwatersheds for intensive restoration, and using Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) information. Additional wetland restoration opportunities may be identified on non-agricultural lands. For example, residential properties, particularly low density areas, may also provide viable project sites that do not appear on the scenarios presented above.  67  Sept. 2002   PROJECTS RELATED TO THE WRAS PROCESS Overview There are numerous projects and programs that have the potential to contribute to successful development and implementation of a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). The listing included here suggests opportunities for cooperation and coordination that can improve the likelihood of success for the WRAS. This listing is not all-inclusive. It is recommended that this list be augmented as new information becomes available and that follow-up should continue to promote the WRAS process with these and other projects and programs.  319(h)-Funded Projects The Federal funding source generally known as ""319"" is not currently funding projects in the Bush River Basin.  Other Projects This section summarizes projects that have the potential to contribute to development and implementation of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy that have not been addressed elsewhere in the watershed characterization. 1. 2002 SAV Experiment In Otter Point Creek Three species of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) have been transplanted from grow out stations at the Anita C. Leight Estuary Center to prescribed areas of Otter Point Creek to test habitat suitability. This project was conducted by Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (CBNERR) staff along with volunteers as part of the Reserves' research function. 2. Anita C. Leight Estuary Center 2002 Access Improvement The Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve partnered with DNR Program Open Space, Harford County Parks and Recreation and the Harford Land Trust to purchase property near the Anita C. Leight Park which is in the Otter Point Component of the Reserve. Subject to necessary approvals and permits, improvements will include replacement an existing unsafe pier with an ADA accessible pier, addition of an ADA path from the parking area to the pier, and a parking lot upgrade to create a safe ADA parking. The new area will be used for public canoe and pontoon boat programs and as a monitoring site.  68  Sept. 2002   POTENTIAL BENCHMARKS FOR WRAS GOAL SETTING Several programs designed to manage water quality and/or living resources have existing or proposed goals that are relevant to setting goals for the Bush River Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). The goals from these other programs tend to overlap and run parallel to potential interests for developing WRAS goals. Therefore, to assist in WRAS development, selected goals from other programs are included here as points of reference. Coastal Zone Management  The Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) Initiative is a component of the Cumulative and Secondary Impacts section of the Maryland Coastal Zone Management Program Section 309 Strategy (2000-2005). Watershed strategies are defined as comprehensive plans that will identify areas of concern, monitoring strategies, gaps in information, mitigation options, and restoration and protection opportunities.  WRAS projects funded under Coastal Zone Management must be in Maryland's Coastal Zone and must include a local program change as part of the effort. This could include incorporation into the County Comprehensive Plan, adoption of local implementing tools like zoning ordinances and environmental codes, modification of sensitive areas elements or alterations to Smart Growth Priority Funding Areas. Chesapeake 2000 Agreement The Chesapeake 2000 Agreement (C2K) includes several significant commitments pertaining to local watershed management planning and implementation. The goal in the C2K Agreement that is directly related to the development of watershed management plans and action strategies is ""By 2010, work with local governments, community watershed groups and watershed organizations to develop and implement locally supported watershed management plans in two-thirds of the Bay watershed covered by this Agreement. These plans would address the protection, conservation and restoration of stream corridors, riparian buffers and wetlands for the purposes of improving habitat and water quality, with the collateral benefits for optimizing flow and water supply."" Four common elements of watershed management planning were adopted by the Chesapeake Bay Program member jurisdictions to be applied Bay-wide. Those elements support the WRAS components which were also identified as common Bay-wide criteria for watershed management planning. The four approved C2K Agreement watershed planning elements are as follows: 1. Does the plan ""address the protection, conservation and restoration of stream corridors, riparian forest buffers and wetlands?"" Each watershed management plan needs to be based on an assessment of natural resources within the watershed. At a minimum, the assessment will evaluate the condition of stream corridors, riparian buffers and wetlands within the watershed. 2. Does the plan reflect the goals and objectives of ""improving habitat and water quality?"" The plan should reflect the issues that the stakeholders feel are important, and, at a minimum, exhibit a 69 Sept. 2002   benefit to habitat and water quality within the watershed. The goals should be based on priority issues identified by the watershed assessment. 3. Chesapeake 2000 Watershed Commitments Criteria #3 Does the plan identify implementation mechanisms? Capacity to implement the plan will be demonstrated by identifying: - What are the specific management actions? - What are the resources necessary for implementation? - Who will implement the plan? - And when will the actions will be implemented? The implementation mechanisms should also incorporate a periodic re-evaluation to ensure the plan is ""living"" and flexible to the changes in the watershed. 4. Does the plan have demonstrated local support? Every effort should be made to demonstrate a diversity of local support. At a minimum, local governments, community groups and watershed organizations should be encouraged to participate in developing and implementing the watershed management plan. Goals from the Clean Water Action Plan 2:  Clean Water Goals - Maryland watersheds should meet water quality standards, including numerical criteria as well as narrative standards and designated uses.  Watersheds should achieve healthy conditions as indicated by natural resource indicators related to the condition of the water itself (e.g. water chemistry), aquatic living resources and physical habitat, as well as landscape factors (e.g. buffered streams and wetland restoration). Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998 - The most significant feature is requiring nutrient management plans for virtually all Maryland farms. The requirement is being phased in over a several year period. - Nitrogen-based plan implementation will be required on all farms beginning December 31, 2001. - Phosphorus-based plan implementation will be required on farms using chemical fertilizer beginning December 31,2002 and on farms using manure or biosolids by July 1, 2005. - Up to 87.5% cost share is available for development of nutrient management plans and up to $20 per ton cost share assistance with costs of manure transportation are available. Implementation of projects assisted by this funding has the potential to move nutrients to sites where they are needed.  70  Sept. 2002   REFERENCES  1. DNR. Internet Site: www.dnr.state.md.us/ .

The number is often used alone as either a noun or an adjective to refer to some aspect of that section of the law, such as grants. Maryland has divided the state into 138 watersheds, each comprising an average of about 75 square miles, that are known as 8-digit watersheds because there are 8 numbers in the identification number each has been given. These nest into the 21 larger 6-digit watersheds in Maryland which are also called Tributary Basins or River Basins. Within the Chesapeake Bay drainage, 8-digit watersheds also nest into 10 Tributary Team Basins. Fish that live most of their lives in salt water but migrate upstream into fresh water to spawn.

Each graph shows two lines: one showing the average measurment for each month and one showing the standard deviation. The example below suggests how to interpret the graphs. Abbreviation key for the graphs: AVG - Average measurement for each month based on the historic record. STD - Standard Deviation for each month based on the historic record.  Total Phosphorus (TP) - Interpretation of graph using July as an example. - The average July TP measurement at Station WT1.1 is slightly less than 0.10 milligrams per liter (mg/l) - The standard deviation July TP measurement at Station WT1.1 is 0.025 mg/l - This means that most of time the historic data record shows that total phosphorus at Station WT1.1 in July is between 0.075 mg/l and 0.125 mg/l - This range for total phosphorous indicates fair water quality.  Total Nitrogen (TN) - Interpretation of graph using July as an example. - The average July TN measurement at Station WT1.1 is about 1.2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) - The standard deviation July TN measurement at Station WT1.1 is close to 0.5 mg/l - This means that most of time the historic data record shows that total phosphorus at Station WT1.1 in July is between 0.7 mg/l and 1.7 mg/l - This range for total nitrogen indicates fair water quality.  106  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Monitoring Graphs  Station WT1.1  Page 2 of 4  107  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Monitoring Graphs  Station WT1.1  Page 3 of 4  108  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Monitoring Graphs  Station WT1.1  Page 4 of 4  109  Sept. 2002   APPENDIX B Maryland Biological Stream Survey 2000-2004 Volume 1 Ecological Assessment of Watersheds Sampled in 2000 Prepared for Maryland Department of Natural Resources Prepared by Nancy E.

GX036-23-11470055	"Statement of Jane Nishida, Maryland Department of the Environment  Presentation Before the Senate Environment Committee  Regarding the ""Clean Water Action Plan"" - A Maryland Perspective  May 13, 1999       Opening Remarks   Good Morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the Sub-Committee. My name is Jane Nishida, Secretary of Maryland's Department of the Environment I am delighted to be here today to support the President's new national initiative to protect America's rivers, lakes, and coastal waters and to give a Maryland perspective on behalf of Governor Parris Glendening. After 27 years of pursuing regulatory solutions under the existing Clean Water Act, the ""Clean Water Action Plan"" represents a fresh and innovative approach which greatly enhances the environmental of options available to States to address impaired waters.   Maryland is very fortunate to have one of the nations most outstanding resources--""the beautiful Chesapeake Bay"". The people of Maryland know the importance of the Chesapeake Bay and are committed to continue the excellent progress we are making restoring the health of the Bay. There are many waters around the country which could similarly benefit from a comprehensive watershed management approach, like the watershed assessment, restoration prioritization process, and action strategies which are promoted through the ""Clean Water Action Plan"".    The New Direction   The Nation's clean water program has been reinvigorated through the ""Clean Plater Action Plan"". This process refocuses State efforts through strengthening and expanding existing programs to assure protection of public health, enhancing stewardship of natal resources, strengthening run-off standards, and expanding citizen's right to know.   Maryland is very excited about these new opportunities. The Action Plan will provide Marylanders a process for refocusing priorities and a mechanism for developing an over-arching strategy to address issues which transcend various environmental laws such as, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Coastal Zone Management Act.    The Bay Program - As a Model   No better model exists as to how a watershed approach can serve as a catalyst for developing interrelated voluntary and regulatory solutions to water quality management, than the ""Chesapeake Bay Program"". Through the Bay program strong federal, State, and local partnerships were achieved. Tributary Teams made up of citizens, local governments, environmentalists, scientists/engineers, homebuilders, and various business and economic interests were established. Waters were assessed, problems identified, and goals agreed to. One of the most successful outcomes was voluntary efforts to achieve a 40 percent nutrient reduction goal. Each Tributary Strategy Team identified reductions targeted to both point and nonpoint sources in each watershed.   Maryland in cooperation with local governments instituted a 50/50 cost share program supported by the Maryland General Assembly which has contributed over $125,000,000 over the past ten years to the cost for insuring nitrogen removal equipment at 63 targeted sewage treatment plants. As effort alone has been credited for reducing nutrients to the Bay by 27 percent.   Governor Parris Glendening and the Maryland General Assembly also passed landmark legislation, through the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998, which will require nitrogen and phosphorus based nutrient management plans on all farms by 2002 and complete implementation by 2005.   Various stakeholder groups in Maryland are currently working with the Department of the Environment to pursue nutrient removal requirements for septic systems to provide for a balanced approach in addressing nutrient reductions from all sectors.   The ""Clean Water Action Plan"" will strongly reinforce Maryland's efforts to clean up the Bay through various initiatives to include:   Promoting watershed assessments, providing guidance for establishing Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs), and enhancing current funding levels for State programs through funding programs like Section 106 and 319.   Establishing nutrient water quality criteria for nitrogen and phosphorus and provide the scientific basis for State adopted standards.   Requiring all State's to manage nutrients on farms by implementing the new Federal Unified Animal Feeding Operation Strategy which will create level playing field among farmers, on a national level, balancing nutrient removal between point and nonpoint sources, and most importantly ensuring that waters impaired by agricultural run-off are restored.    Public Health as a Vital Element of the Action Plan   Although the Bay program has focused on traditions pollutants like suspended solids, oxygen demanding substances, nutrients, fecal coliform and toxics, the summer of 1997 Maryland also demonstrated the need to devote equal attention to public health issues like Pfiesteria.   Emerging disease issues like Pfiesteria and the outbreak of Cryptosporidium in Milwaukee several years ago reinforces the need to reinvigorate our public health program. Source protection studies under the Safe Drinking Water Act and river basin studies under the Clean Water Act, can achieve far greater results by combining them under a collaborative watershed assessment approach as encouraged under the ""Clean Water Action Plan"".   It is essential that EPA and States place appropriate emphasis on finding new mechanisms for treatment and new barriers to disease transmission which replace inadequate historical approaches to protect against this new generation of diseases. Chlorination alone cannot be the answer. Watershed assessments, source water protection, and comprehensive performance evaluations at water plants must be viewed collectively as new approaches to public health protection.    Gunpowder Watershed Project -- A Prototype   In Maryland, such a comprehensive watershed assessment is underway for the Gunpowder Watershed Project. In 1997, EPA, Maryland, Baltimore County, Carroll County, and Baltimore City forged a new partnership to look at issues impacting Baltimore Cites metropolitan area reservoir, Loch Raven. The project examines both the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act issues and investigates:    Impacts from sewage treatment plants on stream biodiversity, health and extent of fisheries, and reservoir eutrophication.   Stormwater impacts on nutrient loadings and localized stream back erosion.   Sedimentation rates of the reservoir.   Cryptosporidium occurrence in the reservoir.   Source protection benefits as compared to water treatment costs, and   Land use impacts associated with development on overall shears loadings and impairments.   As the assessment is completed and various options are considered and prioritized many of the remedies promoted by the ""Clean Water Action Plan"" will be considered. These will necessarily include options for:   Creating wetlands   Using monitoring results to develop TMDLs and watershed permits   Instituting the CAFO Strategy on farms   Implementing Phase II stormwater management requirements   Encouraging pollution prevention and pretreatment requirements at industries and a variety of other options to assure protection of wildlife, improve aquatic habitat, and to enhance natural resources.    Smart Growth   Another approach encouraged Trough the ""Clean Water Action Plan'', which Maryland is  aggressively pursuing involves Smart Growth. Governor Glendening introduced and the Maryland General Assembly passed landmark legislation in 1997 which discourages sprawl development by targeting public funds to existing community centers where infrastructure is in place to accommodate ""planned growth"". This program protects and preserves ""green areas""' eliminates new sources of pollutant run-off, enhances existing communities, and promotes a better quality of life for all Marylanders.   Not only does the Smart Growth initiative discourage sprawl and promote ""green areas"" but it targets limited public funding to existing infrastructure needs which significantly enhances efforts to reduce pollution from metropolitan areas. Key projects receiving targeted funds include combined sewer overflows, stormwater retrofits, Brownfields, sewage treatment upgrades, water supply source protection and treatment, wetland creation projects, and small creek and estuary restoration projects.    Summary and Recommendations   Maryland is looking forward to developing restoration strategies like the Gunpowder project  for other watersheds identified as put of the State's watershed assessment process. Only through collaborative efforts involving multi-media solutions, strong federal/State/local partnerships, and enhancement of existing programs and implementation mechanism, can State efforts continue the progress towards restoring impaired waters to fishable/swimmable standards. The ""Clean Water Action Plan"" is a formidable and well-conceived mechanism for assuring that national water management goals are achieved.   Much progress has been made under the framework of the Clean Water Act but, as we move  forward to the next millennium, new challenges must be met with renewed focus and commitment. Watershed assessments and permits nutrient water quality standards, a progressive CSO Strategy, implementation of the AFO/CAFO Strategy, new wetlands initiatives, stricter controls on non-point source run-off, and Smart Growth will all be essential elements in our new environmental management approach.   Maryland strongly supports the watershed restoration and assessment approach as well as  balanced tributary strategies which are desired to achieve water quality goals through a continuation of voluntary and legally mandated programs. Merging objectives and bringing efforts together to comprehensively address public heals, water quality and living resources is what is needed and what U.S. citizens and Marylanders expect us to do to meet the continuing challenges of restoring and preserving fishable/swimmable waters.     "

The WRAS project area encompasses about 162,000 acres which is 72% of the entire Upper Choptank River watershed. Portions of the watershed in Delaware and Queen Annes County, Maryland, are being considered in the WRAS project but these jurisdictions are not active partners in developing the WRAS. As part of WRAS project, the Maryland Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) is providing technical assistance. For example, DNR is working with the Counties to prepare a Watershed Characterization which is a collection of available water quality related information and identification of issues that may be used as the County generates its Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. Water Quality Overall, water quality as measured by some parameters like dissolved oxygen is frequently satisfactory. However, water quality impairments associated with nutrients and sediment have existed for many years. They appear to be causing high algae populations (chlorophyll a) and poor water clarity (shallow secchi depth). The nutrient impairment is linked to significant loads from both point and nonpoint sources. A fecal coliform impairment in limited areas do not have a currently identified source. These impairments will be the subject of Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) programs within the next few years. Biological impairments in some water bodies as measured by benthic macroinvertebrate community assessment appear to be local in nature. Land Use / Land Cover The Upper Choptank River watershed in Maryland is nearly 60% agricultural and nearly 30% forest or brush. Only about 8% of the watershed is developed. Land use / land cover upstream of the WRAS project area in Delaware are less intensively used: 50% agriculture, 45% forest, 3% developed. Large areas of agricultural and developed lands are on hydric soil and/or poorly drained soil which is drained by Public Drainage Association ditches. Maintenance of these ditches is central to continuation of much of the current economic activity in the watershed. Living Resources and Habitat The Upper Choptank River contains a valuable fisheries resource. It ranks as the third most important striped bass spawning and nursery area in the Chesapeake Bay watershed in terms of size and productivity. In the Upper Choptank, most fish species appear to be stable or doing well. For example, a survey of tidal large mouth bass found the population to be stable or slowly increasing over the three-year study period 1999 through 2001. However, a fish consumption advisory recommends limiting consumption of channel catfish and white perch caught in the mainstem of the Choptank River due to PCB and/or pesticide contamination. viii Sept. 2002   Assessment nontidal streams based on benthic macroinvertebrate communities found that more than 60% of the sites assessed rated as poor or very poor. Assessment of the same stream segments based on fish communities rated more than 60% of the sites as good or fair. These differences indicate that fish, in general, can inhabit maintained ditches more readily than benthic organisms. Beds of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in the Upper Choptank River are small and limited to narrow areas along the river's shoreline. SAV is limited by poor water clarity in much of it potential habitat. Restoration Targeting Tools A synopic survey and benthic community assessment of nontidal streams is collecting data was conducted in 2002. It will assist is identifying areas with issues regarding water quality and benthic macroinvertebrates. A stream corridor assessment is being considered that would identify conditions that potentially impact waters quality and habitat using teams walking along waterways. Four blockages to fish movement have been eliminated in recent years but at least 21 blockages are identified as opportunities for restoration. GIS scenarios were generated to assist in targeting opportunities for restoring stream buffers and wetlands. Hydric soils were used as a key targeting element as well as land use. Based on this analysis of the Upper Choptank River watershed in Maryland, there are over 26,500 acres of wetlands and nearly 43,000 acres of hydric soils. Nearly 24,000 acres of hydric soils were being used as cropland in 2000. This suggests that many opportunities for restoration may be available depending upon land owner interests. A subset of these potential opportunities, about 7,300 acres of hydric soils are within 300 feet of existing wetlands.  ix  Sept. 2002   CONTRIBUTORS TO THE WATERSHED CHARACTERIZATION Local Representatives Raymond Clarke Betsey Krempasky Shane Johnston Matt Kropp Talbot County Dept. of Public Works Caroline County Planning and Code Administration Caroline County Planning and Code Administration Talbot County Dept. of Planning and Zoning  Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service Katharine Dowell, Kathleen Freeman, Greta Guzman, Susan Phelps-Larcher, Catherine Rappe, Ted Weber, John Wolf Fisheries Service Harley Speir, Rick Schaefer, Brett Coakley, Chris Judy, Jim Thompson Public Lands John Dulaney Resource Assessment Service (RAS) Ron Klauda, Sherm Garrison, Martin Hurd, Thomas Parham, Renee Karrh Maryland Maryland Maryland U.S. Fish Dept. of Agriculture (MDA) - John Roderick, Bonita Sims Department of the Environment (MDE) - Robert Daniel, Patrick Dinicola Department of Planning (MDP) - Deborah Weller & Wildlife Service (USFWS)  Editor and Primary Author Ken Shanks, Watershed Management and Analysis Division Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service Maryland Department of the Natural Resources  Other Representatives  Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR)  x  Sept. 2002   INTRODUCTION Watershed Selection Maryland's Clean Water Action Plan, completed in 1998, identified water bodies that failed to meet water quality requirements. As part of the State's response, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) established a program to offer funding and technical assistance to Counties willing to work cooperatively to devise and implement a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) for the impaired water bodies.1,2 Talbot and Caroline Counties are participating in the second round of the WRAS program. The portions of the Upper Choptank Watershed in these Counties are the area selected for restoration. This watershed has several key physical characteristics: - The Upper Choptank is entirely in the Mid Atlantic coastal of Maryland's Eastern Shore; - The watershed is predominantly rural and agricultural with significant forest, small towns and pockets of suburban development; - Open waters of the Upper Choptank mainstem exhibit limited tidal influence. They receive fresh water input from numerous sluggish tributaries including many that are ditched. Location Upper Choptank Watershed Acreage Summary  The Upper Choptank watershed is part of the Choptank Area Land Water Total River basin as shown in Map 1 Talbot County 36,397 1,607 38,004 Regional Context.

These two counties are Watershed Total 219,984 4,740 224,724 the focus of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy which is shown in Map 3 WRAS Project Area. For analytical purposes, DNR has divided the Upper Choptank into 44 subwatersheds as shown in Map 4A, Map 4B, and Map 4C. Purpose of the Characterization One of the earliest steps toward devising a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy is to characterize the watershed using immediately available information. This Watershed Characterization is intended to meet several objectives: 1 Sept. 2002        briefly summarize the most important or relevant information and issues provide preliminary findings based on this information identify sources for more information or analysis suggest opportunities for additional characterization and restoration work.  Additional Characterization Recommended The Watershed Characterization provides a foundation for developing strategies that can be implemented over time to improve water quality. It is part of a framework for a more thorough assessment involving an array of additional inputs:  self-investigation by the local entity of existing programs and policies  targeted technical assistance by partner agencies or contractors  input from local stakeholders  Stream Corridor Assessment, i.e. physically walking the streams and cataloguing important issues, is part of the technical assistance offered by DNR  Synoptic water quality survey, i.e. a program of water sample analysis, can be used to focus on local issues like nutrient hot spots, point source discharges or other selected issues. This is also part of the technical assistance offered by DNR.  Identifying Gaps in Information It is important to identify gaps in available watershed knowledge and gauge the importance of these gaps. One method is to review available information in the context of four physical / biological assessment categories that have been successfully applied in other watershed restoration efforts. These are the main categories that impact aquatic biota:  Habitat: physical structure, stream stability and biotic community (including the riparian zone)  Water Quantity: high water - storm flow & flooding; low water - baseflow problems from dams, water withdrawals, reduced infiltration  Water Quality: water chemistry; toxics, nutrients, sediment, nuisance odors/scums, etc.  Cumulative effects associated with habitat, water quantity and water quality. Adaptive Management In addition, the Watershed Characterization and the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy should be maintained as living documents within an active evolving restoration process. These documents will have to be updated periodically as new, more relevant information becomes available and as the watershed response is monitored and reassessed. This type of approach to watershed restoration and protection is often referred to as ""adaptive management."" 2 Sept. 2002   WATER QUALITY  Priority for Restoration and Protection The 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan established priorities for watersheds in the State water quality restoration and protection. In the Plan, the Upper Choptank River watershed was included in two categories for priority action: - Category 1 Priority watershed (highest State priority for restoration) - Category 3 watershed (indicates that protection us needed for identified resources) As the basis for the prioritization, indicators of water quality, landscape and living resources were developed for all watersheds in Maryland. These indicators are described in greater detail in separate sections in this watershed characterization. Designated Uses All waters of the State are assigned a ""Designated Use"" in regulation, COMAR 26.08.02.08, which is associated with a set of water quality criteria necessary to support that use. These designated uses may or may not be served now but they should be attainable. All surface waters in the Upper Choptank River watershed are designated Use I for Water Contact Recreation, and Protection of Aquatic Life. Waters designated as Use II for Shellfish Harvesting in the Choptank River are located in estuarine waters downstream of the Upper Choptank River watershed. Map 5 Designated Uses shows that Use I water encompass the entire Upper Choptank watershed. For official regulatory information, please see either COMAR or contact MDE. 3,4  3  Sept. 2002   Not Supporting Designated Use  303(d) Listings Some Upper Choptank River watershed water bodies are identified as ""impaired waters"" by listings in the Draft Maryland's 2002 303(d) List summarized below. Satisfactory completion of a public comment period and approval by US EPA is required before the list can be finalized later in 2002. Each water body listed in the table may require preparation of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) to address the water quality and/or habitat impairment.4 Draft 2002 303(d) List of Impaired Waters Upper Choptank River Watershed Summary Name Stream or Watershed Choptank Marine Beach Upper Choptank Watershed Upper Choptank Watershed Stream segments in Talbot County: Beaverdam Branch and unnamed tributaries to Miles Creek Stream segments in Caroline County: Burrsville Br., Coolspring Br., Gravelly Br., Oldtown Br., Tidy Island Ck & an unnamed tributary to it, and unnamed tributaries to each of Andover Branch, Choptank River, Forge Branch and Herring Run These listings mean that pollution associated with the impairment listed are preventing full use of these water bodies based on State criteria. A statewide assessment of water quality is required under Section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act. As part of the assessment, Maryland tracks waterways that do not support their designated use in a list of ""impaired waters"" and in a prioritized list of ""Water Quality Limited Basin Segments"" also known as the 303(d) priority list. Information considered in setting the 303(d) list priorities include, but is not limited to, severity of the problem, threat to human health and high value resources, extent of understanding of problem causes and remedies.5 Impairment Fecal coliform bacteria Nutrients Sediments Biological Sources Nonpoint sources Point, Nonpoint, Natural Point, Nonpoint, Natural Unknown  4  Priority high low low low  4  Sept. 2002   Total Maximum Daily Loads The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) uses the 303(d) priority list to help set State work schedules for various programs including establishment of Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). The intent of establishing one or more TMDLs for a water body is to estimate a pollutant load that the water body can assimilate and still meet water quality standards. Then a waste load allocation is generated to identify appropriate pollution reduction needs among current pollutant sources. Based on January 2002 modeling load projections, 2006 is MDE's target year for establishing a fecal coliform TMDL to protect the Choptank Marine Beach. The January 2002 modeling load projection did not include a schedule for nutrient or sediment TMDLs for the Upper Choptank River. In general, TMDLs include several key parts: 1- Existing conditions for pollutant loads (pounds per day) and pollutant sources. 2- Maximum pollutant load that the water can accept and while still allowing the water body to meet its intended use. 3- Allocation of the maximum pollutant load (#2 above) to specific pollutant sources. To ensure that TMDLs are not exceeded, programs developed by the State and local governments need to be implemented to address pollutant reduction.  5  Sept. 2002   Why Are Local Waters Impaired? Nutrients . In Maryland, most water bodies naturally have low levels of the nutrients nitrogen or phosphorus. These nutrients enter waterways from all types of land uses and from the atmosphere. Nutrient pollution or over-enrichment problems may arise from numerous sources. For example, residential land can be an important contributor of nutrients depending on fertilizer use, extent of lawn and the working condition and location of septic systems. Many farmers carefully manage nutrients using different approaches, so nutrients entering waterways from crop land varies greatly depending on management techniques. Typically, smaller amounts of nutrients reach surface waters from an acre of forest land than from an acre of other types of land. The atmosphere can contribute various forms of nitrogen arising from manmade sources such as the burning of fossil fuels in power plants and from automobile exhaust. Suspended Sediment . Most unpolluted streams and tidal waters naturally have limited amounts of sediment moving ""suspended"" in the water. Excessive amounts of suspended sediment in waterways are considered pollution because they can inhibit light penetration, prevent plant growth, smother fish eggs, clog fish gills, etc. Sediment in streams tends to arise from stream bed and bank erosion and from land that is poorly vegetated or disturbed. Suspended sediment pollution may arise from construction sites, crop land, bare ground and exposed soil generally. The amount of sediment conveyed to a stream varies greatly site to site depending upon stream stability, hydrology, management controls and other factors. Fecal Coliforms . One class of bacteria typically found in the digestive tract of warmblooded animals, including humans, is known as fecal coliforms. Fecal coliform bacteria are always found in animal waste and human sewage (unless it is treated to kill them). In unpolluted streams and tidal waters, water samples commonly contain very few of these bacteria. Water samples exhibiting significantly larger fecal coliform bacteria populations are ""indicators"" of contamination by fecal material. Depending on local conditions, sources of fecal contamination may include any combination of the following: inadequately treated sewage, failing septic systems, wild or domestic animals, urban stormwater carrying pet waste and similar sources.  6  Sept. 2002   National Academy Press, Clean Coastal Waters (2000) What Are the Effects of Nutrient Over-Enrichment? 6 The productivity of many [lake, estuary and] coastal marine systems is limited by nutrient availability, and the input of additional nutrients to these systems increases primary productivity [microscopic organisms including algae]. In moderation in some systems, nutrient enrichment can have beneficial impacts such as increasing fish production; however, more generally the consequences of nutrient enrichment for coastal marine ecosystems are detrimental. Many of these detrimental consequences are associated with eutrophication. The increased productivity from eutrophication increases oxygen consumption in the system and can lead to low-oxygen (hypoxia) or oxygen-free (anoxic) water bodies. This can lead to fish kills as well as more subtle changes in ecological structure and functioning, such as lowered biotic diversity and lowered recruitment of fish populations. Eutrophication can also have deleterious consequences on estuaries even when low-oxygen events do not occur. These changes include loss of biotic diversity, and changes in the ecological structure of both planktonic and benthic communities, some of which may be deleterious to fisheries. Seagrass beds and coral reefs are particularly vulnerable to damage from eutrophication and nutrient over-enrichment. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) harm fish, shellfish, and marine mammals and pose a direct public health threat to humans. The factors that cause HABs remain poorly known, and some events are entirely natural. However, nutrient over-enrichment of coastal waters leads to blooms of some organisms that are both longer in duration and of more frequent occurrence. Although difficult to quantify, the social and economic consequences of nutrient over-enrichment include aesthetic, health, and livelihood impacts  7  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Indicators The 1998 Clean Water Action Plan Unified Watershed Assessment established priorities for watersheds in the State for restoration and protection. In the Plan, the Upper Choptank River watershed was included in one category for priority action: highest priority for restoration.2 As the basis for the prioritization, indicators of water quality, landscape and living resources were developed for all watersheds in Maryland. Other approaches to assessing water quality have been in use for several years and are further described below. In general they do not look comparatively at watersheds as the Unified Assessment did in an effort to set priorities. The Unified Assessment also considered a range of living resource and landscape indicators described a little later. The findings for the water quality indicators are explained in the following text. 1. State 303(d) Impairment Number The Upper Choptank River watershed appeared in the 303(d) list for three impairments, which means that the impairments need to be corrected. For this indicator, presence on the 303(d) list means that the watershed needs restoration. 2. Nontidal Total Phosphorus Index In comparison to the other watersheds that drain to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, the Upper Choptank River watershed was among those with a lower total phosphorus (TP) concentration based on data from ""core"" nontidal stream monitoring stations in the watershed. Watersheds in Maryland that had this data available were ranked on a 1(worst) to 10(best) scale to allow comparison of total phosphorus among them using the Tributary Team reporting methods for status/trends. The Upper Choptank River watershed was ranked ""9"" for TP. To create a benchmark for this indicator, the TP scores for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Upper Choptank River watershed did not exceed this benchmark. 3. Nontidal Total Nitrogen Index In comparison to the other watersheds that drain to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, the Upper Choptank River watershed was among those with a lower total nitrogen (TN) concentration based on data from ""core"" nontidal stream monitoring stations in the watershed. Watersheds in Maryland that had this data available were ranked on a 1(worst) to 10(best) scale to allow comparison of total phosphorus among them using the Tributary Team reporting methods for status/trends. The Upper Choptank River watershed was ranked ""8"" for TN. To create a benchmark for this indicator, the TN scores for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Upper Choptank River watershed did not exceed this benchmark.  8  Sept. 2002   4. Tidal Habitat Index Compared to other Chesapeake Bay watersheds in Maryland, the Upper Choptank River watershed ranked among those having better tidal habitat based on an index combining three measurements of water quality: surface chlorophyll a, secchi depth and summer bottom dissolved oxygen (July-Sept.). Using data collected 1994-1996, the Upper Choptank River watershed ranked ""6.3"" on a scale of 1(worst) to 10(best). To create a benchmark for this indicator, the index scores for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Upper Choptank River watershed did not exceed this benchmark. 5. Tidal Eutrophication Index Compared to other Chesapeake Bay watersheds in Maryland, the Upper Choptank River watershed ranked among those having less eutrophication problems based on an index combining of three measurements of water quality (in surface mixed-layer water): total nitrogen, total phosphorus and total suspended solids. Using data collected 1994-1996, the Upper Choptank River watershed ranked ""5.9"" on a scale of 1(worst) to 10(best). To create a benchmark for this indicator, the index scores for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Upper Choptank River watershed did not exceed this benchmark. 6. Modeled Total Nitrogen Load Compared to other Chesapeake Bay watersheds in Maryland, the Upper Choptank River watershed ranked among those transporting less total nitrogen (TN) to the Chesapeake Bay. The modeled TN load reaching the Chesapeake Bay from the Upper Choptank River was 9.21 lbs/acre. Nitrogen Load is a measure of how much of this important nutrient is reaching streams and other surface waters. For each type of land use in the watershed, on average, stormwater tends to carry or transport a characteristic amount of nitrogen from the land to nearby streams. Based on these averages, computers can be used to estimate (model) how much nitrogen is likely to be reaching Chesapeake Bay.. To create a benchmark for this indicator, the modeled TN loads for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Upper Choptank River watershed did not exceed this benchmark. 7. Modeled Total Phosphorus Load Compared to other Chesapeake Bay watersheds in Maryland, the Upper Choptank River watershed ranked among those transporting excessive loading of total phosphorus (TP) to the Chesapeake Bay. The modeled TP load reaching the Chesapeake Bay from the Upper Choptank 9 Sept. 2002   River was 0.75 lbs/acre. Total Phosphorus is a measure of how much of this important nutrient is reaching streams and other surface waters. The ranking for modeled TP Load was performed in parallel to the ranking for modeled TN Load above. To create a benchmark for this indicator, the modeled TP loads for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark which included theUpper Choptank River watershed.  Tributary Team Characterization As part of the work of the Upper Eastern Shore Tributary Team, Upper Choptank water quality was characterized several parameters at two monitoring sites that are listed below. 1, 9 The status for each parameter in the table is a relative ranking at three levels: good, fair and poor. For example, poor means that the Upper Choptank River ranking is poor compared to similar Chesapeake Bay tributaries with similar salinity. This information is taken from DNR's Internet site www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/tribstrat/index.html which shows the status and trends for various Chesapeake Bay areas. These maps allow qualitative comparison of regional conditions. Summary assessments are shown in tables for Ganey Wharf and Red Bridges.  10  Sept. 2002   Choptank River at Ganey Wharf Parameter Nitrogen: total Phosphorus: total Algae: Abundance Dissolved Oxygen (summer, bottom waters) Water Clarity: secchi depth Suspended Solids: total Status 1997 -99 data Poor Fair Fair Good Poor Poor Trend 1985 through 1999 Degrading Improving (29%) No Trend No Trend No Trend No Trend  Choptank River at Red Bridges (Greensboro) Parameter Nitrogen: total Phosphorus: total Algae: Abundance Dissolved Oxygen (summer, bottom waters) Water Clarity: secchi depth Suspended Solids: total Status 1997 -99 data Fair Fair n/a n/a n/a Good Trend 1985 through 1999 No Trend No Trend n/a n/a n/a No Trend  11  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Assessment In 2001, Talbot County contracted with the University of Maryland Horn Point Laboratory to collect available water quality data for the waters in and around Talbot County and for water bodies in the Choptank River Basin generally. In late 2001, Horn Point Laboratory provided a draft GIS-based product designed to allow visualization of water quality conditions for numerous parameters. The following water quality assessment is drawn from Horn Point Laboratory's work. Map 6 Monitoring Water Quality shows the location of monitoring stations that were used in the Horn Point Laboratory project. As the map indicates, several different programs have recently collected data that contribute to understanding local water quality conditions. Immediately downstream of Tuckahoe Creek in the Choptank River is the most heavily sampled spot in the Upper Choptank River watershed. The Chesapeake Bay Program and most other programs operating in the watershed have sampled in this approximate location. The most wide spread sampling sites for the TMDL program were established relatively recently and will operate for only a few years to meet the needs of that program. In the following discussion, the description of the Creek Watchers program also includes an explanation of the potential benefits for monitoring selected water quality parameters. Additional sections follow that offer a brief interpretation of local water quality conditions based on particular water quality parameters. Additional water quality-related data is available via the Internet. Two recommended Web sites are www.dnr.state.md.us/irc/datasets.html and www.chesapeakebay.net/wquality.htm . To view data for station ET5.2, which is in the Choptank River downstream of the Upper Choptank River watershed, see http://www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/conditions/index.html. 1. Creekwatchers Water Quality Sampling Beginning in 2001, volunteers with the Creekwatcher Program began sampling the Upper Choptank River. The Creekwatcher Program was created as a community partnership between the Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF) and the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum (CBMM). The goal of the Creekwatcher Program is to recruit and mobilize a grassroots volunteer force to monitor the waters of the bay tributaries in Talbot County. The data collected by the volunteers can be used to identify water quality conditions in different locations. Creekwatcher volunteers have monitored six river systems in Talbot County since July 1999 seven water bodies in addition to the Upper Choptank River: Miles River, Wye River, Harris Creek, Broad Creek, Tred Avon River, Island Creek and La Trappe Creek. The following water-quality measures were collected: Acidity (pH)-The pH level is directly related to the health of the fish and plants and in a healthy system, should be between 6.5 and 8.5. The most common causes of variations include stormwater runoff and air deposition of nitric and sulfuric acids discharged by industries, power plants, and automobiles. 12 Sept. 2002   Dissolved oxygen-Dissolved oxygen is essential to all marine life. Readings lower than 5 mg/l indicate insufficient oxygen to support aquatic life. Common causes of low readings include an increase in algae which consumes oxygen as it decomposes and seasonal changes in water salinity levels which can impact dissolved oxygen levels. Temperature-Temperature is important to maintaining healthy marine life. Industrial and municipal discharges and stormwater runoff can impact temperature levels. Temperature levels are dependent upon the season however; healthy levels should be < 30 degrees Celsius. Salinity-Salinity levels are an important water quality parameter and help to define which aquatic resources will live in the area. The salinity ranges change with the season and rainfall however, typical levels for Talbot County waters is around 15 ppt (or 1.5%) which is about half the salinity of the ocean. Turbidity-Turbidity measures the ability of light to pass through the water. Poor water clarity indicated by a low visual turbidity reading indicates that the water is not clear enough for light to penetrate to a depth to support the growth of underwater grasses. Healthy ranges are a visual turbidity reading greater than 3 feet. Conductivity-Conductivity measures the ability of water to conduct electricity. The more saline the water the higher the conductivity. Additionally, metals from discharges and stormwater runoff can impact conductivity readings. Healthy ranges are less than 25 MS/cm. Total Nitrogen (TN)& Total Phosphorus (TP)-Though essential to all bay life, nitrogen and phosphorus, in excessive levels, are the most significant pollutants baywide. Nitrogen and phosphorus are natural fertilizers that stimulate algae blooms. These blooms block sunlight from underwater grasses and, when the algae die, lead to low dissolved oxygen. Moreover, some naturally occurring algae may be toxic or have toxic stages in their life cycles. TN levels should be less than 1 mg/liter and TP levels should be less than 0.1 mg/liter Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV)- Several creeks have been monitored beginning in 2000. These grasses are essential habitat for young crabs and fish. They also help to stabilize shorelines, reduce erosion and reduce wave action that can also damage shorelines. 2. Salinity Salinity in the Upper Choptank River Choptank River Location Bow Knee Point to the Choptank Wetlands Preserve Choptank Wetlands Preserve to Tuckahoe Creek Upstream of Tuckahoe Creek Salinity in parts per thousand (ppt) Highly variable ranging from 0.1 to over 8.0 ppt, i.e. From nearly fresh to slightly brackish (low mesohaline) tends to be in the 0.1 to 3.0 ppt range but periods of salinity slightly higher than 7.0 ppt have been measured. generally less than 1.0 ppt  13  Sept. 2002   3. Dissolved Oxygen The most complete recent dissolved oxygen (DO) data is the Chesapeake Bay monitoring station ET5.2 which is in tidal waters downstream of the Upper Choptank watershed. This downstream station shows that tidal Choptank River waters in warm months generally exhibit low DO below the standard 5.0mg/l. Significantly less complete data for tidal stations on the Choptank River mainstem in the Upper Choptank River suggest that a similar, but less pronounced, pattern may be occurring. While most DO samples are above 5.0 mg/l, several samples collected between May and September fail to meet the standard. Nearly all nontidal monitoring stations report DO concentrations above the 5.0 mg/l standard. However, in Talbot County one station reported one very low DO concentration below 2.0 mg/l in the unnamed tributary at North Dover Road. In Caroline County, the station at Old Town Branch reported on concentration approaching 3 mg/l. 4. Secchi Depth On Map 7 Secchi Depth, average secchi depth measurements along the tidal Choptank River in the Upper Choptank River watershed show that monitoring sites with average secchi depths of at least one meter are interspersed with sites averaging less than one meter secchi depth. These differences may relate primarily to differing local hydrologic conditions. Where ever secchi depths of less than one meter are typical, the poor light penetration would tend to inhibit growth of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). 5. Total Suspended Solids (TSS) Map 8 Total Suspended Solids shows that TSS concentrations tend to higher downstream of Tuckahoe Creek and tend to have the lowest concentrations upstream of Denton. Concentrations of 15 mg/l or greater for total suspended solids (TSS) is believed to generally inhibit growth of SAV because light can not penetrate to the plants' leaves. 6. Chlorophyll A As shown in Map 9 Chlorophyll A, the areas with the higher average chlorophyll a concentrations are generally between Denton and Tuckahoe Creek in the Choptank River. This finding indicates that higher average algae populations tend to be found in these upper reaches of tidal influence. Additional information and maps can be found at the Chesapeake Bay Remote Sensing Program Internet site www.cbrsp.org . This information shows the variability of algae populations in the entire Choptank River.  14  Sept. 2002   Point Sources Discharges from discrete conveyances like pipes are called ""point sources."" Point sources may contribute pollution to surface water or to groundwater. For example, waste water treatment discharges may contribute nutrients or microbes that consume oxygen (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) that reduce oxygen available for aquatic life. Stormwater discharges may contribute excessive flow of water and/or seasonally high temperatures. Industrial point sources may contribute various forms of pollution. Some understanding of point source discharges in a watershed targeted for restoration is useful in helping to prioritize potential restoration projects. According to the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) permit data base as summarized in the summary table below, there are 26 permitted surface water discharges and three permitted groundwater discharges in the Upper Choptank River watershed.

However, nutrients and sediment are a significant issue in the watershed based on two sources:  The 303(d) listing of the watershed for nutrients, sediments, and fecal coliform bacteria is believed to be associated with nonpoint sources.  Long term water quality monitoring data from Ganey Wharf indicates that nitrogen and suspended sediment concentrations are poor and phosphorus concentrations are fair. Upstream of this point in the river, point source loads are probably small compared to nonpoint source loads. Therefore, it is likely that nonpoint sources are the primary cause of degraded water quality at this location.  Long term water quality monitoring data from Red Bridges indicates that nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations are fair. Upstream of this point in the river, point sources are not significant. Consequently, nonpoint sources are the likely reason that water quality is not good at this location.  Modeled phosphorus load in the Water Quality Indicators section in this Watershed Characterization indicates that a combination of factors in the watershed, including land use, would generally lead to excessive phosphors transport. To create an inventory of nonpoint sources for the Upper Choptank River WRAS, Talbot and Caroline Counties are considering urban stormwater and agricultural runoff separately. As part of urban nonpoint sources, rural residential communities are grouped with other types of urban land. In this exercise, the Counties are considering urban nonpoint sources in association with atmospheric deposition, stormwater runoff (managed and unmanaged), on-site disposal systems and illicit discharges.18 For example, it is believed that septic tanks, both failing and properly operating, are contributing nitrogen to the Choptank River. However, an inventory of septic tank locations and condition would need to be generated to planning and project targeting. Also for this exercise, agriculture nonpoint sources are being considered in association with atmospheric deposition, stormwater runoff (managed and unmanaged) and illicit discharges.18  19  Sept. 2002   Shoreline Erosion Wherever land and open water meet, change in the form of erosion or accretion of land is typically the inevitable result of natural processes. Human activity in these areas either tends to inadvertently accentuate these natural processes or purposefully attempts to control movement of water and/or loss of land. Erosion of shorelines can contribute significant amounts of nutrients (mostly phosphorus) and sediment (water column turbidity, habitat loss.) Countywide shoreline erosion is summarized in the following table. 8 Shore Erosion Rate By County (Miles of Shoreline) County Total Shoreline Total Eroding Shoreline Erosion Rate 0-2 feet / year 9 91 2-4 feet / year 1 25 4 and greater feet / year 0 23  Caroline Talbot  66 442  10 (15%) 139 (31%)  The relatively limited shoreline erosion rates listed in the table for Caroline County account for most of the Choptank River shoreline in the Upper Choptank River watershed. These erosion rates are probably also indicative of Talbot County's shoreline in the watershed. The majority of the Talbot County's shoreline, as listed in the table above, is outside of the Upper Choptank River watershed along the Lower Choptank River and the Chesapeake Bay where erosion rates are generally higher. Maps of historic shoreline change were produced in 1999 by the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) in a cooperative effort between DNR and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These maps included digitized shorelines for several years in Talbot and Caroline Counties. The maps also show relatively little change adjacent to smaller water bodies that are typical along the Choptank River in the Upper Choptank River watershed. Copies of these 1:24000 scale maps are available from the MGS.  20  Sept. 2002   Water Supply The Upper Choptank River watershed has only one type of public water supply system. There are at least 24 public community groundwater systems in the watershed that use wells as their water source. These community water supply wells tend to draw from deep aquifers as summarized below. These deep aquifers are relatively distinct from surface water and shallow ground water. They are relatively unaffected by the water quality issues discussed elsewhere in this watershed characterization.

In an effort to gauge the affects of land use on water quality, and to allow comparison between watersheds, DNR has developed a series of Landscape Indicators. These indicators can be used to portray landscape conditions on a watershed scale that tend to support good water quality or that tend to degrade water quality. The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan published in 1998 listed landscape indicators for the Upper Choptank River watershed as summarized in sections that follow. 2 1. Impervious Surface On average across the entire Upper Choptank River watershed, 2.1% of surface cover is impervious. This average imperviousness compares well with similar watersheds in Maryland.2 Roads, parking areas, roofs and other human constructions are collectively called impervious surface. Impervious surface blocks the natural seepage of rain into the ground. Unlike many natural surfaces, impervious surface typically concentrates stormwater runoff, accelerates flow rates and directs stormwater to the nearest stream. Watersheds with small amounts of impervious surface tend to have better water quality in local streams than watersheds with greater amounts of impervious surface. Sideeffects of impervious surfaces become increasingly significant and negative as the percentage of impervious area increases. Examples of related problems include reduction of groundwater infiltration, increased soil and stream bank erosion, sedimentation, destabilization or loss of aquatic habitat, and ""flashy"" stream flows (reduced flow between storms and excessive flows associated with storms.) The Maryland Biological Stream Survey has related the percent of impervious surface in a watershed to the health of aquatic resources. For areas with less than 4% impervious cover, streams generally rate ""Fair"" to ""Good"" for both fish and in-stream invertebrates. Beyond about 12% impervious surface, streams generally rate ""Poor"" to ""Fair"" for both. Reduction of impervious area can be a valuable component of a successful Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). The impervious surface estimate used for this indicator was generated for the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action report. Each land use type in the 1994 Maryland State Planning land use data was assigned an estimated imperviousness taken from the TR-55 manual used by the former Soil Conservation Service. To create a benchmark for comparing impervious area among Maryland watersheds, the percent of impervious area for 8-digit watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Upper Choptank River watershed did not exceed this benchmark.  22  Sept. 2002   2. Population Density The population density in the Upper Choptank River watershed was 0.16 people per acre using pre-2000 Census data. This density compares well with similar Maryland watersheds.2 To create a benchmark for comparing population density among Maryland watersheds, the people per acre for 8-digit watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Upper Choptank River watershed did not exceed this benchmark. While population density may be beyond the scope of a WRAS, directing growth is a potential WRAS component. As human population increases, effects of human activity that tend to degrade, displace or eliminate natural habitat also tends to increase. Watersheds with higher populations, assuming other factors are equal, tend to exhibit greater impacts on waterways and habitat. However, growth can be directed in ways to reduce negative impacts. 3. Historical Wetland Loss The historical loss of wetlands in the Upper Choptank River watershed is estimated to be 48,169 acres which is a relatively large loss of wetlands compared with other similar Maryland watersheds.2 This interpretation is based on the assumption that the hydric soils in the watershed were all, at one time, wetlands. Thoughtful selective restoration of historic wetland areas can be an effective WRAS component. In most of Maryland's watersheds, extensive wetland areas have been converted to other uses by draining and filling. This conversion unavoidably reduces or eliminates the natural functions that wetlands provide. To create a benchmark for comparing impervious area among Maryland watersheds, the historic wetland loss acreage for 8-digit watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Upper Choptank River watershed exceeded the benchmark because it is in the highest quartile. 4. Unbuffered Streams Approximately 49% of streams in the Upper Choptank River watershed were not buffered with trees based on 1998 information. This finding compares well with other similar Maryland watersheds.2 DNR recommends that forested buffer 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream, is typically necessary to promote high quality aquatic habitat and diverse aquatic populations. Replacement of natural vegetation adjacent to streams can be a valuable and relatively inexpensive WRAS element. In most of Maryland, trees are key to healthy natural streams. They provide numerous essential habitat functions: shade to keep water temperatures down in warm months, leaf litter ""food"" for aquatic organisms, roots to stabilize stream banks, vegetative cover for wildlife, etc. In general, reduction or loss of riparian trees / stream buffers degrades stream habitat while replacement of trees / natural buffers enhances stream habitat. (For this indicator only ""blue line streams"" were included. Intermittent streams were not considered.) 23 Sept. 2002   This estimate of streams lacking forested buffer was generated for the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan by using Maryland Department of State Planning GIS data for streams and for 1994 land use. To create a benchmark for comparing impervious area among Maryland watersheds, the percent of unbuffered streams for 8-digit watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Upper Choptank River watershed did not exceed the benchmark. 5. Soil Erodibility The average soil erodibilty of lands within 1000 feet of streams in the Upper Choptank River watershed is 0.28 value/acre which suggests that control of soil erosion is particularly important here.2 Watersheds with more highly erodible soils are naturally more susceptible to surface erosion, sedimentation, streambank erosion and other problems related to soil movement. These negative effects of soil erodibility on water quality can be minimized through careful management. The soil erodibility indicator accounts for natural soil conditions but not for management of the land. (Existing crop land management was not considered.) The naturally erodible soils in the watershed are addressed by techniques called Best Management Practices (BMPs) to prevent soil loss that are typically in use on local farms. BMPs like no-till, reduced till, cover crops, field strips, and others significantly reduce erosion and sediment movement. These BMPs can be seen in use in many places in the watershed. A WRAS can reasonably promote a reduction in disturbance of erodible soils and/or effective soil conservation practices like planting stream buffers. This estimate of soil erodibility was generated through an analysis of GIS data that incorporated the soil erodibility factor (K), slope steepness, land area within 1000 feet of streams and cropland within that 1000 feet buffer based on 1994 Maryland Department of State Planning land use data. To compare Maryland watersheds for this index, the benchmark of 0.275 value/acre was used, i.e. less than 0.275 was considered relatively beneficial for water quality and 0.275 or greater was considered to be a likely factor for water quality problems.  24  Sept. 2002   2000 Land Use / Land Cover The following table and pie chart 2000 Land Use summarize 2000 land use for the Upper Choptank Watershed in Maryland. Upper Choptank River Watershed Based on this information, the watershed Urban (8.27%) was dominated by agriculture (59%) and Wetlands (3.04%) Other (0.25%) forest (29%). The remaining approximately 12% of the land in the watershed was mostly developed lands Forest (29.29%) with small amounts of tidal and emergent Agriculture (59.16%) wetlands and other land uses. Viewing these land uses as potential nonpoint sources of nutrients, agricultural lands are likely to dominate loads to local waterways. Map 11 Generalized Land Use 2000 shows the distribution of these land categories in the watershed. 2000 Land Use Upper Choptank Watershed Category Agriculture Forest Developed Lands Wetlands Other Description Field, Pasture, Ag buildings All woodlands and brush Residential, commercial, etc. Tidal marsh, Emergent wetlands Extractive and bare ground (not graphed) Acres 93,886 46,485 13,124 4,818 395 158,708 163,449  Watershed Total for Land Use (excl. open water) Watershed Total including open water  25  Sept. 2002   Green Infrastructure An additional way to interpret land use / land cover information is to identify ""Green Infrastructure."" In the GIS application developed by Maryland DNR and its partners, Green Infrastructure refers to areas of natural vegetation and habitat that have statewide or regional importance as defined by criteria developed by DNR. The criteria for identifying of lands as Green Infrastructure is limited to considering natural resource attributes currently found on those lands. One example of the criteria is that interior forest and wetlands complexes at least 250 acres in size are considered as part of Green Infrastructure. As a second example, sensitive species habitat that is located within areas of natural vegetation at least 100 acres in size is also counted as Green Infrastructure. Other potential attributes of Green Infrastructure lands, such as ownership or if the current natural conditions are protected in some way, are not criteria for Green Infrastructure but they may be considered independently. Within the Green Infrastructure network, large blocks of natural areas are called hubs, and the existing or potential connections between them, called links or corridors. Together the hubs and corridors form the Green Infrastructure network which can be considered the backbone of the region's natural environment. Protection of Green Infrastructure lands may be addressed through various existing programs including Rural Legacy, Program Open Space, conservation easements and others. The 2001 Maryland General Assembly approved $35 million for the Green Print program which is targeted primarily to protecting Green Infrastructure areas. This funding category is administered by Program Open Space. Map 12 Green Infrastructure shows several significant local characteristics of Green Infrastructure:  A significant number of Green Infrastructure hubs are found in the Upper Choptank River watershed. Many, but not all of these hubs are along the Choptank River and its tributaries. Also, many of these areas of natural vegetation have some association with wetlands and/or wet soils.  Many corridors selected by the computer analysis have significant amounts of agricultural land shown within the potential corridor. In general, viability of these corridors for protection or restoration requires local on-the-ground assessment to provide additional information regarding site conditions, land owner preferences and potential viability of projects.  26  Sept. 2002   Protected Lands As used in the context of watershed restoration, ""protected land"" includes any land with some form of long term limitation on conversion to urban / developed land use. This protection may be in various forms: public ownership for natural resource or recreational intent, private ownership where a third party acquired the development rights or otherwise acquired the right to limit use through the purchase of an easement, etc. The extent of ""protection"" varies greatly from one circumstance to the next. Therefore, for some protected land, it may be necessary to explore the details of land protection parcel by parcel through the local land records office to determine the true extent of protection. For purposes of watershed restoration, a knowledge of existing protected lands can provide a starting point in prioritizing potential restoration activities. In some cases, protected lands may provide opportunities for restoration projects because owners of these lands may value natural resource protection or enhancement goals. Map 13 Protected Land and Smart Growth shows the locations of protected lands in the Upper Choptank River watershed. Based on the information summarized in the table, Protected Land Summary By County, several overall findings can be made:  Protection of agricultural land is the most active form of land conservation in the watershed. In total, agricultural easements encompass about 9,600 acres covering 6% of the watershed. Agricultural Districts encompass an additional 10,400 acres beyond the acreage under easements. This is an additional 6.5% of the watershed.  Conservation easements cover about 4,200 acres (2.6% of the watershed) including about 2,400 in Talbot County and over 1,800 acres in Caroline County. These figures include easements held by private organizations and by the Maryland Environmental Trust.  Government owned land in the Upper Choptank watershed amounts to less than half of one percent of the watershed. No federal land is identified there. Caroline County has about 178 acres of park land in the watershed. DNR land in the watershed encompasses 460 acres including about 300 acres recently acquired from Chesapeake Forest, Inc. Other DNR land in the watershed includes a small portion of Seth Forest in Talbot County and Marinak State Park in Caroline County. In drafting the WRAS for the Upper Choptank Watershed in Talbot and Caroline Counties, existing protected lands could be assessed for their potential role in watershed management:  Public land could be assessed for potential implementation and/or demonstration project sites.  Land owner interests could be surveyed regarding opportunities for management enhancement like agricultural best management practices.  Opportunities for expanding protection from currently protected land to adjacent parcels  27  Sept. 2002   Protected Land Summary By County Upper Choptank River Watershed In Maryland* Area Category Talbot Acres Agricultural Easement Agricultural District** Conservation Easement: MET *** Conservation Easement: Private County Parks DNR Land Total Protected Land In County/Watershed Total County Land In Watershed 1,038 2,807 2,162 235 0 12 6,254 36,575 % 3 8 6 0.6 --17 100 Caroline Acres 8,526 7,636 1,186 641 178 448 18,615 120,982 % 7 6 1 0.5 0.1 0.4 15 100 Queen Annes Acres 84 0 0 0 0 0 84 1,937 % 4 -----4 100  * Data in the table is from late 2000 or earlier depending on the category. ** Agricultural Districts provide various advantages to farmers but do not inhibit land owner decisions to change farm land to nonagricultural land uses in the long term. *** MET - Maryland Environmental Trust  28  Sept. 2002   Smart Growth Within Maryland's Smart Growth program, there are two targeting programs that should be considered as potential watershed restoration projects are considered. In Rural Legacy Areas, protection of land from future development through purchase of easements (or in fee simple) is promoted. In Priority Funding Areas, State funding for infrastructure may be available to support development and redevelopment. Both are shown in Map 13 Protected Land and Smart Growth: - Rural Legacy Area in the Upper Choptank watershed is concentrated near Tuckahoe Creek. A little over 5400 acres of the Tuckahoe Rural Legacy area are in the WRAS watershed. State funding for the Tuckahoe Rural Legacy area was appropriated in State fiscal years 1999 and 2000. - Priority Funding Areas in Caroline County, they are associated with several small communities. Collectively, these areas include nearly 4,100 acres covering a little over 11% of the Upper Choptank watershed in Talbot County. - Priority Funding Areas in Talbot County are concentrated around Easton and the Route 50 corridor. All together these areas total nearly 3,900 acres covering slightly more than 3% of the Upper Choptank watershed in Caroline County.  29  Sept. 2002   Soils 1. Interpreting Local Conditions with Natural Soil Groups Soil conditions, like soil type and moisture conditions, greatly affect how land may be used and the potential for vegetation and habitat on the land. Soil conditions are one determining factor for water quality in streams and rivers. Local soil conditions vary greatly from site to site as published information in the Soil Surveys for Talbot and Caroline Counties show. This complicated information Natural Soil Groups can be effectively summarized using Natural Soil Upper Choptank River Watershed Groups to help identify useful generalizations about groups of soils. In Map 14 Soils and the pie chart, prime farmland is depicted in yellow or yellow with (26.32%) crosshatching. About 56% of the Upper Choptank Watershed in Maryland is prime (48.58%) farmland based on the list below: (8.21%)  48.6% 7.4% 9.5% 8.2% 26.3%  - Best prime agriculture soil (B1) Other prime agriculture soil Excessively well drained soil Wet soils in flood zones - Wet soils in uplands  (9.45%) (7.43%)  2. Soils and Watershed Planning Local soil conditions can be a useful element in watershed planning and for targeting restoration projects. Soils with limitations related to wetness or slope naturally inhibit active use for farming or development. Land owners in the watershed have tended to leave many of these areas in natural vegetation or other low intensity use. By comparing Map 14 Soils with Map 11 1997 General Land Use and Map 12 Green Infrastructure several tendencies can be seen. Green Infrastructure and forest in general tends to coincide with soils that are either hydric & poorly drained or with soils that are excessively well drained. Additionally, development, which often relies on septic systems, tends to be concentrated on excessively well drained soils and to avoid hydric soils. Considering the existing tendencies among landowners suggested above, Natural Soils Groups or similar soils assessment techniques can be used to help identify potential areas for restoration projects or habitat protection. Once areas of interest are targeted and land owner interest is verified, additional detailed soil assessment is an essential step in identifying viable restoration project sites.  30  Sept. 2002   Wetlands 1. Introduction to Wetland Categories The Eastern Coastal Plain Province likely has the highest diversity of emergent estuarine and palustrine wetland communities relative to other Maryland physiographic regions because both tidal and nontidal freshwater marshes occur here. Wetlands are most abundant in the Coastal Plain due to the low topographic relief and high groundwater table characteristic of the region. Estuarine Wetlands. Estuarine wetlands are abundant throughout the Coastal Plain. These systems consist of salt and brackish tidal waters and contiguous wetlands where ocean water is at least occasionally diluted by freshwater runoff from the land. These wetlands may extend far upstream in tidal rivers to freshwater areas. Differences in salinity and tidal flooding within estuaries have a significant effect on the distribution of these wetland systems. Salt marshes occur on the intertidal shores of tidal waters in areas of high salinity. Brackish marshes are the predominant estuarine wetland type in Maryland. They are found along the shores of Chesapeake Bay, mostly on the Eastern Shore, and for considerable distance upstream in coastal rivers. Estuarine shrub swamps are common along the Maryland coastal zone. Aquatic beds, comprised mostly of submerged aquatic vegetation, are abundant in shallow water zones of Maryland's estuaries, especially Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Palustrine wetlands. Forested wetlands are the most abundant and widely distributed palustrine wetland type on the Coastal Plain. These wetlands are found on floodplains along the freshwater tidal and nontidal portions of rivers and streams, in upland depressions, and in broad flat areas between otherwise distinct watersheds. Tidal freshwater swamps occur along coastal rivers in areas subject to tidal influence. Scrub-shrub swamps are not abundant on the Eastern Shore but are represented in the Upper Choptank River watershed. Emergent wetlands on the Coastal Plain are characterized by a wide range of vegetation, depending on water regime. (Adapted from Wetlands of Maryland, Tiner and Burke, 1995.)  31  Sept. 2002   2. Tracking Wetlands Oversight of activities affecting wetlands involves several regulatory jurisdictions. The Maryland Dept. of the Environment (MDE) is the lead agency for the State and cooperates with DNR, the Army Corps of Engineers and other Federal and local agencies. As part of its responsibility, MDE tracks State permitting and the net gain or loss of wetlands over time. As the Wetlands Regulatory Status table shows, changes tracked in the State regulatory program show that a net increase of wetland acreage of nearly 11 acres has occurred in the Upper Choptank River watershed over the past 10 years.

Comprehensive tracking of voluntary wetland gains began in 1998.  32  Sept. 2002   3. Interpreting Wetland Distribution Wetlands in most of the Upper Choptank River watershed tend to occur along waterways as shown in the maps listed below. However, the map also shows that wetland in the northern end of the watershed tend to be more defuse and they are less likely to associated with waterways. - Map 15A Wetlands - South - Map 15B Wetlands - Central - Map 15C Wetlands - North In comparing the wetlands map to Map 11 1997 Generalized Land Use, it can be seen that much of the forested land in the watershed is found in association with wetlands or adjacent to them. Additionally, comparing National Wetlands Inventory Acreage Summary the maps shows that many Upper Choptank River Watershed of the nontidal wetland Wetland Class Acres areas on the wetland maps Estuarine, Subtidal (E1) unconsolidated 3 are depicted as forest on bottom the land use map.

See the Sensitive Species Section for discussion. In the context of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS), wetlands serve valuable water quality and habitat functions that may not be provided by other land uses. Therefore, protection and enhancement of existing wetlands, and restoration of past wetland areas, can be a valuable element in the WRAS. (Also see the Wetland Restoration section.)  33  Sept. 2002   Floodplains Map 16 Floodplain and Sea Level Rise shows that the 100-year floodplain extends far up tributaries to the Choptank River. The extent of potential flood areas in the Upper Choptank River watershed has significant implications for land use decisions and watershed management including potential restoration projects. In recent years, stormwater management requirements have provided a means to limit impacts of new development and impervious area that would otherwise contribute to stream degradation and flooding. However, these new projects may not significantly improve water quality or quantity that are driven by systemic watershed factors. For existing development and impervious area, retrofitting controls to enhance water quality and limit peaks in stormwater runoff may offer an additional way to protect waterways. However, consideration of retrofits must take into account at least two local issues: - Land owner interests and preferences. - Management directions already established by Public Drainage Associations (PDAs)  Low Elevation Areas Subject to Sea Level Rise Most areas of the Upper Choptank River watershed have sufficient elevation to be unaffected by any potential for sea level rise in the next 50 to 100 years. However, marshes and other low-lying wetlands are at risk for inundation. The potential for sea level rise impacts need to be considered as part of any comprehensive watershed management effort. For example, the identification and prioritization of potential WRAS projects will take into account the risk of inundation during the life of the project. As a gauge of potential sea level rise risk, a Maryland-wide assessment of land with an elevation of 1.5 meters or less was first published in 1998 and then repackaged in a 2000 State report.9 At this statewide scale, the general area at risk to inundation from sea level rise is limited to marsh/wetland areas along the Choptank River. As shown in Map 16 Floodplain and Sea Level Rise, the area of concern in the Upper Chotank River watershed extends from Bow Knee Point to Barker Creek just upstream of the Choptank Wetlands Preserve. A significant portion of the Choptank Wetlands Preserve is at risk for inundation.  34  Sept. 2002   LIVING RESOURCES AND HABITAT  Overview Living resources, including all the animals, plants and other organisms that call the land and waters of the Upper Choptank River watershed home, are being affected by human activity. The information summarized here suggests that some of the significant stresses on living resources in the watershed are manipulation of habitat, excessive movement of sediment and excessive availability of nutrients. The Living Resource information summarized here should be considered a partial representation because numerous areas of potential interest or concern could not be included due to lack of information, time, etc. For example, information on many forms of aquatic life, woodland communities, terrestrial habitats, etc. should be considered as watershed restoration decisions are being made. Therefore, it is recommended that stakeholders in the watershed identify important living resource issues or priorities so that additional effort can be focused where it is most needed. New information should be added or referenced as it becomes available.  Living Resource Indicators Aquatic organisms are sensitive, in varying degrees, to changes in water quality and aquatic habitat. This association offers two perspectives that are important for watershed restoration. First, improvements for living resources offer potential goals, objectives and opportunities to gauge progress in watershed restoration. Second, the status of selected species can be used as to gauge local conditions for water quality, habitat, etc. This second perspective is the basis for using living resources as an ""indicator."" The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan published in 1998 listed the following living resource indicators for the Upper Choptank River Watershed.2 Several of these indices rely on index rankings generated from a limited number of sampling sites which were then generalized to represent entire watersheds. Considering this limitation on field data, it may be beneficial to conduct additional assessments to provide a more complete understanding of local conditions as part of the WRAS: 1. SAV Abundance Index For tidal areas of the Upper Choptank River watershed, the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) scored ""1.5"" for the Abundance Index which means that SAV covered about15% of the potential SAV habitat. This index is designed to allow comparison of watersheds based on actual SAV acreage versus potential SAV acreage. To generate the score for this index, two measurements of SAV area were estimated: 1) area covered by SAV in the year 1996 was measured using aerial survey data, and 2) the potential SAV area was measured based on water depth (up to two meters deep), physical characteristics and historic occurrence of SAV. 35 Sept. 2002   The benchmark used for the SAV Abundance Index was 10%. If less than 10% of the potential SAV area in a watershed was covered by SAV in 1996, then the watershed was listed in the category ""needs improvement"". If more than 10% of the potential SAV area in a watershed was covered by SAV in 1996, then the watershed was listed in the category ""needs preventative action"" to protect or enhance SAV abundance. No watershed in the State scored higher than 2, reflecting a maximum observed coverage of 20%. 2. SAV Habitat Requirements Index For tidal areas of the Upper Choptank River watershed, the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) scored ""5.0"" for the Habitat Requirement Index which means that SAV habitat requirements were not met based on 1994-1996 data. This index is designed to allow comparison of watersheds based on several measurements of habitat conditions: secchi depth, dissolved inorganic nitrogen where applicable, dissolved inorganic phosphorus, Chlorophyll a and total suspended solids. The benchmark used for the SAV Habitat Requirements Index was 7. A score of 7 or higher means that 1994 through 1996 data showed that habitat conditions for SAV in a watershed were sufficient and the watershed was listed in the category for ""restoration needed"". A score less than 7 means that the watershed's habitat conditions were not favorable for SAV and the watershed was listed in the category for ""needs preventative action"". 3. Nontidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity Streams in the Upper Choptank River watershed are generally in poor condition on average based on assessment of benthic macroinvertebrate communities (stream bugs). For this index, Liberty Reservoir streams scored an average of 4.9 on a scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best). For this index, an average score for an 8-digit watershed less than 6.0 means that restoration is needed and a score of 8.0 or greater means that protection is recommended. To generate this index, each stream site that is assessed is compared to reference conditions that were established for comparable streams that are minimally impacted. Nontidal rivers (streams seventh order and larger) are not incorporated into this index. Also see Why Look at Benthos in Streams? 4. Nontidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity Based on assessment of fish communities, streams in the Upper Choptank River watershed scored 6.5 on a scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best) indicating a generally fair/good condition on average. For this index, an average score for an 8-digit watershed less than 6.0 means that restoration is needed and a score of 8.0 or greater means that protection is recommended. In each stream site where fish are surveyed, the makeup of the overall fish population is measured in nine distinct ways such as the number of native species, number of benthic fish species, percent of individuals that are ""tolerant"" species, etc. These nine scores are then integrated to generate an index ranking for the survey site. To generate the index for the watershed, the scores for all the stream sites assessed within the 8-digit watershed are averaged together.  36  Sept. 2002   5. Nontidal In-Stream Habitat Index Based on habitat conditions in nontidal streams in the Upper Choptank River watershed, conditions are generally fair on average. In this index, Upper Choptank River streams scored an average of 4.9 on a scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best). This index allows comparison of streams based on habitat for fish and benthic organisms as measured by in-stream and riparian conditions. For each stream site that was assessed, visual field observations are used to score the site for substrate type, habitat features, bank conditions, riparian vegetation width, remoteness, aesthetic value, etc. For each site, the individual scores are integrated to generate a single score for each stream site. The index score reported for each stream site is a relative score to the maximum attainable score for comparable streams. The watershed index is created by averaging the scores for all the sites that were assessed in the watershed.  37  Sept. 2002   Fish 1. Striped Bass Spawning and Nursery The Upper Choptank River is one of the most important spawning and nursery areas for striped bass (rock fish) in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. In terms of size and productivity, the Upper Choptank ranks third (behind 1. Upper Chesapeake Bay and 2. Potomac River). Within the Upper Choptank River, the area most used by striped bass for spawning and nursery extends from near Denton to approximately Bow Knee Point.17 2. Juvenile Fish Survey DNR Fisheries Service conducts numerous surveys to gauge the condition of fisheries and some of the sampling sites have been located in the Upper Choptank River. The Bay-wide Estuarine Juvenile Finfish Survey samples 22 sites each year including one in the Upper Choptank River near Denton and three other sites downstream in the Choptank River. Additionally the annual Blue Crab Survey includes five stations in the Choptank River. As shown in the graph below taken from the DNR Fisheries Service Internet site, 2001 was an excellent recruitment year for young-of-year (YOY) striped bass in the Choptank River. Additionally, 2001 in the Choptank River was an excellent year for young-of-year atlantic menhaden, a good year for white perch and yellow perch and poor year for some species. For additional information see http://www.dnr.state.md.us/fisheries/juvindex/index.html .  YOY Striped Bass 1957-2001 Choptank R.

Tidal Largemouth Bass Studies 1998-200110 The Eastern Regional Staff of Freshwater Fisheries has sampled the Upper Choptank for largemouth bass abundance since the 1980's. In 1999, the survey techniques were changed to increase overall precision, and to better address the correlation between largemouth bass abundance and habitat quality. Roughly forty 250m stations representing prime, average and marginal habitats were sampled each year using an electofishing boat to collect data on largemouth bass and other recreationally important species. The results of these data were encouraging; the bass population in the Upper Choptank appears to be stable or slowly increasing over the three-year study period. Catchper-unit effort (CPUE) for all bass collected per 100m increased over time from 1.52 in 1999, 1.69 in 2000 to 2.25 in 2001. Similarly, CPUE of young-of-year bass has increased as well from 1999-2001. Overall, when compared to other fisheries, the Upper Choptank River supports an excellent fishery for tidal largemouth bass. It is described by consistent reproduction and a balanced age and size structure of bass in optimal physical condition. Bass abundance was highest in areas of prime habitat characterized by areas with an abundance of structure, adjacent deep water and tidal current breaks. Continued growth of SAV beds in the river will undoubtedly enhance the fishery by creating additional prime habitat.

Commercial Fisheries Commercial fisheries harvest information for the Choptank River is tracked by DNR Fisheries Service. While this information aggregates Upper Choptank River information into the Choptank River-wide information, it provides some indication of local conditions. Also see http://mddnr.chesapeakebay.net/mdcomfish/mdcomfishery.html .  Blue Crabs: For the entire Choptank River, the annual commercial harvest ranged from 6 million pounds in 1994 to 3,346,000 pounds in 1999. The harvest decline during this period appears to be consistent with a similar trend throughout the Chesapeake Bay.  Oysters: There are no current or historic oyster bars in Upper Choptank River watershed. Additionally, there are no oyster lease areas in the vicinity. The closest oyster bars are about three miles downstream of Bow Knee Point near the mouth of the Warwick River, Dorchester County.13  Striped Bass: The commercial harvest data for the entire Choptank River extends all the way back to 1929. Over the 70-year period from 1929 to 1999, the annual striped bass harvest in the Choptank River occasionally exceeded 200,000 pounds prior to 1976. Since that time, the annual harvest has been significantly smaller. 1998 was the highest harvest year during the 1990s yielding around 135,000 pounds. 5. Recreational Fish Stock Assessment 11 During 2000, DNR Fisheries Service conducted an extensive effort across the Chesapeake Bay to assess the status of selected fish species that are important for recreational activities. Part of this effort involved sampling of Upper Choptank River fish in the vicinity of the Tuckahoe Creek confluence using experimental fyke nets at five locations. The report on this work, released in 2001, included several findings that may be relevant to the Upper Choptank River WRAS:11  Channel Catfish recruitment in the Choptank River may have improved recently. A higher percentage of 2 to 5 year years amoung the population was found in 1999 and the absolute numbers of channel catfish between 200 mm and 310 mm length increased substantially in 1999 and 2000. From 1993 to 1998 the most frequently found length among channel catfish was consistently increasing. However, 1999 and 2000 surveys suggest that this trend may be reversing.  White Catfish populations in the Choptank River may be expanding based on trends toward increasing length and increasing pre-recruit abundance. Their numbers counted during 2000 were greater than any year since 1993. The fyke net catches in the Choptank River were nine times the level in 1998.  White Perch populations appear to be stable (based on relatively constant length frequencies).  Yellow Perch netted in the 2000 survey indicated continuing strong recruitment in the Choptank River in recent years. The 1996 year-class accounted for 60% of the yellow perch population.  40  Sept. 2002   6. Fish Consumption Advisory In late 2001, MDE issued revised fish consumption advisories. The advisory recommended limiting consumption of channel catfish and white perch caught in the mainstem of the Choptank River due to PCB and/or pesticide contamination. The complete advisory list is available at www.mde.state.md.us/fish_tissue/index.html . MDE cited changes in the EPA's recommended daily consumption estimates, new sampling data and improved analytical techniques, which led to the revised advisory to limit consumption of 13 species of fish recreationally caught in 14 Maryland waterways. While contaminant levels have not changed, the consumption advisories are especially important for children and women of child-bearing age who are or may become pregnant or are nursing. Two sampling stations for this effort were located in the Upper Choptank River watershed as shown in Map 6 Monitoring Water Quality: near the mouth of Hog Creek and at Red Bridges near the Sewell Mills USGS gauging station. Seven additional sampling stations were located elsewhere in the Choptank River Basin  41  Sept. 2002   Maryland Biological Stream Survey  15, 16  Brief summaries of the findings by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) for sampling years from 1994 through 2000 are presented here. More complete information on MBSS findings for each sampling site is available at http://mddnr.chesapeakebay.net/mbss/search.cfm . Findings in the benthic and fish indexes may be used in identifying potential areas for stream protection or restoration. Sampling of streams in the Upper Choptank wateshed by MBSS will likely be scheduled again in 2005 at the earliest. However, sampling by citizen volunteers in the MBSS Stream Waders program could occur sooner if sufficient interest arises. 1. Benthos in Nontidal Streams Assessment of benthos or benthic macroinvertebrates is an valuable way to interpret stream conditions based on organisms living in the stream. The text box Why Look At Benthos In Streams explains the importance of benthos in streams. Assessment of benthic macroinvertebrates or benthos in the Upper Choptank River watershed for the period 1994 through 2000 is presented in Map 17 Benthic Index:     Good: 14% All but one are downstream of Denton. Fair: 22% Scattered throughout the watershed but mostly downstream of Denton. Poor: 36% Scattered throughout the watershed. Very Poor: 28% These sites are scattered but most tend to be upstream of Denton.  The surveys reported in the map were conducted by the Maryland Biologcial Stream Survey (MBSS), a program in DNR. Each symbol on the map characterizes a stream segment (about 100 feet) based on the benthic population and habitat conditions. An index of ""good"" means that the stream segment that was sampled has a benthic population and habitat conditions that are close to those found in a comparable ""reference"" stream. Reference streams are found to have the most natural, least impacted stream conditions found in the area for a particular type of stream. Other index findings varying from fair to poor to very poorly deviate further and further from reference stream conditions. 2. Fish in Nontidal Streams In Map 18 Fish Index, an assessment of fish populations and habitat conditions in the Upper Choptank River watershed for the period 1994 through 2000 are presented:     Good: 26% Fair: 48% Poor: 26% Very Poor: one site  42  Sept. 2002   Why Look at Benthos in Streams? Benthos are sometimes called ""stream bugs"" though that name overly simplifies the diverse membership of this group. Unimpaired natural streams may support a great diversity of species ranging from bacteria and algae to invertebrates like crayfish and insects to fish, reptiles and mammals. Benthic macro-invertebrates, collectively called benthos, are an important component of a stream's ecosystem. This group includes mayflies, caddisflies, crayfish, etc. that inhabit the stream bottom, its sediments, organic debris and live on plant life (macrophytes) within the stream. The food web in streams relies significantly on benthos. Benthos are often the most abundant source of food for fish and other small animals. Many benthic macroinvertebrates live on decomposing leaves and other organic materials in the stream. By this activity, these organisms are significant processors of organic materials in the stream. Benthos often provide the primary means that nutrients from organic debris are transformed to other biologically usable forms. These nutrients become available again and are transported downstream where other organisms use them. Benthos are a valuable tool for stream evaluation. This group of species has been extensively evaluated for use in water quality assessment, in evaluating biological conditions of streams and in gauging influences on streams by surrounding lands. Benthos serve as good indicators of water resource integrity because they are fairly sedentary in nature and their diversity offers numerous ways to interpret conditions. They have different sensitivities to changing conditions. They have a wide range of functions in the stream. They use different life cycle strategies for survival.  43  Sept. 2002   Sensitive Species Sensitive species are most widely known in the form of Federally-listed Endangered or Threatened animals such as the bald eagle. In addition to these charismatic rare animals, both US EPA and Maryland DNR work through their respective Federal and State programs to protect numerous endangered, threatened, or rare species of plants and animals and the habitats that support those species. For the purposes of watershed restoration, it is valuable to account for known locations of habitat for these species. These places are often indicators, and sometimes important constituents, of the network of natural areas or ""green infrastructure"" that are the foundation for many essential natural watershed processes. Protecting these species and/or promoting expansion of their habitats can be an effective foundation for a watershed restoration program. DNR's Wildlife and Heritage Division uses three designations for areas providing habitat for sensitive species. These designations are described in the text box Maryland's Sensitive Species Protection Areas. As shown in Map 19 Sensitive Species, two of the three sensitive species designations are found in the Upper Choptank watershed. The purpose of these designations is to help protect sensitive species and their habitat through the review of applications for State permits or approvals, and review of projects that involve State funds. For the types of projects potentially described above, DNR makes recommendations and/or requirements to protect sensitive species and their habitat. These categories do not place requirements on any activities that do not require a permit/approval or do not involve State funds. However, there are State and Federal restrictions that address ""takings"" of protected species that apply more broadly. In addition, many counties have incorporated safeguards for these areas into their project and permit review processes. In all instances, property owners are encouraged to seek advice on protecting the sensitive species / habitat within their ownership. More details and guidance can be requested from DNR Natural Heritage Division staff.  44  Sept. 2002   Sensitive Species Protection Areas in the Upper Choptank River Watershed  Sensitive Species Project Review Area (SSPRA) At least 18 SSPRAs are identified in the Upper Choptank River watershed. Each SSPRA contains one or more sensitive species habitats. However, the entire SSPRA is not considered sensitive habitat. The SSPRA is an envelope identified for review purposes to help ensure that applications for permit or approval in or near sensitive areas receive adequate attention and safeguards for the sensitive species / habitat they contain. Also see Map 19 Sensitive Species.  Natural Heritage Area (NHA) No NHAs are located in the Upper Choptank River watershed. NHAs are rare ecological communities that encompass sensitive species habitat. They are designated in State regulation COMAR 08.03.08.10. For any proposed project that requires a State permit or approval that may affect an NHA, recommendations and/or requirements are placed in the permit or approval that are specifically aimed at protecting the NHA. To help ensure that proposed projects that may affect an NHA are adequately reviewed, an SSPRA is always designated to encompass each NHA and the area surrounding it.  Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) Numerous small WSSCs are designated in the Upper Choptank River watershed. At least of these areas are visible on Map 19 Sensitive Species but most are not visible. These wetlands are associated with one or more sensitive species habitats that are in or near the wetland. For any proposed project that requires a wetland permit, these selected wetlands have additional regulatory requirements beyond the permitting requirements that apply to wetlands generally. To help ensure that proposed projects that may affect a WSSC are adequately reviewed, an SSPRA is always designated to encompass each WSSC and the area surrounding it. For a listing of designated sites see COMAR 26.23.06.01 at www.dsd.state.md.us  45  Sept. 2002   Submerged Aquatic Vegetation SAV beds in the Upper Choptank River watershed are small and limited to narrow areas along the shoreline. This is, in part, due to the depth of the river channel which limits the area of potential physical habitat in the Upper Choptank River.12 These areas are too small to be identified in the remote sensing data that is publicly available via DNR's MERLIN Internet mapping tool which shows data for each year from 1984 through 1999. (Also see www.vims.edu/bio/sav/ for extensive information or www.mdmerlin.net for annual distribution maps 1984 through 1996). Interest in restoring SAV in the Choptank River is currently on the rise. A ""Grasses for the Masses"" workshop for the Choptank River was held February 2002. The workshop by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF) and Horn Point Laboratory encouraged local people to grow SAV at home for transplantation to the Choptank River in spring 2002. In general, transplantation sites were in the Lower Choptank River.  46  Sept. 2002   RESTORATION TARGETING TOOLS 2002 Stream Corridor Assessment Using the Stream Corridor Assessment Methodology (SCAM) developed and applied by the DNR Watershed Restoration Division, valuable information can be compiled to assist in targeting restoration activities. DNR has proposed a partnership with Talbot and Caroline Counties to conduct a Stream Corridor Assessment in the Upper Choptank River watershed. Using this approach, trained teams from the Maryland Conservation Corps would walk along streams and other significant waterways to identify and document potential problems and restoration opportunities such as the items listed below: DNR will provide a report of findings for County use. Stream Corridor Assessment Data Collection Categories Pipe Outfalls Pond Sites Tree Blockages Inadequate Buffers Erosion Fish Blockages Exposed Pipe Unusual Conditions Trash Dumping In or Near Stream Construction  2002 Synopic Survey and Benthic Community Assessment Working from 2002 sampling in the Upper Choptank River watershed, DNR staff will report on water quality in nontidal streams to supplement knowledge of local conditions. Based on parameters listed below, the survey findings will help identify problem areas and relative conditions among local streams. It will also help rank subwatersheds by their nutrient load contributions to tidal areas of the Upper Choptank River. For the same 2002 sampling sites, DNR staff will also report on benthic organism populations in nontidal streams as a gauge of water quality and habitat conditions. DNR's report of 2002 findings will include assessment of water quality, benthic organism populations and the potential relationships that may be drawn from the 2002 data. Synopic Survey Data Collection Parameters Dissolved Oxygen pH Nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) Conductivity  47  Sept. 2002   Agricultural Conservation Programs Both Caroline and Talbot Counties have significant levels of participation conservation programs. Farmers in these counties willingly implement management systems that address nutrient runoff and infiltration, erosion and sediment control, and animal waste utilization. The Soil and Water Conservation Districts in these counties work with farmers and landowners in the development of Soil Conservation and Water Quality plans that recommend best management practices that will prevent nutrient and sediment impact on surface and ground water. Some of the conservation practices installed were grassed waterways, riparian herbaceous and riparian forested buffers, conservation cover, cover crops, shallow water wildlife areas and grade stabilization structures. The Maryland Agricultural Cost-Share program (MACS), the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP and CREP) and the Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) are some of the state and federal programs promoted and administered by the Soil and Water Conservation Districts and the National Resource Conservation Service (NRCS). Farmers in the watershed who are already using good management practices that benefit water quality could provide examples to promote adoption of similar practices by other farmers.  Marina Programs Discharges of sewage from boats are a concern for water quality because they contribute nutrients, biochemical oxygen demand, pathogens, etc. These discharges are preventable if a sufficient number of pumpout facilities are locally available and boat operators take advantage of these services. In the Upper Choptank River watershed, three marinas are located in the Caroline County and none in Talbot County as shown in Map 20 Marinas. Of these marinas, only one offers pumpout facilities. None of these marinas is currently participating in Maryland's Clean Marina Program. The Clean Marinas Program is a way for marina owners to gain certification and public recognition for voluntarily undertaking a number of actions related to marina design, operation, and maintenance intended to properly manage all kinds of marine products and activities, and to reduce and properly manage waste. Information is available at DNR's website, www.dnr.state.md.us/boating. DNR also funds installation and maintenance of marine pumpout facilities, including those at certified Clean Marinas. Information may be obtained from the Waterway and Greenways Division at DNR. One potential element of a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) is to encourage and/or support adding marina pumpout facilities serving the local area and increasing participation in the Clean Marina Program.  48  Sept. 2002   Fish Blockage Removal Many fish species need to move from one stream segment to the next in order to maintain healthy resilient populations. This is particularly true for anadromous fish species because they spawn and hatch from eggs in free flowing streams but live most of their lives in estuarine or ocean waters. However, blockages in streams can inhibit or prevent many fish species from moving up stream to otherwise viable habitat. The distribution of fish blockages known to exist in the Upper Choptank River watershed in 2001 and earlier are shown in Map 21 Fish Blockages. The map shows that all currently known blockages in the Upper Choptank River watershed are in Caroline County. Four previously existing blockages that have been corrected are also show on the map and are listed in the table Corrected Fish Blockages. One corrected blockage is in Talobt County and the other three corrected blockages are on Herring Run and Broadway Branch in Caroline County. All immediately available information on fish blockages is from the DNR's Fish Blockage Database. DNR's Fisheries Service uses this information to help prioritize stream blockages for mitigation or removal. A summary of the 21 currently identified blockages listed in the Upper Choptank River watershed appears in the table Fish Blockage Removal Opportunities. In general, removal of a fish blockage is recommended if its correction would open a large stream segment containing high quality habitat with existing or potential return of significant fish populations. Some of these blockages to fish movement may be structural components of farm ponds, drainage ditches, etc. If a blockage is found to be in this category, circumstances like requirements for drainage control function and public or land owner needs are considered in determining the potential for a restoration project. The list of fish blockage removal opportunities should be considered as supporting information to help guide additional site assessments and planning for blockage removal. Based on experience in other watersheds, it is likely that a Stream Corridor Assessment would identify additional potential fish blockage problems. As part of the WRAS project, local government and other constituencies may elect to either provide input into DNR's fish blockage removal priorities or to generate a list of local priorities.  49  Sept. 2002   Corrected Fish Blockages Upper Choptank River Watershed Blockage Corrected Site ID CP004 CP005 CPU01 CPU02 County Stream Herring Run Herring Run Beaverdam Branch Broadway Branch Name / Location Dam #1 on Herring Run Dam #2 on Herring Run Beaverdam Creek Weir, near Rt 328 Lake Bonnie Dam, south of Greenboro  1996 1996 1989 1997  CO CO TA CO  50  Sept. 2002   Fish Blockage Removal Opportunities in the Upper Choptank River Watershed Site ID CP001 CP002 CP006 CPU03 CPU05 CPU06 CPU07 CPU08 CPU09 CPU10 CPU11 CPU13 CPU14 CPU16 CPU18 CPU20 CPU21 CPU22 CPU23 CPU24 CPU25 County Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Caroline Stream Chapel Branch Choptank River trib to Skeleton Creek Burrsville Branch Choptank River Choptank River Engle Ditch/ Chapel Br.

Benefits and General Recommendations Natural vegetation in stream riparian zones act as stream buffers that can provide numerous valuable environmental benefits:  Reducing surface runoff  Preventing erosion and sediment movement  Using nutrients for vegetative growth and moderating nutrient entry into the stream  Moderating temperature, particularly reducing warm season water temperature  Providing organic material (decomposing leaves) that are the foundation of natural food webs in stream systems  Providing overhead and in-stream cover and habitat  Promoting high quality aquatic habitat and diverse populations of aquatic species. To realize these environmental benefits, DNR generally recommends that forested stream buffers be at least 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream. Therefore, DNR is promoting this type of stream buffer for local jurisdictions and land owners who are willing to go beyond the minimum buffer standards. The DNR Watershed Restoration Division and other programs like CREP are available to assist land owners who volunteer to explore these opportunities.  2. Using GIS Identifying the areas that need buffer restoration and prioritizing them for action can be a timeconsuming expensive project. Fortunately, use of a computerized Geographic Information System (GIS) to manipulate remote sensing data can help save limited time and funds. To assist in this technical endeavor, DNR Watershed Management and Analysis Division is offering assistance, including GIS work, to help target restoration of naturally vegetated stream buffers, wetlands and other watershed management projects that may be identified locally. With these tools, information generated by a Stream Corridor Assessment and additional on-the-ground verification or ""ground truthing,"" local government may more efficiently and confidently consider stream buffer restoration as part of a local Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. Several scenarios are presented here to help consider potential areas for stream buffer and wetland restoration. These scenarios can be used alone or in combination as models for targeting potential restoration sites for field verification. These maps are intended to demonstrate a methodology that can be used to locate sites having a high probability of optimizing certain ecological benefits of stream buffers. The resolution of the data used to generate these maps is not sufficient for an accurate site assessment, but can be used to identify potential candidate sites for more detailed investigation. The streams presented in the maps are perennial (blue line) streams as generally shown on US Geological Survey Quadrangle Maps. Intermittent streams were not considered in the stream buffer scenario maps. 52 Sept. 2002   3. Headwater Stream Buffers Headwater streams are also called first order streams. These streams, unlike other streams (Second Order, etc.), intercept all of the surface runoff within the watersheds that they drain. In addition, for many watersheds, first order streams drain the majority of the land within the entire watershed. Therefore, stream buffers restored along headwater (First Order) streams tend to have greater potential to intercept nutrients and sediments than stream buffers placed elsewhere. In targeting stream buffer restoration projects, giving higher priority to headwater streams is one approach to optimizing nutrient and sediment retention. Restoring headwater stream buffers can also provide habitat benefits that can extend downstream of the project area. Forested headwater streams provide important organic material, like decomposing leaves, that ""feed"" the stream's food web. They also introduce woody debris which enhances in-stream physical habitat. The potential for riparian forest buffers to significantly influence stream temperature is greatest in headwater regions. These factors, in addition to positive water quality effects, are key to improving aquatic habitat. 4. Land Use and Stream Buffers One factor that affects the ability of stream buffers to intercept nonpoint source pollutants is adjacent land use. Nutrient and sediment loads from different land uses can vary significantly. The loading rates shown in the table here were calculated for the Lower Potomac River Tributary Basin from the model of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model. In general, restoration of stream buffers has been an agricultural Best Management Annual Nonpoint Source Pollution Load Rates Practice (BMP), with less By Land Use applicability in urban areas. Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model (2000) By identifying land uses in Land Use Nitrogen Phosphorus Sediment riparian areas with inadequate (lbs/ac) (lbs/ac) (tons/ac) stream buffers, like crop land adjacent to streams, the Crop land 17.11 1.21 0.74 potential to reduce nutrient Urban 7.5 0.7 0.09 and sediment loads can be improved. To assist in finding Pasture 8.40 1.15 0.30 areas with crop land adjacent to streams, the same land use Forest 1.42 0.00 0.03 data shown in Map 11 Generalized Land Use 2000 can be filtered using GIS. The land use / land cover information selectively shown in Map 22 Stream Buffer Land Use Scenario focuses on the land use within 50 feet of a stream. This view, supplemented with the land use pollution loading rates, suggests potential buffer restoration opportunities that could minimize nutrient and sediment loads. (Note: DNR is encouraging naturally vegetated stream buffers 50 feet wide on each 53 Sept. 2002   side of the stream, which is significantly greater than minimum buffer requirement, to enhance nutrient and habitat benefits beyond minimum buffer requirements.) 5. Nutrient Uptake from Hydric Soils in Stream Buffers In general, the nutrient nitrogen moves from the land into streams in surface water runoff and in groundwater. In watersheds like the Upper Choptank, a significant percentage of nitrogen enters streams in groundwater. Stream buffers can be used to capture nitrogen moving in groundwater if buffer restoration projects have several key attributes:  Plant with roots deep enough to intercept groundwater as it moves toward the stream  Plants with high nitrogen uptake capability, and  Targeting buffer restoration projects to maximize groundwater interception by buffer plants. Hydric soils in stream riparian areas can be used as one factor to help select stream buffer restoration sites. Siting buffer restoration on hydric soils would offer several benefits:  Plant roots are more likely to be in contact with groundwater for longer periods of time  Hydric soils tend to be marginal for many agricultural and urban land uses  Natural vegetation in wet areas often offers greater potential for habitat. Map 23 Stream Buffer Hydric Soils Scenario identifies lands adjacent to streams that are composed of hydric soil and also lack stream buffers in the Upper Choptank River watershed. To generate the map, hydric soils (Natural Soils Group of Maryland, MDP) were grouped into two classes and rated in terms of their potential to maximize groundwater/root zone interaction: poorly drained hydric soils (high nutrient retention efficiency), and moderately well drained hydric soils (moderately high nutrient retention efficiency). An important next step in using this information is verification of field conditions. Care must be taken during field validation to evaluate any hydrologic modification of these soils, such as ditching or draining activities, which would serve to decrease potential benefits. A revision of the above scenario is shown in Map 24 Stream Buffer Scenario: Hydric Soils On Cropland . The presentation in this map is based on the same hydric soil data as the previous map but refines the area highlighted by showing only hydric soils that were used for cropland in 2000. This scenario suggests areas where current agricultural stream buffer restoration programs may be focused. 6. Wetland Associations Wetlands and adjacent natural uplands form complex habitats that offer a range of habitat opportunities for many species. These ""habitat complexes"" tend to offer greater species diversity and other ecological values that are greater than the values that the wetland or uplands could offer independently. Therefore, restoring stream buffers adjacent to or near existing wetlands tends to offer greater habitat benefits than the restoration project could otherwise produce. Map 25 Stream Buffer Wetland Proximity Scenario identifies unforested buffer zones that are in close proximity (within 300 feet) to wetlands (National Wetlands Inventory). Restoration projects in these areas may offer opportunities to enhance and expand wetland habitat in addition to providing other desirable buffer functions. 54 Sept. 2002   7. Optimizing Water Quality Benefits by Combining Priorities Strategic targeting of stream buffer restoration projects may promote many different potential benefits. To maximize multiple benefits, site selection and project design need to incorporate numerous factors. For example, finding a site with a mix of attributes like those in the following list could result in the greatest control of nonpoint source pollution and enhancement to living resources:  land owner willingness / incentives  marginal land use in the riparian zone  headwater stream  hydric soils  selecting appropriate woody/grass species  adjacent to existing wetlands / habitat  Additionally, selecting restoration projects that are likely to produce measurable success is an important consideration in prioritizing projects for implementation. In the early stages of a watershed restoration program, measurable water quality improvement can be one of the strongest ways to demonstrate project success. In general, targeting restoration projects to one or a few selected tributaries or small watersheds will tend to offer the greatest probability of producing measurable water quality improvement. By selecting small areas like a small first order stream for restoration, there is greater likelihood that water quality problems arise locally and that they can be corrected by limited investment in carefully selected local restoration projects. In the Upper Choptank River watershed, available water quality data reinforces the premise that targeting restoration projects to locally generated problems is an important consideration. Because significant inputs to water quality in the Choptank River arise from multiple states and counties, it be will difficult for local projects to demonstrate water quality improvements in the river mainstem. However, if watershed restoration projects are targeted to selected tributary streams, improvement in in-stream water quality are more likely to be measurable in terms of water quality parameters, benthos populations or other parameters. Water quality improvements achieved in the tributary will also inevitably contribute to improving the river mainstem. However, improvement in the mainstem of the river may not be measurable if the magnitude of the problem is as great as the data suggest.  55  Sept. 2002   Wetland Restoration Wetlands serve important environmental functions such as providing habitat and nursery areas for many organisms, facilitating nutrient uptake and recycling, providing erosion control. However, most watersheds in Maryland have significantly fewer wetland acres today than in the past. This loss due to draining, filling, etc. has led to habitat loss and negative water quality impacts in streams and in the Chesapeake Bay. Limiting or reversing this historic trend is an important goal of wetland restoration. One approach to finding candidate wetland restoration sites involves identifying ""historic"" wetland areas based on the presence of hydric soils using GIS. The GIS maps can help initiate a candidate site search process, assist in discussions with willing land owners and targeting site investigations. For the Upper Choptank River watershed, a GIS scenarios were developed as described below:  Data used: Hydric soils (Natural Soil Groups), existing wetlands (National Wetlands Inventory), land use (MDP 1997).  Identify candidate hydric soil areas based on land use. Hydric soils on open land (agricultural fields, bare ground, etc.) are retained while those underlying natural vegetation and developed lands are excluded.  Identify hydric soils on open land that are close to existing wetlands or streams. Two of many possible scenarios for finding potential wetland restoration sites are presented on the accompanying maps:  Map 26 Wetland Restoration Opportunities shows that wetland restoration opportunities are numerous throughout the watershed.  Map 24 Stream Buffer Hydric Soils On Cropland Scenario shows stream buffer restoration opportunities are reasonably common across the watershed. The potential wetland restoration sites suggested in these scenarios can be filtered further by using more accurate wetlands and soil information, considering landownership, etc. Next steps that could also be beneficial are considering additional criteria like habitat enhancement opportunities, sensitive species protection, targeting specific streams or subwatersheds for intensive restoration, and using Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) information. Additional wetland restoration opportunities may be identified on non-agricultural lands. For example, residential properties, particularly low density areas, may also provide viable project sites that do not appear on the scenarios presented above.  56  Sept. 2002   PROJECTS RELATED TO THE WRAS PROCESS Overview There are numerous projects and programs that have the potential to contribute to successful development and implementation of a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). The listing included here suggests opportunities for cooperation and coordination that can improve the likelihood of success for the WRAS. This listing is not all-inclusive. It is recommended that this list be augmented as new information becomes available and that follow-up should continue to promote the WRAS process with these and other projects and programs.  319(h)-Funded Projects The Federal funding source generally known as ""319"" is funding a project that includes the Upper Choptank River watershed. This Maryland Dept. of Agriculture project is known as the Progressive Management Practices for Lower Eastern Shore Public Drainage Associations (PDAs). To date, the project has been funded in Federal fiscal year 1999 and 2000. Additional funding is proposed for Federal fiscal 2002. The project is intended to improve water quality in the Lower Eastern Shore by installing best management practices on PDAs to reduce the amount of sediment flow and nutrients into rivers that receive agricultural drainage by:  Installing weirs or other water control structures on 50 miles of public drainage systems for water quality improvement.  Demonstrating the viability of pocket wetland systems on public drainage systems on the Lower Eastern Shore.  Providing cost-share funds for repair and stabilization of emergency blowouts, channel obstructions and weir maintenance on existing PDAs for water quality protection.  Providing cost-share funds to increase PDA buffer protection and maintenance areas up to 35 feet from the drainage system center line.  Other Projects This section summarizes projects that have the potential to contribute to development and implementation of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy that have not been addressed elsewhere in the watershed characterization. 1. Agricultural / PDA BMP Monitoring The Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) and DNR will begin monitoring several agricultural areas served by Public Drainage Associations (PDAs) on Maryland's Eastern Shore in summer 2002. The intent of the project is gather information on the water quality affects of selected 57 Sept. 2002   Best Management Practices (BMPs). Some of this information will be collected in the Upper Choptank River watershed. This locally collected information can also be used to better quantify water quality conditions in the drainage ditches where the monitoring is stationed. 2. Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) The CRP program pays farmers on a per acre basis to remove fields from production. One of numerous benefits from the program is reduction of sediment and nutrient movement into streams. 3. Conservation and Restoration Enhancement Program (CREP) The CREP program reimburses farmers who restore stream riparian areas to natural vegetation. Under the program, this land creates new or enhanced stream buffer which is placed under a conservation easement. 4. Greenways The Year 2000 edition of the Maryland Greenways Atlas identifies Greenway and Green Infrastructure projects and issues that include the Upper Choptank River watershed area: - Easton-Clayton Rail Trail (recreational greenway) is proposed to extend through the Upper Choptank River watershed from the existing section completed in 1998 in Talbot County. As proposed, the completed project would extend outside of the watershed and then eventually re-enter the watershed in Caroline County to extend through Hillsboro, Ridgely and Goldsboro. - Choptank and Tuckahoe River Water Trail has been proposed as a partnership between Talbot County, Caroline County and private citizens that would establish an official water trail. This portion of the Choptank River within the Upper Choptank River watershed would build on the existing popularity among canoe and kayak enthusiasts. - Denton Municipal Greenway proposal would connect Denton to Martinak State Park on the Choptank River within the WRAS watershed. - Hillsboro Rail Trail is a proposal for a recreational greenway on an inactive railroad spur between Hillsboro and Denton. - Upper Choptank River Greenway is proposed to be an ecological and recreational greenway. It would follow the Choptank River (in the Upper Choptank River watershed) connecting the County Christian Park to the boat ramp in Greensboro.  58  Sept. 2002   POTENTIAL BENCHMARKS FOR WRAS GOAL SETTING Several programs designed to manage water quality and/or living resources have existing or proposed goals that are relevant to setting goals for the Breton Bay Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). The goals from these other programs tend to overlap and run parallel to potential interests for developing WRAS goals. Therefore, to assist in WRAS development, selected goals from other programs are included here as points of reference. Coastal Zone Management  The Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) Initiative is a component of the Cumulative and Secondary Impacts section of the Maryland Coastal Zone Management Program Section 309 Strategy (2000-2005). Watershed strategies are defined as comprehensive plans that will identify areas of concern, monitoring strategies, gaps in information, mitigation options, and restoration and protection opportunities.  WRAS projects funded under Coastal Zone Management must be in Maryland's Coastal Zone and must include a local program change as part of the effort. This could include incorporation into the County Comprehensive Plan, adoption of local implementing tools like zoning ordinances and environmental codes, modification of sensitive areas elements or alterations to Smart Growth Priority Funding Areas. Chesapeake 2000 Agreement The Chesapeake 2000 Agreement (C2K) includes several significant commitments pertaining to local watershed management planning and implementation. The goal in the C2K Agreement that is directly related to the development of watershed management plans and action strategies is ""By 2010, work with local governments, community watershed groups and watershed organizations to develop and implement locally supported watershed management plans in two-thirds of the Bay watershed covered by this Agreement. These plans would address the protection, conservation and restoration of stream corridors, riparian buffers and wetlands for the purposes of improving habitat and water quality, with the collateral benefits for optimizing flow and water supply."" Four common elements of watershed management planning were adopted by the Chesapeake Bay Program member jurisdictions to be applied Bay-wide. Those elements support the WRAS components which were also identified as common Bay-wide criteria for watershed management planning. The four approved C2K Agreement watershed planning elements are as follows: 1. Does the plan ""address the protection, conservation and restoration of stream corridors, riparian forest buffers and wetlands?"" Each watershed management plan needs to be based on an assessment of natural resources within the watershed. At a minimum, the assessment will evaluate the condition of stream corridors, riparian buffers and wetlands within the watershed. 2. Does the plan reflect the goals and objectives of ""improving habitat and water quality?"" The plan should reflect the issues that the stakeholders feel are important, and, at a minimum, exhibit a 59 Sept. 2002   benefit to habitat and water quality within the watershed. The goals should be based on priority issues identified by the watershed assessment. 3. CWiC Criteria #3-- Does the plan identify implementation mechanisms? Capacity to implement the plan will be demonstrated by identifying: - What are the specific management actions? - What are the resources necessary for implementation? - Who will implement the plan? - And when will the actions will be implemented? The implementation mechanisms should also incorporate a periodic re-evaluation to ensure the plan is ""living"" and flexible to the changes in the watershed. 4. Does the plan have demonstrated local support? Every effort should be made to demonstrate a diversity of local support. At a minimum, local governments, community groups and watershed organizations should be encouraged to participate in developing and implementing the watershed management plan. Goals from the Clean Water Action Plan 2  Clean Water Goals - Maryland watersheds should meet water quality standards, including numerical criteria as well as narrative standards and designated uses.  Watersheds should achieve healthy conditions as indicated by natural resource indicators related to the condition of the water itself (e.g. water chemistry), aquatic living resources and physical habitat, as well as landscape factors (e.g. buffered streams and wetland restoration). Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998 - The most significant feature is requiring nutrient management plans for virtually all Maryland farms. The requirement is being phased in over a several year period. - Nitrogen-based plan implementation will be required on all farms beginning December 31, 2001. - Phosphorus-based plan implementation will be required on farms using chemical fertilizer beginning December 31,2002 and on farms using manure or biosolids by July 1, 2005. - Up to 87.5% cost share is available for development of nutrient management plans and up to $20 per ton cost share assistance with costs of manure transportation are available. Implementation of projects assisted by this funding has the potential to move nutrients to sites where they are needed.  60  Sept. 2002   REFERENCES 1. DNR. Internet Site: www.dnr.state.md.us/ .

These watersheds have been adopted by State agencies as one of several standardized approaches to analyzing and sharing information across the State of Maryland. The table is broken into three segments consistent with the three maps that match three maps entitled Stream and Subwatersheds in the Upper Choptank River Watershed Characterization. One key identifier for subwatersheds relates the tables and maps: - in the table, the second column contains a three digit number - on the maps, the same three digit number is a unique identifier shown for each subwatershed. (These are the same subwatersheds mapped by DNR/MDE for the entire state known as ""12-digit watersheds.) Example: - on Map 3A, the stream Beaverdam Branch, which is east of Easton, is near the top of the map. - the map labels the Beaverdam Branch subwatershed as ""483"". - on table ""Stream Summary for Map 3A"", look either for ""Beaverdam Branch"" or ""483"" - the table shows that DNR GIS system shows 17 linear miles of stream for Beaverdam Branch  Additional Notes: 12-Digit Name - A unique number assigned by DNR to each ""12-Digit Watershed"" in the State. The table truncates the leading zero (example 0472 in the table is 472). Potential Watershed Name - Most of the ""12-Digit Watersheds"" designated by DNR do not have an official English name. The names listed here are offered only to raise the issue and to promote clear communication. Stream Miles. This estimate is based on Statewide large-scale map digitization rounded to the nearest whole mile. Other sources, like the County's Planning and Zoning Maps, probably show additional stream reaches not included in the statewide data. Lakes and ponds that appear on USGS Quad Maps as open water were digitized with a left and a right shoreline. Therefore, the stream miles estimate reflects an estimate of the water body's perimeter.  100  Sept. 2002   Stream Summary for Map 3A 12-Digit Count & Number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 472 473 474 475 476 477 478 479 480 481 482 483 484 Skeleton Creek Marsh Creek Little Creek Mitchell Run Crowberry Creek Williams Creek  Upper Choptank River - South Section Stream Miles Total 11 89 <1 25 19 8 5 8 4 3 11 17 11  October 2001 Watershed Area w/ Open Water (Total Acres) 4,448 22,110 1,701 5,591 4,232 1,979 880 2,780 1,138 1,288 4,165 4,766 3,524  Potential Watershed Name  Miles Creek Headwaters Miles, Kings, Turkey Creeks  Kings Creek Headwaters Galloway and Wootenaux Creeks Beaverdam Branch Hog Creek  101  Sept. 2002   Stream Summary for Map 3B 12-Digit Count & Number 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 0485 0486 0487 0488 0489 0490 0491 0492 0493 0494 0495 0496 0497 0498 0499 0500 Spring Branch Chapel Branch Watts Creek Herring Run Mill Creek  Upper Choptank River  Central Section Stream Miles Total 29 17 32 9 6 12 7 25 5 31 20 2 10 3 12 13  October 2001 Watershed Area w/ Open Water (Total Acres) 9,334 4,050 5,036 6,355 1,519 5,228 1,116 7,977 606 10,284 4,083 488 2,050 347 829 3,550  Potential Watershed Name  Fowling Creek Robins Creek  102  Sept. 2002   Stream Summary for Map 3C 12-Digit Count & Number 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 0501 0502 0503 0504 0505 0506 0507 0508 0509 0510 0511 0512 0513 0514 0515  Upper Choptank River  North Section Stream Miles Total 14 11 6 7  October 2001 Watershed Area w/ Open Water (Total Acres) 3,442 3,760 1,947 2,334 5,611 1,650 2,250 2,732 4,729 4,067 645 635 1,242 3,444 3,754 163,699  Potential Watershed Name  Tubmill Branch Gravelly Branch  Lower Forge Branch Forge Branch west headwaters Forge Branch north headwaters Oldtown Branch Broadway Branch Choptank River near Rt 287  29 9 13 13 18 19 <1 3 5  Coolspring Branch Harrington Beaverdam Branch Upper Choptank River Watershed  15 13 564  TOTAL  103  Sept. 2002   APPENDIX B  Delaware's Upper Choptank River Watershed  Delaware Department of Natural Resource and Environmental Control ( DNREC ) Watershed Assessment Section  104  Sept. 2002"

Kent County applied for grant funding and volunteered to develop a strategy in the watershed to improve water quality using protection and restoration projects. The purpose of the Watershed Characterization is to assist Kent County in collecting information and identifying issues that may be used as the County generates its Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. The Middle Chester River watershed encompasses about 37,400 acres of land in Kent and Queen Annes County. Over 2,000 acres of open water in the Chester River separate the two Counties creating hydrologically distinct drainage areas on either side of the River. Approximately 29,600 acres of land are in the Kent County WRAS area. Within the WRAS area, the very rural and agricultural Morgan Creek watershed drains about 22,200 acres. The relatively developed Radcliffe Creek watershed containing Chestertown drains about 4030 acres. The remainder of the Kent County Middle Chester River WRAS area consists of minor watersheds draining directly to the Chester River. Water Quality The Middle Chester River does not support its designated use (water contact recreation) due to problems associated with nutrients, fecal coliforms and sediment. Nearly all of the water quality information available for the Middle Chester River watershed is for the Chester River mainstem where water quality is poor in general. In this area of the mainstem, water clarity is the worst of the Chesapeake Bay ""segments"" for the period 1992 through 1997. Several water quality parameters, including water clarity, algae and phosphorus, are showing a recent trend toward improvement. Toxicity in river water and sediment from two Middle Chester River sites did not cause significant mortality for minnows or clams under laboratory conditions. However, in terms of inhibiting growth of these organisms, toxicity was ranked as high or moderately high for river water and for sediment from the sites tested. DDT and Dieldrin, which were found here, may have contributed to an observed reduction in growth rate. Based on the relatively little information available on nontidal streams in the Middle Chester River watershed, few generalizations can be put forward. For Radcliffe Creek, low summer dissolved oxygen and assessment of benthic organisms found there suggests that high nutrient levels may be present. Very poor water quality associated with nutrients and sedimentation in Urieville Lake is a well known local condition. The Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) issued for the Lake in 1999 called for a 42% reduction in sediment load and an 85% reduction in total phosphorus load.  v   Land Use Land in Kent County / Middle Chester River watershed is among the most productive agricultural land in Maryland. The watershed is nearly all privately owned and is about three quarters agricultural land. However, soil erodibility is high, which presents a challenge for managers of land and water quality. The majority of the forested land in the watershed is associated with wetlands and wet soil conditions. Developed lands are projected to increase over the next twenty years primarily at the expense of farm land. The majority of the limited acreage in the watershed that is protected from development is privately owned with either agricultural or conservation easements providing the protection. Living Resources and Habitat Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) has not been found in the Middle Chester River area during the period 1978 through 1999 when annual aerial survey monitoring was conducted. Long-time residents of the Chestertown area recall that SAV was abundant in the 1950s and 1960s in the Middle Chester River. Current-day SAV absence is linked to poor water clarity and other factors. Little information is available for living resources associated with nontidal streams in the Middle Chester River watershed. Analysis of benthic organism populations and habitat was conducted at two Middle Chester River sites. Radcliffe Creek was rated as ""not supporting"" benthic species. Morgan Creek near Urieville Lake (but not down stream of it) was rated as ""partially supporting"" benthic species. Interpretation of fish populations upstream of Urieville Lake rated the biotic integrity of two tributary streams ""fair"" and ""good."" However, fish populations in Urieville Lake itself are poor due to its eutrophic condition. Restoration Targeting Tools A stream corridor assessment is scheduled for Winter 2000/2001. It will identify the status of stream buffers, stream bank erosion, etc. This information will provide a foundation for targeting restoration projects. Computerized mapping was used to demonstrate concepts for restoration targeting and to help identify areas for additional site investigation for restoration of stream buffers and wetlands. Opportunities were also identified to address fish blockages and to reduce overboard sewage discharge from boats that could potentially use marina pumpout facilities. Additional Information The DNR Chester River Study is anticipated to be available in Winter 2001. It will provide analysis of Chester River mainstem water quality and living resources.  vi   INTRODUCTION Watershed Selection Maryland's Clean Water Action Plan, completed in 1998, identified water bodies that failed to meet water quality requirements. As part of the State's response, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is offering funding and technical assistance to Counties willing to work cooperatively to devise and implement a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) for the impaired water bodies. Kent County is one of five Counties participating in the first round of the WRAS program. The portion of the Middle Chester River Watershed within Kent County is the area selected for restoration. This watershed has several key physical characteristics: coastal plain location, low to moderate elevation, moderate terrain with limited areas of steep slope, and generally rural land uses with development mostly clustered in and around Chestertown. Location The Middle Chester River watershed is located within the Chester River basin as shown in Map 1 Regional Context . The majority of the Middle Chester River watershed is in Kent County, Maryland. This area is the focus of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy and this Watershed Characterization. Map 2 Middle Chester River Watershed WRAS Project Area shows the geographic Acreage Summary location of the WRAS watershed in County Land Water Total Maryland. In addition, about 23% of the watershed is in Queen Anne's County, Kent 29,611 1,286 30,897 Maryland. As shown in Map 3 Streams and Queen Anne's 7,825 1,211 9,036 Sub-Watersheds, the two Counties are on opposite sides of the Chester River. Watershed Total 37,436 2,497 39,933 Therefore, their subwatersheds are hydrologically distinct. Purpose of the Characterization One of the earliest steps toward devising a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy is to characterize the watershed using immediately available information. This Watershed Characterization is intended to meet several objectives:  briefly summarize the most important or relevant information and issues  provide preliminary findings based on this information  identify sources for more information or analysis  suggest opportunities for additional characterization and restoration work. 1   Additional Characterization Recommended The Watershed Characterization is intended to be a starting point. It is part of a framework for a more thorough assessment involving an array of additional inputs:  self-investigation by the local entity  targeted technical assistance by partner agencies or contractors  input from local stakeholders  Stream Corridor Assessment, i.e. physically walking the streams and cataloguing important issues, is part of the technical assistance offered by DNR  Synoptic water quality survey, i.e. a program of water sample analysis, can be used to focus on local issues like nutrient hot spots, point source discharges or other selected issues. This is also part of the technical assistance offered by DNR.  Identifying Gaps in Information It is important to identify gaps in available watershed knowledge and gauge the importance of these gaps. One method is to review available information in the context of four physical / biological assessment categories that have been successfully applied in other watershed restoration efforts. These are the main categories that impact aquatic biota:  Habitat: physical structure, stream stability and biotic community (including the riparian zone)  Water Quantity: high water - storm flow & flooding; low water - baseflow problems from dams, water withdrawals, reduced infiltration  Water Quality: water chemistry; toxics, nutrients, sediment, nuisance odors/scums, etc.  Cumulative effects associated with habitat, water quantity and water quality.  Adaptive Management In addition, the Watershed Characterization and the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy should be maintained as living documents within an active evolving restoration process. These documents will have to be updated periodically as new, more relevant information becomes available and as the watershed response is monitored and reassessed. This type of approach to watershed restoration and protection is often referred to as ""adaptive management.""  2      WATER QUALITY Designated Uses All waters of the State are assigned a ""Designated Use"" in regulation, COMAR 26.08.02.08, which is associated with a set of water quality criteria necessary to support that use. A simplified summary of the Designated Uses in the Middle Chester watershed is listed below. (The Department of the Environment should be contacted for official regulatory information.) 7 - Use I: for water contact recreation and aquatic life: All waters not designated as Use II - Use II: for shellfish harvesting: Tidal waters downstream of Route 213. - No other designated uses are established in the Middle Chester River watershed.  Not Supporting Designated Use  303(d) Listings Significant portions of the Middle Chester River either do not support their designated use or partially do not support their designated use.2 As required under Section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act, Maryland tracks waterways that did not support their designated use in a prioritized list of ""Water Quality Limited Basin Segments."" The Middle Chester River is referenced twice: - Nutrients. In the 1996 303(d) list, the Chester River (which includes the Middle Chester River) is listed as Priority #4 among many priorities. Nutrients from point, nonpoint and natural sources are identified as the problem. - Nutrients, Fecal Coliform, Suspended Sediment . In the 1996 303(d) list, the Middle Chester River is also listed separately for nutrients, fecal coliform and suspended sediment from nonpoint & natural sources. The 303(d) priority referenced above is established by the Maryland Department of the Environment. Information considered in setting these priorities include, but is not limited to, severity of the problem and the extent of understanding of problem causes and remedies. These priorities are used to help set State work schedules various programs including total maximum daily loads (TMDLs). Nutrients enter waterways from all types of land and from the atmosphere. The nutrients of primary concern are nitrogen and phosphorus. In general, an acre of forest land contributes the smaller amounts of nutrients than other lands. Residential land can be important contributor of nutrients depending on fertilizer use, extent of lawn and the status of septic systems. Many farmers carefully control nutrients so nutrients entering waterways from crop land varies greatly depending on management techniques. The atmosphere can contribute various forms of nitrogen arising from the burning of fossil fuels in power plants and from automobile exhaust. Fecal coliforms are bacteria that are used as a measure of contamination from human and animal waste. 6   Suspended sediment arises from stream bed and bank erosion and from land that is poorly vegetated or disturbed. Construction sites, crop land and bare ground are common contributors. The amount of sediment contributed varies greatly site to site depending upon management controls that are used.  National Academy Press, Clean Coastal Waters (2000) What Are the Effects of Nutrient Over-Enrichment? 18 The productivity of many coastal marine [and estuary] systems is limited by nutrient availability, and the input of additional nutrients to these systems increases primary productivity [microscopic organisms including algae]. In moderation in some systems, nutrient enrichment can have beneficial impacts such as increasing fish production; however, more generally the consequences of nutrient enrichment for coastal marine ecosystems are detrimental. Many of these detrimental consequences are associated with eutrophication. The increased productivity from eutrophication increases oxygen consumption in the system and can lead to low-oxygen (hypoxia) or oxygen-free (anoxic) water bodies. This can lead to fish kills as well as more subtle changes in ecological structure and functioning, such as lowered biotic diversity and lowered recruitment of fish populations Eutrophication can also have deleterious consequences on estuaries even when low-oxygen events do not occur. These changes include loss of biotic diversity, and changes in the ecological structure of both planktonic and benthic communities, some of which may be deleterious to fisheries. Seagrass beds and coral reefs are particularly vulnerable to damage from eutrophication and nutrient over-enrichment. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) harm fish, shellfish, and marine mammals and pose a direct public health threat to humans. The factors that cause HABs remain poorly known, and some events are entirely natural. However, nutrient over-enrichment of coastal waters leads to blooms of some organisms that are both longer in duration and of more frequent occurrence. Although difficult to quantify, the social and economic consequences of nutrient over-enrichment include aesthetic, health, and  7   Water Quality Indicators The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan published in 1998 listed the following water quality indicators for the Middle Chester River.3 The Middle Chester River is also identified in the Plan as a Category 1 Priority Watershed ""in need of restoration during the next two years."" For more details on the Clean Water Action Plan see www.dnr.state.md.us/cwap/ Water Quality Indicator State 303(d) Impairment Number Modeled TN Load Finding ""3"" Rank Fail Bench Mark This watershed is included in the 303(d) list. Impairment Number 3 means that additional protection is needed. In comparison to 138 watersheds in Maryland, this watershed is among the 34 (25%) with the highest nitrogen loads. In comparison to 138 watersheds in Maryland, this watershed is among the 104 (75%) with the lower phosphorus loads.  9.66 lbs/acre  Fail  Modeled TP Load  0.62 lbs/acre  Pass  See Interpreting Water Quality Indicators for additional information.  8   Interpreting Water Quality Indicators State 303(d) Impairment Number. This number is used to characterize watersheds relative to regulatory requirements of the Federal Clean Water Act. It is based on numerous water quality-related factors that are tracked by the State of Maryland under these federal requirements. Modeled TN Load. TN refers to Total Nitrogen. Nitrogen Load is a measure of how much of this important nutrient is reaching streams and other surface waters. For each type of land use in the watershed, on average, stormwater tends to carry or transport a characteristic amount of nitrogen from the land to nearby streams. Based on these averages, computers can be used to estimate (model) how much nitrogen is likely to be reaching local streams. This method was applied Statewide to all the 138 watersheds in Maryland to allow comparison of ""modeled total nitrogen load"" among them. A rank of ""fail"" means that this watershed was among the 34 watersheds (25%) that had the highest estimated total nitrogen load. High nitrogen levels in tidal waters and lakes are often associated with poor water quality. Modeled TP Load. TP refers to Total Phosphorus. It is a measure of how much of this important nutrient is reaching streams and other surface waters. The ranking for modeled TP Load was performed in parallel to the ranking for modeled TN Load above. (Note: details of the models differ.) The rank of ""pass"" means that this watershed was among the 104 (75%) out of 138 total watersheds in Maryland that had the lower estimated total phosphorus load.  9   Tributary Team Characterization As part of the work of the Upper Eastern Shore Tributary Team, Middle Chester River water quality was characterized several parameters that are listed below. 1, 9 The status for each parameter in the table is a relative ranking at three levels: good, fair and poor. For example, poor means that the Middle Chester River ranking is poor compared to comparable Chesapeake Bay tributaries with comparable salinity. This information is taken from DNR's Internet site www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/tribstrat/index.html which includes maps of the Upper Eastern Shore of Maryland showing the status and trends for rivers near the Middle Chester River. These maps allow qualitative comparison of regional conditions. Parameter Nitrogen: total Phosphorus: total Algae: Abundance Dissolved Oxygen (summer, bottom waters) Water Clarity: secchi depth Suspended Solids: total Status 1997 -99 data poor poor poor poor poor poor Trend 1985 through 1999 no trend improving (29%) improving (22%) no trend improving (53%) no trend  Water Quality Assessment It is anticipated that DNR will release a report, tentatively called the DNR Chester River Study, during Winter 2001. It will include information as described below that was collected at the sampling stations shown in Map 4 Monitoring Stations labeled as ""mainstem"" and ""additional"" stations:  Water and Sediment samples were gathered in 1995 to establish baseline concentrations for metals and select pesticides. These samples were collected at the ten mainstem stations.  A suite of nutrient parameters was measured monthly in 1999 at 30 sampling stations.  Several water quality parameters were measured at each sampling station. 1. Clarity Water clarity in the Chester River mainstem in the vicinity of the Middle Chester was the worst of any Chesapeake Bay tidal segment during the 1992-1997 time frame. 23 This condition, translated into living resource terms, indicates that submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) can not grow in the Middle Chester River unless water clarity is improved. Based on data collected from monitoring station 10   ET4.1 upstream of the Middle Chester in the Chester River mainstem, this problem is arising, at least in part, upstream of the Middle Chester. For example, information is available indicating that at least one of the Upper Chester River subwatersheds contributes nutrients (total nitrogen) at a rate among the highest in the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed. 24 These nutrients would tend to drive algae growth in the River which reduces water clarity. To view data for station ET4.1, see http://www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/conditions/index.html. 2. Dissolved Oxygen Analysis of dissolved oxygen (DO) samples collected in the Middle Chester River watershed show a range of conditions. DO in the Chester River was consistently above the water quality standard of 5.0 mg/L. 20 In very limited sampling of nontidal streams, summer DO in Radcliffe Creek fell below 5.0 mg/L water quality standard. 21 This is a level which stresses or eliminates some aquatic life. Urieville Lake DO has been found at extremely low concentrations -- as little as 0.1 mg/L. 13 Many species of aquatic life can not survive in these conditions. Additional water quality-related data is available via the Internet. Two recommended Web sites are www.dnr.state.md.us/irc/datasets.html and www.chesapeakebay.net/wquality.htm . 3. Nutrients In Radcliffe Creek, potentially elevated nutrient concentrations were cited in one study as a contributing factor for benthic conditions in 1992 and 1993. This study recommended Radcliffe Creek as a candidate for more exhaustive nutrient analyses. 21 A comparison of the modeled nutrient estimates in the Water Quality Indicator section and the nutrient status and trends in the Tributary Team Characterization section shows the limitations of currently available nutrient information:  Nutrient data for Middle Chester River tributaries was not available for the Watershed Characterization with the exception of the Radcliffe Creek data summarized above.  The Water Quality Indicator modeled nutrient loads are based on estimated loads generated by nutrient sources in the watershed using average loading rates for each land use type.  The Tributary Team Characterization is based on water quality data collected in the Chester River mainstem which includes nutrient loads from all sources upstream of the Middle Chester River. For total nitrogen, the modeled indicator (fail) and Tributary Team Characterization (poor) seem consistent even though the two are measuring differing nitrogen source areas. For total phosphorus, the modeled indicator (pass) and Tributary Team Characterization (poor) may not be inconsistent because they are measuring differing phosphorus source areas. It is anticipated that the Chester River Study will refine the knowledge of nutrients in the Chester River mainstem. However, it is likely the modeled nutrient estimates for the watershed will remain useful until nutrient data is available for Middle Chester River tributaries.  11   4. Toxicity In Tidal Areas In a December 2000 report produced by the Chesapeake Bay Program, Chesapeake Bay Program Toxics 2000 Strategy, portions of the Chester River, including the Middle Chester River, were classified as an ""area of emphasis."" The Middle Chester was one of several tidal areas around the Chesapeake Bay to receive this classification based on toxic compounds found there. The Chester River's classification was based on findings of DDT, arsenic and nickel there according to the report. In general, toxic materials in the water and sediments of the Chesapeake Bay system are known to be localized and they are not homogeneously distributed bay-wide. Tidal rivers tend to serve as traps that accumulate the toxics which are residuals or by-products of human activities. The tidal rivers identified in the Toxics 2000 Strategy as areas of emphasis have high potential for toxic impacts and are showing early warning signs of contamination. The Toxics 2000 Strategy indicates that future efforts to address toxics will focus on these areas. A study of toxicity in open tidal waters and sediment in the Chester River reported varying levels of toxicity to test organisms at all four sites tested in 1996. 20 Two of the four sample sites tested were in the Middle Chester River watershed as shown in Map 4 Monitoring Stations:  Near Skillet Point which is near Chestertown  Near Scotts Point down-river of Radcliffe Creek In this study, toxicity waas measured by comparing survival and growth rates of test organisms (minnows and clams). These organisms were exposed to sample-site water or sediment collected from various sites around the Chesapeake Bay under laboratory conditions. For the Chester River sites, survival was not significantly affected but growth rates were inhibited. In summary, the Skillet Point site was found to have ""high toxicity"" in both the water column and in the sediment. The Scotts Point site exhibited ""high toxicity"" in the sediment and ""low toxicity"" in the water column. These findings mean that the test organisms grew at slower rates than reference sites (relatively uncontaminated areas.) The toxicity findings at the Middle Chester sites were similar those for more urbanized rivers like the James River, VA or the Magothy River, Anne Arundel County, MD. DDT and Dieldrin were found at all four Chester River sites with the highest concentrations found at the Middle Chester River sites. The authors of the study speculated that these compounds may have contributed to their toxicity findings. Concentrations for metals were found to be generally low at the Chester River sites. However, both Middle Chester River sites had sediment concentrations above the ""Effects Range - Low"" threshold for arsenic, lead and nickel. The Skillet Point site also had sediment concentrations for mercury and zinc above this threshold. These findings suggest that the on-site concentrations of these metals could cause biological effects in some organisms.  12    Point Sources Discharges from discrete conveyances like pipes are called ""point sources."" Point sources may contribute pollution to surface water or to groundwater. For example, waste water treatment discharges may contribute nutrients or microbes that consume oxygen (measured as Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) that reduce oxygen available for aquatic life. Stormwater discharges may contribute excessive flow of water and/or seasonally high temperatures. Industrial point sources may contribute various forms of pollution. Some understanding of point source discharges in a watershed targeted for restoration is useful in helping to prioritize potential restoration projects. According to the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) permit data base as summarized in the following table, there are six permitted surface water discharges and two permitted groundwater discharges in Kent County's portion of the Middle Chester River watershed. Not included in the table, but shown in Map 5 MDE Permits, are six ""general permits"" (hospital, bulk petrol, marina, farm, etc.), eight general industrial stormwater permits listed in MDE's permit data base, and five permits of various types in the Queen Anne's County portion of the Middle Chester River watershed. Characteristics of the these permitted discharges (volume, temperature, pollutants, etc.) are tracked by MDE through the permit system. Most of this information is accessible to the public and can be obtained from MDE. Based on information received by the Upper Eastern Shore Tributary Team, Chestertown has agreed to upgrade its Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) with Biological Nutrient Removal (BNR) technology to reduce nutrient discharge from the WWTP. This treatment technology is designed to reduce nutrients discharged during summer months when the risk of algae blooms is greatest. The greatest benefit of using BNR is reduction of total nitrogen concentration in the effluent. Control of total nitrogen in sewage effluent by other means (chemicals, etc.) is significantly more expensive in general.  14   POINT SOURCES: NPDES PERMITS and GROUDWATER DISCHARGE PERMITS Middle Chester River Watershed Facility Name NPDES Permit / MD Code MD0002232 93DP0009 MD0020010 95DP0592 MD0052671 92DP1142 MD0065731 96DP2878 MD0000345 93DP0014 MD0060585 94DP2109 94DP3117 97DP2562 Discharge Type / MDE Permit Category Surface Water / Industrial Surface Water / Municipal Surface Water / Municipal Surface Water / Industrial Surface Water / Industrial Surface Water / Municipal Groundwater / Industrial Groundwater / Industrial Location  Chestertown Foods, Inc.

Anecdotal information on wildlife contributions, including the region's large goose population, has not been quantified. However, nutrients and sediment are a significant issue in the watershed based on two sources:  listing of the river under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act  modeled nitrogen summary in the Water Quality Indicators section in this Watershed Characterization. Several potential approaches for addressing nonpoint source pollution in the Middle Chester River WRAS were identified in discussions between local representatives and DNR representatives:  Supporting development of nutrient management plans.  Promoting the marina pumpout program  especially for summer visitors on the Chester River.  Identification of septic system problems: existing and potential.  Supporting development of comprehensive conservation plans for agricultural operations. 1. Erosion and Sediment Transport Soils in the Middle Chester River watershed are prone to erosion. (See the Soil Erodibility Indicator in the Land Use section.) The experience from Urieville Lake suggests that high sediment transport has been an important factor in determining the quality of aquatic habitat within the watershed. The lake currently provides poor habitat, in part, because it is largely filled by trapped sediment. Stream habitat below the lake is relatively good because of the protective function provided by the lake. 14 The 1999 Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for Urieville Lake called for over 42% reduction in sediment loading rates to protect the lake.5 The intent of the TMDL is to reduce both the sediment and the phosphorus load that accompanies the sediment. Based on this limited assessment, the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy may incorporate projects for education and/or incentives for erosion and sediment control.  16   2. Shorelines Wherever land and open water meet, change in the form of erosion or accretion of land is typically the inevitable result of natural processes. Human activity in these areas either tends to inadvertently accentuate these natural processes or purposefully attempts to control movement of water and/or loss of land. Erosion of shorelines can contribute significant amounts of nutrients (mostly phosphorus) and sediment (water column turbidity, habitat loss.) Countywide shoreline erosion is summarized in the following table. 12 Kent County Shore Erosion Rate Summary (Miles of Shoreline) Total Shoreline Total Eroding Shoreline Erosion Rate 0 - 2 feet / year 64 2 - 4 feet / year 12 > 4 feet / year 2  268  78  Maps of historic shoreline change were produced in 1999 by the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) in a cooperative effort between DNR and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These maps included digitized shorelines for several years in Kent County. The maps show that extensive changes have occurred adjacent to all large bodies of open water which are outside of the Middle Chester River watershed. The maps also show relatively little change adjacent to smaller water bodies that are typical along the Middle Chester. Copies of these 1:24000 scale maps are available from the MGS.  17    Total Maximum Daily Loads: Urieville Lake Currently, Total Daily Maximum Load (TMDL) work in the Middle Chester River watershed has been completed for the subwatershed draining to the Urieville Community Lake. It can be anticipated that additional TMDL work will be conducted in the Middle Chester watershed but no schedule is currently available. As new information becomes available it can be added to this Watershed Characterization. Urieville Community Lake is an extremely eutrophic water body on a DNR-owned property. The very poor water quality of the lake is associated with trapped sediment and nutrients. Water samples collected in 1993 found dissolved oxygen below 0.1 mg/l. Measurements of both total phosphorus and total nitrogen concentrations in the lake indicated eutrophic conditions.13 An attempt by DNR to improve conditions in the Lake by draining and sediment removal in the middle 1990s was not successful. However, this approach proved controversial and the plan was not implemented. Currently, lake conditions remain poor.14 The June 1999 Final Total Daily Maximum Load (TMDL) for Urieville Community Lake verified that past / present nonpoint sources are the cause of water quality problems in the Lake. The Lake's watershed is 80% agricultural land, 18% forest and only 2% urbanized land. There are no point sources in this drainage area.5 The TMDLs for Urieville Lake are:  Phosphorus = 509 lb/yr. This represents an 85% reduction.  Sediment = ""An estimated 42.45% reduction in sediment loading rates. This translates to a sediment accumulation rate of about 24% of the storage capacity in 40 years, or an estimated load of 89.2 tons/yr. This estimated load is based on estimated ""suspended solids,"" which include organic matter, but exclude materials transported in the bed load."" Therefore, this TMDL is intended to reduce sediments from land erosion but does not address stream bank erosion.  19   LAND USE Middle Chester River Watershed Landscape Indicators Water quality, particularly in streams and rivers, is affected by the land in the riparian zone and the land use throughout the watershed. In an effort to gauge the affects of land use on water quality, and to allow comparison between watersheds, DNR has developed a series of Landscape Indicators. These indicators can be used to portray landscape conditions on a watershed scale that tend to support good water quality or that tend to degrade water quality. The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan published in 1998 listed landscape indicators for the Middle Chester River watershed as summarized in the table below. 3 Most indicator ranking (pass / fail) is a relative measure that compares the Middle Chester River watershed with the other 137 watersheds of similar size that together cover the entire State of Maryland. Landscape Indicator Impervious Surface Finding 3.7 % of watershed is impervious 0.11 people per acre 13,226 acres Rank Pass Bench Mark Of 138 watersheds in Maryland, this one is among the 104 watersheds (75%) with the least impervious surface. Of 138 watersheds in Maryland, this one is among the 104 watersheds (75%) with the lower population density. Of 138 watersheds in Maryland, this one is among the 104 watersheds (75%) with smaller historic losses. Of 138 among highest natural watersheds in Maryland, this one is the 34 watersheds (25%) with the soil erodibility. (Soil erodibility is a condition.)  Population Density  Pass  Historic Wetland Loss Density Soil Erodibility  Pass  0.30 value per acre  Fail  NOTE: The soil erodibility indicator accounts for natural soil conditions but not for management of the land. The naturally erodible soils of the Middle Chester River watershed are addressed by techniques called Best Management Practices (BMPs) to prevent soil loss that are typically in use on local farms. BMPs like no-till, reduced till, cover crops, field strips, and others significantly reduce erosion and sediment movement. These BMPs can be seen in use in many places in the watershed. See Interpreting Landscape Indicators for additional information.  20   Interpreting Landscape Indicators Page 1 of 2 Impervious Surface. Reduction of impervious area can be a valuable component of a successful Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). Roads, parking areas, roofs and other human constructions are collectively called impervious surface. Impervious surface blocks the natural seepage of rain into the ground. Unlike many natural surfaces, impervious surface typically concentrates stormwater runoff, accelerates flow rates and directs stormwater to the nearest stream. Side-effects of impervious surfaces become increasingly significant as the percentage of impervious area increases. Examples include reduction of groundwater infiltration, soil and stream bank erosion, sedimentation, destabilization or loss of aquatic habitat, and ""flashy"" stream flows (reduced flow between storms and excessive flows associated with storms.) Population Density. While population density may be beyond the scope of a WRAS, directing growth is a potential WRAS component. Humans are usually very successful in competing for use of land and water. As human population increases, effects of human activity tend to degrade, displace or eliminate natural habitat. Watersheds with higher populations, assuming other factors are equal, tend to exhibit greater impacts on waterways and habitat. However, growth can be directed in ways to reduce negative impacts. Historic Wetland Loss Density. About 43% of the Middle Chester River watershed is hydric soil (about 13,000 out of 31,000 acres). The historic wetland loss estimate is based on the assumption that the hydric soils were all, at one time, wetlands. Thoughtful selective restoration of historic wetland areas can be an effective WRAS component. In most of Maryland's watersheds, extensive wetland areas have been converted to other uses by draining and filling. This conversion unavoidably reduces or eliminates the natural functions that wetlands provide. These functions include habitat and nursery areas for many aquatic organisms, flood attenuation, and uptake and redistribution of nutrients, etc. In general, watersheds exhibiting greater wetland loss tend to also exhibit greater loss of the beneficial functions that wetlands provide. Strategic replacement of wetlands can significantly improve natural function in local watershed areas.  21   Interpreting Landscape Indicators Page 2 of 2 Unforested Stream Buffers. DNR recommends that forested buffer 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream, is typically necessary to promote high quality aquatic habitat and diverse aquatic populations. Replacement of natural vegetation adjacent to streams can be a valuable and relatively inexpensive WRAS element. In most of Maryland, trees are key to healthy natural streams. They provide numerous essential habitat functions: shade to keep water temperatures down in warm months, leaf litter ""food"" for aquatic organisms, roots to stabilize stream banks, vegetative cover for wildlife, etc. In general, reduction or loss of riparian trees / stream buffers degrades stream habitat while replacement of trees / natural buffers enhances stream habitat. (For this indicator only ""blue line streams"" were included. Intermittent streams were not considered.) Soil Erodibility. A finding of 0.30 means that the Middle Chester River watershed has ""high"" soil erodibility considering soils types, steep slopes and the extent of crop land within 1000 feet of waterways. (Existing crop land management was not considered.) Watersheds with more highly erodible soils are naturally more susceptible to surface erosion, sedimentation, streambank erosion and other problems related to soil movement. These negative effects of soil erodibility on water quality can be minimized through careful management. A WRAS can reasonably promote a reduction in disturbance of erodible soils and/or effective soil conservation practices like planting stream buffers.  22   Land Use 1997 The following table and pie chart summarize 1997 land use for the Kent County portion of the Middle Chester River Watershed. Viewing these land uses as potential nonpoint sources of nutrients, agricultural lands are likely to dominate loads to local waterways. Map 6 1997 Generalized Land Use Map shows the distribution of lands in the watershed. Additional details on land use in the Middle Chester River watershed are prodived in the Land Use Technical Report.  1997 Land Use Middle Chester River Watershed (Kent) Forest (14.43%) Wetlands (1.71%) Urban (8.31%)  Agriculture (75.54%)  1997 Land Use Middle Chester River Watershed in Kent County Category Agriculture Forest Urban Wetlands Other Description Field, Pasture, Ag buildings All woodlands and brush All developed areas Tidal marsh, Emergent wetlands Extractive and bare ground (not graphed) Acres 22,360 4,272 2,461 506 26 29625  Watershed Total (excluding open water)  23   Land Use Projection to 2020 The Maryland Department of Planning is projecting planning estimates for population and related factors like land use to the year 2020. Based on work completed as of October 2000, the 2020 land use estimates are shown in the pie chart and in the table below. 17 Several 2020 projections are potentially important for WRAS planning in the Kent County portion of the Middle Chester River watershed as listed on the next page:  2020 Projected Land Use Middle Chester River Watershed (Kent) Forest (14.21%) Wetlands (1.71%) Urban (9.73%)  Agriculture (74.35%)  Projected Change in Land Use 1997 to 2020 Middle Chester River Watershed in Kent County Category Agriculture Forest Urban Wetlands Other Description Field, Pasture, Ag buildings All woodlands and brush All developed areas Tidal marsh, Emergent wetlands Extractive and bare ground Acres - 356 - 67 423 no change no change  24    Urban land use is projected to increase 17% while agriculture and forest lands are projected to decrease about 1.5% each. The projected continuing loss of prime agricultural land is of particular concern.  Percentage of households served by septic system are projected to increase from 31% to 39%.  Impervious cover is projected to increase in the Radcliffe Creek subwatershed (0411) from 10% to 11%. The subwatershed encompassing the remainder of Chestertown (0413) is projected to increase from 12% to 13%. Increasing imperviousness is known to increase stress on aquatic organisms.  Kent County Department of Planning indicates that several factors may also affect land use change over the next twenty years. 22 1) Wet soil conditions tend to be prevalent in forested areas in the Middle Chester River watershed. This local condition may prevent conversion of some forested areas to urban use because new structures in rural areas will require on-site sewage treatment (passing soil percolation tests). Therefore, the County feels that additional pressure for development may be seen on agricultural lands that perk and potentially less pressure on wet forested land than the land use projection model suggests. (For more information on this issue, see Map 11 Wetlands, the wetlands section and hydric soils shown in Map 21 Wetland Restoration Opportunities.) 2) County-wide, forest land acreage has been increasing partially due to requirements of the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area. These factors may affect the Middle Chester area. These projections suggest an overall trend toward increasing stress on natural systems in the watershed and particularly on aquatic life. In light of these projections, Middle Chester watershed planning could consider potential WRAS elements to help counterbalance the anticipated trends. Potential WRAS initiatives could relate to smart growth, agricultural land preservation, stream / natural area enhancement or protection, etc. The Land Use Technical Report has additional details.  25    Green Infrastructure An additional way to interpret land use / land cover information is to identify ""Green Infrastructure."" In the GIS application developed by Maryland DNR and its partners, Green Infrastructure refers to areas of natural vegetation and habitat that have statewide or regional importance as defined by criteria developed by DNR. The criteria for identifying of lands as Green Infrastructure is limited to considering natural resource attributes currently found on those lands. One example of the criteria is that interior forest and wetlands complexes at least 250 acres in size are considered as part of Green Infrastructure. As a second example, sensitive species habitat that is located within areas of natural vegetation at least 100 acres in size is also counted as Green Infrastructure. Other potential attributes of Green Infrastructure lands, such as ownership or if the current natural conditions are protected in some way, are not criteria for Green Infrastructure but they may be considered independently. Within the Green Infrastructure network, large blocks of natural areas are called hubs, and the existing or potential connections between them, called links or corridors. Together the hubs and corridors form the Green Infrastructure network which can be considered the backbone of the region's natural environment.6 Protection of Green Infrastructure lands may be addressed through various existing programs including Rural Legacy, Program Open Space, conservation easements and others. The 2001 Maryland General Assembly approved $35 million for the Green Print program which is targeted primarily to protecting Green Infrastructure areas. This new funding category will be administered by Program Open Space. Based on results so far from the Chino Farms Project in Queen Anne's County, Kent County representatives have expressed interest in potential use of the Green Infrastructure concept. Map 7 Green Infrastructure shows several significant local characteristics of Green Infrastructure:  The great majority of Kent County is in active agriculture or urban use and is therefore not identified as part of the Green Infrastructure. Other lands that may be areas of natural vegetation are not identified on the Green Infrastructure maps because they are too small to be considered of State or regional importance. However, some of these areas may be locally significant components of Green Infrastructure that should be identified for local consideration in the WRAS.  Most Green Infrastructure in Kent County is associated with water and wetlands. For example, the largest Green Infrastructure Hub in the Middle Chester River watershed, along Morgan Creek, is mostly emergent wetlands and forest associated with wetlands and hydric soil.  The corridors shown on the Green Infrastructure Map can be considered as existing or potential connections between Green Infrastructure hubs. Significant portions of the mapped corridors are in agricultural use. The large areas that lack natural vegetation tend to limit the corridor's contribution to the Green Infrastructure network. The Middle Chester WRAS could potentially assess enhancement, expansion, or protection of the Green Infrastructure hubs and corridors. 27    Natural Resource Areas at the Watershed Scale The Green Infrastructure scenario described here, due to its Statewide or regional focus, may not identify natural resource areas that are locally significant. It is reasonable to employ GIS information at the watershed scale to help identify natural areas of potential local significance. Map 8 Natural Resource Areas of Potential Local Significance suggests numerous areas that may have local natural resource importance. This GIS map (and similar scenarios) can be used to assist in prioritizing areas for further assessment and to help clarify local interests and needs for locally important natural resource areas.  29    Protected Lands As used in the context of watershed restoration, ""protected land"" includes any land with some form of long term limitation on conversion to urban / developed land use. This protection may be in various forms: public ownership for natural resource or recreational intent, private ownership where a third party acquired the development rights or otherwise acquired the right to limit use through the purchase of an easement, etc. The extent of ""protection"" varies greatly from one circumstance to the next. Therefore, for some protected land, it may be necessary to explore the details of land protection parcel by parcel through the local land records office to determine the true extent of protection. For purposes of watershed restoration, a knowledge of existing protected lands can provide a starting point in prioritizing potential restoration activities. In some cases, protected lands may provide opportunities for restoration projects because owners of these lands may value natural resource protection or enhancement goals. The following listing and Map 9 Protected Land and Smart Growth summarize the status of protected lands in the Middle Chester River watershed.  Most land in the watershed is privately owned. Promoting opportunities available for private land owners to protect rural, agricultural and similar land values may be valuable in the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. In preliminary discussions between County and DNR representatives, communicating opportunities for agricultural easements was raised as an interest.  Local / County parks are concentrated in one large area at the northwest edge of the watershed or are small parcels geared to local recreational interests around Chestertown.  DNR land is limited to a small acreage at the Urieville Community Lake.  Land protected with the intent of continued agricultural use is concentrated on several farms northeast of Chestertown.  Conservation easements are concentrated in two areas south and west of Chestertown. In drafting the WRAS for the Middle Chester River in Kent County, existing protected lands could be assessed as potential contributors to WRAS implementation. Various types of opportunities could be explored:  Potential sites for implementation projects and/or demonstration projects  Opportunities for management enhancement or additional protection  Opportunities for expanding protection from currently protected land to adjacent parcels.  31   Smart Growth Within Maryland's Smart Growth program, there are two targeting programs that should be considered as potential watershed restoration projects are considered. In Rural Legacy Areas, protection of land from future development through purchase of easements (or in fee simple) is promoted. In Primary Funding Areas, State funding for infrastructure may be available to support development and redevelopment. Both are shown in Map 9 Protected Land and Smart Growth: - Rural Legacy Areas in the Middle Chester. Two small areas at the edge of the Middle Chester watershed up stream of Urieville Lake are part of a much larger Rural Legacy Area immediately outside of the watershed to the north. Expansion of protected land through this program could be incorporated as a component of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. - Priority Funding Areas in the Middle Chester. About six areas in the Middle Chester watershed are designated Priority Funding Areas. The majority of the acreage is concentrated in and around Chestertown and Worton. In Priority Funding Areas, new development and/or redevelopment may be anticipated. Planning for watershed restoration projects in Priority Funding Areas, or downstream of them, needs to account for potential changing conditions during the life of the project. For example, increasing impervious area may alter stormwater conditions that a watershed restoration project will have to adequately address.  32    Soils of the Middle Chester River Watershed 1. Interpreting Local Conditions with Natural Soil Groups Soil conditions, like soil type and moisture conditions, greatly affect how land may be used and the potential for vegetation and habitat on the land. Soil conditions are one determining factor for water quality in streams and rivers. Local soil conditions vary greatly from site to site as published information in the Soil Survey for Kent County shows. This complicated information can be effectively summarized using Natural Soil Groups to help identify useful generalizations about groups of soils. Natural Soils Groups In Map 10 Soils and the pie chart, prime Middle Chester (Kent Co.) farmland is depicted in yellow or yellow with crosshatching. Over 75% of the Middle Chester (0.53%) River Watershed in Kent County is prime (11.65%) (0.66%) farmland. (7.08%) The green and bluegreen areas are soils (2.37%) with wetness conditions that limit their (1.24%) (48.47%) agricultural or development potential. These soils are concentrated along the Middle Chester River and its tributaries Morgan Creek and (27.73%) Radcliffe Creek. Nearly 20% of the watershed (0.27%) exhibit wetness-related limitations. Also concentrated along local waterways are soils on slopes between 8% to 15% and soils that are excessively well drained. 2. Soils and Watershed Planning Local soil conditions can be a useful element in watershed planning and for targeting restoration projects. Soils with limitations related to wetness or slope naturally inhibit active use for farming or development. Land owners in the watershed have tended to leave many of these areas in natural vegetation or other low intensity use. By comparing Map 10 Soils with the three preceding maps listed below, it is apparent marginal soils and current areas of natural habitat tend to coincide:  Map 6 1997 General Land Use  Map 7 Green Infrastructure  Map 8 Natural Resource Areas of Potential Local Significance Natural Soils Groups or similar soils assessment techniques can be used to help identify potential areas for restoration projects or habitat protection. Once areas of interest are targeted and land owner interest is verified, additional detailed soil assessment is an essential step in identifying viable restoration project sites.  34    Wetlands 1. Introduction to Wetland Categories 26 The Eastern Coastal Plain Province likely has the highest diversity of emergent estuarine and palustrine wetland communities relative to other Maryland physiographic regions because both tidal and nontidal freshwater marshes occur here. Wetlands are most abundant in the Coastal Plain due to the low topographic relief and high groundwater table characteristic of the region. Estuarine Wetlands. Estuarine wetlands are abundant throughout the Coastal Plain. These systems consist of salt and brackish tidal waters and contiguous wetlands where ocean water is at least occasionally diluted by freshwater runoff from the land. These wetlands may extend far upstream in tidal rivers to freshwater areas. Differences in salinity and tidal flooding within estuaries have a significant effect on the distribution of these wetland systems. Salt marshes occur on the intertidal shores of tidal waters in areas of high salinity. Brackish marshes are the predominant estuarine wetland type in Maryland. They are found along the shores of Chesapeake Bay, mostly on the Eastern Shore, and for considerable distance upstream in coastal rivers. Estuarine shrub swamps are common along the Maryland coastal zone. Aquatic beds, comprised mostly of submerged aquatic vegetation, are abundant in shallow water zones of Maryland's estuaries, especially Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Palustrine wetlands. Forested wetlands are the most abundant and widely distributed palustrine wetland type on the Coastal Plain. These wetlands are found on floodplains along the freshwater tidal and nontidal portions of rivers and streams, in upland depressions, and in broad flat areas between otherwise distinct watersheds. Tidal freshwater swamps occur along coastal rivers in areas subject to tidal influence. Scrub-shrub swamps are not abundant on the Eastern Shore but are represented in the Middle Chester River watershed. Emergent wetlands on the Coastal Plain are characterized by a wide range of vegetation, depending on water regime. (Adapted from Wetlands of Maryland, Tiner and Burke, 1995.)  36   2. Tracking Wetlands 26 Oversight of activities affecting wetlands involves several regulatory jurisdictions. The Maryland Dept. of the Environment (MDE) is the lead agency for the State and cooperates with DNR, the Army Corps of Engineers and other Federal and local agencies. As part of its responsibility, MDE tracks State permitting and the net gain or loss of wetlands over time. As the Wetlands Regulatory Status table shows, changes tracked in the State regulatory program have been minor in the Middle Chester River watershed.  Tracking Nontidal Wetland Change Middle Chester River Watershed Permits Authorized = 3 Letters of Authorization Issued = 11 Wetland Class Acres Permanent Impacts -0.36 Mitigation by Permittee 0 Other Gains (Regulatory) 8.69 Programmatic Gains 0 Net Gain/Loss 8.33 Note: Regulatory tracking for authorized nontidal wetland losses began in 1991.

Interpreting Wetland Distribution Wetlands in the Middle Chester River watershed tend to occur along waterways as shown in Map 11 Wetlands. In comparing the wetlands map to Map 6 1997 Generalized Land Use, it can be seen that much of the forested land in the watershed is found in association with wetlands or adjacent to them. A comparison of the two maps shows that Wetland Acreage Summary many of the nontidal Middle Chester River Watershed 26 wetland areas are Wetland Class Acres depicted as forest on the Estuarine, Intertidal (E2) aquatic bed 0 land use map.

See the Sensitive Species Section for discussion. significant for watershed management. From a land use perspective, 506 acres of wetlands are identified by the Maryland Department of Planning. From a habitat / regulatory perspective, there are approximately 16,816 acres of wetlands in the watershed. In the context of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS), wetlands serve valuable water quality and habitat functions that may not be provided by other land uses. Therefore, protection and enhancement of existing wetlands, and restoration of past wetland areas, can be a valuable element in the WRAS. (Also see the Wetland Restoration section.)  38    LIVING RESOURCES AND HABITAT  Overview Living resources, including all the animals, plants and other organisms that call the land and waters of the Middle Chester River watershed home, are being affected by human activity. The information summarized here suggests that some of the significant stresses on living resources in the watershed are manipulation of habitat, excessive movement of sediment and excessive availability of nutrients. The Living Resource information summarized here should be considered a partial representation because numerous areas of potential interest or concern could not be included due to lack of information, time, etc. For example, information on many forms of aquatic life, woodland communities, terrestrial habitats, etc. should be considered as watershed restoration decisions are being made. Therefore, it is recommended that stakeholders in the watershed identify important living resource issues or priorities so that additional effort can be focused where it is most needed. New information should be added or referenced as it becomes available.  40   Living Resource Indicators Aquatic organisms are sensitive, in varying degrees, to changes in water quality and aquatic habitat. This association offers two perspectives that are important for watershed restoration. First, improvements for living resources offer potential goals, objectives and opportunities to gauge progress in watershed restoration. Second, the status of selected species can be used as to gauge local conditions for water quality, habitat, etc. This second perspective is the basis for using living resources as an ""indicator."" The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan published in 1998 listed the following living resource indicators for the Middle Chester River Watershed.3 Compared to other watersheds in Maryland, the Middle Chester watershed exhibits poor conditions for submerged aquatic vegetation and for bottomdwelling organisms in nontidal streams. Living Resource Indicator SAV Abundance Index SAV Habitat Index Non-Tidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity Non-Tidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity Score 1.00 3.00 3.59 Rank Fail Fail Fail Bench Mark (percent based on 138 watersheds) Scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best) Score of 1 yields a rank of ""fail"" Scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best) Score less than 7 yields a rank of ""fail"" Scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best) Score less than 6 yields a rank of ""fail"" Streams scoring less than 6 were designated Category 1 watersheds in need of restoration. Streams scoring greater than or equal to 8 were designated Category 3 watersheds in need of protection. Scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best) Of 138 watersheds in Maryland, the 34 (25%) with the lowest nontidal in-stream habitat index received a rank of ""fail"" and were designated as Category 1 watersheds in need of restoration. The top 34 (25%) were designated as Category 3 watersheds in need of protection.  7.50  Pass  Non-Tidal In-stream Habitat Index  3.89  Pass  Also see Interpreting Living Resource Indicators.  41   Interpreting Living Resource Indicators General. Several of these indices rely on index rankings generated from a limited number of sampling sites which were then generalized to represent entire watersheds. Considering this limitation on field data, it may be beneficial to conduct additional assessments to provide a more complete understanding of local conditions as part of the WRAS: SAV Abundance Index. The Finding of ""1.0"" means that SAV in 1996 covered 10% or less of the potential SAV habitat. This index allows comparison of watersheds based on the Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV) actual/potential SAV area. To generate the number under Finding, the watershed area covered by SAV in a single year is measured using aerial survey data. The year used here was 1996. The potential SAV area, as determined by water depth, physical characteristics and historic occurrence of SAV, includes water area up to two feet deep. (This is the Tier III SAV restoration goal.) SAV Habitat Index. An index less than 7 means that, based on available data from 1994 through 1996, habitat conditions for SAV are less than favorable. This index allows comparison of watersheds based on how well SAV habitat requirements are attained. To create this index, five measurements of habitat conditions are considered (secchi depth, dissolved inorganic nitrogen where applicable, dissolved inorganic phosphorus, Chorophyll a and total suspended solids.) Non-Tidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity. This index allows comparison of streams based on the populations of bottom-dwelling ""bugs"" (benthic macroinvertebrate organisms) found in the stream. For coastal plain streams, this index employs seven measurements of these populations which is translated into a rank for each sampling site. An index less than 6 indicates that benthic organisms are significantly stressed by local conditions. Non-Tidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity. An index less than 6 indicates that improvements would be beneficial to fish populations. This index allows comparison of selected streams (first through third order nontidal streams) based on fish community health. In each sampling site where fish are surveyed, the makeup of the overall fish population is measured in nine distinct ways such as the number of native species, number of benthic fish species, percent of individuals that are ""tolerant"" species, etc. These nine scores are then integrated to generate an index ranking for the survey site. An index of 8 or greater indicates conditions favorable for fish. Non-Tidal In-Stream Habitat Index. This index allows comparison of streams based fish and benthic habitat as measured by in-stream and riparian conditions. For each stream site that was assessed, visual field observations are used to score the site for substrate type, habitat features, bank conditions, riparian vegetation width, remoteness, aesthetic value, etc. These scores are then integrated to generate a single rank for each stream site.  42   Fish 1. Tidal Areas Sampling at ten stations in the Chester River was conducted monthly from July through September for the years 1995 through 2000. Findings from at least four to six of these stations will be relevant to the Middle Chester River watershed. The locations of these stations are shown on Map 4 Monitoring Stations. Sampling was accomplished using beach seines and trawls. Results of this effort will be reported in the DNR Chester River Study anticipated to be available in Winter 2001. 19 2. Nontidal Areas In 1995, two sites were sampled during a Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) project on two nontidal streams that flow into the Urieville Community Lake. For these two sampling sites, the Fish Index of Biotic Integrity was considered ""fair"" for the Unnamed Fish Species Upstream of Urieville Lake, 1995 Tributary and ""good"" for the Upper Left Unnamed Upper Left Fork. 4 Also see Map 4 Monitoring Species Tributary Fork Stations for the approximate site locations. least brook lamprey X The two tributaries to Urieville American eel X X Community Lake described here are eastern mud minnow X X only a partial representation of Middle Chester watershed conditions. golden minnow X Availability of additional information in creek chubsucker X X the DNR fisheries database has not been confirmed at this time.

Benthos are sometimes called ""stream bugs"" though that name overly simplifies the diverse membership of this group. Unimpaired natural streams may support a great diversity of species ranging from bacteria and algae to invertebrates like crayfish and insects to fish, reptiles and mammals. Benthic macroinvertebrates, collectively called benthos, are an important component of a stream's ecosystem. This group includes mayflies, caddisflies, crayfish, etc. that inhabit the stream bottom, its sediments, organic debris and live on plant life (macrophytes) within the stream. The food web in streams relies significantly on benthos. Benthos are often the most abundant source of food for fish and other small animals. Many benthic macroinvertebrates live on decomposing leaves and other organic materials in the stream. By this activity, these organisms are significant processors of organic materials in the stream. Benthos often provide the primary means that nutrients from organic debris are transformed to other biologically usable forms. These nutrients become available again and are transported downstream where other organisms use them. Benthos are a valuable tool for stream evaluation. This group of species has been extensively evaluated for use in water quality assessment, in evaluating biological conditions of streams and in gauging influences on streams by surrounding lands. Benthos serve as good indicators of water resource integrity because they are fairly sedentary in nature and their diversity offers numerous ways to interpret conditions. They have different sensitivities to changing conditions. They have a wide range of functions in the stream. They use different life cycle strategies for survival.  44   1. Benthos in Nontidal Streams The most recent assessment of ""bugs"" living in streams (benthic macroinvertebrates or benthos) in Middle Chester River stream was conducted in early 2001 by the DNR Watershed Restoration Division. It is anticipated that results will be available in June 2001. Additional monitoring by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) is scheduled for the Chester River Basin to assess the instream aquatic community and habitat conditions in 2002 (10 sites) and in 2003 (10 sites.) 10 In the 1990s, living resources including benthos were assessed at four Middle Chester River watershed sites shown in Map 4 Monitoring Stations. In 1995, the first round of the MBSS included two sites in the Middle Chester River watershed. This assessment addressed the in-stream aquatic community and habitat conditions summarized in the 1995 MBSS Findings Table . The living resources and habitat at the two sites are significantly different even though both sites are in close proximity to each other upstream of Urieville Lake. In 1992 and 1993, benthic organisms and their habitat were assessed at numerous sites in the Chester River basin. 21 One site was on Radcliffe Creek near the Route 20 crossing. Habitat quality there was ranked as the worst of the 25 sites assessed in the Chester River Basin and it was categorized as ""non-supporting"" of benthos. However, assessment of the Radcliffe Creek / Route 20 site based on the benthic macroinvertebrate community found the site to be ""moderately impaired."" Recommendations that accompanied these findings suggested that elevated nitrogen concentrations may have been a contributing factor in promoting benthos community conditions despite poor habitat conditions. The second Middle Chester site was on Morgan Creek near the Perkins Hill Road crossing. Habitat quality and habitat condition were ranked as ""partially supporting"" benthos. This finding is better than the Radcliffe Creek site but it is still impaired. The assessment of the Morgan Creek / Perkins Hill Road site based on the benthic macroinvertebrate community found the site to be ""moderately impaired,"" comparable to that found at Radcliffe Creek. 2. Benthos in Tidal Areas Sampling of benthic (bottom dwelling) organisms was conducted in the Chester River between 1995 and 1998. In 1995 and 1996, samples were collected at ten mainstem stations as shown in Map 4 Monitoring Stations. In 1997 and 1998, samples were collected at 30 stations. Results of this effort will be reported in the DNR Chester River Study anticipated to be available in Winter 2001. 19  45   1995 MBSS Findings * Middle Chester River Watershed In Kent County Station # KE-...-95 N-128-122 N-018-216 Stream Location Upstream of Ur Upstream of Ur Fish Score 4.0 3 Description Ranges from 1.0 (worst) to 5.0 (best) Ranges from 1.0 (worst) to 5.0 (best) Range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) Condition Good Fair Benthos Score 1.57 3 Condition Very Poor Fair Physical Habitat Score 24.67 66.87 Condition Poor Fair  Index Used In 1995 MBSS Fish Index of Biotic Integrity Benthic Index Biotic Integrity Physical Habitat Index *       Additional details are available at www.dnr.state.md.us .

Historic information gathered in a survey conducted between 1906 to 1912 indicates that oyster beds were once located in areas farther upstream than their current locations but none were so far upstream as the Middle Chester.16  Sensitive Species Sensitive species are most widely known in the form of Federally-listed Endangered or Threatened animals such as the bald eagle. In addition to these charismatic rare animals, both US EPA and Maryland DNR work through their respective Federal and State programs to protect numerous endangered, threatened, or rare species of plants, animals and ecological communities of those species. For the purposes of watershed restoration, it is valuable to account for known locations of habitat for these species. These places are often indicators, and sometimes important constituents, of the network of natural areas or ""green infrastructure"" that are the foundation for many essential natural watershed processes. Protecting these species and/or promoting expansion of their habitats can be an effective foundation for a watershed restoration program.  47   1. Habitat Protection Categories One way to characterize a watershed for sensitive species is to identify known habitat locations using several broad categories employed by DNR's Wildlife and Heritage Division. These categories are described in the text box Maryland's Sensitive Species Protection Categories. More details and guidance can be requested from Division staff. Two of the three categories used to help protect sensitive species during review of applications for a State permit or approval or involve State funds are found in the Middle Chester River Watershed as shown in Map 12 Sensitive Species. For projects potentially affecting these areas, the State permit or approval will include recommendations and/or requirements to protect sensitive species and their habitat. In addition, many counties have incorporated safeguards for these areas into their permit review process. These categories do not place requirements on any activities that do not require a permit/approval or do not involve State funds. However, there are State and Federal restrictions that address ""takings"" of protected species that apply more broadly. In addition, property owners are encouraged to seek advice on protecting the sensitive species / habitat within their ownership. 2. Morgan Creek Wetlands of Special State Concern The Morgan Creek Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) is a diverse swamp forest containing dense alder thickets and emergent marshes, bordered by an upland mixed hardwood-pine forest. A population of rare plant species classified as ""State Rare"" grows in the creek banks of this swamp forest. 24 This 75-acre WSSC is shown in Map 12 Sensitive Species. 3. Rare Fish and Mussels DNR recently initiated a project to rank watersheds across Maryland to aid in targeting conservation and restoration efforts to benefit known populations of rare fish and mussels. In comparison to the more than 1000 small (12-digit) watersheds identified by DNR in Maryland, several of the 12-digit sub-watersheds in Kent County's Middle Chester River watershed ranked ""moderately high"" and the remainder ranked ""neutral."" The Sensitive Species Map shows the distribution of the ranking. Map 12 Sensitive Species shows the rare fish and mussels ranking. In general, higher ranking suggests that restoration or conservation projects in these areas may have greater potential to protect aquatic species diversity. Projects could be used to protect, enhance or expand existing aquatic habitat. A ranking of neutral indicates that information is insufficient (rather than these species are absent or that the area is low priority.) Neutral areas upstream of higher ranked areas are potentially important because they affect rare fish and mussel populations located downstream. In neutral ranked areas, it is reasonable to rely on other available criteria for targeting watershed conservation and restoration projects. This ranking considers information from 1970 to 1997 only for rare species of fish or mussels being tracked in Maryland. Four possible ranks were used for this project: Very High, High, Moderately High and Neutral. Each rare species being tracked contributed to this ranking based on two types of criteria: 1) presence or absence, and 2) if present, weighting relative rarity on worldwide and Statewide scales. 48   Maryland's Sensitive Species Protection Categories Sensitive Species Project Review Area (SSPRA) At least five SSPRAs are identified in the Middle Chester River watershed. Each SSPRA contains one or more sensitive species habitats. However, the entire SSPRA is not considered sensitive habitat. The SSPRA is an envelop identified for review purposes to help ensure that applications for permit or approval in or near sensitive areas receive adequate attention and safeguards for the sensitive species / habitat they contain. At least one SSPRA compasses each NHA and WSSC. Also see Map 12 Sensitive Species. Natural Heritage Area (NHA) Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) One WSSC is designated in the Middle Chester River watershed -- the Morgan Creek Wetlands. These wetlands are associated with one or more sensitive species habitats that are in or near the wetland. For any proposed project that requires a wetland permit, these selected wetlands have additional regulatory requirements beyond the permitting requirements that apply to wetlands generally. For a listing of designated sites see COMAR 26.23.06.01 at www.dsd.state.md.us  No NHAs are located in the Middle Chester River watershed. NHAs are rare ecological communities that encompass sensitive species habitat. They are designated in State regulation COMAR 08.03.08.10. For any proposed project that requires a State permit or approval that may affect an NHA, recommendations and/or requirements are placed in the permit or approval that are specifically aimed at protecting the NHA.  49    Submerged Aquatic Vegetation  8  The well-defined link between water quality and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) distribution/abundance make SAV communities good barometers of the health of estuarine ecosystems. SAV is important not only as an indicator of water quality, but it is also a critical nursery habitat for many estuarine species. For example, blue crab ""post-larvae"" are up to 30 times more abundant in SAV beds than adjacent unvegetated areas. Additionally, several species of waterfowl depend on SAV for food when they over-winter in the Chesapeake region. 1. Criteria for Tracking SAV The Chesapeake Bay Program has developed new criteria for determining SAV habitat suitability of an area based on water quality. The measurement called ""Percent Light at Leaf"" assesses the amount of available light reaching the leaf surface of SAV after being reduced in the water column and by epiphytic growth on the leaves themselves. The document describing this new model measuring SAV habitat suitability is found on the Chesapeake Bay Program website (www.chesapeakebay.net/pubs/sav/index.html). The older ""Habitat Requirements"" of five water quality parameters are still used for diagnostic purposes. Re-establishment of SAV is measured against the ""Tier 1 Goal"", an effort to restore SAV to any areas known to contain SAV from 1971 to 1990. (Also see the Executive Summary SAV Requirements for additional information.) 2. Middle Chester SAV Status According to at least one time-time local resident, SAV beds did occur in the vicinity of Chestertown in the 1950s and/or 1960s.29 Since 1979 when the Chesapeake Bay-wide aerial mapping program began, SAV has never been sighted by in the Middle Chester River or other tidal fresh and low salinity (oligohaline) areas of the Chester River. However, this area has never been ground-truthed to determine if SAV beds too small to be seen in the aerial photographs may be undetected. To due the absence of SAV, a Tier 1 Goal for SAV restoration has not been established for this portion of Chester River. (Also see www.vims.edu/bio/sav/ for extensive information or www.mdmerlin.net for annual distribution maps 1984 through 1996). 3. Comparing the Middle Chester to Nearby Areas A comparison of SAV in the Middle Chester River watershed to other nearby areas is shown in Map 13 SAV Habitat Requirement Status and Map 14 SAV Distribution. Water quality data for the low salinity (oligohaline) region including much of the Middle Chester River has not been available. Up stream of the Middle Chester, data for the tidal fresh area near Route 290 Crumpton Road (monitoring station ET4.1) indicate that only phosphorous levels meet the SAV habitat requirements, while four other criteria fail: percent light at leaf, light attenuation, suspended solids and algae concentrations. ( Nitrogen is not applicable in low salinity areas.) Down stream of the Middle Chester River, in the moderate salinity (mesohaline) portion of Chester River, SAV coverage has been highly variable since 1984, ranging from a low of 80 acres in 51   1990 to a high of 1,181 acres in 1998 (www.vims.edu/bio/sav/). The 1999 coverage was 736 acres or 20% of the Tier I goal (3,751 acres). On the Kent County side of the river, SAV beds fringe much of Langford, Greys Inn, and Church Creeks, and Eastern Neck Narrows and many of the coves around Eastern Neck Island. On the Queen Anne's County side, the largest beds are found from Macum Creek (Kent Island) extending up to and including Queenstown Creek. Ground-truthing by citizens (and the Chester River Association) and staff from Maryland DNR, Patuxent River Wildlife Center, U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Environmental Protection Agency has found, in order of most frequently reported, redhead grass, milfoil, elodea, widgeon grass, sago pondweed, horned pondweed, wild celery and naiads. Water quality monitoring data from the station located between the southern tip of Eastern Neck Island and Kent Narrows indicate that percent light at leaf, suspended solids and phosphorous level meet the SAV habitat requirements, while light attenuation and levels of nitrogen and algae are borderline. 4. SAV Restoration Potential 26 For a comparison of the Middle Chester to all other tidal segments in the Chesapeake Bay see the technical report Executive Summary SAV Requirements. The last page includes a map indicating that the Middle Chester area (oligohaline portion of the Chester River), ranked the worst compared to other segments based on failure to meet SAV requirements during the period 1992 to 1997. This finding suggests that water quality improvements are necessary in the Middle Chester mainstem to allow for eventual restoration of SAV.  52     RESTORATION TARGETING TOOLS 2000/2001 Stream Corridor Assessment Using the Stream Corridor Assessment Methodology (SCAM) developed and applied by the DNR Watershed Restoration Division, valuable information can be compiled to assist in targeting restoration activities. In partnership with Kent County, DNR is conducting a Stream Corridor Assessment in the Middle Chester River watershed during Winter 2000/2001. Trained teams from the Maryland Conservation Corps will walk along streams to identify and document potential problems and restoration opportunities such as the items listed below: Stream Corridor Assessment Data Collection Categories Pipe Outfalls Pond Sites Tree Blockages Inadequate Buffers Erosion Fish Blockages Exposed Pipe Unusual Conditions Trash Dumping In or Near Stream Construction  In preliminary discussions between County and DNR representatives, several interests for stream assessment were identified:  Potential priorities for stream assessment were for 1) Radcliffe Creek, 2) Morgan Creek and 3) other waterways in the Middle Chester River watershed.  Identifying stream blockages to fish movement  Identifying railroad drainage problems at stream crossings A stream corridor assessment report will be generated, including maps and photographs, to support targeting decisions for restoration projects. Draft data summaries are expected to be available in Summer 2001 with a final report by December 2001. The results of the stream corridor assessment will provide a valuable foundation for development of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy.  55   Agricultural Conservation Programs Kent County has one of the highest levels of conservation participation in the state. Farmers in the county willingly implement management systems that address nutrient runoff and infiltration, erosion and sediment control, and animal waste utilization. The Kent Soil and Water Conservation District (KSWCD) works with farmers and landowners in the development of Soil Conservation and Water Quality plans that recommend best management practices that will prevent nutrient and sediment impact on surface and ground water. Last year 54 plans were developed for 8,665 acres, 67 plans for 13,246 acres were revised, and 273 individual BMPs were installed. Some of the conservation practices installed were grassed waterways, riparian herbaceous and riparian forested buffers, conservation cover, cover crops, shallow water wildlife areas and grade stabilization structures. The Maryland Agricultural Cost-Share program (MACS), the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP and CREP) and the Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) are some of the state and federal programs promoted and administered by the Kent SWCD and NRCS. 28 Farmers in the watershed who are already using good management practices that benefit water quality could provide examples to promote adoption of similar practices by other farmers.  Clean Marinas Program Overboard discharges of sewage from boats are a concern for water quality because they contribute nutrients, biological oxygen demand, pathogens, etc. These discharges are preventable if a sufficient number of pumpout facilities are locally available and boat operators take advantage of these services. Three of the six marinas located in the Middle Chester River vicinity offer pumpout facilities as shown in Map 15 Fish Blockages and Marinas. None of these marinas is currently participating in Maryland's Clean Marina Program. The Clean Marinas Program is voluntary way for marina owners to demonstrate that their pumpout service and other high quality boating services provided in accordance with Program guidelines are helping keep local waters cleaner. Kent County representatives have expressed interest in exploring overboard discharge and clean marina related issues. One potential element of a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) is to encourage and/or support adding marina pumpout facilities serving the local area and increasing participation in the Clean Marina Program.  56   Fish Blockage Removal Many fish species need to move from one stream segment to the next in order to maintain healthy resilient populations. This is particularly true for anadromous fish species because they spawn and hatch from eggs in free flowing streams but live most of their lives in estuarine or ocean waters. Blockages in streams can inhibit or prevent many fish species from moving up stream to otherwise viable habitat. To help prioritize stream blockages for mitigation or removal, the DNR Fish Passage Program maintains a database of significant blockages to fish movement. A summary of blockages listed in the database for the Middle Chester River watershed appears in the Fish Blockages Table and Map 15 Fish Blockages and Marinas. Of the 24 blockages listed in Kent County's portion of the Middle Chester River watershed, none are known to have been corrected. The same is true of the four blockages listed in the Queen Anne's County portion of the watershed. The listings in this database should be considered as supporting information for initiating a thorough Stream Corridor Assessment. Based on experience in other watersheds, it is likely that an assessment would identify additional potential fish blockage problems. In general, removal of fish blockages is recommended if they would open a large stream segment containing high quality habitat with existing or potential return of significant fish populations. Most of the blockages on the map appear to be relatively near the headwaters of the streams they affect. However, several known blockages on the map that are relatively near the Chester River appear to be blocking significant stretches of stream. Based on this limited information, the following priority suggestions are offered for consideration:  High priority: For blockages nearest to the Chester River, perform stream corridor assessments to verify potential benefit of removal.  Mid Priority: For all other blockages, perform stream corridor assessments. Some blockages to fish movement may be structural components of farm ponds, drainage ditches, etc. If a blockage is found to be in this category, circumstances like requirements for drainage control function and public or land owner needs are considered in determining the potential for a restoration project.  57   Fish Blockages / Removal Opportunities in the Middle Chester River Watershed Page 1 0f 2 Radcliffe Creek and Other Subwatersheds Except Morgan Creek Station Radcliffe Creek CH028 CH085 CH086 CH087 CH084 CH089 CH090 CH018 CH036 CH088 CH091 Blockage Corrected Co KE KE KE KE KE KE KE QA QA QA QA Stream Radcliffe Creek Radcliffe Creek trib to Radcliffe Creek trib to Radcliffe Creek trib to Chester River trib to Chester River trib to Chester River Hambleton Creek Rosin Creek trib to Chester River trib to Rosin Creek below Mary Morris Road Route 289 0.4 miles below Route 291 Route 291 above Route 213 0.5 miles above Route 544 south of Route 213 at Truslow Road south of Round Top Road Name / Location below Mary Morris Road  Queen Annes County  Chester River  58   Fish Blockages / Removal Opportunities in the Middle Chester River Watershed Page 2 of 2 Morgan Creek Subwatershed Station CH024 CH025 CH092 CH093 CH094 CH095 CH096 CH097 CH098 CH100 CH101 CH102 CH103 CH104 CH105 CH106 CH107 Blockage Corrected Co KE KE KE KE KE KE KE KE KE KE KE KE KE KE KE KE KE Stream Morgan Creek Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek Southeast Creek trib to Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek trib to Morgan Creek Name / Location weir 1.0 mile above Perkins Hill Road 0.2 miles below Brownstown Blacks Rd 0.2 miles below Route 213 0.3 miles below Route 213 near Route 561 0.2 miles below Route 297 0.4 miles below Worton 0.2 miles east of Route 213 at Rt. 561 0.5 miles west of Perkins Hill Road RR crossing near headwaters 0.1 mile east of Route 448 0.3 mile east of Route 448 upstream of Perkins Hill Road below Kenndeyville Road below Kennedyville Road above Route 448  59    Stream Buffer Restoration 1. Benefits and General Recommendations Natural vegetation in stream riparian zones act as stream buffers that can provide numerous valuable environmental benefits:  Reducing surface runoff  Preventing erosion and sediment movement  Using nutrients for vegetative growth and moderating nutrient entry into the stream  Moderating temperature, particularly reducing warm season water temperature  Providing organic material (decomposing leaves) that are the foundation of natural food webs in stream systems  Providing overhead and in-stream cover and habitat  Promoting high quality aquatic habitat and diverse populations of aquatic species. To realize these environmental benefits, DNR generally recommends that forested stream buffers be at least 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream. Therefore, DNR is promoting this type of stream buffer for local jurisdictions and land owners who are willing to go beyond the minimum buffer standards. The DNR Watershed Restoration Division and other programs like CREP are available to assist land owners who volunteer to explore these opportunities.  2. Using GIS Identifying the areas that need buffers planted and prioritizing them for restoration is often a time-consuming and expensive project. Fortunately, use of a computerized Geographic Information System (GIS) to manipulate remote sensing data can help save limited time and funds. To assist in this technical endeavor, DNR Watershed Management and Analysis Division has developed GIS-based tools to assist in the buffer restoration targeting process. With these tools, GIS maps and other information can be generated to help select stream segments for additional Stream Corridor Assessment, to identify geographic areas for community and land owner contact and for similar uses. Then, with an appropriate level of on-the-ground verification or ""ground truthing,"" these GIS tools can provide an efficient first step toward stream buffer restoration. In preliminary discussion, Kent County Representatives expressed interest in exploring the potential for targeting available funds through several programs like CRP and CREP. One tool that could be used for this targeting is prioritization of stream buffer restoration. Several scenarios are presented here to help consider potential areas for stream buffer restoration. These scenarios can be used alone or in combination as models for targeting potential restoration sites for field verification. These maps are intended to demonstrate a methodology that can be used to locate sites having a high probability of optimizing certain ecological benefits of stream buffers. The resolution of the data used to generate these maps is not sufficient for an accurate site assessment, but can be used to identify potential candidate sites for more detailed investigation. The 61   streams presented in the maps are perennial (blue line) streams as generally shown on US Geological Survey Quadrangle Maps. Intermittent streams were not considered in the stream buffer scenario maps. 3. Headwater Stream Buffers Headwater streams are also called first order streams. These streams, unlike other streams (Second Order, etc.), intercept all of the surface runoff within the watersheds that they drain. In addition, for many watersheds, first order streams drain the majority of the land within the entire watershed. Therefore, stream buffers restored along headwater streams (First Order) tend to have greater potential to intercept nutrients and sediments than stream buffers placed elsewhere. In targeting stream buffer restoration projects, giving higher priority to headwater streams is one approach to optimizing nutrient and sediment retention. Restoring headwater stream buffers can also provide habitat benefits that can extend downstream of the project area. Forested headwater streams provide important organic material, like decomposing leaves, that ""feed"" the stream's food web. They also introduce woody debris which enhances in-stream physical habitat. The potential for riparian forest buffers to significantly influence stream temperature is greatest in headwater regions. These factors, in addition to positive water quality effects, are key to improving aquatic habitat. 4. Land Use and Stream Buffers One factor that affects the ability of stream buffers to intercept nonpoint source pollutants is adjacent land use. Nutrient and sediment loads from different land uses can vary significantly. By identifying land uses in riparian areas with inadequate Nonpoint Source Pollution Load Rates By Land Use stream buffers, like crop land Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model, in kg/ha-yr adjacent to streams, the potential to reduce nutrient and sediment Land Use Nitrogen Phosphorus Sediment loads can be improved. To assist Crop land 17.11 1.21 0.74 in finding areas with crop land Urban Impervious 8.43 0.58 0.00 adjacent to streams, the same Pervious 10.79 1.56 0.20 land use data shown in Map 6 1997 Generalized Land Use can Pasture 8.40 1.15 0.30 be filtered using GIS. The new Forest 1.42 0.00 0.03 scenario shown in Map 16 Land Use Scenario for Stream Buffer Restoration focuses on the land use within 150 feet of a stream. This view, supplemented with the land use pollution loading rates, suggests potential buffer restoration opportunities that could minimize nutrient and sediment loads. (Note: DNR is encouraging stream buffers 150 feet wide on each side of the stream, which is significantly greater than minimum buffer requirement, to enhance nutrient and habitat benefits beyond minimum buffer requirements.) 62   5. Nutrient Uptake from Hydric Soils in Stream Buffers In general, the nutrient nitrogen moves from the land into streams in surface water runoff and in groundwater. In watersheds like the Middle Chester River, a significant percentage of nitrogen enters streams in groundwater. Stream buffers can be used to capture nitrogen moving in groundwater if buffer restoration projects have several key attributes:  Plant with roots deep enough to intercept groundwater as it moves toward the stream  Plants with high nitrogen uptake capability, and  Targeting buffer restoration projects to maximize groundwater interception by buffer plants. Hydric soils in stream riparian areas can be used as one factor to help select stream buffer restoration sites. Siting buffer restoration on hydric soils would offer several benefits:  Plant roots are more likely to be in contact with groundwater for longer periods of time  Hydric soils tend to be marginal for many agricultural and urban land uses  Natural vegetation in wet areas often offer greater potential for habitat. Map 17 Nutrient Retention Using Hydric Soils Scenario identifies lands adjacent to streams that are composed hydric soil and also have insufficient stream buffers in the Middle Chester River watershed. To generate the map, hydric soils (Natural Soils Group of Maryland, MDP) were grouped into two classes and rated in terms of their potential to maximize groundwater/root zone interaction: poorly drained hydric soils (high nutrient retention efficiency), and moderately well drained hydric soils (moderately high nutrient retention efficiency). An important next step in using this information is verification of field conditions. Care must be taken during field validation to evaluate any hydrologic modification of these soils, such as ditching or draining activities, which would serve to decrease potential benefits. A refinement of the above scenario is shown in Map 18 Nutrient Retention Using Hydric Soils Associated With Cropland . The presentation in Map 18 is based on the same analysis as Map 17 except that only cropland is shown so that these areas are easier to see. 6. Wetland Associations Wetlands and adjacent natural uplands form complex habitats that offer a range of habitat opportunities for many species. These ""habitat complexes"" tend to offer greater species diversity and other ecological values that are greater than the values that the wetland or uplands could offer independently. Therefore, restoring stream buffers adjacent to or near existing wetlands tends to offer greater habitat benefits than the restoration project could otherwise produce. Map 19 Wetland Proximity Scenario identifies unforested buffer zones that are in close proximity (within 300 feet) to wetlands (National Wetlands Inventory). Restoration projects in these areas may offer opportunities to enhance and expand wetland habitat in addition to providing other desirable buffer functions.  63   7. Optimizing Water Quality Benefits by Combining Priorities Strategic targeting of stream buffer restoration projects can take into account many different potential benefits. Several of these scenarios are presented independently in this section. However, site selection and project design generally incorporate numerous factors to optimize benefits from the project. For example, finding a site with a mix of attributes like those in the following list could result in the greatest control of nonpoint source pollution and enhancement to living resources:  land owner willingness / incentives  marginal land use in the riparian zone  headwater stream  hydric soils  selecting appropriate woody/grass species  adjacent to existing wetlands / habitat  Two of the many ways to integrate targeting criteria to help identify candidate sites for additional investigation are shown here. One example is shown on Map 18 Nutrient Retention Using Hydric Soils Associated With Cropland Scenario . This map suggests potential stream buffer restoration areas that are likely to offer the greatest opportunity to reduce both nutrients and sediment entering the stream. Another example shown in Map 20 Prioritizing Streams Scenario prioritizes stream segments based on lack of adequate naturally vegetated buffers, land use adjacent to the stream and headwater stream status.  Targeting To Achieve Measurable Water Quality Improvement Selecting restoration projects that are likely to produce measurable success is an important consideration in prioritizing projects for implementation. In the early stages of a watershed restoration program, measurable water quality improvement can be one of the strongest ways to demonstrate project success. In general, targeting restoration projects to one or a few selected tributaries or small watersheds will tend to offer the greatest probability of producing measurable water quality improvement. By selecting small areas like a small first order stream for restoration, there is greater likelihood that water quality problems arise locally and that they can be corrected by limited investment in carefully selected local restoration projects. In the Middle Chester River watershed, available water quality data reinforces the premise targeting restoration projects to locally generated problems is an important consideration. For example, water clarity data for the Chester River shows that the problem extends up river. The data also suggest that origins of the problem are great in magnitude and are in part outside of the Middle Chester River watershed. If restoration projects are targeted to selected Middle Chester tributaries, improvement in instream water quality may be measurable in terms of water quality parameters, benthos populations or other parameters. Water quality improvements achieved in the tributary will also inevitably contribute to improving the river mainstem. However, improvement in the mainstem of the river may not be measurable if the magnitude of the problem is as great as the data suggest.  64        Wetland Restoration Wetlands serve important environmental functions such as providing habitat and nursery areas for many organisms, facilitating nutrient uptake and recycling, providing erosion control. However, most watersheds in Maryland have significantly fewer wetland acres today than in the past. This loss due to draining, filling, etc. has led to habitat loss and negative water quality impacts in streams and in the Chesapeake Bay. Reversing this historic trend is an important goal of wetland restoration. One approach to identifying candidate wetland restoration sites involves identifying ""historic"" wetland areas based on the presence of hydric soils. This process can be accelerated by using GIS to manipulate soils information with other data like land use. The GIS products can then assist in initiating the candidate site search process, targeting site investigations and helping to identify land owners. To promote wetland restoration, DNR Watershed Management and Analysis Division has developed GIS capability for these purposes. In preliminary discussions between County and DNR representatives several potential interests involving wetland restoration were identified:  Creation of habitat or wetlands based on stream data  Exploring assistance to landowners who participate / contribute to wetland restoration.  Eradication of the invasive plant Phragmites: outreach/newsletter For the Middle Chester River watershed, GIS was used to map and prioritize areas of hydric soil for potential wetland restoration. The steps and priorities used to generate the map are listed below:  Data used: Hydric soils (Natural Soil Groups), existing wetlands (National Wetlands Inventory), land use (DOP 1997).  Identify candidate hydric soil areas based on land use. Hydric soils on open land (agricultural fields, bare ground, etc.) are retained while those underlying natural vegetation and developed lands are excluded.  Explore hydric soils based on land ownership and proximity to existing wetlands or streams. Two of many possible scenarios for finding potential wetland restoration sites are presented on the accompanying maps:  Map 21 Wetland Restoration Opportunities shows that there are around 100 sites that fit the following criteria: 1) hydric soil, 2) on open land, and 3) within 300 feet of existing wetlands. In this scenario, opportunities on public land are suggested as high priority for investigation because their small number and relatively simple land owner issues would allow rapid assessment of viability. The much greater number of potential sites on private land will require additional screening based on land owner interests.  70    Map 18 Nutrient Retention Using Hydric Soils Associated With Cropland shows numerous potential stream buffer restoration sites that may offer wetland restoration opportunities considering: 1) hydric soils, 2) on open land / agricultural fields, 3) adjacent to streams, and 4) potential to address nutrients in groundwater based on soil type. The potential wetland restoration sites suggested in these scenarios can be filtered further by using more accurate wetlands and soil information, considering landownership, etc. Additional steps would be beneficial in applying this information such as considering additional criteria like habitat enhancement opportunities, sensitive species protection, targeting specific streams or subwatersheds for intensive restoration, and using Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) information. Additional wetland restoration opportunities may be identified on non-agricultural lands. For example, residential properties, particularly low density areas, may also provide viable project sites that do not appear on the scenarios presented above.  71    PROJECTS RELATED TO THE WRAS PROCESS Overview There are numerous projects and programs that have the potential to contribute to successful development and implementation of a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). The listing included here suggests opportunities for cooperation and coordination that can improve the likelihood of success for the WRAS. This listing is not all-inclusive. It is recommended that this list be augmented as new information becomes available and that follow-up should continue to promote the WRAS process with these and other projects and programs.  319(h)-Funded Projects The Federal funding source generally known as ""319"" has two projects in the Middle Chester River watershed: 1- Agriculture Soil Conservation Water Quality Planning for the Upper & Middle Chester River watersheds. (319 funding for years 1999 and 2000, Coastal Zone Management funding for year 2001.) 2- Tracking Tributary Strategy Results with Volunteer Water Quality Monitors within the Chester River watershed. (319 funding for year 1997.)  Other Projects This section summarizes projects that have the potential to contribute to development and implementation of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy that have not been addressed elsewhere in the watershed characterization. 1. Chesapeake Country Scenic Byway Program This transportation-related program may offer opportunities for stream restoration at road crossings. 2. Chester River Association The Chester River Association is private volunteer organization. In 1988, the Association sponsored a workshop facilitated by the National Park Service Mid-Atlantic Region. The workshop afforded an opportunity for the local community to express interests and concerns related to the Chester River watershed. A broad spectrum of issues and potential actions were documented.15 3. Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) pays farmers rental payments over a 10 year 73   period on a per acre basis to remove highly erodible land and other sensitive land/fields from production. One of numerous benefits from the program is reduction of sediment and nutrient movement into streams. 4. Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program The Conservation and Restoration Enhancement Program (CREP) program pays farmers and land owners on a per acre basis to remove from agricultural production environmentally sensitive land that is located near water bodies. This program creates new or enhanced stream buffers, restores wetlands, converts highly erodible ground to protective cover and creates wildlife habitat. Landowners also have the option to place their CREP ground under a conservation easement. 5. Environmental Quality Incentive Program The Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) offers financial assistance to farmers to install conservation practices related to local watershed concerns. The Middle and Upper Chester River watersheds in Kent County have been designated as a Geographic Priority Area which entitles the area to receive a annual funding under the program. These funds are used to provide financial assistance to farmers who are implementing Best Management Practices (BMPs) that will reduce three kinds of water quality problems:  nutrient loadings in surface and groundwater  sediment reaching surface water and  pesticide contamination of surface and groundwater. 6. Forest Service Integrated Service Delivery Project The current State Forest Service project to improve service delivery could also offer opportunities to promote stream buffer restoration. 7. Greenways The Year 2000 edition of the Maryland Greenways Atlas identifies Greenway and Green Infrastructure projects and issues important to Kent County and the Middle Chester River watershed. 8. Wetland Restoration Projects Ducks Unlimited, Inc. has a project to create a shallow water wetland habitat that could serve as an example for additional work  74   POTENTIAL BENCHMARKS FOR WRAS GOAL SETTING Several programs designed to manage water quality and/or living resources have existing or proposed goals that are relevant to setting goals for the Middle Chester River Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). The goals from these other programs tend to overlap and run parallel to potential interests for developing WRAS goals. Therefore, to assist in WRAS development, selected goals from other programs are included here as points of reference. Goals from the Clean Water Action Plan 3:  Clean Water Goals - Maryland watersheds should meet water quality standards, including numerical criteria as well as narrative standards and designated uses.  Watersheds should achieve healthy conditions as indicated by natural resource indicators related to the condition of the water itself (e.g. water chemistry), aquatic living resources and physical habitat, as well as landscape factors (e.g. buffered streams and wetland restoration). Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998 - The most significant feature is requiring nutrient management plans for virtually all Maryland farms. The requirement is being phased in over a several year period. - Nitrogen-based plan implementation will be required on all farms beginning December 31, 2001. - Phosphorus-based plan implementation will be required on farms using chemical fertilizer beginning December 31,2002 and on farms using manure or biosolids by July 1, 2005. - Up to 87.5% cost share is available for development of nutrient management plans and up to $20 per ton cost share assistance with costs of manure transportation are available. Implementation of projects assisted by this funding has the potential to move nutrients to sites where they are needed.  75   ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Sources Used for the Characterization 1. DNR.

The Town of La Veta's wastewater treatment facility utilizes a partially aerated lagoon system followed by a constructed wetlands system to treat influent wastewater. The Town's treatment facility utilizes the following treatment components and unit processes: influent flow measurement, lagoon system consisting of one mechanically aerated cell and two stabilization cells, wetland system consisting of two cells, chlorination, dechlorination using sulfur dioxide, effluent flow measurement and a continuous effluent flow measuring device.  Lagoons The La Veta lagoon system consist of one aerated cell and two stabilization cells. The aerators are operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week during the winter and 8 hours a day during the rest of the year. Some features of this lagoon system are detailed in the table below.  La Veta  Page 1   La Veta  Lagoon Information Cell No.: Surface Area (sq. ft.) Avg. Depth (ft) Avg.

The 1992 expansion and modification of the original treatment facility was brought about as a result of the original treatment facility being overloaded, its inability to produce an effluent which could consistently comply with the facility's discharge permit limitations and the need to provide additional treatment capacity to accommodate projected growth in the service area.  Energy Analysis The wastewater flows through the system by gravity. Energy is consumed in the aerated lagoons by submersible 3hp pumps. During the winter months these pumps run 24 hours a day. The rest of the year, the pumps are operated 8 hours, during the night. A typical energy bill is about $450 a month.  Construction Costs This wetland system cost approximately $365,000 to construct. Since it was established in an abandoned lagoon, earthwork was minimized.  Wetland Design Design Methods The design of the wetland system is based on BOD5 removal using the first order, plug flow, reaction kinetics model developed by Reed, Middlebrooks and Crites. It is assumed that the bulk of settleable solids will be removed in the lagoon system, therefore; influent BOD5 will be primarily soluble BOD and floatable or suspended algal material. A water balance was done to determine the typical wetland hydraulic loading rate. The required water depth for a hydraulic residence time of 11.9 days in the winter and 5 days in the summer will be an operating depth of 6"" to 12"", with the maximum depth kept to less than 24"".  Objectives The main objective of the wetland cells is to remove TSS due to algal carryover from the lagoons.  La Veta  Page 2   La Veta Size The wetland system is a surface flow system consisting of two cells. The total area of the wetland system is 69,400 square feet (1.6 acres).  Shape As shown by the schematic, the sedimentation forebay is rectangular and the wetland cells are rectangular with a direct flow path. The wetland cells are constructed within the embankments of an abandoned lagoon.  Hydraulics Each wetland cell is equipped with its own influent and effluent flow system. A timber wall equipped with a longitudinal weir plant at its top, runs along the width of each wetland. This structure provides uniform flow into the wetlands. Both wetland cells can be bypassed, or one cell can be taken offline for maintenance. The water flow to each wetland is controlled by adjustment of the weir plates installed in the influent control structure. Flow depth in the wetland cells can be adjusted by installing stop planks at the effluent end of each cell. During normal summer months, the depth in the cells operates in the range of 6 to 12 inches. During the winter, the flow is maintained 4 to 6 inches under the ice cover. The effluent end of each wetland cell consists of timber walls with semi-circular corrugated metal pipe fitted in open sections. Outlet pipes are located outside the timber walls. Each outlet pipe is equipped with a perforated cap and buried in river rock.

Data reflect the quality of the effluent, not influent measurements are taken for these parameters. The pH values plotted are an average of the minimum and maximum 30-day values that are reported in the monthly reports. Previous to the wetland implementation, data indicate that average pH values in the effluent were close to the maximum daily allowable of 11. An amendment to the discharge permit changed the maximum pH limitation from 9.0su to 11.0 s.u. La Veta was eligible for this amendment because it met both applicable requirements, 1) no inorganic chemical could be added to the wastestream, and 2) contributions from industrial sources do not cause the pH of the effluent to be less than 6.0 s.u. or greater than 9.0 s.u. It was determined that the high pH in the system was due to significant algae bloom in the lagoons. A chlorination-dechlorination system is provided as a part of the treatment to meet the fecal coliform permit limitations. This system has not been used in the last 5 years because effluent quality has been suitable for discharge without their use.

The wetland discharges to the Cuchares River. The LaVeta treatment wetlands are located in the broad valley of the Cucharas River, at the base of a pion pine-dominated bluff.  Cell Vegetation Two cells are present at the LaVeta site. Cell 1 is composed of 80 percent water, 10 percent litter, and 10 percent vegetation. The vegetation communities for cells 1 and 2 are identical. Community 1, which composes 90 percent of each wetland cell, is dominated by cattail (Typha latifolia), with Scirpus americanus and duckweed (Lemna minor) present but not dominant. Vegetation community 2, which composes the remaining 10 percent, is dominated by cattail, softstem bulrush (Scirpus tabernamontanae) with duckweed, willowherb (Epilobeum ciliata), creeping spikerush (Eleocharis palustris), foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum)and sandbar willow (Salix exigua) present but not dominant. The site is dominated by 95 percent water and 5 percent vegetation.  Planting/Seeding Cattails were planted at the site in the fall. The planting rate is not known..  Weeds Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense), mullein (Verbascum thapsus), and gumweed (Grindelia squarosa) are present around ponds and wetlands in both cells. Canada thistle and mullein are on the State Noxious Weed list. They are invasive in areas of recent disturbance, and spread quickly. They also prevent the establishment of native species and have low wildlife value.  Maintenance Issues No maintenance items were noted.  Wildlife The LaVeta wetland provides habitat for muskrat, beaver, red winged black birds, waterfowl, and geese. Mallards and herons were observed during the site visit. This wetland has structural diversity in the form of small patches of open water interspersed with cattail stands. From a landscape perspective, it provides valuable wildlife habitat. There are no other similar wetland/open water complexes in the area, and the treatment facility gains extra value because of its location between the Cucharas River floodplain and the pion bluff.  Wetland Biodiversity Functional Assessment Sediment/nutrient/toxicant removal and production export/food chain support both rated high. General wildlife habitat rated moderate. Habitat diversity and uniqueness of the constructed wetland rated moderate to low. This wetland received 45 percent of the total possible functional points. It rated as a category III wetland.

Two Maryland 8-digit watersheds in the WRAS project area are State-identified priorities for restoration: Bush River and Bynum Run. The WRAS project area encompasses nearly 119,600 acres including about 10,845 acres of open water. As part of WRAS project, the Maryland Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) is providing technical assistance. For example, DNR is working with the County to prepare a Watershed Characterization which is a collection of available water quality related information and identification of issues that may be used as the County generates its Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. Water Quality Five of the six Maryland 8-digit watersheds in the Bush River Basin are identified in the State's 303(d) list for not supporting their designated use. The causes appear to be related to four general categories of water quality problems: 1) nutrients in tidal waters and lakes, 2) suspended sediment in both tidal and nontidal waters, 3) toxics substances found near Aberdeen Proving Ground, and; 4) biological limitations identified in specific nontidal stream segments. As one step toward remedying these problems, Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) projects will be conducted over the next several years. TMDLs for nitrogen and phosphorus have been established for Swan Creek. During the years 1985 to 2000, one long term monitoring station (WT1.1) in the tidal Bush River shows trends for two parameters -- long term measurements for both total phosphorus and algae abundance suggest a worsening of conditions. All other long term water quality measurements at this station show no significant trend (total nitrogen, dissolved oxygen, total suspended solids and water clarity as measured by secchi disk). Land Use Land in the Bush River Basin has significant concentrations of development. Overall, the River Basin is about 35% developed. The most developed 8-digit watershed is Bynum Run (53% developed) and the least developed is Bush River (nearly 25%). Agriculture is a significant land use across the Bush River Basin except for Aberdeen Proving Ground. Agricultural land use involved 16 to 40% of the land in the other 8-digit watersheds. Overall, forest land covers more than one third of the Bush River Basin. Large concentrations of forest are found in the Aberdeen Proving Ground and Bush River watersheds. Relatively little remains in the Bynum Run and Atkisson Reservoir watersheds (about 23 and 28% respectively). Wetlands cover large acreage of Aberdeen Proving Ground (about 16%) and significant acreage in the Bush River 8-digit watershed (over 7%). Compared to other Bush River Basin watersheds, Bynum Run watershed has the highest percent developed land and greatest extent of land identified for Smart Growth in a Priority Funding Area. It also has the least protected land and forest interior. viii Sept. 2002   Living Resources and Habitat The Upper Chesapeake Bay is considered to be very important for fish spawning and nursery. Estuarine areas of the Bush River Basin may contribute to the overall productivity of the area but specific information on Bush River Basin fisheries is not available. In nontidal streams, about half of the fish populations assessed by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) were rated as good and most of remainder were rated fair or poor. MBSS sites rated as very poor were all within the Aberdeen Proving Ground watershed. Fish consumption advisories have been issued for two tidal fish species (channel catfish and white perch) due to PCBs and pesticides and for some species commonly taken from lakes due to methyl-mercury. In nontidal streams, benthic populations assessed by the MBSS across the Bush River Basin were commonly rated fair or poor. Locations assessed by MBSS as good were all found in the Swan Creek watershed. In the Aberdeen Proving Ground watershed, most areas assessed were rated as very poor. Sensitive species areas identified for project review purposes are found in all of the 8-digit watersheds in the Bush River Basin. However, Wetlands of Special State Concern, which are subject to regulatory review requirements for sensitive species, are concentrated in a few areas: Bush River Watershed (Otter Point Creek, North of Sod Run, Church Creek), Atkisson Reservoir, and Swan Creek watershed (Swan and Gasheys Creeks, Chesapeake Bay shore area, Swan Harbor Farm Park). Habitat for the Federally Endangered Maryland Darter is located in the Swan Creek watershed (Gashey's Run). Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) populations in the Bush River are very sparse compared to the potential physical habitat. The factors inhibiting SAV locally are believed to be associated with poor light penetration, elevated algal populations, nutrients and suspended solids. Restoration Targeting Tools Otter Point Creek in the Bush River watershed is designated as part of the National Estuarine Research Reserve. This designation provides for protection of over 900 acres of water, wetlands and uplands. The designation has also fostered long term efforts for estuarine research, monitoring and education relating to the local estuary. DNR conducted a stream corridor assessment on Church Creek in 2002. This information augments earlier work by DNR on Bynum Run and Swan Creek and by Harford County in other Bush River Basin watesheds. These surveys identify the status of stream buffers, stream bank erosion and other measures of stream condition. This information provides a ground-truthed foundation for targeting restoration projects. Computerized mapping was used to demonstrate concepts for restoration targeting and to help identify areas for additional site investigation for restoration of stream buffers and wetlands. For example, one GIS scenario suggests that opportunities for stream buffer restoration targeted to areas of poorly drained hydric soils to maximize nutrient uptake may be found upstream of Bel Air and in several headwater streams in the Bush River watershed.  ix  Sept. 2002   CONTRIBUTORS TO THE WATERSHED CHARACTERIZATION Harford County Director of Department of Public Works Department of Public Works, Water Resources Engineering Department of Public Works, Water and Sewer Department of Planning and Zoning Department of Parks and Recreation Health Department Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service Coastal Zone Management Division Watershed Restoration Division Watershed Management and Analysis Division Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve Fisheries Service Resource Assessment Service Upper Western Shore Tributary Team Aberdeen Proving Ground U.S. Army Environmental Center Maryland Department of Agriculture Maryland Department of the Environment Maryland Department of Planning  Maryland Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) Others  Editor and Primary Author Ken Shanks, Watershed Management and Analysis Division Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service Department of the Natural Resources  x  Sept. 2002   INTRODUCTION Watershed Selection Maryland's Clean Water Action Plan, completed in 1998, identified water bodies that failed to meet water quality requirements. As part of the State's response, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is offering funding and technical assistance to Counties willing to work cooperatively to devise and implement a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) for the impaired water bodies.1,2 Harford County is one of five Counties participating in the second round of the WRAS program.

Swan Creek is not part of the County's WRAS project area included to allow comparison of subwatersheds across the entire Bush River Basin.  Purpose of the Characterization One of the earliest steps toward devising a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy is to characterize the watershed using immediately available information. This Watershed Characterization is intended to meet several objectives:  briefly summarize the most important or relevant information and issues  provide preliminary findings based on this information 1 Sept. 2002    identify sources for more information or analysis  suggest opportunities for additional characterization and restoration work. Additional Characterization Recommended The Watershed Characterization is intended to be one starting point. It is part of a framework for a more thorough assessment involving an array of additional inputs:  self-investigation by the local entity  targeted technical assistance by partner agencies or contractors  input from local stakeholders  Stream Corridor Assessment, i.e. physically walking the streams and cataloguing important issues, is part of the technical assistance offered by DNR  Synoptic water quality survey, i.e. a program of water sample analysis, can be used to focus on local issues like nutrient hot spots, point source discharges or other selected issues. This is also part of the technical assistance offered by DNR.  Identifying Gaps in Information It is important to identify gaps in available watershed knowledge and gauge the importance of these gaps. One method is to review available information in the context of four physical / biological assessment categories that have been successfully applied in other watershed restoration efforts. These are the main categories that impact aquatic biota:  Habitat: physical structure, stream stability and biotic community (including the riparian zone)  Water Quantity: high water - storm flow & flooding; low water - baseflow problems from dams, water withdrawals, reduced infiltration  Water Quality: water chemistry; toxics, nutrients, sediment, nuisance odors/scums, etc.  Cumulative effects associated with habitat, water quantity and water quality.  Adaptive Management In addition, the Watershed Characterization and the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy should be maintained as living documents within an active evolving restoration process. These documents will have to be updated periodically as new, more relevant information becomes available and as the watershed response is monitored and reassessed. This type of approach to watershed restoration and protection is often referred to as ""adaptive management.""  2  Sept. 2002   WATER QUALITY  Priority for Restoration and Protection The 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan established priorities for watersheds in the State water quality restoration and protection. In the Plan, Category 1 Priority watershed (highest State priority for restoration) was applied to three subwatersheds in the Bush River basin as shown in Map 4 Category 1 Priority Watersheds: - Bush River, watershed 02130701 - Bynum Run, watershed 02130704 - Swan Creek, watershed 02130706 (outside of the WRAS project area) As the basis for the prioritization, indicators of water quality, landscape and living resources were developed for all watersheds in Maryland. These indicators are described in greater detail in separate sections in this watershed characterization.  Designated Uses All waters of the State are assigned a ""Designated Use"" in regulation, COMAR 26.08.02.08, which is associated with a set of water quality criteria necessary to support that use. Map 5 Designated Uses shows the distribution of designated uses across the Bush River Basin. In the simplified summary below, designated uses requiring the better water quality are listed first and the least restrictive (Use I) is listed last. In general, Use I water quality requirements apply everywhere unless superceded by criteria necessary for other designated uses. (The Department of the Environment should be contacted for official regulatory information.) 3 - Use III Natural Trout Waters: Bynum Run and all tributaries - Use IV-P Recreational Trout Waters and Protection of Public Water Supply: Winters Run and all tributaries - Use II Shellfish Harvesting: All estuarine portions of tributaries except: (a) Bush River and tributaries above a line from Fairview Pt. to Chillbury Pt. (b) Romney Creek above Briar Point (c) Swan Creek and tributaries above mouth - Use I-P Water Contact Recreation, Protection of Aquatic Life and Protection of Public Water Supply: Winters Run and all tributaries, including Atkisson Reservoir from Otter Point Creek to upstream boundary of Atkisson Reservoir. - Use I Water Contact Recreation and Protection of Aquatic Life: All water bodies not otherwise designated above. 3 Sept. 2002   Not Supporting Designated Use  303(d) Listings The table 303(d) List of Impaired Waters shows that there are 13 listings within the Bush River Basin. These listings mean that pollution associated with nutrients, suspended sediment and/or toxic materials are preventing full use of these waters based on State criteria. A statewide assessment of water quality is required under Section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act. As part of the assessment, Maryland tracks waterways that do not support their designated use in a list of ""impaired waters"" and in a prioritized list of ""Water Quality Limited Basin Segments"" also known as the 303(d) priority list. Information considered in setting the 303(d) list priorities include, but is not limited to, severity of the problem, threat to human health and high value resources, extent of understanding of problem causes and remedies.5 Each impairment identified in the 303(d) List is assigned a priority which is intended to help communicate the need for correcting the impairment relative to all impairments listed Statewide. Waterways with impairments having the greatest potential impacts to human health, high value resources, etc. are ranked numerically 1 through 25. All other impairments that are not ranked in the top 25 are ranked high, medium or low. Potential Next Steps. A potential goal for a WRAS could be elimination of 303(d) listings for the watershed and/or mitigation of the causes contributing to the listings. Shellfish Harvesting Restrictions As shown in Map 5 Designated Uses, a large portion of the Bush River are designated for shellfish harvesting. However, the entire area shown as Use II waters for shellfish harvesting on the map is ""restricted."" This restriction applied by the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) ""means that no harvesting of oysters and clams is allowed at any time."" Use II (shellfish harvesting waters in this basin are technically restricted because only minimal monitoring is being done due to the lack of a commercially harvestable resource.26 There are relatively few oysters in the Bush River because it typically has less than 0.5 parts per thousand (ppt) salinity but oysters grow best in water with greater than 12 ppt. Consequently, the State's shellfish area monitoring efforts are not invested in low salinity areas like the Bush River where oysters can not be commercially harvested. In the absence of regular monitoring, the restriction is necessary to protect human health because oysters and clams are filter feeders that are readily contaminated by even brief or intermittent exposure to animal and human waste.  4  Sept. 2002   303(d) List of Impaired Waters for the Bush River Basin4 from 2000 Maryland Section 305(b)Water Quality Report, Appendix F Watershed Bush River: Cranberry Run & Broad Run Bush River Number 02130701 -1129 02130701 Impairment Biological Sources Unknown Priority low  Nutrients Suspended Sediment  NPS, natural NPS, natural  low low  Winters Run Atkisson Reservoir Bynum Run  02130702 02130703  impairment not listed Nutrients Suspended Sediment NPS, natural NPS, natural NPS, natural NPS, natural NPS, natural Point Source, NPS, natural Point Source, NPS, natural Point Source, NPS, natural NPS, natural NPS, natural low low low low 18 low low low low low  02130704  Nutrients Suspended Sediment  Aberdeen Proving Ground  02130705  Toxic Substances Nutrients Suspended Sediment Toxic Substances  Swan Creek  02130706  Nutrients Suspended Sediment  5  Sept. 2002   Total Maximum Daily Loads The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) uses the 303(d) priority list to help set State work schedules for various programs including establishment of Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). The intent of establishing one or more TMDLs for a water body is to estimate a pollutant load that the water body can assimilate and still meet water quality standards. Then a waste load allocation is generated to identify appropriate pollution reduction needs among current pollutant sources. Based on January 2002 work load projections, MDE has set several target years for establishing TMDLs for water bodies in the Bush River watershed. (Note 1: work load scheduling is subject to change.

Biological. Within selected stream segments, populations of benthic macroinvertebrates and fish and their associated physical habitat have been assessed by the Maryland Biological Stream Program. Based on criteria developed for each physiographic/ecological zone in Maryland, each stream segment is rated as either good, fair, poor or very poor. Ratings of poor and very poor were listed as biological impairment for the first time in Maryland in the draft 2002 303(d) list of impaired waters. Nutrients . In Maryland, most water bodies naturally have low levels of the nutrients nitrogen or phosphorus. These nutrients enter waterways from all types of land and from the atmosphere. Nutrient pollution or over-enrichment problems may arise from numerous sources. For example, residential land can be an important contributor of nutrients depending on fertilizer use, extent of lawn and the status of septic systems. Many farmers carefully manage nutrients using different approaches, so nutrients entering waterways from crop land varies greatly depending on management techniques. Typically, smaller amounts of nutrients reach surface waters from an acre of forest land than from an acre of other types of land. The atmosphere can contribute various forms of nitrogen arising from the burning of fossil fuels in power plants and from automobile exhaust. Suspended Sediment . Most unpolluted streams and tidal waters naturally have limited amounts of sediment moving ""suspended"" in the water. Excessive amounts of suspended sediment in waterways are considered pollution because they can inhibit light penetration, prevent plant growth, smother fish eggs, clog fish gills, etc. Sediment in streams tends to arise from stream bed and bank erosion and from land that is poorly vegetated or disturbed. Suspended sediment pollution may arise from construction sites, crop land, bare ground and exposed soil. The amount of sediment contributed varies greatly site to site depending upon stream stability, hydrology, management controls and other factors. Toxic Substances. A wide array of materials may be considered toxic substances because they exhibit poisonous or lethal affects or otherwise harm aquatic life. These materials are very diverse in their sources and effects. Sometimes toxic substances can occur naturally. However, toxic substances of concern for water quality restoration are those types that are the product of human activity. For regulatory purposes, the US Environmental Protection Agency maintains a list of substances that are considered to be toxic. A few examples are heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), asbestos and many other materials.  7  Sept. 2002   National Academy Press, Clean Coastal Waters (2000) What Are the Effects of Nutrient Over-Enrichment? 6 The productivity of many [lake, estuary and] coastal marine systems is limited by nutrient availability, and the input of additional nutrients to these systems increases primary productivity [microscopic organisms including algae]. In moderation in some systems, nutrient enrichment can have beneficial impacts such as increasing fish production; however, more generally the consequences of nutrient enrichment for coastal marine ecosystems are detrimental. Many of these detrimental consequences are associated with eutrophication. The increased productivity from eutrophication increases oxygen consumption in the system and can lead to low-oxygen (hypoxia) or oxygen-free (anoxic) water bodies. This can lead to fish kills as well as more subtle changes in ecological structure and functioning, such as lowered biotic diversity and lowered recruitment of fish populations. Eutrophication can also have deleterious consequences on estuaries even when low-oxygen events do not occur. These changes include loss of biotic diversity, and changes in the ecological structure of both planktonic and benthic communities, some of which may be deleterious to fisheries. Seagrass beds and coral reefs are particularly vulnerable to damage from eutrophication and nutrient over-enrichment. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) harm fish, shellfish, and marine mammals and pose a direct public health threat to humans. The factors that cause HABs remain poorly known, and some events are entirely natural. However, nutrient over-enrichment of coastal waters leads to blooms of some organisms that are both longer in duration and of more frequent occurrence. Although difficult to quantify, the social and economic consequences of nutrient over-enrichment include aesthetic, health, and livelihood impacts.  8  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Indicators The Clean Water Action Plan's 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment established priorities for watersheds in the State for restoration and protection. In the Plan, three watersheds in the Bush River Basin watershed were listed for action under the highest priority for restoration (Category 1 Priority):  Bush River 02130701  Bynum Run 02130704  Swan Creek 02130706 As the basis for the prioritization, indicators of water quality, landscape and living resources were developed for all watersheds in Maryland. Other approaches to assessing water quality have been in use for several years and are further described below. In general they do not look comparatively at watersheds as the Unified Assessment did in an effort to set priorities. The Unified Assessment also considered a range of living resource and landscape indicators described a little later. The Unified Assessment used water quality indicators to compare the State's 138 watersheds which were applied to help characterize the Bush River Basin. The findings for the water quality indicators are summarized in the table below and are more thoroughly explained in the following text. Lower Winters Run  Bynum Run  State 303(d) List Impairment Number Modeled TN Load Modeled TP Load Tidal Habitat Index Tidal Eutrophication Index  2 27.88 1.14 4.3 7.0  0 11.54 0.38  2 9.18 0.49  2 10.94 0.47  2 9.32 0.32  NOTES: Click on the indicator name to link to its description and interpretation. Unshaded indicators in the table mean that average watershed conditions measured by this indicator are better than the Statewide benchmark. Shaded indicators grid mean that average watershed conditions measured by this indicator are worse than the Statewide benchmark, i.e. water quality problems are more likely to arise due to the conditions represented by the indicator.  9  Swan Creek 2 15.28 0.67 Sept. 2002  Bush River  APG  Water Quality Indicator  Atkisson Reservoir   1. State 303(d) Impairment In the Bush River Basin, all of the watersheds in the Basin are on the 303(d) list with the exception of Lower Winters Run. For this indicator, presence on the 303(d) list means that the following watersheds have one or more water quality problems that need correction or restoration: Bush River, Atkisson Reservoir, Bynum Run, Aberdeen Proving Ground and Swan Creek. 2. Modeled Total Nitrogen Load For the Bush River Basin, the total nitrogen (TN) load reaching the Chesapeake Bay was estimated using a computer model to be relatively low for Atkisson Reservoir and Aberdeen Proving Ground watersheds. Compared to other watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, these watersheds ranked among those transporting less TN to the Chesapeake Bay. All the other watersheds in the river basin has relatively high estimated total nitrogen loads reaching the Chesapeake Bay. Compared to other watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, the Bush River, Lower Winters Run, Bynum Run and Swan Creek watersheds ranked among those transporting high TN to the Chesapeake Bay. Nitrogen Load is a measure of how much of this important nutrient reaches streams and other surface waters. For each type of land use in the watershed, on average, stormwater tends to carry or transport a characteristic amount of nitrogen from the land to nearby streams. Based on these averages, computers can be used to estimate (model) how much nitrogen is likely to be reaching Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay is receiving too much nitrogen, so higher TN loads from watersheds contribute to the water quality problems in the Chesapeake Bay. To create a benchmark for this indicator, the modeled TN loads for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. Four watersheds in the Bush River Basin (Bush River, Lower Winters Run, Bynum Run and Swan Creek) exceeded this benchmark. 3. Modeled Total Phosphorus Load For the Bush River Basin, the total phosphorus (TP) load reaching the Chesapeake Bay was estimated using a computer model to be relatively low for four watersheds: Lower Winters Run, Atkisson Reservoir, Bynum Run and Aberdeen Proving Ground. Compared to other watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, these watersheds ranked among those transporting less TN to the Chesapeake Bay. The TP load reaching the Chesapeake Bay from two Bush River Basin watersheds was estimated to be relatively high according to the computer model. Compared to other Chesapeake Bay watersheds in Maryland, the Bush River and Swan Creek watersheds ranked among those transporting high TP to the Chesapeake Bay. Total Phosphorus is a measure of how much of this important nutrient is reaching streams and other surface waters. The ranking for modeled TP Load was performed in parallel to the ranking for modeled TN Load above. The Chesapeake Bay is receiving too much phosphorus, so higher TP loads from watersheds contribute to the water quality problems in the Chesapeake Bay. 10 Sept. 2002   To create a benchmark for this indicator, the modeled TP loads for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Bush River and Swan Creek watersheds did exceeded this benchmark. 4. Tidal Habitat Index In the Bush River Basin, the Bush River watershed had sufficient data available to be assessed for the Tidal Habitat Index. The other two watersheds in the Basin that include tidal waters, Aberdeen Proving Ground and Swan Creek, did not have sufficient data for assessment. Compared to other Chesapeake Bay watersheds in Maryland, the Bush River watershed ranked among those having poorer tidal habitat based on an index combining three measurements of water quality: algae populations as measured by surface chlorophyll a, water clarity as measured by secchi depth and summer bottom dissolved oxygen (July-Sept.). Using data collected 1994-1996, the Bush River watershed ranked ""4.3"" on a scale of 1(worst) to 10(best). To create a benchmark for this indicator, the index scores for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Bush River watershed exceeded this benchmark. 5. Tidal Eutrophication Index In the Bush River Basin, the Bush River watershed had sufficient data available to be assessed for the Tidal Eutrophication Index. The other two watersheds in the Basin that include tidal waters, Aberdeen Proving Ground and Swan Creek, did not have sufficient data for assessment. Compared to other Chesapeake Bay watersheds in Maryland, the Bush River watershed ranked among those having less eutrophication problems based on an index combining of three measurements of water quality (in surface mixed-layer water): total nitrogen, total phosphorus and total suspended solids. Using data collected 1994-1996, the Bush River watershed ranked ""7.0"" on a scale of 1(worst) to 10(best). To create a benchmark for this indicator, the index scores for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Bush River watershed did not exceed this benchmark.  Water Quality Background 1950s to 1988 Slow flushing characteristics of the Bush River tend to accentuate water quality problems there. It typically takes 48 days for this tidal fresh estuary to flush.8 Salinity in the tidal Bush River varies from about 5 parts per thousand (ppt) at the Chesapeake Bay to about 0.1 ppt in the upper Bush River to less than 0.05 ppt at the mouths of tributary creeks like Otter Point Creek.14 11 Sept. 2002   1. Tidal Bush River The earliest available water quality records covering the 1950s through 1965 noted high bacteria levels in the tidal Bush River. This a period before public sewerage services were offered in the Bush River watershed. The sources of this bacterial problem were believed to be existing discharges directly into the river including Bata Shoe, Edgewood Arsenal and probably effluent from private septic systems. Sampling in 1965 verified high bacterial populations in the river including E. Coli. These high bacterial populations were found in extensive areas of the upper tidal reaches of the Bush River and along the western shore of the Bush River toward the Chesapeake Bay. 11 1970s and 1980s In General Bacteria problems began to cause swimming closures in the Upper Bush River beginning in 1971. These problems were in-part associated with failing septic systems.8 Several projects gathered water quality data in the 1970s and 1980s: 1972 Goucher College Environmental Studies Program had sampling stations in the open tidal waters of the Bush River and near the mouths of Bush Creek and Cranberry Run. 9 1977 DNR had sampling stations in the tidal waters of the Bush River.9 1980-82 CH2M Hill, a consultant working for Harford County had most sampling stations in open tidal waters of the Bush River with the exception of two stations near the tidal interface in Otter Point Creek and James Run. 9 1987 Harford County Dept. Of Public Works10 1988 Harford Community College12 Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations measured at all stations by CH2M Hill and DNR were higher than the minimum standard of 5.0 mg/l. However, 1972 dissolved oxygen sampling data showed several DO standard violations near the mouths of Bush Creek and Cranberry Run. 9 In 1987, DO concentrations below the standard were recorded at Church Creek, the upper Bush River and Otter Point Creek.10 Additional DO problems were reported in 1988 for Greys Run, Cranberry Run and Bynum Run.12 High fecal coliform bacteria populations were found by DNR in July 1977 up and down the tidal Bush River. 1982 monitoring by CH2M Hill found the highest fecal coliform bacteria populations and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) tended to be from their two stream stations. The next highest findings were found near Otter Point.9 Specific sources of these problems were believed to be associated with remaining failing septic systems even though about one-half of the watershed's population was now served by public sewer service.8 1987 sampling found four sites with fecal coliform bacteria greater than 200 MPN (most probable number): 2 stations in the upper Bush River, Winters Run at Rt 40 and James Run at Rt 40. Additionally, Bynum Run and Church Run were considered likely contributors.10 Winters Run was identified again for a high fecal coliform count in 1988.12 Algae blooms reported in the upper tidal Bush River were believed to be driven by nutrient inputs from tributary streams.9 In 1987, algae blooms in the upper Bush River north of the AMTRAK railway bridge was identified as a continuing issue. Nutrient concentrations in the tidal Bush River were high. For total phosphorus, concentrations 12 Sept. 2002   greater than 0.01 mg/l were considered to highly enriched. Monitoring in 1972-73 for DNR Power Plant Siting found total phosphorus concentrations were nearly always greater than this benchmark with peak concentrations between 0.05 and 0.07 mg/l. 19 1987 monitoring data found that the orthophosphorus fraction alone averaged between 0.04 and 0.08 mg/l. 10 For total inorganic nitrogen (which is collectively ammonia, nitrite and nitrate), concentrations greater than 0.5 to 1.5 mg/l were considered very high. 1972-73 data gathered for the DNR Power Plant Siting Program found organic nitrogen concentrations occasionally above 0.5 mg/l.19 Monitoring data found that ammonia nitrogen ranged from 0.01 to 0.11 mg/l and nitrate nitrogen ranged from 0.02 to 0.77 mg/l. Data for the two streams sampled supported the belief that tributary streams were a significant nutrient source for the Bush River. Additionally, 1972 data collected by the Goucher College Environmental Studies Program reported high nutrient concentrations near the mouths of Bush Creek and Cranberry Run. In 1987, high nutrient concentrations tended to found at all sampling sites.10 In 1988, elevated nutrients were found at all sampling sites including Bynum Run, James Run, Greys Run and Cranberry Run. Additionally, a trend toward increasing nitrate concentrations was reported.12 Sedimentation problems were believed to be associated with urbanizing areas of the watershed.9 High sediment loads were reported in Lower Winters Run. 8 The County Dept. of Public Works identified several streams as the major sources of sediment to the upper Bush River in 1987: Otter Point Creek, James Run/Bynum Run, and Church Creek. Then, again in 1988, turbidity levels exceeding the State standard were reported for Bynum Run (the highest), Winters Run and James Run. 2. Atkisson Reservoir13 During the 1970s, excessive sediment movement in streams above the Reservoir was known to be a problem based on water intake records maintained by Maryland Water Works. Sampling in 1980 in the 38-year old Atkisson Reservoir found that 81% of its original volume had been lost to deposited sediment. That same year, stream surveys conducted upstream of the Reservoir found excessive sediment in Winters Run and Plum Tree Run near the Reservoir. However, turbidity in the reservoir in 1980 was not found to be a problem. [These findings may suggest that sediment mobilized upstream of the Reservoir tended to be larger particles that readily settled out in slack water, ed.] The Reservoir was characterized as eutrophic with algae blooms commonly occurring in summer. The blooms were believed to be caused by high total phosphorus concentrations in the Reservoir ranging from 0.07 to 0.52 mg/l. At the time, EPA criteria was 0.025 mg/l total phosphorus. Low dissolved oxygen concentrations were identified in deep waters of the Reservoir below the 13 foot depth. Bacterial problems in the Reservoir were identified in the 1960s and 1970s. Sampling in 1980 verified that fecal coliform counts were typically high. Temperature, pH, metals or pesticides were not identified as concerns in the Reservoir.  13  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Assessment 1989 to the Present In the Bush River Basin (021307), there is one regularly scheduled long-term water quality monitoring effort for one station (WT1.1) in the tidal Bush River. All other monitoring is short term and special purpose. For example, the Maryland Biological Stream Survey collects water quality information in nontidal streams as part of its program. Additionally, MDE collected water quality data in 1999 to support permitting decisions and anticipated work on Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs).26 Cheseapeake Bay Program Tributary Monitoring Station WT1.1 shown on Map 6 Monitoring Stations is the best source of long term water quality data for the tidal Bush River. DNR Resource Assessment Service has analyzed data from this station and a summary of their findings appears in the table below. The status for each parameter in the table is a relative ranking at three levels: good, fair and poor. For example, the ranking of ""fair"", which is the most common ranking in the table, means that the Bush River ranking is fair compared to comparable Chesapeake Bay tributaries with comparable salinity. Additional discussion follows the table in this section. A more detailed look at the historic water quality record for this monitoring station is presented in Appendix A Selected Water Quality Historic Record for Bush River Station WT1.1. As part of DNR's work of the Upper Western Shore Tributary Team, this relative water quality assessment for the tidal Bush River and nearby tidal tributaries is presented in DNR's Internet site www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/tribstrat/index.html. 1, 9 For additional information on water quality in general and Station WT1.1 specifically, see http://www.chesapeakebay.net/wquality.htm and www.dnr.state.md.us/irc/datasets.html Parameter Nitrogen: total Phosphorus: total Algae: Abundance Dissolved Oxygen (summer, bottom waters) Water Clarity: secchi depth Suspended Solids: total Status 1998 -2000 data Fair Fair Poor Good Poor Fair Trend 1985 through 2000 No Trend Degrading (46%) Degrading (117%) No Trend No Trend No Trend  14  Sept. 2002   1. Nitrogen Total nitrogen concentrations for 1998 through 2000 from station WT1.1 in the Bush River suggested ""fair"" water quality. For the period 1985 through 2000, there was no trend toward significant change. During 2001, the graph shows total nitrogen concentrations varied slightly more than 1 mg/l averaging 1.2 mg/l for the year.  Total Nitrogen Station WT1.1 for 2001 2 1.8 1.6 MG/l 1.4 1.2 1 0.8 0.6 Months January Through December  2. Phosphorus Total phosphorus concentrations for 1998 through 2000 from station WT1.1 in the Bush River suggested ""fair"" water quality. For the period 1985 through 2000, there was a trend toward increasing concentrations suggesting worsening conditions. During 2001, the graph shows total phosphorus concentrations varied about than 0.1 mg/l averaging 0.074 mg/l for the year.  Total Phosphorus Station WT1.1 for 2001 0.14 0.12 MG/l 0.1 0.08 0.06 0.04 Months January Through December  15  Sept. 2002   3. Algae Abundance of algae as measured by chlorophyl a Chlorophyll A concentrations for 1998 through Station WT1.1 for 2001 2000 from station WT1.1 in the 50 Bush River suggested ""poor"" 40 water quality. For the period 30 1985 through 2000, there was a trend toward increasing 20 concentrations suggesting 10 worsening conditions. During 2001, the graph shows total 0 nitrogen concentrations varied Months January Through December more than 40 ug/l averaging about 25 micrograms per liter (ug/l). The year 2001 average chlorophyll a concentrations suggest that algae abundance is typically high enough to inhibit health of submerged aquatic vegetation during the growing season. MG/l  4. Dissolved Oxygen Dissolved oxygen Dissolved Oxygen concentrations for 1998 through Station WT1.1 for 2001 2000 from station WT1.1 in the 12 Bush River suggested ""good"" water 11 quality. For the period 1985 10 through 2000, there was no trend 9 toward significant change. During 2001, the graph shows dissolved 8 oxygen concentrations varied about 7 5 mg/l averaging 9.2 mg/l for the 6 year. Measurements at this station Months January Through December have consistently met the State water quality standard of 5.0 mg/l during the past several years. Data collected from this station, due to its location in the middle of the Bush River's open tidal waters, probably does not reflect dissolved oxygen conditions in tidal waters in more restricted areas. MG/l  16  Sept. 2002   5. Water Clarity The measurement of water clarity for 1998 through Station WT1.1 for 2001 2000 at station WT1.1 in the 0.6 Bush River using secchi disk depth suggested ""poor"" water 0.5 quality. For the period 1985 0.4 through 2000, there was no trend toward significant change. 0.3 During 2001, the graph shows secchi disk depth varied less 0.2 than one half meter averaging Months January Through December 0.4 meters for the year. Measurements from this station indicate that water clarity is too limited to support submerged aquatic vegetation. However, water clarity conditions in other parts of the tidal Bush River may differ significantly. MG/l  Secchi Disk Depth  6. Suspended Solids Total suspended solids concentrations for 1998 through 2000 from station WT1.1 in the Bush River suggested ""fair"" water quality. For the period 1985 through 2000, there was no trend toward significant change. During 2001, the graph shows total suspended solids concentrations varied about 30 mg/l averaging 28 mg/l for the year.

Chemical Contaminants Overall, the Bush River is identified by the US EPA Chesapeake Bay Program as an area with insufficient or inconclusive data.30 Sampling of sediment and the water column in the Bush River has not been conducted to support a more definitive statement. However, limited data in the Aberdeen Proving Ground watershed has identified toxic substances of concern in small areas. Additionally, the most recent Fish Consumption Advisory from the Maryland Dept. of the Environment identified PCBs, pesticides and methyl mercury in fish tissue as concerns.  MG/l  17  Sept. 2002   Point Sources Discharges from discrete conveyances like pipes are called ""point sources."" Point sources may contribute pollution to surface water or to groundwater. For example, waste water treatment discharges may contribute nutrients or microbes that consume oxygen (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) that reduce oxygen available for aquatic life. Stormwater discharges may contribute excessive flow of water and/or seasonally high temperatures. Industrial point sources may contribute various forms of pollution. Some understanding of point source discharges in a watershed targeted for restoration is useful in helping to prioritize potential restoration projects. Permit information from the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) permit data base for the Bush River basin is summarized in the table below and on Map 7 MDE Permits. Characteristics of the these permitted discharges (volume, temperature, pollutants, etc.) are tracked by MDE through the permit system. Most of this information is accessible to the public and can be obtained from MDE.

Sod Run Waste Water Treatment Plant The the Sod Run Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) began operating in 1969 with a discharge to Romney Creek. By the late 1970s, the plant had expanded capacity from 4 million gallons per day (MGD) to 10 MGD. In October 1982, the discharge averaging about 5 MGD was moved to the Bush River in response to tightened discharge requirements for Romney Creek.9 In the Bush River watershed (02130701), the discharge from the Sod Run WWTP is the most important nutrient point source. For the year October 2000 to October 2001, the average effluent flow from the plant was 11 million gallons per day. The monthly average total phosphorus concentration for the period was 1.1 mg/l. For the same period, The monthly average total nitrogen concentration was 9.0 mg/l.27  21  Sept. 2002   MDE Permits Listing  Page 4 of 5 (Sept. 2001 data) Lower Winters Run Watershed 02130702 Atkisson Reservoir Watershed 02130703 Type / MDE Category Surface Water / Industrial Groundwater / Industrial Facility Name Tollgate Landfill Permit(s) MD/NPDES 96DP2887 MD0065765 95DP1318 96DP2890 97SW1247 97SW0539 00MM2282 00HT9423 MDG679423 95MM9708 MDG499708 00HT9510 MDG679510 Winters Run Edgewood Osburn Lane, Joppa Winters Run Lake Vista Drive, Joppa Old Mountain Rd, Joppa Winters Run Bel Air Road Receiving Stream / Location Winters Run North Tollgate Road, Bel Air Norrisville Rd, Jarrettsville Bel Air Rd, Bel Air  Jarrettsville Elementary Village Volvo Alcore, Inc.

However, nutrients and sediment are a significant issue in the watershed based on several sources:  Listing of the river under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act  Modeled nitrogen summary in the Water Quality Indicators section in this Watershed Characterization.  The Maryland Biological Stream Survey identified evidence of nonpoint source problems including erosion in the riparian area, streambank erosion and sedimentation. Several potential approaches for addressing nonpoint source pollution in the Bush River WRAS were identified in discussions between local representatives and DNR representatives:  Supporting development of nutrient management plans.  Promoting the marina pumpout program  especially for summer visitors on the Bush River.  Identification of septic system problems: existing and potential.  Supporting development of comprehensive conservation plans for agricultural operations.  Urban stormwater management  Lawn maintenance issues  Potential stream maintenance projects 1. Erosion and Sedimentation Some Soils in the Bush River basin are prone to erosion. (See the Soil Erodibility Indicator in the Land Use section.) Based on this limited assessment, the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy may incorporate projects for education and/or incentives for erosion and sediment control.  Sedimentation Research Findings From Otter Point Creek The presence of the Otter Point National Estuarine Reserve Research in the Bush River watershed has facilitated understanding of the relation between sediment deposition and local marshes. A brief summary of recently completed research is included below. Sediment deposition from upstream areas created river delta areas of Otter Point Creek. The physical dynamics of this tidal freshwater delta area have been extensively quantified and modeled.14 Research on the historic conditions indicate that pre-settlement sedimentation rates were about half of rates from later times when agriculture covered 40 to 50% of the watershed. The long term sediment accumulation rate in Otter Point Creek was as high as 5 cm-yr during the 1840 to 1900 period. This rate is comparable to other delta areas in the Upper Chesapeake Bay. 14 Recent sedimentation cycle study found that marsh areas are growing due to sediment accumulation and incorporation into the marsh matrix.15 Study of marsh areas that were previously sewage lagoons at Otter Point Creek indicates that they tend to act as nitrogen sinks.16 This action is similar to that of other marshes and suggests that these areas act to improve water quality in their vicinity. 24 Sept. 2002   2. Shorelines Wherever land and open water meet, change in the form of erosion or accretion of land is typically the inevitable result of natural processes. Human activity in these areas either tends to inadvertently accentuate these natural processes or purposefully attempts to control movement of water and/or loss of land. Erosion of shorelines can contribute significant amounts of nutrients (mostly phosphorus) and sediment (water column turbidity, habitat loss.) Historic records show that very large areas of land on the Bush River's western shore appeared since the arrival of the Europeans.8 This new land includes most of the Edgewood Area of the Aberdeen Proving Ground and the southern shores of Otter Point Creek. It may be inferred that formation of this land was caused by extremely high erosion and sedimentation rates associated with the land clearing and management of the past 300 years. Countywide shoreline erosion is summarized in the following table. 25 Harford County Shore Erosion Rate Summary (Miles of Shoreline) Total Shoreline Total Eroding Shoreline Erosion Rate 0 - 2 feet / year 30 2 - 4 feet / year 11 > 4 feet / year 5  140  46(33%)  Maps of historic shoreline change were produced by the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) in a cooperative effort between DNR and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Maps produced for Harford County in 1995 included digitized shorelines. Copies of these 1:24000 scale maps are available from the MGS. Updates of these maps should be available by the end of 2002.  25  Sept. 2002   Water Supply In the Bush River Basin, there are eight providers for community water supply systems. The majority use groundwater as their source water but two have surface sources as shown on Map 8 Water Supply. Information for the surface water systems are summarized in the table below. The community systems served by groundwater in the Bush River Basin are summarized in the table Groundwater Community Water Supply Permits. The groundwater sources serving these systems are mostly unconfined aquifers with the exception of the Potomac Group Aquifer which is tapped by the Harford County Dept. of Public Works. Well head protection areas have been established for the wells operated by Harford County and the City of Aberdeen as shown on the map.23 The groundwater sources used for community systems in the Bush River Basin do not employ near-surface groundwater, which is subject to potential local pollution sources. In general, near surface groundwater is credited with carrying nutrients, particularly nitrogen, from land sources to surface waters where nutrient over-enrichment is occurring. Potential Next Steps. A potential goal or objective for a WRAS could be augmentation of existing programs to protect community water systems by targeting projects or controls in watersheds above surface water intakes.

In an effort to gauge the affects of land use on water quality, and to allow comparison between watersheds, DNR has developed a series of Landscape Indicators. These indicators can be used to portray landscape conditions on a watershed scale that tend to support good water quality or that tend to degrade water quality. The 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan included a unified watershed assessment that used a number of landscape indicators to assess the State's 138 watersheds.2 Most indicators are relative measures by which a watershed like those in the Bush River Basin can be compared with the other 137 watersheds of similar size that together cover the entire State of Maryland. The following sections identify the findings for the watersheds in the Bush River Basin, with the exception of the population density indicator, which is based on 2000 Census data not available when the Unified Assessment was done.

Impervious Surface Based on estimates of imperious cover for each 8-digit watershed in the Bush River Basin averaged across each watershed, the percent of impervious surface cover varies from about 10% to over 30%. These findings for average imperviousness do not compare well with similar watersheds in Maryland.2 Roads, parking areas, roofs and other human constructions are collectively called impervious surface. Impervious surface blocks the natural seepage of rain into the ground. Unlike many natural surfaces, impervious surface typically concentrates stormwater runoff, accelerates flow rates and directs stormwater to the nearest stream. Watersheds with small amounts of impervious surface tend to have better water quality in local streams than watersheds with greater amounts of impervious surface. The Maryland Biological Stream Survey has related the percent of impervious surface in a watershed to the health of aquatic resources. For areas with less than 4% impervious cover, streams generally rate ""Fair"" to ""Good"" for both fish and instream invertebrates. Beyond about 12% impervious surface, streams generally rate ""Poor"" to ""Fair"" for both. Side-effects of impervious surfaces become increasingly significant and negative as the percentage of impervious area increases. Examples of related problems include reduction of groundwater infiltration, increased soil and stream bank erosion, sedimentation, destabilization or loss of aquatic habitat, and ""flashy"" stream flows (reduced flow between storms and excessive flows associated with storms.) The impervious surface estimate used for this indicator was generated for the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action report. Each land use type in the 1994 Maryland State Planning land use data was assigned an estimated imperviousness taken from the TR-55 manual used by the former Soil Conservation Service. To create a benchmark for comparing impervious area among Maryland watersheds, the percent of impervious area for 8-digit watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. All of the Bush River watersheds exceeded this benchmark. 2. Population Density According to 2000 Census data, the population density in the watersheds in the Bush River Basin varied from less than one person per acre in the Aberdeen Proving Ground watershed to more than three people per acre in the Bynum Run watershed. The figures in the table differ from those that appeared in the 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment . A comparison with other watersheds in the state has not been completed using the 2000 census data.2 While population density may be beyond the scope of a WRAS, directing growth is a potential WRAS component. As human population increases, effects of human activity that tend to degrade, displace or eliminate natural habitat also tends to increase. Watersheds with higher populations, assuming other factors are equal, tend to exhibit greater impacts on waterways and habitat. However, growth can be directed in ways to reduce negative impacts.  29  Sept. 2002   3. Historical Wetland Loss The estimated historic loss of wetlands in watersheds in the Bush River Basin varies from a relatively very small 258 acres in the Aberdeen Proving Ground watershed to over 9700 acres in the Bush River watershed. This range of estimated wetland loss in Bush River Basin watersheds is relatively small compared with other similar Maryland watersheds.2 This interpretation is based on the assumption that the hydric soils in the watershed were all, at one time, wetlands. Thoughtful selective restoration of historic wetland areas can be an effective WRAS component. In most of Maryland's watersheds, extensive wetland areas have been converted to other uses by draining and filling. This conversion unavoidably reduces or eliminates the natural functions that wetlands provide. To create a benchmark for comparing impervious area among Maryland watersheds, the historic wetland loss acreage for 8-digit watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. All of the watersheds in the Bush River Basin did not exceed the benchmark because they were not found to be in the highest quartile. 4. Unbuffered Streams According to data used for the 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment , only the Bynum Run watershed in the Bush River Basin had a relatively high percentage of unbuffered streams compared to other similar Maryland watersheds.2 DNR recommends that forested buffer 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream, is typically necessary to promote high quality aquatic habitat and diverse aquatic populations. Replacement of natural vegetation adjacent to streams can be a valuable and relatively inexpensive WRAS element. In most of Maryland, trees are key to healthy natural streams. They provide numerous essential habitat functions: shade to keep water temperatures down in warm months, leaf litter ""food"" for aquatic organisms, roots to stabilize stream banks, vegetative cover for wildlife, etc. In general, reduction or loss of riparian trees / stream buffers degrades stream habitat while replacement of trees / natural buffers enhances stream habitat. (For this indicator only ""blue line streams"" were included. Intermittent streams were not considered.) This estimate of streams lacking forested buffer was generated for the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan by using Maryland Department of State Planning GIS data for streams and for 1994 land use. To create a benchmark for comparing impervious area among Maryland watersheds, the percent of unbuffered streams for 8-digit watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Bynum Run watershed exceed the benchmark because it was in the highest quartile. The other watersheds in the Bush River basin did not exceed the benchmark because they were not in the highest quartile.  30  Sept. 2002   5. Soil Erodibility For four of the watersheds in the Bush River Basin (Lower Winters Run, Atkisson Reservoir, Bynum Run and Swan Creek), the average soil erodibilty of lands within 1000 feet of streams is greater than 0.30 value/acre which suggests that control of soil erosion is particularly important in these watersheds.2 For the Bush River watershed and the Aberdeen Proving Ground watershed, the average soil erodibilty of lands within 1000 feet of streams is 0.18 and 0.01 value/acre which suggests that control of soil erosion is particularly important here.2 This estimate of soil erodibility was generated through an analysis of GIS data that incorporated the soil erodibility factor (K), slope steepness, land area within 1000 feet of streams and cropland within that 1000 feet buffer based on 1994 Maryland Department of State Planning land use data. Watersheds with more highly erodible soils are naturally more susceptible to surface erosion, sedimentation, streambank erosion and other problems related to soil movement. These negative effects of soil erodibility on water quality can be minimized through careful management. The soil erodibility indicator accounts for natural soil conditions but not for management of the land. (Existing crop land management was not considered.) The naturally erodible soils in the watershed are addressed by techniques called Best Management Practices (BMPs) to prevent soil loss that are typically in use on local farms. BMPs like no-till, reduced till, cover crops, field strips, and others significantly reduce erosion and sediment movement. These BMPs can be seen in use in many places in the watershed. A WRAS can reasonably promote a reduction in disturbance of erodible soils and/or effective soil conservation practices like planting stream buffers. Because soils can vary significantly within very small areas, a generalized erodibility indicator must be used with caution and supplemented with site-specific evaluation prior to implementing any management action. To compare Maryland watersheds for this index, the benchmark of 0.275 value/acre was used, i.e. less than 0.275 was considered relatively beneficial for water quality and 0.275 or greater was considered to be a likely factor for water quality problems.  31  Sept. 2002   2000 Land Use / Land Cover The following table and pie chart summarize the Year 2000 land use for the Bush River Basin. Viewing these land uses as potential nonpoint sources of nutrients, agricultural lands are likely to dominate loads to local waterways. Map 9 2000 Land Use / Land Cover shows the distribution of lands in the watershed. Just under 37% of the Bush River Basin is forest. This is up from the estimated 20% forest cover in the same area at the beginning of the 20th Century, which was the peak of deforestation in the area.14  Bush River Basin 2000 Land Use, 6-Digit Watershed  Agriculture (23.30%) Urban (34.74%)  Wetlands (4.92%) Other (0.45%)  Forest (36.59%)  2000 Land Use / Land Cover Bush River Basin in Harford County Watershed Area in Acres (Md Dept. of Planning) Lower Winters Run Bynum Run Bush River Swan Creek 5,350 5,481 5,117 99 84 16,131 16,862 Category Aberdeen PG Atkisson Reservoir  Agriculture Forest and Brush Urban Wetlands Other Land & Land Water Only Watershed Total  7,318 17,395 9,169 2,683 402 36,967 45,837  1,370 3,406 3,444 163 16 8,399 8,468  11,488 7,569 9,913 28 23 29,021 29,076  3,345 3,413 7,780 0 39 14,577 14,583  219 8,426 7,959 3,176 0 19,780 21,625  29,090 45,690 43,382 6,149 564 124,875 136,451  32  Sept. 2002  Total   Bush River Basin 2000 Land Use  8-Digit Watershed Pie Charts  Bush River 8-Digit Watershed Agriculture (19.80%)  Lower Winters Run 8-Digit Watershed Agriculture (16.31%) Urban (41.00%)  Urban (24.80%)  Wetlands (7.26%) Other (1.09%) Forest (47.06%) Wetlands (1.94%) Other (0.19%) Forest (40.55%)  Atkisson Reservoir 8-Digit Watershed  Bynum Run 8-Digit Watershed  Agriculture (22.95%)  Urban (34.16%)  Agriculture (39.59%) Urban (53.37%)  Wetlands (0.10%) Other (0.08%) Forest (26.08%)  Forest (23.41%) Other (0.27%) Wetlands (0.00%)  Aberdeen PG 8-Digit Watershed Agriculture (1.11%)  Swan Creek 8-Digit Watershed  Urban (31.72%)  Agriculture (33.17%)  Urban (40.24%)  Forest (42.60%) Wetlands (0.61%) Other (0.52%)  Wetlands (16.06%)  Other (0.00%)  Forest (33.98%)  33  Sept. 2002   Large Forest Blocks / Forest Interior Large blocks of forest land cover are incorporated into the Green Infrastructure of the landscape. Within large blocks of forest, habitat is available for species that are specialized for conditions with relatively little influence by species from open areas or humans. For example, forest interior dwelling birds require forest interior habitat for their survival and they can not tolerate much human presence. Map 10 Forest Interior shows blocks of contiguous forest that are at least 50 acres in size with at least 10 acres of forest interior (forest edge is at least 300 feet away). This size threshold was chosen to help ensure that the forest interior is large enough to likely provide significant habitat for sensitive forest interior dwelling species. While blocks of forest interior cover about 22% of the entire Bush River Basin, the amount of large-block forest interior varies significantly among the 8-digit watersheds in the river basin as summarized in the table below:  About one third of the two watersheds abutting the Chesapeake Bay (Bush River and Aberdeen PG) are covered by large blocks of forest interior.  Bynum Run watershed has the least forest interior cover relative to other Bush River watersheds.  The three remaining 8-digit watersheds in the Bush River Basin have similar amounts of forest interior cover (between 14% and 18%).

In the GIS application developed by Maryland DNR and its partners, Green Infrastructure refers to areas of natural vegetation and habitat that have statewide or regional importance as defined by criteria developed by DNR. The criteria for identifying of lands as Green Infrastructure is limited to considering natural resource attributes currently found on those lands. One example of the criteria is that interior forest and wetlands complexes at least 250 acres in size are considered as part of Green Infrastructure. As a second example, sensitive species habitat that is located within areas of natural vegetation at least 100 acres in size is also counted as Green Infrastructure. Other potential attributes of Green Infrastructure lands, such as ownership or if the current natural conditions are protected in some way, are not criteria for Green Infrastructure but they may be considered independently. Within the Green Infrastructure network, large blocks of natural areas are called hubs and the existing or potential connections between them are called links or corridors. Together the hubs and corridors form the Green Infrastructure network which can be considered the backbone of the region's natural environment. Protection of Green Infrastructure lands may be addressed through various existing programs including Rural Legacy, Program Open Space, conservation easements and others. The 2001 Maryland General Assembly approved $35 million for the Green Print program which is targeted primarily to protecting Green Infrastructure areas. This funding category is administered by Program Open Space. Map 11 Green Infrastructure shows several significant local characteristics of Green Infrastructure:  Bush River Basin Green Infrastructure hubs tend to be located in lowlands near the Chesapeake Bay in two 8-digit watersheds: Bush River and Aberdeen Proving Ground. These hubs appear to exist because of the protection from development pressure afforded by Federal ownership/management. Another large hub is located in the northern central portion of the Bush River watershed.  Lower Winters Run and Atkisson Reservoir watersheds have small Green Infrastructure hubs adjacent to major streams.  Bynum Run watershed has a small portion of a Green Infrastructure hub near its confluence with the Bush River. All other areas of natural vegetation in the watershed did not meet Green Infrastructure criteria (generally too small in size).  Swan Creek watershed has several Green Infrastructure hubs that are separated by the major highways serving the Baltimore / Philadelphia areas. Potential Next Steps. Green Infrastructure, Forest Interior Dwelling Species and other views of the landscape could be integrated into various local landuse planning and management scenarios.  35  Sept. 2002   Protected Lands As used in the context of watershed restoration, ""protected land"" includes any land with some form of long term limitation on conversion to urban / developed land use. This protection may be in various forms: public ownership for natural resource or recreational intent, private ownership where a third party acquired the development rights or otherwise acquired the right to limit use through the purchase of an easement and other mechanisms. The extent of ""protection"" varies greatly from one circumstance to the next. Therefore, for some protected land, it may be necessary to explore the details of land protection parcel by parcel through the local land records office to determine the true extent of protection. For purposes of watershed restoration, a knowledge of existing protected lands can provide a starting point in prioritizing potential restoration activities. In some cases, protected lands may provide opportunities for restoration projects because owners of these lands may value natural resource protection or enhancement goals. The table Protected Lands Summary and Map 12 Protected Land and Smart Growth summarize the status of protected lands in the Bush River basin.  In the Bush River Basin, Federal land ownership accounts for nearly one third of the land. Federal Land dominates land ownership in two watersheds: Bush River and Aberdeen Proving Ground.  Non-Federal land protection in the Lower Winters Run watershed is the highest percentage (9%) among watersheds (8-digit) in the Bush River Basin. This relatively high percentage of protection is mostly associated with the Otter Point Creek Park. This property has been designated as a component of the Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve in Maryland. A total of 261 acres of open water and 672 acres of adjoining wetlands and uplands are protected for long-term estuarine research and monitoring and for estuarine education. 4 Potential Next Steps. Existing protected lands could be assessed as potential contributors or hubs for WRAS implementation. Various types of opportunities could be explored:  Watershed location should be a factor in considering land protection opportunities.  Potential sites for implementation projects and/or demonstration projects.  Opportunities for management enhancement or additional protection.  Opportunities for expanding protection from currently protected land to adjacent parcels.  36  Sept. 2002   Protected Land Summary * Bush River Basin in Harford County Watershed Area Protected in Acres Lower Winters Run Bynum Run Bush River Swan Creek 247 0 136 0 0 719 2% 7% Category Aberdeen PG Atkisson Reservoir  Conservation Easements DNR Land County Parks Agricultural Easements Agricultural Districts Federal Land Percent of Watershed Protected  435 530 132 359 189 13,390 4% 41%  362 0 62 312 0 0 9% 9%  15 0 804 710 361 0 5% 7%  73 70 30 0 35 0 1% 1%  0 0 0 0 0 19,795 0% 100%  33,904 3% 31%  The percent on top excludes agricultural districts and Federal land.

In Rural Legacy Areas, protection of land from future development through purchase of easements (or in fee simple) is promoted. In Priority Funding Areas, State funding for infrastructure may be available to support development and redevelopment. Both are shown in Map 12 Protected Land and Smart Growth: - Harford County's Rural Legacy Area is located entirely outside of the Bush River Basin, which is mostly in the Deer Creek watershed. - Priority Funding Areas (PFA) in Harford County are mostly in the Bush River Basin with relatively small areas of PFA located in other County watershed areas. The table below shows the relative PFA area for the Bush River watersheds. Priority Funding Areas (PFA) Summary Bush River Basin Watershed PFA Acres Name Bush River Lower Winters Run Atkisson Reservoir Bynum Run Aberdeen PG Swan Creek Bush River Basin Total Acres 36,967 8,399 29,021 14,577 19,780 16,131 124,875 12,834 5,160 5,860 12,066 2,016 3,965 41,901 Percent of Watershed In PFA 35% 64% 20% 83% 10% 25% 34%  Note: Data is from 2000. Acreage in PFAs and protected land acreage are not mutually exclusive. It is common for park land, which is commonly considered to be protected, to be in a PFA to facilitate receiving State funding for park infrastructure. For example, Otter Creek Park is protected from development but it is entirely within a PFA. Therefore, protected land acreage and percentage of a watershed should only be used as an indicator of general direction for development.  38  Sept. 2002   Soils of the Bush River Basin 1. Interpreting Local Conditions with Natural Soil Groups Soil conditions, like soil type and moisture conditions, greatly affect how land may be used and the potential for vegetation and habitat on the land. Soil conditions are one determining factor Natural Soil Groups for water quality in streams and rivers. Local soil Bush River Basin conditions vary greatly from site to site as published information in the Soil Survey for Harford County shows. This complicated information can be effectively summarized using (27.21%) (29.91%) Natural Soil Groups to help identify useful generalizations about groups of soils. The pie chart shows the distribution of percentages of soils based on broad categories: (16.14%) -- Yellow - prime agricultural soils (26.74%) -- Green - all other well drained soils including stony/rocky soils -- Blue - all poorly drained soils including wetlands and marshes and soils with perched watertables. -- White - unclassified soils including all of Aberdeen Proving Ground The Map 13 Soils shows that prime farmland, depicted in yellow or yellow with crosshatching, is widely distributed across the Bush River Basin. 2. Soils and Watershed Planning Local soil conditions can be a useful element in watershed planning and for targeting restoration projects. Using Prime Farmland as an example, the scattered location of prime agricultural soils in the Bush River Basin suggests that agricultural preservation efforts need to be targeted to selected areas and prioritized for action to help ensure that protection efforts result in viable agricultural communities. Additionally, prioritization of agricultural cost share funding to these areas could provide additional incentive for local land owners to participate in agricultural preservation programs. Comparing Map 13 Soils with Map 9 2000 Land Use and Map 11 Green Infrastructure suggests other potential watershed planning approaches. For example, two Green Infrastructure hubs are located north of the tidal Bush River along upper James Run and Grays Run. In these areas, land owners tended to leave poor soils in natural vegetation because the soils were wet or stony. Targeting natural resource protection efforts to areas like this, which offer poor suitability for active use, could benefit both land owners and natural resource protection.  39  Sept. 2002   Wetlands 1. Introduction to Wetland Categories 26  The Bush River Basin has a great diversity of wetland types relative to other Maryland physiographic regions because it includes both Piedmont and Coastal Plain physiographic areas and it has both tidal and nontidal freshwater waterbodies. Map 14 Wetlands In The Bush River Basin shows the general distribution of wetlands based on the National Wetlands Inventory. The majority of the wetland acreage in the river basin is on Federal land Brief descriptions of the major wetland categories found in the River Basin are listed below. Estuarine Wetlands. These systems consist of brackish tidal waters and contiguous wetlands where freshwater runoff from the land receives some saltwater influence. Estuarine wetlands are abundant throughout the Bush River Basin's Coastal Plain covering nearly 5,700 acres. Brackish marshes are found along the shores of Chesapeake Bay and they are the predominant estuarine wetland type in Maryland. Estuarine shrub swamps are common along the Maryland coastal zone. Aquatic beds, comprised mostly of submerged aquatic vegetation, are abundant in shallow water zones of Maryland's estuaries, especially Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Palustrine wetlands. These systems are freshwater wetlands that are not associated with streams or lakes. In the Bush River Basin, this wetland type covers slightly more than 3,700 acres. These wetlands are found on floodplains along the freshwater tidal and nontidal portions of rivers and streams, in upland depressions, and in broad flat areas between otherwise distinct watersheds. Tidal freshwater swamps occur along coastal rivers in areas subject to tidal influence. Scrub-shrub swamps are not abundant but are represented in the Bush River Basin. Emergent wetlands on the Coastal Plain are characterized by a wide range of vegetation, depending on water regime. (Adapted from Wetlands of Maryland, Tiner and Burke, 1995.) Lacustrine wetlands (associated with lakes) and Riverine wetlands (associated with rivers) cover relatively small areas of the Bush River river basin: 54 acres and 21 acres respectively. 2. Wetland Studies In the Bush River Basin The presence of the Otter Point National Estuarine Reserve Research in the Bush River watershed has facilitated understanding of plant populations in local marshes. During the 1990s, a plant list for Otter Point Creek compiled by William Hilgartner identified 133 species of herbaceous plants and 39 species of woody plants.17  40  Sept. 2002   3. Tracking Wetlands Oversight of activities affecting wetlands involves several regulatory jurisdictions. The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) is the lead agency for the State and cooperates with DNR, the Army Corps of Engineers and other Federal and local agencies. As part of its responsibility, MDE tracks State permitting and the net gain or loss of wetlands over time. As the Wetlands Regulatory Status table shows, changes tracked in the State regulatory program have amounted to a small net increase in nontidal wetland acreage in the Bush River watershed. Research findings from Otter Point Creek associated with the Otter Point National Estuarine Reserve Research in the Bush River watershed has facilitated understanding of the changes over time in local marshes. According to research reported in 1998, the mix of wetland types in the upper Otter Point Creek tidal freshwater marshes has changed greatly since early colonial times. In about 1730, nearly the entire marsh area here was subtidal, i.e. the marsh was mostly underwater. By 1990, the same marsh area had changed so that its area was roughly one third subtidal, one third intertidal and one third forested.14 The change appears to be associated with sediment deposition and incorporation into the marsh.15 Tracking Nontidal Wetland Change In The Bush River Basin In Acres 1/1/1991 through 12/31/2001 20 Basin Code 02130701 02130702 02130703 02130704 02130705 02130706 021307 Watershed Bush River Lower Winters Run Atkisson Reservoir Bynum Run Aberdeen Proving Ground Swan Creek Permanent Impacts -8.01 -3.43 -3.55 -8.37 -0.13 -5.27 Permittee Mitigation 10.19 8.47 9.03 6.15 0 7.85 Programmatic Gains 0 0 0 0 0 2.20 Other Gains 0.76 0 0 0 0 0 Net 2.94 5.05 5.48 -2.22 -0.13 4.78  Bush River -28.75 41.71 2.20 0.76 15.91 Basin Notes: Only nontidal wetland changes are shown, tidal wetland changes are excluded.

Interpreting Wetland Distribution Wetlands in the Bush River Watershed (02130701) are shown in Map 15 Wetlands On NonFederal Land: Bush River Watershed. The table below accompanies the map with a summary of wetland categories and acreage. Based on the DNR wetlands data used for the map, forested fresh water wetlands are the largest category of wetlands in this area. The data source used for this interpretation has not been completed for the entire Bush River Basin. In the context of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS), wetlands serve valuable water quality and habitat functions that may not be provided by other land uses. Therefore, protection and enhancement of existing wetlands, and restoration of past wetland areas, can be a valuable element in the WRAS. (Also see the Wetland Restoration section.)

However, coverage for the Bush River Basin (021307) is incomplete. The National Wetlands Inventory is available for the entire Bush River Basin but it has a lower resolution and, therefore, identifies a smaller wetland acreage for the same geographic area. In comparison, the generalized land use / land cover data presented earlier in this chapter is the lowest resolution data that identifies wetlands and, therefore, identifies even fewer wetlands in the same geographic area. See the Sensitive Species Section for discussion on Wetlands of Special State Concern.  42  Sept. 2002   Floodplains and Low Elevation Areas Subject to Sea Level Rise Floodplains and associated riparian areas are naturally important areas for habitat and hydrologic functioning of streams. Map 16 Floodplain shows that the most 100-year floodplains in the Bush River Basin are located on Federal land. On non-Federal land, two of the largest 100-year floodplain areas are on lower Winters Run and near the confluence of Bynum Run and James Run. Most floodplain areas are too small to be seen at the basin-wide scale and require subwatershed scale or smaller assessment. Most areas of the Bush River Basin have sufficient elevation to be unaffected by any potential for sea level rise in the next 50 to 100 years. As a gauge of potential sea level rise risk, a Marylandwide assessment of land with an elevation of 1.5 meters or less was first published in 1998 and then repackaged in a 2000 State report. According to this report, all the at-risk areas identified in the Bush River Basin are on Federally managed land.24 Currently, DNR is considering sea level rise as it works to improve prediction of shoreline erosion. New information that may be generated by this effort will be shared with local jurisdictions and other stakeholders as it becomes available. Potential Next Steps. Protection of people and property has always been the core of floodplain management. Additional objectives for watershed management relative to floodplains may include conservation of habitat, targeting for restoration of wetlands and stream buffers, and prioritization for protecting selected areas from development or inappropriate uses. Using information gathered in the Stream Corridor Assessment, restoring natural floodplain and wetland function can be one criteria for prioritizing stream restoration projects. Maintaining stable floodplains on a watershed-wide basis can be a factor in determining stormwater management requirements including control of impervious area in a watershed.  43  Sept. 2002   LIVING RESOURCES AND HABITAT  Overview Living resources, including all the animals, plants and other organisms that call the land and waters of the Bush River watershed home, are being affected by human activity. The information summarized here suggests that some of the significant stresses on living resources in the watershed are manipulation of habitat, excessive movement of sediment and excessive availability of nutrients. The Living Resource information summarized here should be considered a partial representation because numerous areas of potential interest or concern could not be included due to lack of information, time or resources. For example, information on many forms of aquatic life, woodland communities, terrestrial habitats and other factors should be considered as watershed restoration decisions are being made. Therefore, it is recommended that stakeholders in the watershed identify important living resource issues or priorities so that additional effort can be focused where it is most needed. New information should be added or referenced as it becomes available.  44  Sept. 2002   Living Resource Indicators Aquatic organisms are sensitive, in varying degrees, to changes in water quality and aquatic habitat. This association offers two perspectives that are important for watershed restoration. First, improvements for living resources offer potential goals, objectives and opportunities to gauge progress in watershed restoration. Second, the status of selected species can be used as to gauge local conditions for water quality and habitat. This second perspective is the basis for using living resources as an ""indicator."" The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan published in 1998 listed the following living resource indicators for the Bush River Basin.2 In the table below, ""attain"" means watershed conditions are at least as good as the benchmark. ""Exceed"" means that watershed conditions are not as good as the benchmark. An empty box in the table """", means that an indicator could not be generated. Several of these indices rely on index rankings generated from a limited number of sampling sites which were then generalized to represent entire watersheds. Considering this limitation on field data, it may be beneficial to conduct additional assessments to provide a more complete understanding of local conditions as part of the WRAS.  Lower Winters Run  Bynum Run  SAV Abundance Index SAV Habitat Requirement Attainment Non-Tidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity Non-Tidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity Non-Tidal In-stream Habitat Index  1.0 2.0 ----  ------  --4.4 8.50 5.98  ---8.30 6.01  ------  NOTES: Click on the indicator name to link to its description and interpretation. Unshaded indicators in the table grid mean that average watershed conditions measured by this indicator are better than the Statewide benchmark. Shaded indicators mean that average watershed conditions measured by this indicator are worse than the Statewide benchmark, i.e. water quality problems are more likely to arise due to the conditions represented by the indicator.  45  Swan Creek ---- Sept. 2002  Bush River  APG  Living Resource Indicator  Atkisson Reservoir   1. SAV Abundance For tidal areas of the Bush River watershed, the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) scored ""1.0"" for the Abundance Indicator which means that SAV covered 10% or less of the potential SAV habitat. This indicator is designed to allow comparison of watersheds based on actual SAV acreage versus potential SAV acreage. To generate the score for this indicator, two measurements of SAV area were estimated: 1) area covered by SAV in the year 1996 was measured using aerial survey data, and 2) the potential SAV area was measured based on water depth (up to two meters deep), physical characteristics and historic occurrence of SAV. The benchmark used in the Unified Watershed Assessment of the Clean Water Action Plan for the SAV Abundance Index was 10%. If less than 10% of the potential SAV area in a watershed was covered by SAV in 1996, then the watershed was listed in the category ""needs improvement"". If more than 10% of the potential SAV area in a watershed was covered by SAV in 1996, then the watershed was listed in the category ""needs preventative action"" to protect or enhance SAV abundance. No watershed in the State scored higher than 2, reflecting a maximum observed coverage of 20%. 2. SAV Habitat For tidal areas of the Bush River watershed, the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) scored ""2.0"" for the Habitat Index which means that SAV habitat requirements were not met based on 1994-1996 data. This index is designed to allow comparison of watersheds based on several measurements of habitat conditions: water clarity as measured by secchi depth, dissolved inorganic nitrogen where applicable, dissolved inorganic phosphorus, abundance of algae as measured by Chlorophyll a and total suspended solids. The benchmark used in the Unified Watershed Assessment for the SAV Habitat Index was 7. A score less than 7 means that the watershed's habitat conditions were not favorable for SAV and the watershed was listed as being in need of restoration (Category 1). A score of 7 or higher means that 1994 through 1996 data showed that habitat conditions for SAV in a watershed were sufficient and the watershed was listed in the category for ""restoration needed"". 3. Nontidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) 21 The Coastal Plain stream benthic IBI looks at the insects and other invertebrates, like crayfish, living on the bottoms of streams, considering the overall community composition, the number and diversity of species and the presence of sensitive species. To calculate the benthic IBI, for the Unified Watershed Assessment , reference conditions were established for minimally-impacted streams. IBI values are relative to conditions in these minimally-impacted streams. To create a benchmark for this index, local stream scores in the watershed were compared to reference conditions established for minimally impacted streams. An average benthic IBI less than 6.0 for a watershed caused it to be listed as ""needs restoration"". The Atkisson Reservoir watershed's ranking of less than 6.0 caused it to be listed as ""needs restoration"" for this index.  46  Sept. 2002   4. Nontidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) 21 As interest in whole ecosystems, and ecosystem health, has grown, Indexes of Biotic Integrity (IBIs) for fishes have been developed for small (first- to third-order) non-tidal streams. Several characteristics of the fish community are measured-- numbers of native species, of benthic species and of tolerant individuals; the percent of tolerant species, of dominant species, and of generalists, omnivores and insectivores; the number of individuals per square meter; biomass in grams per square meter; percent of lithophilic spawners; and percent insectivores. These characteristics are scored and summed to calculate a fish IBI for each sampled stream. Scores for watersheds are reported as means for the sites within each watershed (one most degraded, 10 best condition). To create a benchmark for this index, local stream scores in the watershed were compared to reference conditions established for minimally impacted streams. An average fish IBI less than 6.0 for a watershed caused it to be listed as ""needs restoration"". The Atkisson Reservoir and Bynum Run watersheds both had higher index ranks higher than 6.0. 5. Nontidal In-stream Habitat Index 21 In the Bush River Basin two watersheds had sufficient data for assessment in the nontidal instream habitat index. Both the Atkisson Reservoir and Bynum Run watersheds received a score of 6 out of a possible range of scores from 1 (worst) to 10 (best). Of 138 watersheds in Maryland, the 34 (25%) with the lowest nontidal in-stream habitat index received a rank of ""exceed"" and were designated as Category 1 watersheds in need of restoration. This index allows comparison of streams based fish and benthic habitat as measured by in-stream and riparian conditions. For each stream site that was assessed, visual field observations are used to score the site for substrate type, habitat features, bank conditions, riparian vegetation width, remoteness, aesthetic value and other factors. These scores are then integrated to generate a single rank for each stream site.  47  Sept. 2002   Fish and Shellfish 1. Tidal Waters The Bush River is an important spawning and nursery ground for many fish species.19 A survey conducted during the period March 1972 to June 1973 found that the Bush River has considerable spawning by several anadromous, semi-anadromous and local species. These included the commercially important species of striped bass, white perch and herring. It found a wide range of types of fish inhabiting the area. However, two species were clearly dominant in numbers: white perch were said to be ubiquitous and anchovy were found seasonally. 19 Commercial fisheries harvest information is tracked by Maryland DNR Fisheries Service. This information is available on DNR's Internet site. The Bush River's data is reported for several important commercial species as part of the Upper Chesapeake Bay geographic area (above Worton Point). Reporting for other commercially harvested species is not summarized here because reports are for even larger geographic areas.  Blue Crabs: Commercial harvest reporting for blue crabs groups Bush River data with the Upper Chesapeake Bay above Worton Point. For this wider area, commercial blue crab harvest for the 1992 to 1999 was significantly higher than in previous years. Since 1992, the annual harvest tended to be greater that 1 million pounds with a significantly higher peak in 1995 of 2,266,000 pounds.  Oysters: There is no commercial oyster harvest in the Bush River because the regulatory shellfish harvesting restrictions prevent oyster harvest. Even so, the commercial harvest in the entire Upper Chesapeake Bay is a minuscule percentage of the Bay-wide harvest. The very low salinity of the area inhibits oyster habitat and survival.  Striped Bass: The reported annual harvest for striped bass in 1999 from the Bush River was 5,583 pounds. Prior to 1999, Bush River data was reported as part of the Upper Chesapeake Bay (north of Worton Point). During the late 1990s, the annual harvest for the Upper Bay including the Bush River was typically around 70,000 pounds with one exception in 1998 with a larger harvest of 97,000 pounds. The Chesapeake Bay's most important striped bass spawning and nursey area is considered to be the Upper Chesapeake Bay based on area size and productivity. The estuarine areas of the Bush River Basin may contribute to the productivity of this area but the relative value of the Bush River is not well understood. 2. Nontidal Areas General information on fish in nontidal streams is primarily gathered as part of the Maryland Biological Stream Survey. See MBSS Findings for summary information. The Designated Use of Bynum Run as Use 3 Natural Trout Waters suggests that brook trout where found here. However, DNR Fisheries Service has no records that naturally reproducing trout populations exist anywhere in the Bush River Basin.28 48 Sept. 2002   3. Fish Consumption In late 2001, MDE issued revised fish consumption advisories including significant limitations on consumption of some fish species in the Bush River area. The advisory recommends not eating channel catfish and severely limiting meals of white perch caught in the Bush River mainstem. The concern in these fish is contamination from PCBs and/or pesticides. Methylmercury is also a contaminate of concern primarily for some fish species caught in lakes. The table below summarizes advisory for areas in the Bush River Basin. More complete information is available at www.mde.state.md.us/fish_tissue/index.html In issuing the 2001 advisory, MDE cited changes in the EPA's recommended daily consumption estimates, new sampling data and improved analytical techniques, which led to advisories to limit consumption of 13 species of fish recreationally caught in 14 Maryland waterways. While contaminant levels have not changed, the consumption advisories are especially important for children and women of child-bearing age who are or may become pregnant or are nursing. Bush River Basin - 2001 Advisory On Fish Consumption Recommended Maximum Allowable Meals Per Month Species Channel Catfish White Perch Smallmouth & Largemouth Bass, Pickerel, Northern Pike, Walleye Bluegill Area Bush River mainstem Bush River mainstem Lakes and other impoundments Rivers and streams Lakes and other impoundments General Population 8oz meal 0 1 4 no advisory 8 Women 6oz meal 0 1 4 8 8 Children 3oz. meal 0 0 2 8 8 Methylmercury PCBs, Pesticides Contaminant  49  Sept. 2002   Algae Based on surveys conducted in 1972-73, the Bush River estuary was found to be rich in phytoplankton throughout most of the spring, summer and early autumn. The survey found nothing peculiar, special or unusual regarding the phytoplankton community. Of the six most common species found, five were diatoms and one was a bluegreen algae. As an indicator of the extent of green algae populations, chlorophyll a concentrations only occasionally reached high levels above 50 ug/l. The highest chlorophyll a concentration reported during the study was 139 ug/l.19  Maryland Biological Stream Survey  21, 22  Assessment of biological communities in nontidal streams, like macroinvertebrates, fish and their physical habitat can help with interpretation of aquatic conditions from the perspective of living resources. The Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) has been conducting these assessments Statewide since 1994. More recently, beginning in the year 2000, MBSS has also facilitated collection of benthic macroinvertebrate information by citizen volunteers in the Stream Waders program. The MBSS approach involves assessment of each site using a suite of criteria including identification of fish and benthic macroinvertebrate species present. The findings from the criteria are then combined to generate an index for benthic organisms, fish and for physical habitat. The table below shows the scales used to rate findings for the sites shown on the accompanying maps and the table MBSS Findings Summary for the period 1994 through 2000. Additional explanation of the purpose and value of assessing benthic organisms is presented in the text box Why Look At Benthos In Streams . More complete information on the MBSS program and findings for each sampling site is available at http://mddnr.chesapeakebay.net/mbss/search.cfm . Map 17 Benthic Index Scale of 1 to 5 1 to 1.99 2 to 2.99 3 to 3.99 4 to 5 Map 18 Fish Index Scale of 1 to 5 1 to 1.99 2 to 2.99 3 to 3.99 4 to 5 Map 19 Physical Habitat Index Scale of 0 to 100 0 to 11.99 12 to 41.99 42 to 71.99 72 to 100  Category Very Poor Poor Fair Good  The surveys reported in the map were conducted by the Maryland Biologcial Stream Survey (MBSS), a program in DNR. Each symbol on the map characterizes a stream segment (about 100 feet) based on the fish/benthic population and habitat conditions. An index of ""good"" means that the stream segment that was sampled has conditions that are close to those found in a comparable 50 Sept. 2002   ""reference"" stream. Reference streams are found to have the most natural, least impacted stream conditions found in the area for a particular type of stream. Other index findings varying from fair to poor to very poor deviate further and further from reference stream conditions. Additional monitoring by MBSS is scheduled for the Bush River Basin to assess the in-stream aquatic community and habitat conditions in 2002 (10 sites) and in 2003 (10 sites.)10 Sampling by citizen volunteers in the MBSS Stream Waders program is anticipated to continue during this time. Potential Next Steps. MBSS provides site-specific information on nontidal streams that can be considered in the WRAS process to prioritize potential restoration and protection projects. Additionally, for selected streams or project areas, before and after monitoring using MBSS methods can provide a gauge of success for individual projects. MBSS methods can also provide a measure of progress toward water quality improvement goals based on biological indicators.

Benthos are sometimes called ""stream bugs"" though that name overly simplifies the diverse membership of this group. Unimpaired natural streams may support a great diversity of species ranging from bacteria and algae, to invertebrates like crayfish and insects, to fish, reptiles and mammals. Benthic macro-invertebrates, collectively called benthos, are an important component of a stream's ecosystem. This group includes mayflies, caddisflies, crayfish and similar creatures. that inhabit the stream bottom, its sediments, organic debris and live on plant life (macrophytes) within the stream. The food web in streams relies significantly on benthos. Benthos are often the most abundant source of food for fish and other small animals. Many benthic macroinvertebrates live on decomposing leaves and other organic materials in the stream. By this activity, these organisms are significant processors of organic materials in the stream. Benthos often provide the primary means that nutrients from organic debris are transformed to other biologically usable forms. These nutrients become available again and are transported downstream where other organisms use them. Benthos are a valuable tool for stream evaluation. This group of species has been extensively evaluated for use in water quality assessment, in evaluating biological conditions of streams and in gauging influences on streams by surrounding lands. Benthos serve as good indicators of water resource integrity because they are fairly sedentary in nature and their diversity offers numerous ways to interpret conditions. They have different sensitivities to changing conditions. They have a wide range of functions in the stream. They use different life cycle strategies for survival.  52  Sept. 2002   Sensitive Species Sensitive species are most widely known in the form of Federally-listed Endangered or Threatened animals such as the bald eagle. In addition to these charismatic rare animals, both US EPA and Maryland DNR work through their respective Federal and State programs to protect numerous endangered, threatened, or rare species of plants and animals and the habitats that support those species. For the purposes of watershed restoration, it is valuable to account for known locations of habitat for these species. These places are often indicators, and sometimes important constituents, of the network of natural areas or ""green infrastructure"" that are the foundation for many essential natural watershed processes. Protecting these species and/or promoting expansion of their habitats can be an effective foundation for a watershed restoration program. 1. Habitat Protection Categories DNR's Wildlife and Heritage Division uses three designations for areas providing habitat for sensitive species. These designations are described in the text box Maryland's Sensitive Species Protection Areas. As shown in Map 20 Sensitive Species, two of the three sensitive species designations are found in the Bush River Basin. The purpose of these designations is to help protect sensitive species and their habitat through the review of applications for State permits or approvals, and review of projects that involve State funds. For the types of projects potentially described above, DNR makes recommendations and/or requirements to protect sensitive species and their habitat. These categories do not place requirements on any activities that do not require a permit/approval or do not involve State funds. However, there are State and Federal restrictions that address ""takings"" of protected species that apply more broadly. In addition, many counties have incorporated safeguards for these areas into their project and permit review processes. In all instances, property owners are encouraged to seek advice on protecting the sensitive species / habitat within their ownership. More details and guidance can be requested from DNR Natural Heritage Division staff.  53  Sept. 2002   2. Wetlands of Special State Concern The Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) in the Bush River Basin are shown in Map 20 Sensitive Species though most are difficult to see at the scale of the map. The largest groupings of the WSSCs are listed in the summary table below. Wetlands of Special State Concern  Areas of Concentration In The Bush River Basin Watershed Name Bush River Watershed 02130701 Acres 28 Stream Vicinity Otter Point Creek North of Sod Run Church Creek Atkisson Reservoir 02130703 Swan Creek 02130706 Bush River Basin 021307 37 44 109 Atkisson Reservoir Swan and Gasheys Creeks, Chesapeake Bay shore area Community Vicinity Flying Point Road / Willoughby Woods area South of Perryman Road, ""Perryman Woods"" area North of Rt 40, ""Church Creek Pond"" Harford Glen Center and Aberdeen PG property Oakington Road, Swan Harbor Farm Park  3. Maryland Darter In the Swan Creek watershed (02130706), Gashey's Run was declared critical habitat for the Federally endangered Maryland darter by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 1984. This designation, in part, means that the US Fish and Wildlife Service reviews activities that meet two conditions 1) a federal permit, license and/or funding in involved, and; 2) there is a potential to impact the species or its habitat.26  54  Sept. 2002   Sensitive Species Protection Areas in the Bush River Basin  Sensitive Species Project Review Area (SSPRA) At least 26 SSPRAs are identified in the Bush River Basin. Each SSPRA contains one or more sensitive species habitats. However, the entire SSPRA is not considered sensitive habitat. The SSPRA is an envelope identified for review purposes to help ensure that applications for permit or approval in or near sensitive areas receive adequate attention and safeguards for the sensitive species / habitat they contain. Also see Map 20 Sensitive Species.  Natural Heritage Area (NHA) No NHAs are located in the Bush River basin (Md 6-digit wateshed). NHAs are rare ecological communities that encompass sensitive species habitat. They are designated in State regulation COMAR 08.03.08.10. For any proposed project that requires a State permit or approval that may affect an NHA, recommendations and/or requirements are placed in the permit or approval that are specifically aimed at protecting the NHA. To help ensure that proposed projects that may affect an NHA are adequately reviewed, an SSPRA is always designated to encompass each NHA and the area surrounding it.  Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) There are three concentrations of WSSCs designated in the WRAS project area and several are designated elsewhere in the Bush River Basin. These wetlands are associated with one or more sensitive species habitats that are in or near the wetland. For any proposed project that requires a wetland permit, these selected wetlands have additional regulatory requirements beyond the permitting requirements that apply to wetlands generally. To help ensure that proposed projects that may affect a WSSC are adequately reviewed, an SSPRA is always designated to encompass each WSSC and the area surrounding it. For a listing of designated sites see COMAR 26.23.06.01 at www.dsd.state.md.us  55  Sept. 2002   Submerged Aquatic Vegetation The well-defined link between water quality and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) distribution/abundance makes SAV communities good barometers of the health of estuarine ecosystems. In addition to its value as a water quality indicator, SAV is also a critical nursery habitat for many estuarine species. For example, blue crab ""post-larvae"" are up to 30 times more abundant in SAV beds than adjacent unvegetated areas. Additionally, several species of waterfowl depend on SAV for food when they over-winter in the Chesapeake region. Map 21 Submerged Aquatic Vegetation shows that during the 1980s and 1990s distribution of SAV in the Bush River basin is generally very sparse. Within the WRAS project area, all the SAV areas that were large enough to identify using aerial photography were located adjacent to Federal land. Elsewhere in the Bush River Basin, the largest concentration of SAV has been near Swan Creek. Experience obtained through years of monitoring SAV demonstrates that acreage in the Bush River fluctuates from year to year. For example, SAV acreage in Bush River during the year 2000 was at least 17% and 12 acres greater than acreage in 1999.29 The map also shows that potential SAV habitat area based on a water depth of two meters or less. This shallow depth covers extensive areas of the Bush River and the perimeter of the Bush River Basin adjacent to the Chesapeake Bay. It is believed that the limitations exhibited by historic SAV distribution compared to potential habitat relate in part to excessive nutrient and suspended sediment loads in the Bush River and the Upper Chesapeake Bay. The nutrient loads appear to be driving algae growth that competes with SAV for sunlight. Additionally, suspended sediment also blocks the sunlight which reduces the light that reaches SAV leaves. Potential Next Steps. Beginning in early 2002, Harford County and numerous Federal and State agencies began cooperating to pool their information on SAV and to generate a consensus on SAV management for the Bush River. The findings and results of this effort can be integrated into the local watershed management strategy. The Anita C. Leight Estuary Center and Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (CBNERR) will begin a long term research and restoration project to restore native SAV species to Otter Point Creek and surrounding waters. The staff are using innovative ""SAV planting grids"" and will be using multiple species of SAV to determine the most suitable species, or combination of species, for restoration to the site. Also see Related Projects.  56  Sept. 2002   RESTORATION TARGETING TOOLS 2002 Stream Corridor Assessment Using the Stream Corridor Assessment Methodology (SCAM) developed and applied by the DNR Watershed Restoration Division, valuable information can be compiled to assist in targeting restoration activities. In partnership with Harford County, DNR is conducting a Stream Corridor Assessment on Church Creek in the Bush River watershed in 2002. Trained teams from the Maryland Conservation Corps will walk along streams to identify and document potential problems and restoration opportunities such as the items listed below: DNR will provide a report for County use. Stream Corridor Assessment Data Collection Categories Pipe Outfalls Pond Sites Tree Blockages Inadequate Buffers Erosion Fish Blockages Exposed Pipe Unusual Conditions Trash Dumping In or Near Stream Construction  Potential Next Steps. Harford County has demonstrated success in using Stream Corridor Assessments to identify restoration projects. For the WRAS, this information can be used as a foundation to prioritize/target geographic areas for restoration and/or types of projects for implementation in a watershed-based management strategy.  Recent Stream Corridor Assessments Harford has completed several Stream Corridor Assessments in the Bush River Basin including Bynum Run (1995-1996), Swan Creek (Spring 1994 - Spring 1995) and Winters Run (1998). Each report identifies each site where problems are identified and ranks its severity relative to other sites. Each report also singles out specific sites that are considered particularly severe. As an example of this work, the table below summarizes the findings from the Bynum Run effort.7  57  Sept. 2002   Bynum Run Stream Corridor Assessment Findings Matrix for Winter 1995-1996 Potential Problems Identified Count Length Est. feet / miles 86,818 / 16.4 Severity Frequency 1 23 24 45 62,954 / 11.9 12,554 / 2.4 14 15 1 6 2 3,100 / 0.6 2 132 2 50 8 26 22 3 5 5 1 -120 3 82 33 35 47 20 9 6 4 2 238 4 49 43 22 22 19 2 1 2 -160 5 11 64 15 13 14 7 5 1 5 135  Erosion (stream banks) Pipe Outfalls Fish Blockages Inadequate Buffers, Unshaded Streams Channel Alternation Exposed Pipe Unusual Conditions Trash Dumping Livestock TOTAL  214 172 143 118 71 24 23 10 9 784  2002 Synopic Survey and Benthic Community Assessment Based on 2002 sampling in the Bush River watershed, DNR staff will report on water quality in nontidal streams to supplement knowledge of local conditions. Based on parameters listed below, the survey findings will help identify problem areas and relative conditions among local streams. It will also help rank subwatersheds by their nutrient load contributions to tidal areas of the Bush River. For the same 2002 sampling sites, DNR staff will also report on benthic organism populations in nontidal streams as a gauge of water quality and habitat conditions. DNR's report of 2002 findings will include assessment of water quality, benthic organism populations and the potential relationships that may be drawn from the 2002 data. Synopic Survey Data Collection Parameters Dissolved Oxygen pH Nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) Conductivity  58  Sept. 2002   Aricultural Conservation Programs Harford County has a high level of participation in agricultural conservation programs. Farmers in the county willingly implement management systems that address nutrient runoff and infiltration, erosion and sediment control, and animal waste utilization. The Harford Soil Conservation District (HSCD) works with farmers and landowners in the development of Soil Conservation and Water Quality plans that recommend best management practices that will prevent nutrient and sediment impact on surface and ground water. Some of the conservation practices installed were grassed waterways, riparian herbaceous and riparian forested buffers, conservation cover, cover crops, shallow water wildlife areas and grade stabilization structures. The Maryland Agricultural Cost-Share program (MACS), the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP and CREP) and the Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) are some of the state and federal programs promoted and administered by the Harford SCD and NRCS. 28 Farmers in the watershed who are already using good management practices that benefit water quality could provide examples to promote adoption of similar practices by other farmers. Potential Next Steps. Encouraging implementation of BMPs, nutrient management, participation in conservation programs and other agricultural approaches to protecting water quality are important elements in local water management strategy that can be augmented through the WRAS process.  Marina Programs Discharges of sewage from boats are a concern for water quality because they contribute nutrients, biochemical oxygen demand, pathogens, etc. These discharges are preventable if a sufficient number of pumpout facilities are locally available and boat operators take advantage of these services. Three of the five marinas in the Bush River offer pumpout facilities as shown in Map 22 Marinas. None of these marinas is currently participating in Maryland's Clean Marina Program. The Clean Marinas Program is a way for marina owners to gain certification and public recognition for voluntarily undertaking a number of actions related to marina design, operation, and maintenance intended to properly manage all kinds of marine products and activities, and to reduce and properly manage waste. Information is available at DNR's website, www.dnr.state.md.us/boating. DNR also funds installation and maintenance of marine pumpout facilities, including those at certified Clean Marinas. Information may be obtained from the Waterway and Greenways Division at DNR. One potential element of a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) is to encourage and/or support adding marina pumpout facilities serving the local area and increasing participation in the Clean Marina Program.  59  Sept. 2002   Fish Blockage Removal Many fish species need to move from one stream segment to the next in order to maintain healthy resilient populations. This is particularly true for anadromous fish species because they spawn and hatch from eggs in free flowing streams but live most of their lives in estuarine or ocean waters. Blockages in streams can inhibit or prevent many fish species from moving up stream to otherwise viable habitat. To help prioritize stream blockages for mitigation or removal, the DNR Fish Passage Program maintains a database of significant blockages to fish movement. A summary of blockages listed in the database for the Bush River Basin appears in the Fish Blockages / Removal Opportunities Table and Map 23 Fish Blockages. The listings in this database should be considered as supporting information for Stream Corridor Assessments that have been completed or are planned. Based on experience in other watersheds, it is likely that an assessment would identify additional potential fish blockage problems. Of the more than twenty fish blockages listed in the database, one on Lower Winters Run known as Van Bibber Dam was mitigated in 1990. Correction of this blockage reconnected a large segment of Lower Winters Run to the Chesapeake Bay. Potential Next Steps. In general, mitigation or removal of a blockage to fish movement is recommended if the change would open a significant stream segment containing high quality habitat with existing or potential return of significant fish populations. DNR Fisheries Service can provide technical advice and potentially funding for mitigation projects. Some blockages to fish movement may be structural components of lakes, farm ponds or drainage ditches. If a blockage is found in any of these categories, circumstances like requirements for public recreation needs, drainage control function, land owner needs and other factors are considered in determining the potential for a restoration project.  60  Sept. 2002   Fish Blockages / Removal Opportunities in the Bush River Basin -- Page 1 of 2 Watershed (8-Digit) Bush River 02130701 Station Blockage Corrected Stream Name / Location  BU010 BU011 BU012 BU013 BU014  Gray's Run James Run James Unnamed Tributary Unnamed Tributary yes Otter Point Creek Lower Winters Run Lower Winters Run Winters Run Bynum Run Bynum Run Bynum Run Bynum Run Bynum Run Bynum Run Bynum Run Bynum Run  Carsins Run Road 0.25 miles above I-95 James Run Road Gulf Road 0.3 miles below Rt. 159 0.1 miles above Edgewood 50ft below Atkisson Dam 0.2 miles above Singer Road 25 yards above Rt 1 1 mile below Wheel Road 1 mile above Wheel Road 0.8 miles above Wheel Road 0.5 miles below St. Andrews Rd. 0.1 mile below St. Andrews Rd. 0.6 miles below Rt. 1 0.7 miles below Rt 23 Rt 23  Lower Winters Run 02130702 Atkisson Res. 02130703 Bynum Run 02130704  BU016 BU017 BU018 BU019 BU001 BU002 BU003 BU004 BU005 BU006 BU007 BU008  Aberdeen PG 02130705  no blockages listed in database  Note: Fish Blockage Database records may not include findings from Stream Corridor Assessments.  61  Sept. 2002   Fish Blockages / Removal Opportunities in the Bush River Basin -- Page 2 of 2 Watershed (8-Digit) Swan Creek 02130706 Station Blockage Corrected Stream Name / Location  CW010 CW011 CW030 CW031 CW032 CW063 CW064  Gashey's Creek Gashey's Creek Swan Creek Swan Creek Swan Creek Unnamed Trib to Gashey's Creek Unnamed Trib to Gashey's Creek  0.2 mile below Chapel Road Chapel Road 0.1 mile above Rt. 40 100 ft. above Oak St. 130 yards above Oak Street 0.33 mile below Chapel Road Chapel Road  Note: Fish Blockage Database records may not include findings from Stream Corridor Assessments.  62  Sept. 2002   Stream Buffer Restoration 1. Benefits and General Recommendations Natural vegetation in stream riparian zones act as stream buffers that can provide numerous valuable environmental benefits:  Reducing surface runoff  Preventing erosion and sediment movement  Using nutrients for vegetative growth and moderating nutrient entry into the stream  Moderating temperature, particularly reducing warm season water temperature  Providing organic material (decomposing leaves) that are the foundation of natural food webs in stream systems  Providing overhead and in-stream cover and habitat  Promoting high quality aquatic habitat and diverse populations of aquatic species. To realize these environmental benefits, DNR generally recommends that forested stream buffers be at least 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream. Therefore, DNR is promoting this type of stream buffer for local jurisdictions and land owners who are willing to go beyond the minimum buffer standards. The DNR Watershed Restoration Division and other programs like CREP are available to assist land owners who volunteer to explore these opportunities. 2. Using GIS Identifying the areas that need buffer restoration and prioritizing them for action can be a timeconsuming expensive project. Fortunately, use of a computerized Geographic Information System (GIS) to manipulate remote sensing data can help save limited time and funds. To assist in this technical endeavor, DNR Watershed Management and Analysis Division is offering assistance, including GIS work, to help target restoration of naturally vegetated stream buffers, wetlands and other watershed management projects that may be identified locally. With these tools, information generated by a Stream Corridor Assessment and additional on-the-ground verification or ""ground truthing,"" local government may more efficiently and confidently consider stream buffer restoration as part of a local Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. Several scenarios are presented here to help consider potential areas for stream buffer and wetland restoration. These scenarios can be used alone or in combination as models for targeting potential restoration sites for field verification. These maps are intended to demonstrate a methodology that can be used to locate sites having a high probability of optimizing certain ecological benefits of stream buffers. The resolution of the data used to generate these maps is not sufficient for an accurate site assessment, but can be used to identify potential candidate sites for more detailed investigation. The streams presented in the maps are perennial (blue line) streams as generally shown on US Geological Survey Quadrangle Maps. Intermittent streams were not considered in the stream buffer scenario maps.  63  Sept. 2002   3. Headwater Stream Buffers Headwater streams are also called first order streams. These streams, unlike other streams (Second Order, etc.), intercept all of the surface runoff within the watersheds that they drain. In addition, for many watersheds, first order streams drain the majority of the land within the entire watershed. Therefore, stream buffers restored along headwater streams (First Order) tend to have greater potential to intercept nutrients and sediments than stream buffers placed elsewhere. In targeting stream buffer restoration projects, giving higher priority to headwater streams is one approach to optimizing nutrient and sediment retention. Restoring headwater stream buffers can also provide habitat benefits that can extend downstream of the project area. Forested headwater streams provide important organic material, like decomposing leaves, that ""feed"" the stream's food web. They also introduce woody debris which enhances in-stream physical habitat. The potential for riparian forest buffers to significantly influence stream temperature is greatest in headwater regions. These factors, in addition to positive water quality effects, are key to improving aquatic habitat. 4. Land Use and Stream Buffers One factor that affects the ability of stream buffers to intercept nonpoint source pollutants is adjacent land use. Nutrient and sediment loads from different land uses can vary significantly. The loading rates shown in the table here were calculated for the Lower Potomac River Tributary Basin from the model of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model. Restoration of stream buffers is a valuable agricultural Best Management Practice Annual Nonpoint Source Pollution Load Rates (BMP). By identifying land uses By Land Use in riparian areas with inadequate Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model (2000) stream buffers, like crop land Land Use Nitrogen Phosphorus Sediment adjacent to streams, the potential (lbs/ac) (lbs/ac) (tons/ac) to reduce nutrient and sediment loads can be improved. To Crop land 17.11 1.21 0.74 assist in finding areas with crop Urban 7.5 0.7 0.09 land adjacent to streams, the same land use data shown in Pasture 8.40 1.15 0.30 Map 9 2000 Land Use / Land Cover can be filtered using GIS. Forest 1.42 0.00 0.03 The new scenario shown in Map 24 Stream Buffer Land Use Scenario focuses on the land use within 50 feet of a stream. This view, supplemented with the land use pollution loading rates, suggests potential buffer restoration opportunities that could minimize nutrient and sediment loads. (Note: DNR is encouraging stream buffers 150 feet wide on each side of the stream, which is significantly greater than minimum buffer requirement, to enhance nutrient and habitat benefits beyond minimum buffer requirements.) 64 Sept. 2002   5. Nutrient Uptake from Hydric Soils in Stream Buffers In general, the nutrient nitrogen moves from the land into streams in surface water runoff and in groundwater. In watersheds like the Bush River Basin, a significant percentage of nitrogen enters streams in groundwater. Stream buffers can be used to capture nitrogen moving in groundwater if buffer restoration projects have several key attributes:  Plant with roots deep enough to intercept groundwater as it moves toward the stream  Plants with high nitrogen uptake capability, and  Targeting buffer restoration projects to maximize groundwater interception by buffer plants. Hydric soils in stream riparian areas can be used as one factor to help select stream buffer restoration sites. Siting buffer restoration on hydric soils would offer several benefits:  Plant roots are more likely to be in contact with groundwater for longer periods of time  Hydric soils tend to be marginal for many agricultural and urban land uses  Natural vegetation in wet areas often offers greater potential for habitat. Map 25 Stream Buffer Hydric Soils on Open Land Scenario identifies lands adjacent to streams that are composed of hydric soil and also have insufficient stream buffers in the central part of the Bush River Basin. The map suggests that several areas north of Bel Air have unbuffered streams on hydric soils. This type of area could offer opportunities to restore stream buffers and intercept nitrogen in near-surface groundwater before it reached the nearby stream. To generate the map, hydric soils (Natural Soils Group of Maryland, MDP) were grouped into two classes and rated in terms of their potential to maximize groundwater/root zone interaction: poorly drained hydric soils (high nutrient retention efficiency), and moderately well drained hydric soils (moderately high nutrient retention efficiency). An important next step in using this information is verification of current field conditions. Care must be taken during field validation to evaluate any hydrologic modification of these soils, such as ditching or draining activities, which would serve to decrease potential benefits. 6. Optimizing Water Quality Benefits by Combining Priorities Strategic targeting of stream buffer restoration projects may promote many different potential benefits. To maximize multiple benefits, site selection and project design need to incorporate numerous factors. For example, finding a site with a mix of attributes like those in the following list could result in the greatest control of nonpoint source pollution and enhancement to living resources:  land owner willingness / incentives  marginal land use in the riparian zone  headwater stream  hydric soils  selecting appropriate woody/grass species  adjacent to existing wetlands / habitat  Additionally, selecting restoration projects that are likely to produce measurable success is an important consideration in prioritizing projects for implementation. In the early stages of a watershed restoration program, measurable water quality improvement can be one of the strongest ways to demonstrate project success. 65 Sept. 2002   In general, targeting restoration projects to one or a few selected tributaries or small watersheds will tend to offer the greatest probability of producing measurable water quality improvement. By selecting small areas like a small first order stream for restoration, there is greater likelihood that water quality problems arise locally and that they can be corrected by limited investment in carefully selected local restoration projects. In the Bush River Basin, available water quality data reinforces the premise that targeting restoration projects to locally generated problems is an important consideration. Because significant inputs to water quality in tidal portions of the Bush River arise from multiple tributary streams and tidal exchange with the Chesapeake Bay, it be will difficult for local projects to demonstrate water quality improvements in tidal waters. However, if watershed restoration projects are targeted to selected tributary streams, improvement in in-stream water quality are more likely to be measurable in terms of water quality parameters, benthos populations or other parameters. Water quality improvements achieved in the tributary will also inevitably contribute to improving the river mainstem. However, improvement in the mainstem of the river may not be measurable if the magnitude of the problem is as great as the data suggest.  Wetland Restoration Wetlands serve important environmental functions such as providing habitat and nursery areas for many organisms, facilitating nutrient uptake and recycling, and providing erosion control and sediment trapping. However, most watersheds in Maryland have significantly fewer wetland acres today than in the past. This loss due to draining, dredging or filling has led to habitat loss and negative water quality impacts in streams and in the Chesapeake Bay. Reversing this historic trend is an important goal of wetland restoration. One approach to identifying candidate wetland restoration sites involves identifying ""historic"" wetland areas based on the presence of hydric soils. This process can be accelerated by using GIS to manipulate soils information with other data like land use. The GIS products can then assist in initiating the candidate site search process, targeting site investigations and helping to identify land owners. To promote wetland restoration, DNR Watershed Management and Analysis Division has developed GIS capability for these purposes. For the Bush River and Bynum Run 8-digit watersheds, GIS was used to map and prioritize areas of hydric soil for potential wetland restoration. The steps and priorities used to generate the map are listed below:  Data used: Hydric soils (Natural Soil Groups), existing wetlands (National Wetlands Inventory), land use (DOP 1997).  Identify candidate hydric soil areas based on land use. Hydric soils on open land (mostly agricultural fields or bare ground) are retained while those underlying natural vegetation and developed lands are excluded.  Explore hydric soils based on land ownership and proximity to existing wetlands or streams. 66 Sept. 2002   Two of many possible scenarios for finding potential wetland restoration sites are presented on the accompanying maps:  Map 26 Wetland Restoration Opportunities shows that there are numerous concentrations of hydric soils that are near existing wetlands. These areas could be candidates for wetland restoration. The areas identified on the map along Lower Winters Run near the existing protected land at Otter Point could offer both restoration and natural resource protection opportunities within an existing management program.  In comparing Map 26 with Map 25 Stream Buffer Hydric Soils on Open Land , several areas appear in both the stream buffer and the wetland restoration scenarios. For example, the headwaters area of Broad Run, James Run and Grays Run may be candidates for restoration projects that could meet multiple natural resource and water quality protection objectives. The potential wetland restoration sites suggested in these scenarios can be filtered further by using more accurate wetlands and soil information, considering landownership and other factors. Additional steps would be beneficial in applying this information such as considering additional criteria like habitat enhancement opportunities, sensitive species protection, targeting specific streams or subwatersheds for intensive restoration, and using Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) information. Additional wetland restoration opportunities may be identified on non-agricultural lands. For example, residential properties, particularly low density areas, may also provide viable project sites that do not appear on the scenarios presented above.  67  Sept. 2002   PROJECTS RELATED TO THE WRAS PROCESS Overview There are numerous projects and programs that have the potential to contribute to successful development and implementation of a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). The listing included here suggests opportunities for cooperation and coordination that can improve the likelihood of success for the WRAS. This listing is not all-inclusive. It is recommended that this list be augmented as new information becomes available and that follow-up should continue to promote the WRAS process with these and other projects and programs.  319(h)-Funded Projects The Federal funding source generally known as ""319"" is not currently funding projects in the Bush River Basin.  Other Projects This section summarizes projects that have the potential to contribute to development and implementation of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy that have not been addressed elsewhere in the watershed characterization. 1. 2002 SAV Experiment In Otter Point Creek Three species of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) have been transplanted from grow out stations at the Anita C. Leight Estuary Center to prescribed areas of Otter Point Creek to test habitat suitability. This project was conducted by Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (CBNERR) staff along with volunteers as part of the Reserves' research function. 2. Anita C. Leight Estuary Center 2002 Access Improvement The Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve partnered with DNR Program Open Space, Harford County Parks and Recreation and the Harford Land Trust to purchase property near the Anita C. Leight Park which is in the Otter Point Component of the Reserve. Subject to necessary approvals and permits, improvements will include replacement an existing unsafe pier with an ADA accessible pier, addition of an ADA path from the parking area to the pier, and a parking lot upgrade to create a safe ADA parking. The new area will be used for public canoe and pontoon boat programs and as a monitoring site.  68  Sept. 2002   POTENTIAL BENCHMARKS FOR WRAS GOAL SETTING Several programs designed to manage water quality and/or living resources have existing or proposed goals that are relevant to setting goals for the Bush River Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). The goals from these other programs tend to overlap and run parallel to potential interests for developing WRAS goals. Therefore, to assist in WRAS development, selected goals from other programs are included here as points of reference. Coastal Zone Management  The Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) Initiative is a component of the Cumulative and Secondary Impacts section of the Maryland Coastal Zone Management Program Section 309 Strategy (2000-2005). Watershed strategies are defined as comprehensive plans that will identify areas of concern, monitoring strategies, gaps in information, mitigation options, and restoration and protection opportunities.  WRAS projects funded under Coastal Zone Management must be in Maryland's Coastal Zone and must include a local program change as part of the effort. This could include incorporation into the County Comprehensive Plan, adoption of local implementing tools like zoning ordinances and environmental codes, modification of sensitive areas elements or alterations to Smart Growth Priority Funding Areas. Chesapeake 2000 Agreement The Chesapeake 2000 Agreement (C2K) includes several significant commitments pertaining to local watershed management planning and implementation. The goal in the C2K Agreement that is directly related to the development of watershed management plans and action strategies is ""By 2010, work with local governments, community watershed groups and watershed organizations to develop and implement locally supported watershed management plans in two-thirds of the Bay watershed covered by this Agreement. These plans would address the protection, conservation and restoration of stream corridors, riparian buffers and wetlands for the purposes of improving habitat and water quality, with the collateral benefits for optimizing flow and water supply."" Four common elements of watershed management planning were adopted by the Chesapeake Bay Program member jurisdictions to be applied Bay-wide. Those elements support the WRAS components which were also identified as common Bay-wide criteria for watershed management planning. The four approved C2K Agreement watershed planning elements are as follows: 1. Does the plan ""address the protection, conservation and restoration of stream corridors, riparian forest buffers and wetlands?"" Each watershed management plan needs to be based on an assessment of natural resources within the watershed. At a minimum, the assessment will evaluate the condition of stream corridors, riparian buffers and wetlands within the watershed. 2. Does the plan reflect the goals and objectives of ""improving habitat and water quality?"" The plan should reflect the issues that the stakeholders feel are important, and, at a minimum, exhibit a 69 Sept. 2002   benefit to habitat and water quality within the watershed. The goals should be based on priority issues identified by the watershed assessment. 3. Chesapeake 2000 Watershed Commitments Criteria #3 Does the plan identify implementation mechanisms? Capacity to implement the plan will be demonstrated by identifying: - What are the specific management actions? - What are the resources necessary for implementation? - Who will implement the plan? - And when will the actions will be implemented? The implementation mechanisms should also incorporate a periodic re-evaluation to ensure the plan is ""living"" and flexible to the changes in the watershed. 4. Does the plan have demonstrated local support? Every effort should be made to demonstrate a diversity of local support. At a minimum, local governments, community groups and watershed organizations should be encouraged to participate in developing and implementing the watershed management plan. Goals from the Clean Water Action Plan 2:  Clean Water Goals - Maryland watersheds should meet water quality standards, including numerical criteria as well as narrative standards and designated uses.  Watersheds should achieve healthy conditions as indicated by natural resource indicators related to the condition of the water itself (e.g. water chemistry), aquatic living resources and physical habitat, as well as landscape factors (e.g. buffered streams and wetland restoration). Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998 - The most significant feature is requiring nutrient management plans for virtually all Maryland farms. The requirement is being phased in over a several year period. - Nitrogen-based plan implementation will be required on all farms beginning December 31, 2001. - Phosphorus-based plan implementation will be required on farms using chemical fertilizer beginning December 31,2002 and on farms using manure or biosolids by July 1, 2005. - Up to 87.5% cost share is available for development of nutrient management plans and up to $20 per ton cost share assistance with costs of manure transportation are available. Implementation of projects assisted by this funding has the potential to move nutrients to sites where they are needed.  70  Sept. 2002   REFERENCES  1. DNR. Internet Site: www.dnr.state.md.us/ .

United States Geological Survey Surface water quality standards consist of two parts: (a) designated uses of each water body; and (b) water quality criteria necessary to support the designated uses. Designated uses of for all surface waters in Maryland (like shell fish harvesting or public water supply) are defined in regulation. Water quality criteria may be qualitative (like ""no objectionable odors"") or quantitative (toxic limitations or dissolved oxygen requirements). All the land that drains to an identified body of water or point on a stream.

Each graph shows two lines: one showing the average measurment for each month and one showing the standard deviation. The example below suggests how to interpret the graphs. Abbreviation key for the graphs: AVG - Average measurement for each month based on the historic record. STD - Standard Deviation for each month based on the historic record.  Total Phosphorus (TP) - Interpretation of graph using July as an example. - The average July TP measurement at Station WT1.1 is slightly less than 0.10 milligrams per liter (mg/l) - The standard deviation July TP measurement at Station WT1.1 is 0.025 mg/l - This means that most of time the historic data record shows that total phosphorus at Station WT1.1 in July is between 0.075 mg/l and 0.125 mg/l - This range for total phosphorous indicates fair water quality.  Total Nitrogen (TN) - Interpretation of graph using July as an example. - The average July TN measurement at Station WT1.1 is about 1.2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) - The standard deviation July TN measurement at Station WT1.1 is close to 0.5 mg/l - This means that most of time the historic data record shows that total phosphorus at Station WT1.1 in July is between 0.7 mg/l and 1.7 mg/l - This range for total nitrogen indicates fair water quality.  106  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Monitoring Graphs  Station WT1.1  Page 2 of 4  107  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Monitoring Graphs  Station WT1.1  Page 3 of 4  108  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Monitoring Graphs  Station WT1.1  Page 4 of 4  109  Sept. 2002   APPENDIX B Maryland Biological Stream Survey 2000-2004 Volume 1 Ecological Assessment of Watersheds Sampled in 2000 Prepared for Maryland Department of Natural Resources Prepared by Nancy E.

These watersheds are in the central portion of the Maryland Coastal Bays drainage area. The WRAS project area encompasses about 46,204 acres including about 11,471 acres of open water. The purpose of the WRAS project is for Worcester County and various stakeholders to determine local priorities for protection and restoration of water quality and habitat. As part of the WRAS project, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is providing technical assistance, including preparation of a watershed characterization (compilation of available water quality and natural resources information and identification of issues), a stream corridor assessment (uses field inspection data to catalog issues and rate problem severity) and a synoptic survey (analyzes benthic macroinvertebrates, fish and water samples with focus on nutrients). The County will use this information to help generate the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. Water Quality Maryland's Coastal Bays, including the WRAS project area, are salty water bodies with salinty that varies between 27 parts per thousand (ppt) to 34 ppt. Tidal portions of Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay are listed by the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) for impairments associated with low dissolved oxygen, nutrients and fecal coliform bacteria. Both watersheds are affected by MDE's statewide fish consumption advisory due to methylmercury. The Newport Bay watershed has an approved Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) that addresses nitrogen in three tidal creeks and the bay and biological oxygen demand in Kitts Branch. Nutrient loads in this watershed are mostly from nonpoint sources. Nonpoint sources generate about 49% of the nitrogen load, point sources contribute about 30%and the remainder comes from atmospheric deposition and groundwater. Phosphorus loads are about 80% from nonpoint sources and 20% from point sources. Nonpoint source phosphorus in the water is mostly associated with movement of sediment. Sinepuxent Bay has a small area closed to shellfish harvesting due to a sewage effluent discharge from the Assateague Island Park visitor facility. The average stream base flow nitrate concentration for nontidal streams flowing into Maryland's Coastal Bays south of Berlin was measured at 1.75 milligrams per liter (mg/l) during the winters of 1999 and 2000. This level is significantly higher than the previously assumed level of 0.72 mg/l. Average groundwater nitrate was found to be low in most areas. However, high nitrates in groundwater, ranging from 5.01 mg/l to 8.00 mg/l, characterized the area bounded by the tidal portion of Ayer Creek on the west, Newport Creek on the south and Sinepuxent Bay on the east. Several smaller areas exhibited higher average nitrate levels.  vi   The Landscape According to Maryland Department of Planning 2000 data, land use differs in the two watersheds. The Newport Bay watershed is relatively rural: 11% developed, 34% agriculture, 43% forest/scrub and 12% wetland. The Sinpuxent Bay watershed has twice the developed area and one-third the agricultural area. However, the greatest concentration of impervious area is in the Town of Berlin, which drains to Newport Bay. Both watersheds have significant green infrastructure, forest with large interior area and wetlands. In the Newport Bay watershed, most of this land is not protected from land use conversion. A large proportion of these areas in Sinepuxent Bay watershed are protected by the Assateague Island parks system. About 37% of these watersheds is prime agricultural land. Over 48% of the soils in these watersheds exhibit hydric conditions. Some areas of hydric soils are ditched to improve drainage. The most prevalent wetland type in both watersheds is emergent wetland. However, the Newport Bay watershed has a large portion of forested palustrine wetlands (freshwater wetlands not associated with lakes, rivers or streams. Sinepuxent Bay watershed has a relatively large portion of unconsolidated shore wetlands  mostly on the bay-side of the barrier island. In the long term, a large area of the WRAS Project Area may be affected by sea level rise. Living Resources and Habitat Tidal fish species of commercial and recreational importance are showing signs of improvement following significant declines in population in the 1980s and 1990s. Sensitive species identified in these watersheds include 20 plant and five animal species including two Federally listed birds: the bald eagle and the piping plover. Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV) beds have been increasing their coverage since monitoring began in the 1980s. SAV in Maryland's Coastal Bays was nearly eliminated by disease in the 1930s. Sinepuxent Bay has a significantly larger area of SAV than Newport Bay. Restoration Targeting Tools Scenarios for potential stream buffer restoration and wetland restoration targeting suggests that opportunities for further assessment may be available. Current field data gathered by the Stream Corridor Assessment and the Synoptic Survey will help develop a list of issues for further investigation and identify sites that could be used in restoration efforts.  vii   CONTRIBUTORS TO THE WATERSHED CHARACTERIZATION Worcester County Department of Comprehensive Planning Maryland Dept. of Natural Resources Sandy Coyman, David Honick, Katherine Munson, Keota Silaphone  Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service David Bleil, Mary Conley, Katharine Dowell, Greta Guzman, Danielle Lucid, Robin Pelicano, Niles Primrose, Ted Weber, John Wolf, Ken Yetman Forest Service Anne Hairston-Strang Fisheries Service Harley Speir Resource Assessment Service Ellen Friedman, Renee Karrh, Catherine Wazniak Wildlife & Heritage Division Lynn Davidson, Tim Larney Maryland Department of the Environment John Grace, Kelly Neff, John Smith, Robert Daniel  Others  Editor and Primary Author: Ken Shanks, Maryland Department of the Natural Resources, Watershed Services, Landscape and Watershed Analysis Division  viii   INTRODUCTION Background In 1998, Maryland completed an assessment of all the state's watersheds in order to identify high priorities for restoration action based on impaired waters and high priorities for conservation action based on high or unique natural resource value. The assessment, called the Unified Watershed Assessment, was conducted by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) under the direction of the US Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Water Action Plan initiative with assistance from the Maryland Departments of Environment, Agriculture and Planning and the University of Maryland. It moved beyond consideration of water quality in the streams in the state, which had been assessed regularly since the early 1970's, to a larger consideration of living resources in the streams and the landscape conditions which could impact both water quality and living resources.1,2 In response to the findings of the Unified Watershed Assessment, DNR offers technical and financial assistance to local governments who are willing to develop and implement Watershed Restoration Action Strategies (WRAS) addressing needs for restoration and conservation in priority watersheds. One of these projects is the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay Watersheds in Worcester County, where the County, DNR and other local cooperators, both public and private, are engaged in developing a watershed management strategy. Location Watershed Acreage Summary MDP 2000 Land Use/Land Cover  The Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds are located Watershed Land Water Total within the Maryland Coastal Bays drainage area as shown in Map 1 Newport Bay 27,229 5,264 32,493 Location. These watersheds are Sinepuxent Bay 7,504 6,207 13,711 located entirely within Worcester County as highlighted in Map 2 Newport and 34,733 11,471 46,204 Project Area. This area is the focus of Sinepuxent Bays the WRAS and this Watershed Characterization. The adjacent table shows that about one quarter of the WRAS project area is open water. Map 2 also shows that DNR subdivides the Newport Bay watershed into four ""12-digit"" subwatersheds for analytical purposes. No Sinepuxent Bay subwatersheds are defined by DNR. The table Subwatersheds provides additional details on these subwatersheds. Purpose of the Characterization One of the earliest steps in devising a WRAS is to characterize the watershed using available information. This Watershed Characterization is intended to meet several objectives:  briefly summarize the most important information and issues 1        provide preliminary findings identify information or analysis needs suggest opportunities for additional characterization and restoration work. provide a common base of knowledge about the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay Watersheds for local governments, citizens, businesses and other organizations  Additional Characterization Work The Watershed Characterization is intended to be one starting point that can be updated as needed. It is part of a framework for a more thorough assessment involving an array of additional inputs:  self-investigation by Worcester County  targeted technical assistance and assessment by partner agencies or contractors  input from local citizens  completion of a Stream Corridor Assessment, in which DNR personnel physically walk the streams and catalogue important issues.  completion of a synoptic water quality survey, i.e. a program of water sample analysis, that can be used to focus on local issues like nutrient hot spots, point source discharges or other selected issues. This is also part of the technical assistance offered by DNR. Findings of the 2002 synoptic survey of the streams in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds are reported in Appendix D. Identifying Gaps in Information It is important to identify gaps in available watershed knowledge and gauge the importance of these gaps. In assessing data gaps, we have found it helpful to review information in four categories:  Habitat: physical structure, stream stability and biotic community (including the riparian zone)  Water Quantity: high waterstorm flow and flooding; low waterbaseflow problems from dams, water withdrawals, reduced infiltration  Water Quality: water chemistry; toxics, nutrients, sediment, nuisance odors/scums, etc.  Cumulative effects associated with habitat, water quantity and water quality. Because restoration is an active evolving process, the Watershed Characterization and the resulting Watershed Restoration Action Strategy should be maintained as living documents within an active evolving restoration process. These documents will need to be updated periodically as new, more relevant information becomes available and as the watershed response is monitored and reassessed.  2   Subwatersheds Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay WRAS Project Area ""8-Digit"" Watershed Number/ Name 02130104 Sinepuxent Bay ""12-Digit"" Subwatershed Name and Number same as 8-digit 0681 Area in Acres Description Water 6,207 Land* 7,504 Total 13,711 Entire 8-digit Watershed Includes Massey Br.

Historically, the emphasis has been on chemical water quality. More recently, additional factors are being considered like measurements of selected biological conditions and physical conditions that affect habitat quality in streams and estuaries. This developmental path is reflected in the ways in which streams have been monitored, the types of data gathered, and the regulatory approach taken. Water Quality Standards and Designated Uses All streams and other water bodies in Maryland are assigned a ""designated use"" in the Code of Maryland Regulation (COMAR) 26.08.02.08, which is associated with a set of water quality criteria necessary to support that use. The Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds are assigned two uses: - Use I, Water Contact Recreation and Protection of Aquatic Life: All surface waters not designated as Use II. - Use II, Shellfish Harvesting Waters: All portions of the territorial seas and estuarine portions of bays and tributaries except: Ocean City Harbor above the entrance to West Ocean City Harbor Map 3 Designated Uses and Use Restrictions depicts the distribution of surface waters in each category. (COMAR or MDE should be consulted for official regulatory information.) 3,5 Use Impairments and Restrictions 4  Some streams or other water bodies in the WRAS project area cannot be used to the full extent envisioned by their designated use in Maryland regulation due to water quality or habitat impairments. These areas, known as ""impaired waters"", are tracked by the State of Maryland under Section 303(d) requirements of the Federal Clean Water Act. Each impairment listed may require preparation of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) to address the water quality and/or habitat impairment in the affected water body.5 Maryland's list of impaired waters for the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds include waters affected by the water quality or habitat problems listed and discussed below: Dissolved Oxygen Fecal Coliform Bacteria and Shellfish Harvesting Restrictions Nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) Fish Consumption Advisory  4   1. Dissolved Oxygen The draft 2002 303(d) list identifies dissolved oxygen impairment in tidal portions of both Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay. The origins of the dissolved oxygen problem are listed: as natural and nonpoint sources related to human activity. Aquatic life requires a range of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in water to allow for respiration and survival. If DO concentrations diminish beyond the range of tolerance for the species in a water body, mobile species like fish attempt to leave low DO areas in search more suitable areas. Individuals unable to escape die when DO concentrations drop below tolerance levels. To help ensure that waters of the State provide sufficient levels of dissolved oxygen to support aquatic life, the State of Maryland has a DO water quality standard in regulation. The standard requires that dissolved oxygen concentrations be maintained at 5.0 mg/l or higher. Water bodies in which DO levels are known to fall below 5.0 mg/l on a reoccurring basis are listed as impaired in the 303(d) list. 2. Fecal Coliform Bacteria and Shellfish Harvesting Restrictions The tidal portions of Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay are listed for impairment by fecal coliform bacteria in the draft 2002 303(d) list. The origins of these bacteria were listed: as natural and nonpoint sources. As shown in Map 3 Designated Uses and Use Restrictions, a small portion of Sinepuxent Bay is affected by shellfish harvesting restrictions. Tidal waters closest to the Assateague Island State Park Visitor Center are ""restricted"" which ""means that no harvesting of oysters and clams is allowed at any time."" These restrictions are applied by the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) to protect public health because areas near treated sewage effluent discharges have the potential to receive elevated levels fecal coliform bacteria. Fecal coliform bacteria are a class of bacteria typically found in the digestive tract of warm-blooded animals, including humans. Fecal coliform bacteria are always found in animal waste and human sewage (unless it is treated to kill them). In unpolluted streams and tidal waters, it is common for water samples to contain very few of these bacteria. Water samples exhibiting significantly larger fecal coliform bacteria populations are ""indicators"" of contamination by animal or human, waste. Depending on local conditions, sources of fecal contamination may include any of the following: inadequately treated sewage, failing septic systems, wild or domestic animals, urban stormwater carrying pet waste and similar sources. 3. Nutrients The tidal portions of Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay are listed for impairment by nutrients in the 1996 303(d) list and in the draft 2002 303(d) list. The origins of these nutrients were listed: as natural and nonpoint sources related to human activity. According to the November 2002 TMDL report for Newport Bay, nutrients are significant contributors to the use impairments in the Newport Bay system. High nutrient loads, particularly nitrogen in the Newport Bay, contribute to excessive algal blooms and concentrations of dissolved oxygen below the minimum State standard of 5.0 milligrams per liter (mg/l). The algae and dissolved oxygen problems impair local conditions and interfere with the designated uses of the Newport Bay system. The section Total Maximum Daily Loads gives additional information. 5   In general, nutrients can lead to the problems noted above in several ways. In Maryland, most water bodies naturally have low levels of the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus. Without these essential nutrients, most water bodies could support aquatic life. However, in the tidal waters of the Coastal Bays, when high nutrient loads coincide with warm weather and sufficient light, algae populations can grow to excessive levels. These algae can then crowd out other small organisms, cloud the water limiting light penetration, and eventually die-off consuming the dissolved oxygen that other aquatic life needs to survive. Nutrient pollution or over-enrichment problems may arise from numerous sources including all types of land and from the atmosphere. However, most of the nutrients in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bays are generated within their respective watersheds. Residential land can be an important contributor of nutrients depending on fertilizer use, extent of lawn and the status of septic systems. Farmers apply nutrients using different approaches, so nutrients entering waterways from crop land vary greatly depending on management techniques. Typically, streams and other surface waters receive relatively small amounts of nutrients from forest land and relatively large amounts from land uses that involve soil disturbance and application of fertilizer. The fraction of the total nitrogen load contributed by the atmosphere typically originates at burning fossil fuels in power plants and other industries, and from automobiles. Also see What Are the Effects of Nutrient Over-Enrichment? 4. Fish Consumption Advisory Fish tissue sampling conducted in 2001 by MDE led to issuance of a fish consumption advisory in late 2001. An update to the advisory was issued by MDE in January 2003. The purpose of the advisory is to recommend limiting human consumption as described in the table below. The table is adapted from www.mde.state.md.us/CitizensInfoCenter/FishandShellfish 2003 Advisory On Fish Consumption Affecting Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay Recommended Maximum Allowable Meals Per Month Species Smallmouth & Largemouth Bass, Pickerel, Northern Pike, Walleye Bluegill Area Affected Statewide Lakes and other impoundments Rivers and streams Lakes and other impoundments General Population 8oz meal 4 no advisory 8 Women 6oz meal 4 8 8 Children 3oz. meal 2 8 8 Methylmercury Contaminant  6   Total Maximum Daily Loads The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) uses the 303(d) list to determine the need for establishing Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). A TMDL is the amount of pollutant that a waterbody can assimilate and still meet its designated use. A waterbody may have multiple impairments and multiple TMDLs to address them. MDE is responsible for establishing TMDLs in Maryland. In general, TMDLs include several key parts: 1- Maximum pollutant load that the water body can accept while still allowing it to meet its intended use. 2- Allocation of the maximum pollutant load to specific pollutant sources. As of March 2003, one TMDL has been drafted that directly affects the WRAS project area encompassing the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. The report Total Maximum Daily Loads of Nitrogen for Three Tidal Tributaries and Total Maximum Daily Load of Biological Oxygen Demand for One Tributary in the Newport Bay System, Worcester County, Maryland, was submitted to EPA in January 2003. The following sections summarize key parts of the TMDLs set in the report. 1. Nitrogen TMDLs In The Newport Bay Watershed The Newport Bay mainstem receives flows and pollutants from numerous tributaries. In 1998, MDE conducted water quality monitoring to support its TMDL work. Analysis of this data and data from other sources covering the same time frame lead MDE to the conclusion that control of nitrogen would limit algae growth in the Newport Bay system. In response, MDE has designed nitrogen TMDLs for several areas in the Newport Bay watershed as described below and summarized in the table Newport Bay Watershed Nitrogen TMDLs:  There are five subwatersheds in the Newport Bay system that were addressed in the TMDL report. Three subwatersheds received nitrogen TMDLs (Ayer Creek, Newport Creek/Trappe Creek and Newport Bay), one BOD TMDL (Kitts Branch) and Marshall Creek had insufficient data and modeling limitations to allow generation of a TMDL.  Nitrogen TMDLs are designed to address needs in specific areas of the Newport Bay system. The goals of these TMDLs are to improve water quality by maintaining dissolved oxygen concentrations above the State standard of 5.0 mg/l and by reducing algae blooms as measured by chlorophyll a. The nitrogen TMDL for Newport Bay is intended to constrain the total nitrogen load from the entire Newport Bay watershed while the TMDLs for its tributaries are intended to control local problem areas.  The nitrogen TMDL for Newport Bay will require nearly a 47% total load reduction from current nitrogen loads. MDE reported that the total nitrogen load to Newport Bay is 407,551 pounds per year based on water quality monitoring. The sum of the monthly nitrogen loads listed as limits for Newport Bay in table Newport Bay Watershed Nitrogen TMDLs is 218,209 pounds per year of nitrogen.  7   Newport Bay Watershed Nitrogen TMDLs in Pounds/Month Watershed Area Ayer Creek Newport Cr. / Trappe Cr.

Biological Oxygen Demand TMDL for Kitts Branch Kitts Branch, which drains an area around the town of Berlin, flows into Trappe Creek and then to Newport Bay. The Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) TMDL for Kitts Branch is designed to protect water quality by maintaining dissolved oxygen concentrations above the State standard of 5.0 mg/l during spring and summer low-flow conditions. The spring TMDL is 6,132 pounds per month from April 1 to May 31. Based on 1998 monitoring data, the typical spring nitrogen load in Kitts Branch is about 100 pounds per day (around 3,000 pounds per month). The summer TMDL is 1,369 pounds per month from June1 to Oct. 31. Based on 1998 monitoring data, the typical summer nitrogen load in Kitts Branch is about 28 pounds per day (around 840 pounds per month). There are no BOD TMDL limits applied in winter from November 1 through March 31.  8   Water Quality IndicatorsSetting Priority for Restoration and Protection In Maryland's 1998 Clean Water Action Plan, the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds were included in two categories for priority action: highest priority for restoration, and priority for protecting valued resources. As the basis for the 1998 prioritization, a Unified Watershed Assessment was conducted to establish priorities for restoration and protection all for all watersheds (134) covering the State of Maryland. Part of this assessment employed indicators of water quality, landscape and living resources for each watershed where sufficient information was available. Other approaches to assessing water quality have been in use for several years and are further described below. In general they do Water Quality Indicator Summary not look comparatively at watersheds Coastal Bay Tidal Index as the Unified Assessment did in an Watershed effort to set priorities. The Unified Habitat Eutrophication Assessment also considered a range of living resource and landscape Assawoman Category 1 Category 2 indicators described in the following Isle of Wight Category 1 Category 2 sections. The Coastal Bays watersheds, Sinepuxent Category 2 Category 2 the table summarizes the rankings for the water quality indicators used to Newport Category 1 Category 2 allow comparison among them. The Chincoteague Category 2 Category 2 definition each category is listed below: Category 1  watersheds in this category have the greatest problems compared to other watersheds. These watersheds are assigned the highest priority for restoration. Category 2  watersheds that do not have conditions to qualify for either Category 1 or Category 3. Both restoration and protection would be addressed in these watersheds as practicable. Category 3  watersheds with relatively very few problems and high quality conditions. These watershed are assigned the highest priority for protection.  9   National Academy Press, Clean Coastal Waters (2000) What Are the Effects of Nutrient Over-Enrichment? 6 The productivity of many [lake, estuary and] coastal marine systems is limited by nutrient availability, and the input of additional nutrients to these systems increases primary productivity [microscopic organisms including algae]. In moderation in some systems, nutrient enrichment can have beneficial impacts such as increasing fish production; however, more generally the consequences of nutrient enrichment for [lake, estuarine and] coastal marine ecosystems are detrimental. Many of these detrimental consequences are associated with eutrophication. The increased productivity from eutrophication increases oxygen consumption in the system and can lead to low-oxygen (hypoxia) or oxygen-free (anoxic) water bodies. This can lead to fish kills as well as more subtle changes in ecological structure and functioning, such as lowered biotic diversity and lowered recruitment of fish populations. Eutrophication can also have deleterious consequences on estuaries even when low-oxygen events do not occur. These changes include loss of biotic diversity, and changes in the ecological structure of both planktonic and benthic communities, some of which may be deleterious to fisheries. Seagrass beds are particularly vulnerable to damage from eutrophication and nutrient over-enrichment. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) harm fish, shellfish, and marine mammals and pose a direct public health threat to humans. The factors that cause HABs remain poorly known, and some events are entirely natural. However, nutrient over-enrichment of coastal waters leads to blooms of some organisms that are both longer in duration and of more frequent occurrence. Although difficult to quantify, the social and economic consequences of nutrient over-enrichment include aesthetic, health, and livelihood impacts  10   Water Quality Monitoring Various agencies conduct on-going water quality-related monitoring in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay area, including DNR, MDE, the National Park Service and volunteers working with Maryland's Coastal Bays Program. Map 4 Monitoring Water Quality shows some of these monitoring stations (mostly those used for the Newport Bay TMDL). Maryland's Coastal Bays Program distributes information relevant to the WRAS Project via the Internet at http://www.dnr.state.md.us/coastalbays/index.html . An example of the information available under the heading Water Quality is shown below. The Internet site offers other information like analysis of data from the four fixed monitoring stations listed below and labeled on Map 4. Ayer Creek at Rt. 376 - AYR0017 Trappe Creek at Saddle Creek - TRC0043 Newport Bay near Newport Neck - XCM4878 Marshall Creek east of Rick's Point - MSL0011  11   Water Quality Analysis 1. Algae 7 To estimate relative population levels of green and blue-green algae present in a water body, the concentration of Chlorophyll a in water is used as an indirect estimate of the aggregate population. Higher Chlorophyll a concentrations indicate higher algae populations. Algae problems tend to occur more in Trappe, Ayer and Newport Creeks rather than the open tidal waters of Newport Bay itself based on 1998 data. In Newport Bay, Chlorophyll a concentrations were 50 micrograms per liter (Fg/l) or less under high flow (spring) and low flow (summer) conditions. The greatest algae populations were found in Trappe Creek where chlorophyll a concentrations from 100 to 200 Fg/l occurred during low flow conditions. Under high flow conditions in Trappe Creek, chlorophyll a concentrations as high as 125 Fg/l were measured. Ayer Creek and Newport Creek both exhibited elevated chlorophyll a concentrations during low flow conditions up to 125 Fg/l and up to 90 Fg/l respectively. In Kitts Branch, chlorophyll a concentrations were consistently less than 40 Fg/l which indicates that algae is not a problem in this tributary. Overall, the 1998 data suggests that the algae problem is related to conditions arising up in the watershed rather than from problems arising from tidal inputs from Sinepuxent or Chincoteague Bay. 2. Dissolved Oxygen During spring high flow conditions, all the tidal waters monitored during 1998 exhibited dissolved oxygen concentrations that were consistent with the State water quality standard of 5.0 milligrams per liter (mg/l).7 During summer months dissolved oxygen below the State standard was found in several areas:  In Newport Bay, Newport Creek, Ayer Creek, Trappe Creek and Kitts Branch for all the tidal waters monitored in 1998. The lowest dissolved oxygen measurement, less than 2.5 mg/l, was observed in Ayer Creek.7  Throughout Newport Bay (1999 through 2001 monitoring, DNR Resource Assessment Service)18  Newport Creek and Marshall Creek (Aug. 2001 monitoring, DNR Resource Assessment Service)18  Sinepuxent Bay (DNR Fisheries Service, sampling typically below a depth of 4 feet)18 3. Biological Oxygen Demand 7 Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) is a measure of oxygen consumption associated with living matter including algae, bacteria, plants and animals. BOD at various levels occurs naturally in water bodies and is only considered a problem if it causes problems such as violation of the 5.0 mg/l dissolved oxygen standard. In most areas of Newport Bay system, low dissolved oxygen problems can be traced to algal activity and nutrients that feed the algae. However, 1998 monitoring of Kitts Branch found occasional low dissolved oxygen that was not accompanied by high algal activity. This suggests that BOD may be the cause.  12   4. Nitrogen In Tidal Waters 7 Excessive livels of nitrogen was Newport Bay detected in1998 monitoring of the T otal Nitrogen Loads Newport Bay mainstem and Ayer and Newport Creeks at sites shown on Map 4 Agriculture Monitoring Water Quality. 30% Forest 38% Modeling analysis conducted by MDE to support their TMDL work Urban determined that nitrogen is the limiting Atmosphere nutrient in tidal waters of the Newport Bay Groundwater system. This means that controlling 12% Point Sources nitrogen loads affecting tidal waters can 7% 9% 4% effectively limit algae growth. The relative sources of nutrient loads to Newport Bay are shown in the adjacent pie charts adapted from MDE's TMDL report for Newport Bay. For total nitrogen, about two-thirds comes from point sources and agricultural lands based on MDE's estimates. Less than one-fifth of the nitrogen load comes from sources that are not locally controllable (groundwater and atmospheric deposition). Overall, these estimates suggest that control of locally generated nitrogen loads would reduce the total nitrogen load reaching Newport Bay. 5. Nitrogen in Nontidal Streams 20 The United States Geological Survey (USGS) measured stream base flow and water quality in 17 nontidal streams discharging to Chincoteague, Newport and Sinepuxent Bays during the winters of 1999 and 2000. Map 4 Monitoring Water Quality shows the USGS monitoring sites that were within the WRAS project area. USGS reports that the average stream base flow nitrate concentration for nontidal streams flowing into Maryland's Coastal Bays south of Berlin is 1.75 milligrams per liter (mg/l). Previously, nitrate concentration in this area was assumed be 0.72 mg/l. They also indicate that the majority of their samples found nitrate concentrations higher than natural levels for stream base flow in this area which is 0.4 mg/l or less. This finding indicates that the nonpoint contribution of nitrate to the Coastal Bays may be more significant than previously believed. USGS also reports that base flow nitrate concentrations in streams ranged from below 0.5 to 5.28 mg/l as nitrogen. They found a significant positive correlation between the percentage of watershed area used for row crops and nitrate concentration. This finding indicates the nitrogen management for row crops is a significant contributor of nitrogen to the Coastal Bays. 6. Nitrogen in Groundwater US Geological Survey (USGS) reports that the dominant nutrients in groundwater for the Chincoteague Bay and Sinepuxent Bay vicinities are dissolved ammonia and dissolved nitrate. The highest ammonia concentrations, up to 23.4 mg/l as nitrogen, were associated with anoxic groundwater, i.e. well water with little or no dissolved oxygen. The highest nitrate concentrations, up to 15.5 mg/l, were associated oxic groundwater, i.e. well water that also contained dissolved oxygen. Nitrate concentrations ranged as low as 0.05 mg/l. These findings 13   came from monitoring of 28 wells during the winters of 1999 and 2000. The wells were drilled into the surficial aquifer and the underlying confining layer so that water level and water quality measurements could be taken at different depths. 20 USGS also sampled 388 wells in the Maryland Coastal Bays watershed to help map the distribution of groundwater nitrate concentration. Throughout most of the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds, nitrate concentrations less than 1.0 mg/l were prevalent. However, several areas exhibited significantly higher nitrate concentrations. For example, nitrate concentrations in the 5.01 mg/l to 8.00 mg/l range characterized the area bounded by the tidal portion of Ayer Creek west, Newport Creek on the south and Sinepuxent Bay on the east. 7. Phosphorus The 1998 monitoring described above was also the basis for assessing total phosphorus. As shown in the pie chart, phosphorus from agricultural lands and point sources Newport Bay dominate loads to Newport Bay according T otal Phosphorus Loads to MDE's estimates. Groundwater and atmospheric deposition, which are Agriculture represented by ""0%"" labels on the pie 20% chart, are not significant sources of Forest phosphorus in the Newport Bay Urban watershed. Based on this assessment, 0% Atmosphere 67% essentially all sources of phosphorus are 0% Groundwater locally controllable. 5%  Point Sources  8% 8. Salinty Based on monitoring in Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay in 2001 and 2002 during a study of macroalgae, the range of salinity in the two bays is similar, varying from about 27 parts per thousand (ppt) to 34 ppt.19  14   Sources of Pollution Since European settlement of North America there has been an explosive growth in human population, supported by more intensive agriculture and the growth of industry. The entire continent has become mutually interdependent by employing vast transportation systems. All of this contributes to the decline in quality of our water and other natural resources. 1. Point Sources Discharges from pipes or other ""discrete conveyances"" are called ""point sources."" Point sources may contribute pollution to surface water or to groundwater. For example, wastewater treatment discharges may contribute nutrients or microbes that consume oxygen (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)) reducing oxygen available for other aquatic life. Industrial point sources may contribute various forms of pollution. Some understanding of point source discharges in a watershed can be useful in helping to identify and prioritize potential restoration measures. The information from the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) permit data base for the Sinepuxent Bay and Newport Bay watershed is presented in two forms  MDE Discharge Permits Summary Table and  Map 5 MDE Discharge Permits:  The Sinepuxent Bay watershed has seven surface water discharges and three groundwater discharges. Only one of these, the Visitors Center at the Assateague National Seashore, may contribute significant nutrients to the Bay. The groundwater discharges all involve land application of treated sewage affluent.  The Newport Bay watershed has 13 surface water discharges. The two most significant contributors of nitrogen to the Newport Bay system are the Berlin Wastewater Treatment Plant and Tyson Foods, Inc. Two lesser contributors are Kelly Foods, Inc. and the Newark Wastewater Treatment Plant. These four facilities may be affected by implementation of the nitrogen TMDLs in the Newport Bay watershed. The other nine surface water discharges in the watershed are not significant sources of nutrients.7  Kitts Branch, where BOD was addressed in the TMDL, receives effluent from several significant point source dischargers. Of these, Tyson Foods, Inc. is the greatest. A lesser point source of BOD is Kelly Foods, Inc. During cold-weather months, the Berlin Wastewater Treatment Plant, which discharges to Bottle Branch/Kitts Branch only during the months of November through March, is the second greatest point source of BOD. Characteristics of these permitted discharges (volume, temperature, pollutants, etc.) are tracked by MDE through the permit system. Most of this information is accessible to the public and can be obtained from MDE.  15   MDE Discharge Permits Summary Table  Page 1 of 3 Sinepuxent Bay Watershed  All Permitted Discharges (2/2003 data) Type / MDE Category Surface Water Discharge Water Treatment Sewage Effluent Industrial Gen.

Diffuse or Nonpoint Sources Sources of pollution that include areas of land and other sources that do not have a specific point of origin are called nonpoint sources. Nonpoint sources are commonly significant contributors of pollutants, particularly nutrients and sediment. These diffuse sources include rain water that runs off roofs, streets and parking lots (sometimes via storm drains) into nearby surface waters, as well as run-off from farm fields and, to a much lesser extent, forests. Also included in nonpoint source pollution is deposition from the atmosphere and contributions from ground water, where septic systems are a factor. A. Nutrients According to the November 2002 TMDL report for Newport Bay, nonpoint source (NPS) nutrients, particularly nitrogen, are significant contributors to the use impairments in the Newport Bay system. On average for Newport Bay, 49% of the total nitrogen load arises from nonpoint sources (urban, residential and agricultural lands) and 80% of the total phosphorus load arises from nonpoint sources. However, the relative importance of nonpoint source nutrient loads varies significantly among subwatersheds of the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay area. For nitrogen, the Newport Bay watershed is dominated by nonpoint sources in all subwatersheds except Kitts Branch which has significant point source nitrogen loads. Phosphorus loads in all Newport Bay subwatersheds are entirely are nonpoint sources except Kitts Branch which has significant point source nutrient loads. B. Shoreline Erosion Wherever land and open water meet, change in the form of erosion or accretion of land is the inevitable result of natural processes. Human activity in these areas often interferes with these natural processes by attempting to control movement of water and/or loss of land. Erosion 18   of shorelines can contribute significant amounts of nutrients (mostly phosphorus) and sediment (water column turbidity, habitat loss). Countywide shoreline erosion is summarized in the following table. These figures group together shoreline for both the Coastal Bays and the Chesapeake Bay drainage. 8 Worcester County Shore Erosion Rate Summary (Miles of Shoreline) Total Shoreline Total Eroding Shoreline 919 (32%) Erosion Rate 0 to 2 feet / year 74 2 to 4 feet / year 26 4 or more feet / year 10  407  Maps of historic shoreline change were produced in 1999 by the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) in a cooperative effort between DNR and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These maps included digitized shorelines for several different years in Worcester County. The maps show that extensive changes have occurred adjacent to large bodies of open water. Copies of these 1:24000 scale maps are available from the MGS. Currently, DNR is working to improve our ability to predict and address areas of high-rate shoreline erosion. In addition to considering historic erosion rates, contributory effects of land subsidence and sea level rise are being considered. To help generate predictive tools, two pilot areas have been selected: St. Mary's County and Dorchester County. Results from this work are not currently available.  19   Groundwater and Water Supply Groundwater is the source of nearly all water used for agriculture and business, and all potable water in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. In general, these water uses do not employ near-surface groundwater, which is subject to potential local pollution sources. Additionally, near surface groundwater is credited with carrying nutrients, particularly nitrogen, from land source to surface waters where nutrient over-enrichment is occurring. Groundwater is the source of all potable water for all community systems in the WRAS project area. As shown on Map 6 Community Water Systems, several public water supply systems are located in the Newport Bay watershed and none are located in the Sinepuxent Bay watershed. Permit information is summarized in the table below.

In an effort to gauge the affects of land use on water quality, and to allow comparison between watersheds, DNR has developed a series of Landscape Indicators. These indicators can be used to portray landscape conditions on a watershed scale that either tend to support good water quality or that tend to degrade water quality. Landscape Indicators The 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan included a unified watershed assessment that used a number of landscape indicators to assess the State's 138 watersheds.2 Most indicators are relative measures by which Maryland's watersheds can be compared. The following sections identify the findings for the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds from the 1998 Plan, with the exception of the Year 2000 population density estimates. Summary of Coastal Bays Landscape Indicators Watershed Population Density (people/acre) 0.65 0.57 0.25 0.22 0.03 Wetland Loss (acre) 3,531 16,129 2,662 17,025 28,820 Unbuffered Streams (percent) 61 44 79 25 26 Soil Erodibility (value/acre) 0.13 0.23 0.13 0.08 0.13  Assawoman Bay Isle of Wight Bay Sinepuxent Bay Newport Bay Chincoteague Bay  Color Key: Green- benchmark met, conditions better than some other comparable watersheds. Orange- benchmark not met, condition is poorer than many other comparable watersheds. 1. Population Density The Year 2000 population density in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds was 0.22 and 0.25 people per acre of land respectively. A comparison with other watersheds in Maryland has not been completed using the 2000 census data.2 While population density may be beyond the scope of a WRAS, directing growth is a potential WRAS component. As human population increases, the effects of human activity that degrades, displaces, or eliminates natural habitat also tend to increase. Watersheds with higher populations, assuming other factors are equal, tend to exhibit greater impacts on waterways and habitat. However, growth can be directed in ways to reduce negative impacts.  21   2. Historic Wetland Loss The Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds are estimated to have lost about 2,662 and 17,025 acres of wetlands, respectively, over the years.2 This interpretation is based on the assumption that the hydric soils in the watershed were all, at one time, wetlands. Thoughtful selective restoration of historic wetland areas can be an effective WRAS component. In most of Maryland's watersheds, extensive wetland areas have been converted to other uses by draining and filling. This conversion unavoidably reduces or eliminates the natural functions that wetlands provide. 3. Unbuffered Streams Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds differ significantly on the extent of unbuffered streams, 79% and 25% respectively based on 1998 information. To develop this indicator, the presence or absence of forest cover adjacent to streams in corridors 100 feet wide (50 feet either side of the stream) was assessed. The estimate of streams lacking forested buffer was generated for the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan by using Maryland Department of State Planning GIS data for streams and for 1994 land use.2 In most of Maryland, trees are key to healthy natural streams. They provide numerous essential habitat functions: shade to keep water temperatures down in warm months, leaf litter ""food"" for aquatic organisms, roots to stabilize stream banks, vegetative cover for wildlife, etc. In general, reduction or loss of riparian trees in stream buffers degrades stream habitat while replacement of trees to create natural stream buffers enhances stream habitat. For this indicator, only streams that are shown on USGS Quadrangle maps are addressed. 4. Soil Erodibility Soil erodibility for Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds are both in the range of very low erosion potential as measured by the K factor: 0.13 and 0.08 respectively.2 The K factor normally varies from approximately zero to about 0.6. A K value of 0.17 has a very low erosion potential, a value of 0.32 has a moderate erosion potential, a value of 0.37 has a high erosion potential, and a value of 0.43 has a very high erosion potential. Watersheds with more highly erodible soils are naturally more susceptible to surface erosion, sedimentation, streambank erosion and other problems related to soil movement. These negative effects of soil erodibility on water quality can be minimized through careful management. The soil erodibility indicator accounts for natural soil conditions but not for management of the land. Existing cropland management was not considered. The naturally erodible soils in the watershed are addressed by techniques called Best Management Practices (BMPs) to prevent soil loss, practices that are typically in use on local farms. BMPs like no-till or reduced till cropping, planting cover crops, field strips, or retiring erodible soils from production can significantly reduce erosion and sediment movement. These BMPs can be seen in use in many places in the watershed. Because soils can vary significantly within very small areas, a generalized erodibility indicator must be used with caution and supplemented with site-specific evaluation prior to implementing any management action.  22   Land Use The table Land Use / Land Sinepuxent Bay Watershed Cover and pie charts summarize 2000 data for the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds as Agriculture (11.34%) Developed (21.91%) categorized by the Maryland Department of Planning. Map 7 Land Use / Land Cover shows the Forest (31.37%) distribution of these land use categories in the watershed. Wetlands (23.31%) In general, the forest and brush cover the greatest percentage of land in Other (12.07%) both the Newport Bay watershed and the Sinepuxent Bay watershed. Viewing these general land use categories as potential nonpoint sources of nutrients, agricultural lands are likely to contribute the greatest loads to local waterways. Urban lands may also contribute significant nutrient loads.  2000 Land Use  2000 Land Use Newport Bay Watershed Developed (10.99%) Wetlands (11.86%) Other (0.58%) Agriculture (33.93%)  Forest (42.63%)  23   Land Use / Land Cover Summary Table In Sinepuxent Bay Watershed and Newport Bay's Subwatersheds MDP 2000 Data, Acres / Percent Subwatershed Name / Number Sinepuxent Bay Trappe Creek Headwaters Newport Bay Ayer Creek & Trappe Creek Newport and Porter Creeks Marshall Creek Newport Bay Total Ag 851 11% 1,262 33% 2,550 37% 3,523 33% 1,905 34% 9,240 Forest & Brush 2,354 32% 1,355 33% 3,164 46% 4,277 40% 2,813 51% 11,609 Developed 1644 22% 1,425 34% 386 6% 989 9% 192 3% 2,992 Wetland 1,749 23% 6 -774 11% 1,763 17% 687 12% 3,230 Other Land 906 12% 75 -3 -80 1% --158 Total Land 7,504 4,123 6,877 10,632 5,597 27,229  Impervious Surface Roads, parking areas, roofs and other human constructions are collectively called impervious surface. Impervious surface blocks the natural seepage of rain into the ground. Unlike many natural surfaces, impervious surface typically concentrates stormwater runoff, accelerates flow rates and directs stormwater to the nearest stream. Watersheds with small amounts of impervious surface tend to have better water quality in local streams than watersheds with greater amounts of impervious surface. Urbanization and the increase in impervious surfaces that accompanies development can significantly impact stream health. Increases in the extent of upstream impervious surface are strongly associated with a decrease in stream quality. As impervious surfaces cover more of the landscape, less water infiltrates the soil and more water enters stream systems through runoff or stormwater discharge. This increased stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces contributes to stream quality degradation by introducing more nonpoint source pollution, higher temperatures, reduced stream baseflow and more erosive flood flow. Map 8 Impervious Surface Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay Watersheds and the table below reflects data developed by the University of Maryland's Regional Earth Sciences Application Center (RESAC).10 The map shows relative average impervious cover for each subwatershed and it shows local concentrations of impervious coverage as darker areas. The map shows that the subwatersheds closest to Route 50 have the highest average impervious cover (Sinepuxent Bay, Trappe Creek Headwaters, Ayer and Trappe Creeks). The subwatersheds south of Berlin have very low average impervious surface. 24   Map 9 Impervious Cover Town of Berlin Vicinity shows the distribution of impervious surface around the most developed portion of the Newport Bay watershed. At this scale, it is possible to see that the majority of the area has little impervious surface. However, concentrations of impervious cover in and around Berlin and adjacent to major roads may have significant affect on local waterways. The findings presented in the maps suggest potential directions for watershed management activities:  Large areas of the WRAS project watershed probably have very little impact from impervious surfaces. These areas could be prioritized for controls on new impervious surface or other forms of protection. In these areas, if any restoration action is needed, relatively limited restoration projects may be able to eliminate impacts associated with impervious surfaces.  Limited areas near Berlin and major roads, where impervious surface is concentrated, could be prioritized for protects like stormwater infiltration retrofits.

These thresholds are based on extensive biological monitoring conducted by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey:9 Upstream Impervious Cover Thresholds Percent Less Than 2 Above 2 Above 15 Above 25 Affects on Stream Quality Imperviousness is relatively insignificant compared to other factors affecting habitat quality. In cold-water habitats, brook trout may be found. Negative impacts to stream health begin. Brook trout are never found in streams with watershed imperviousness above this threshold. Stream health is never rated good, based on a combined fish and benthic macroinvertebrate Index of Biotic Integrity. Only hardy, pollution-tolerant reptiles and amphibians can thrive, while more pollution-sensitive species are eliminated.  25   Lands With Significant Natural Resource Value and Large Area 1. Green Infrastructure DNR has mapped a network of ecologically important lands, comprised of hubs and linking corridors, using several GIS data layers to identify hubs that contain one or more of the following: - areas containing sensitive plant or animal species; - large blocks of contiguous interior forest (at least 250 contiguous acres, plus the 300 foot transition zone); - wetland complexes with at least 250 acres of unmodified wetlands; - streams or rivers with aquatic species of concern, rare coldwater or blackwater ecosystems, or important to anadromous fish, and their associated riparian forest and wetlands; and - conservation areas already protected by public (primarily DNR or the federal government) and private organizations like The Nature Conservancy or Maryland Ornithological Society. This ""Green Infrastructure"" provides the bulk of the state's natural support system. Ecosystem services, such as cleaning the air, filtering and cooling water, storing and cycling nutrients, conserving and generating soils, pollinating crops and other plants, regulating climate, protecting areas against storm and flood damage, and maintaining hydrologic function. For more information on the Green Infrastructure identification project in Maryland, see http://www.dnr.state.md.us/greenways/gi/gi.html Protection of Green Infrastructure lands may be addressed through various existing programs including Rural Legacy, Program Open Space, conservation easements and others. Map 10 Green Infrastructure shows that, even from the statewide perspective that guided the analysis, there is a significant amount of Green Infrastructure in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds:  Numerous Green Infrastructure hubs are in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds.  Assateague Island is the only Green Infrastructure hub where natural resource values are protected. Other Green Infrastructure hubs are not protected. 2. Large Forest Blocks Large blocks of forest provide habitat for species that are specialized for conditions with relatively little influence by species from open areas or humans. For example, forest interior dwelling birds require forest interior habitat for their survival and they cannot tolerate much human presence. Map 11 Forest Interior shows blocks of contiguous forest that are at least 50 acres in size with at least 10 acres of forest interior (forest edge is at least 300 feet away) that may be important locally within the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. This size threshold was chosen to help ensure that the forest interior is large enough to likely provide locally significant habitat for sensitive forest interior dwelling species. The assessment shown in Map 11 differs from the Green Infrastructure assessment which considered only large blocks of forest land cover at least 250 acres in size that are likely to have state or regional importance.  26   Protected Lands For purposes of watershed restoration, a knowledge of existing protected lands and likely areas for new development can provide a starting point in prioritizing potential restoration activities. In some cases, protected lands may provide opportunities for restoration projects because owners of these lands may value natural resource protection or enhancement goals. As used in the context of watershed restoration, ""protected land"" is any land with some form of long term limitation on conversion to developed land use. This protection may be in various forms: public ownership for natural resource or low impact recreational uses or, private ownership where a third party acquired the development rights or limits use through an easement. The extent of ""protection"" varies greatly from one circumstance to the next. Therefore, for some protected land, it may be necessary to explore the details of land protection parcel by parcel through the local land records office to determine the true extent of protection.

Interpreting Local Conditions with Natural Soil Groups Soil conditions like soil type and moisture conditions greatly affect how land may be used and the potential for vegetation and habitat on the land. Soil conditions are one determining factor for water quality in streams and rivers. Map 13 Soils shows soil variation in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. The table and pie chart summarized information from the map.

Soils and Watershed Planning Local soil conditions can be a useful element in watershed planning and for targeting restoration projects. Soils with limitations like wetness or slope naturally inhibit active use for farming or development and may then be available as restoration project sites. By comparing Map13 Soils with the three preceding maps listed below, it may be possible to discern how patterns of active or passive land use relate to soil conditions:  Map 7 Land Use / Land Cover  Map 10 Green Infrastructure Natural Soils Groups and other soils assessments can be used to help identify potential areas for restoration projects or habitat protection. Hydric soils, for example, are more easily restored as wetlands than soils that were never saturated with water. Once areas of interest are targeted and landowner interest is verified, additional detailed soil assessment is an essential step in identifying viable restoration project sites. Floodplains And Low Elevation Areas Subject To Sea Level Rise The average rate of sea level rise along Maryland's coastline has been 3-4 mm/yr or approximately one foot per century. Such rates are nearly twice those of the global average (1.8 mm/yr), a result most likely influenced from land subsidence. The rate of sea level rise is expected to accelerate in response to global warming, resulting in a rise of 2-3 feet by the year 2100. The low-lying coastal plains such as those along the eastern shore are vulnerable to impacts associate with rising sea level. Sea level rise threatens to exacerbate erosion and flooding, making areas more vulnerable to land loss, permanent inundation, and storm surge. Recognizing the need for advanced planning, the Department of Natural Resources developed a response strategy in 2000 and has been aggressively acquiring high-resolution elevation data (LIDAR) in the most vulnerable areas. Complete coverage of Worcester County including the Sinepuxent and Newport Bay has been acquired as select areas were defined as being less than 1.5 meters (5 feet) above sea level. Accurate elevation data will significantly improve the State and County's ability to define the most vulnerable areas and determine the most appropriate management measures to mitigate the impacts. Map 14 Floodplains shows the 100-year floodplain extending over a majority of the land near open water in the Sinepuxent Bay and Newport Bay. Small areas of floodplain also occur along the tributaries to Trappe Creek in the vicinity of the Town of Berlin. As sea level rises and land development increases, the 100-year floodplain is likely to expand putting more infrastructure and resources at risk from permanent inundation and flooding.  29   Wetlands 1. Wetland Categories The Coastal Plain Province has the highest diversity of emergent estuarine and palustrine (fresh water) wetland communities relative to other Maryland physiographic regions because both tidal and nontidal freshwater marshes occur here. Wetlands are most abundant in the Coastal Plain due to the low topographic relief and high ground water table characteristic of the region. Estuarine Wetlands. Estuarine wetlands are abundant throughout the Coastal Plain. These systems consist of salt and brackish tidal waters and contiguous wetlands where ocean water is at least occasionally diluted by freshwater runoff from the land. These wetlands may extend far upstream in tidal rivers to freshwater areas. Differences in salinity and tidal flooding within estuaries have a significant effect on the distribution of these wetland systems. Salt marshes occur on the intertidal shores of tidal waters in areas of high salinity. Brackish marshes are the predominant estuarine wetland type in Maryland. They are found along the shores of Chesapeake Bay, mostly on the Eastern Shore, and for considerable distance upstream in coastal rivers. Estuarine shrub swamps are common along the Maryland coastal zone. Aquatic beds, comprised mostly of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), were historically abundant in shallow water zones of Maryland's estuaries, especially Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Palustrine wetlands. These are freshwater wetlands that are not associated with streams or lakes. In general, palustrine wetlands are associated with freshwater, high water tables or intermittent ponding on land. Forested wetlands are the most abundant and widely distributed palustrine wetland type on the Coastal Plain. These wetlands are found on floodplains along the freshwater tidal and nontidal portions of rivers and streams, in upland depressions, and in broad flat areas between otherwise distinct watersheds. Tidal freshwater swamps occur along coastal rivers in areas subject to tidal influence. Scrub-shrub swamps are represented in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. Emergent wetlands on the Coastal Plain are characterized by a wide range of vegetation, depending on water regime. (Adapted from Wetlands of Maryland, Tiner and Burke, 1995.) 2. Tracking Wetlands Oversight of activities affecting wetlands involves several regulatory jurisdictions. The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) is the lead agency for the State and cooperates with DNR, the Army Corps of Engineers and other Federal and local agencies. As part of its responsibility, MDE tracks State permitting and the net gain or loss of wetlands over time. As the table Tracking Nontidal Wetland Change shows, the State regulatory program has measured a small net increase of wetland acreage in the Sinepuxent Bay watershed over the past 11 years. A small net decrease occurred in the Newport Bay watershed. This slowing of wetland loss in the watershed contrasts significantly with the estimated historic wetland loss in the watershed as described in the Landscape Indicators section.  30   Tracking Nontidal Wetland Change In The Newport Bay/Sinepuxent Bay Watersheds In Acres 1/1/1991 through 12/31/2002 11 Basin Code 02130104 Watershed Sinepuxent Bay Permanent Impacts -3.67 Permittee Mitigation 3.11 Programmatic Gains 3.00 Other Gains 0.09 Net 2.53  02130105 Newport Bay -4.80 3.45 0.50 0.80 -0.05 Notes: 1) Regulatory tracking for authorized nontidal wetland losses began in 1991.

Interpreting Wetland Distribution Map 15 Wetlands and the table below summarize distribution and categories of wetlands in the WRAS area. In the Newport Bay watershed, 94% of wetlands are emergent estuarine or forested palustrine. The Sinepuxent Bay watershed is dominated by three wetland types: estuarine emergent 43%, unconsolidated shore (beach) 40% and forested palustrine 11%.

The information summarized here suggests that some of the significant stresses on living resources in the watershed are alteration and destruction of habitat, excessive movement of sediment and excessive availability of nutrients. The living resource information summarized here should be considered a partial representation, because numerous areas of potential interest or concern could not be included due to lack of information, time, etc. For example, information on many forms of aquatic life, woodland communities, terrestrial habitats, etc. should be considered as watershed restoration decisions are being made. Therefore, it is recommended that stakeholders in the watershed identify important living resource issues or priorities so that additional effort can be focused where it is most needed. New information should be added or referenced as it becomes available. Living Resource Indicators  Aquatic organisms are sensitive, in varying degrees, to changes in water quality and aquatic habitat. They are also sensitive Indicator Name Finding to landscape changes. This association Nontidal Benthic Index 3.2 offers two perspectives that are important for watershed restoration. First, Only one Living Resource Indicator was improvements for living resources offer developed for the Newport Bay watershed in the potential goals, objectives and opportunities Maryland Clean Water Action Plan's Unified to gauge progress in watershed restoration.

For used to gauge local conditions for water comparison with similar Maryland watersheds, quality, habitat, etc. This second the benchmark for this indicator was not met. perspective is the basis for using living resources as an ""indicator."" The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan's Unified Watershed Assessment, published in 1998, included a number of living resource indicator for the Newport Bay watershed.2 Several of these indicators rely on extrapolations from a limited number of sampling sites, which were then generalized to represent entire watersheds. Some indicators represent indices comprising several conditions. Considering this limitation on field data, it would be beneficial to conduct additional assessments to provide a more complete understanding of local conditions.  Living Resource Indicator Summary Newport Bay Watershed From: 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment  32   1. Nontidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity With an IBI score of 3.2, the Newport Bay watershed does not meet the benchmark set for the Nontidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI). The nontidal benthic IBI looks at the insects and other invertebrates, like crayfish, living on the bottoms of streams, considering the overall community composition, the number and diversity of species and the presence of sensitive species. To calculate the benthic IBI, for the Unified Watershed Assessment, reference conditions were established for minimally-impacted streams. IBI values are relative to conditions in these minimally-impacted streams. An index of 6.0 or less means that restoration is recommended and an index of 8.0 or higher means that protection is recommended. Fish and Oysters Fish in Kitts Branch  MBSS 2001 Data 1. Fish In Nontidal Streams Information on fish in nontidal streams has been gathered as part of the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) for one stream in the Newport Bay watershed. The table shows that all the fish species identified are either tolerant or moderately tolerant of pollution and/or poor habitat conditions. The ranking of pollution tolerance is taken from work associated with MBSS.15 Tolerant Species Fish that tend to survive greater pollution and poorer habitat conditions American Eel Bluegill* Eastern Mudminnow Moderately Tolerant Species Fish with mid-range ability to co-exist with pollution and varied habitat conditions Banded Killfish Inland Silverside Largemouth Bass* Mosquitofish  Pumpkinseed 2.

Yates conducted between 1906 and 1912. As shown on Map 16 MBSS Sampling Sites and Oyster Status, about half of one 129-acre historic oyster bed was located within Newport Bay as it is currently delineated.17 Currently, no legally designated oyster beds are located in Maryland's Coastal Bays, including Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay. Oyster lease areas are currently located in the Assawoman Bay, Sinepuxent Bay and Chincoteague Bay. The only oyster lease in the WRAS area, in Sinepuxent Bay, covers about 1.5 acres as shown on Map 16 MBSS Sampling Sites and Oyster Status.  33   3. Tidal Fisheries Immediately available information on tidal fisheries does not segregate data on Newport Bay or Sinepuxent Bay. However, the following information that represents all of Maryland's Coastal Bays can be used as a frame of reference for the WRAS project area:  Blue crabs comprise the most valuable commercial fishery product from Maryland's Coastal Bays. Due to high salinity in these bays, blue crabs are relatively small compared to their Chesapeake Bay counterparts. According to DNR trawl survey results, only 5% of the blue crabs inspected are greater than five inches across while 21% of Chesapeake Bay blue crabs are over five inches. 23  In 2002 surveys conducted by DNR, 80 species of fish were identified. In the prior 30 years of surveys, an additional 50 species have also been identified. Twenty of the species identified in 2002 included juveniles. The Coastal Bays serve as important nursery areas for these species. 23  Four fish species are highly abundant in Maryland's Coastal Bays: Atlantic menhaden, Atlantic silverside, spot and bay anchovy. These fish are important forage for other fish species that are valued for commercial and recreational purposes. 23  Adults of many fish species are seasonally common in Maryland's Coastal Bays: summer and winter flounder, weakfish, bluefish, croaker, white perch, spot, black sea bass, tautog, eel and sharks.24  Recreational catches for some fish species are significant: summer flounder, weakfish, bluefish, croaker, tautog, striped bass and black sea bass.24  Some of the important fish species in Maryland's Coastal Bays have declined in population over time. This has necessitated management the affects to address the decline:25  Between the early 1970s and 1999, a coastal bay forage index based on Atlantic menhaden, spot, bay anchovy and Atlantic silverside has shown a gradual decline.  Summer flounder has strict harvest controls that were set after severe declines in the late 1980s. Increases in recruitment are evident based on presence of coastal bay juveniles and increasing average size in the offshore population.  Atlantic croaker has exhibited variable population size that may be associated with weather conditions and harvest rate. Stocks are showing consistent improvement which is attributed to current restrictions and bycatch reduction devices in commercial nets.  Spot have declined substantially since the late 1980s. The causes of this change is not understood. Spot is valuable for both commercial and recreational interests and as a forage species for game fish.  Bluefish was a major sportfish as late as 1989 but has exhibited substantial decline since that time.  Black sea bass is at a low biomass level and is believed to be over-exploited. In the late 1990s, the average size in the population increased which suggests the potential for a trend toward recovery.  34   Benthic Macroinvertebrates In Nontidal Streams During the past 25 years, DNR has conducted biological assessment of selected stream sites in the Newport Bay watershed using three different methods. Map 16 MBSS Sampling Sites and Oyster Status shows sampling sites were data is available. The Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) samples stream conditions for fish, benthic population and habitat conditions. Rresults from this sampling are summarized in the table below. Prior to creation of the MBSS method of assessment and random site selection technique, DNR used other biological assessment approaches in nontidal steams known as artificial substrate samplers and rapid bio-assessment. While results of this assessment is not directly comparable to the current day MBSS data, it does provide a way to compare stream conditions during the early 1990s. Information from these efforts is summarized in the text that follows. 2001 MBSS Findings in the Newport Bay Watershed Score Location Kitts Branch Bassett Creek / Tukesburg Branch Station # NEWP-116-R-2001 NEWP-110-R-2001 Fish 3.0 -Benthos 2.71 1.29 Physical ---  Key for MBSS Findings Table Index of Biotic Integrity Fish Benthic Physical Habitat Ranges for Index 1.0 (worst) to 5.0 (best) 1.0 (worst) to 5.0 (best) 0 (worst) to 100 (best) Very Poor 1.0 - 1.9 1.0 - 1.9 0 - 11.9 Poor 2.0 - 2.9 2.0 - 2.9 12 - 41.9 Fair 3.0 - 3.9 3.0 - 3.9 42 - 71.9 Good 4.0 - 5.0 4.0 - 5.0 72 - 100  * Additional details are available at http://www.dnr.state.md.us/streams/mbss/index.html  Click on ""Search Online Data"" (button on left); Enter ""Newport Bay"" or ""Sinepuxent Bay"" in dialog box for ""8 Digit watershed name""; click on search.  35   1. Bottle Branch at Harrison Road In 1994 and 1996, sampling of benthic macroinvertebrates in Bottle Branch at Harrison Road was conducted using the rapid bioassessment technique. The following ratings summarize the findings:  Benthic community quality  poor  Habitat quality  poor  Water quality  fair Since 1978, DNR has sampled macroinvertebrates in Bottle Branch at the Harrison Road crossing using artificial substrate samplers. Assessment of the benthic community shows a significant improvement in species diversity and a shift in species type, which together indicate that conditions have improved at this site over the past 25 years. Most of the improvement has occurred since 1997. The data shows that there was a significant correlation between time and biotic index and taxa number, with both improving. The taxa number is the total number of genera found at the site at the time of sampling. It reflects the health of the community but a direct measure of the types of organisms and the number will increase with better water quality and better suitability for the organisms. The biotic index is used to detect organic pollution and its influence on the macroinvertebrate community. When it improves it means that there are more pollution intolerant organisms present and less pollution tolerant. The macroinvertebrate community showed that over the years the site has been sampled that the water quality went from the upper poor range to the lower fair range, which is considered a moderate improvement in the water quality. 2. Kitts Branch at Flower Road In 1990, 1994 and 1996, sampling of benthic macroinvertebrates in Kitts Branch at Flower Road was conducted using the rapid bioassessment technique. The following ratings summarize the findings. Comments listed with the data indicate that the stream channel was ditched and a discharge from poultry plant was evident:  Benthic community quality  poor  Habitat quality  poor  Water quality  poor  36   Why Look at Benthos in Streams? Unimpaired natural streams may support a great diversity of species like bacteria, algae, invertebrates like crayfish and insects to fish,birds, reptiles and mammals. All these groups of organisms have been extensively assessed relative to water quality and habitat quality. One group, benthic invertebrates, was found to serve as a good indicator of stream condition including water quality and habitat quality. Benthic invertegrates are sometimes called ""stream bugs"" though that name overly simplifies the diverse membership of this group. This group includes mayflies, caddisflies, crayfish, and other invertebrates, that inhabit the stream bottom, its sediments, organic debris and live on plant life (macrophytes) within the stream. Benthic macro-invertebrates are an important component of a stream's ecosystem. The food web in streams relies significantly on benthic organisms. Benthos are often the most abundant source of food for fish and other small animals. Many benthic macroinvertebrates live on decomposing leaves and other organic materials in the stream. By this activity, these organisms are significant processors of organic materials in the stream. Benthos often provide the primary means that nutrients from organic debris are transformed to other biologically usable forms. These nutrients become available again and are transported downstream where other organisms use them. Assessment of benthic organisms is a valuable tool for stream evaluation. This group of species has been extensively used in water quality assessment, in evaluating biological conditions of streams and in gauging influences on streams by surrounding lands. These organisms serve as good indicators of water resource integrity because they are fairly sedentary in nature and their diversity offers numerous ways to interpret conditions. They have different sensitivities to changing conditions. They have a wide range of functions in the stream. They use different life cycle strategies for survival.  37   Sensitive Species Sensitive species are generally recognized as being the plants or animals that are most at risk in regards to their ability to maintain healthy population levels. The most widely known are perhaps the State and Federally-listed Endangered or Threatened animals such as the bald eagle and Delmarva fox squirrel. In addition to charismatic animals such as these however, both the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Maryland DNR work through their respective Federal and State programs to protect a wide variety of declining non-game animals, rare plants, and the unique natural communities that support them. The table, Sensitive Species Tracked By Maryland in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay Watersheds, lists animals and plants of concern within the WRAS project area. For the purposes of watershed restoration, it is valuable to account for the known locations and areas of potential habitat for sensitive species in a given area. They are often indicators, and sometimes important constituents, of the network of natural areas which form the foundation for many essential natural watershed processes. In fact, in addition to conserving biodiversity in general, protecting these species and/or promoting expansion of their habitats can be an effective component for a watershed restoration program. DNR's Wildlife and Heritage Service identifies important areas for sensitive species conservation in different ways. The geographic delineations most commonly used are described in the text box Marylands Sensitive Species Conservation Areas. As shown in Map 17 Sensitive Species, three specific sensitive species overlays used by the State of Maryland are found in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. The purpose of utilizing these delineations is to help protect sensitive species by identifying the areas in which they are known to occur. Doing so allows DNR to work toward the conservation of these sensitive resources by evaluating potential impacts of proposed actions that may affect them. Specifically, working within an established procedural framework, the Wildlife and Heritage Service reviews projects and provides recommendations for activities falling within these overlays. The geographic areas covered by these overlays are designed to serve as coarse filters. To allow for uncertainty pertaining to interpretation discrepancies, the polygons used on the map to depict these locations have been buffered. Accurate on-the-ground information regarding species locations and habitat delineations for a specific area can be obtained from DNR's Natural Heritage Program. It is also important to note that outside of the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area, DNR generally only places requirements on projects requiring a permit/approval or those which are utilizing State funds. However, there are more broadly applied State and Federal laws and regulations which address ""takings"" of listed species. In addition, many counties have incorporated safeguards for areas associated with sensitive species into their project and permit review processes as well as adopting specific ordinances in some cases to protect them. In all instances, property owners are encouraged to seek advice on protecting the sensitive species and habitat within their ownership.  38   Sensitive Species Tracked By Maryland In The Newport Bay And Sinepuxent Bay Watersheds Scientific Name Animals Charadrius melodus Cicindela dorsalis media Haliaeetus leucocephalus Rynchops niger Sterna antillarum Plants Almus maritima Antennaria solitaria Asclepias rubra Carex silicea Cleistes divaricata Cyperus retrofractus Dryopteris celsa Eleocharis albida Eleocharis rostellata Fimbristylis caroliniana Fuirena pumila Gymnopogon brevifolius Ludwigia hirtella Panicum scabriusculum Polygonum glaucum Prunus maritima Scleria verticillata Sesuvium maritimum Spiranthes praecox Triglochin striata Common Name Piping plover White tiger beetle Bald eagle Black skimmer Least tern Seaside Alder Single-headed pussytoes Red milkweed Sea-beach sedge Spreading pogonia Rough cyperus Log fern White spikerush Beaked spikerush Carolina fimbry Smooth fuirena Broad-leaved beardgrass Hairy ludwigia Tall swamp panicgrass Seaside knotweed Beach plum Whorled nutrush Sea-purslane Grass-leaved ladys' tres Three-ribbed arrow-grass Status Md.

Each ESA contains one or more sensitive species habitats. However, the entire ESA is not considered sensitive habitat. The ESA is an envelope identified for review purposes to help ensure that applications for permit or approval in or near sensitive areas receive adequate attention and safeguards for the sensitive species / habitat they contain. Natural Heritage Area (NHA) As shown in Map 17 Sensitive Species, one NHA is located in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. It covers the entire Assateague Island National Seashore. In general, NHAs have been designated as such because they represent rare ecological communities. These are areas which provide important sensitive species habitat. They are designated in State regulation (COMAR 08.03.08.10) and are afforded specific protections in the Critical Area Law criteria. For proposed projects that could potentially affect a particular NHA, recommendations and/or requirements may be put in place during the permit or approval process. These would be specifically aimed at protecting the ecological integrity of the NHA itself. To help ensure that proposed projects which may affect a given NHA are adequately reviewed, an ESA is always designated to encompass each NHA and the area surrounding it. Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) As shown on Map 17 Sensitive Species, numerous WSSCs, totaling about 57 acres, are designated in the Newport Bay Watershed. These important and ecologically unique wetlands are mostly located between Bassett Creek and Porter Creek. There are no WSSCs in the Sinepuxent Bay watershed. These selected wetlands, which generally represent the best examples of Maryland's nontidal wetland habitats, are afforded additional protection in state law beyond the permitting requirements that apply to wetlands generally. The Maryland Department of the Environment may be contacted for more information regarding these regulations. To help ensure that proposed projects that may affect a WSSC are adequately reviewed, an EA is always designated to encompass each WSSC and the area surrounding it. For a listing of designated sites see COMAR 26.23.06.01 at www.dsd.state.md.us  40   Seaweed / Macroalgae Macroalgae, commonly called seaweed, are the simple aquatic plants that grow in shallow high salinity aquatic environments like the Coastal Bays. A two-year study beginning in 1998 was the first to characterize macroalgae in Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay. The random sampling technique used throughout the Coastal Bays of Maryland and Delaware, found that macroalgae are more abundant that previously suspected and that no significant difference in abundance among embayments was detected. A second study conducted in May, August and November 2001 and March 2002 assessed over 600 monitoring sites in Maryland's Coastal Bays returned several findings in the WRAS area:19  The objective of the study was to determine if there is a relationship between nutrient enrichment and the relative abundance of phytoplankton (associated with high nutrients), macroalgae (associated with mid-range nutrients) and SAV (associated with low nutrients). The study did not establish the presence or absence of a correlation. However, considering only the WRAS project area, its findings for Newport Bay (higher nurients and Chlorophyll a, less macroalgae and SAV) and Sinepuxent Bay (lower nutrients and Chlorophyll a, more macroalgae and SAV) are consistent with the hypothesis.  Red algae was the diverse group identified by the study. These algae are commercially grown as a source of ingredients for food, cosmetics and medicines. The most common group, known as red weeds (genera Agardhiella and Gracilaria), were well distributed throughout the bays in all season except for Newport Bay where their presence was limited to spring.  Green macroalgae was the second most diverse group found and sea lettuce (Ulva spp.) Was the most prevalent. It was generally distributed throughout the Coastal Bays and was most consistently found in Sinepuxent Bay and in embayments to its north. In Newport Bay, these macroalgae were consistently absent.  Brown algae was less diverse than the other two groups. Brown algae in some form was found in Sinepuxent Bay during all seasons but no genera was found year-round. In Newport Bay, brown algae is generally absent but appears in winter/spring in the south end of the bay.  41   Submerged Aquatic Vegetation The well-defined link between water quality and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) distribution/abundance make SAV communities good barometers of the health of estuarine ecosystems. SAV is not only important as an indicator of water quality, but it is also a critical nursery habitat for many estuarine species. For example, blue crab ""post-larvae"" are up to 30 times more abundant in SAV beds than in adjacent unvegetated areas. Additionally, several species of waterfowl depend on SAV for food when they over-winter in the Chesapeake region. In the 1930s, a disease nearly eliminated all SAV Acreage for Selected Years SAV in Maryland's Coastal Bays. Since about 1986, in general there has been a steady increase in area Year Newport Sinepuxent covered by SAV beds. For example SAV acreage increased from 2000 to 2001 in most Coastal Bay 1999 52 1,925 Areas. However, a few areas including Sinepuxent 1998 66 1,463 Bay experienced a decrease in SAV acreage from 2000 to 2001. Coverage in Sinepuxent Bay 1997 68 1,264 decreased approximately 2 percent from 2000 to a total of 1,654 acres in 2001.13 1996 19 1,058 The size of SAV beds in Sinepuxent Bay has 1995 23 718 been generally consistent with the Coastal Bayswide trend toward increasing acreage covered based 1989 0 425 on data collected since1989 as shown in the adjacent table. Map 18 Submerged Aquatic Vegetation also shows the difference in area covered in 1989 versus 1999. In Newport Bay, the adjacent table shows that SAV beds have covered a relatively small acreage and the trend toward increasing acreage is less pronounced. In general, SAV beds large enough to be identified via aerial photography have always been limited to the eastern bank of Newport Bay. For additional information, also see http://www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/sav/index.html .  42   RESTORATION AND CONSERVATION TARGETING There are a number of programs and tools available to assist in implementing goals for protection of valued watershed resources and for targeting restoration of those that have become degraded or otherwise function less than optimally. Some of these tools are described below. 2003 Stream Corridor Assessment Using the Stream Corridor Assessment Methodology (SCAM) developed and applied by the DNR Watershed Restoration Division, valuable information can be compiled to assist in targeting restoration activities. In partnership with Worcester County, DNR is conducting a Stream Corridor Assessment in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds during 2003. In this effort, trained teams from the Maryland Conservation Corps walk along streams to document potential problems and restoration opportunities associated with the issues listed in the table below: Stream Corridor Assessment Data Collection Categories Pipe Outfalls Pond Sites Tree Blockages Inadequate Buffers Erosion Fish Blockages Exposed Pipe Unusual Conditions Trash Dumping In- or Near-Stream Construction  A stream corridor assessment report will be generated, including maps and photographs, to support targeting decisions for restoration projects. The results of the stream corridor assessment will provide a valuable foundation for development of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. 2003 Synoptic Survey and Aquatic Community Assessment During 2003 DNR staff collected water quality samples in nontidal streams to supplement knowledge of local conditions. The water quality findings included in the report on this work can help identify problem areas and relative conditions among local streams based on measurements of dissolved oxygen, pH, nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen), conductivity and flow. The findings include nutrient loads at each sampling site and allow the ranking of subwatersheds based on the nutrient load estimates. For some of these nontidal stream sampling sites, DNR staff has also assessed fish and benthic organism populations. These assessments provide additional perspectives to gauge local water quality and habitat conditions. 43   Agricultural Conservation Programs Many farmers in Worcester County willingly implement management systems that address nutrient runoff and infiltration, erosion and sediment control, and animal waste utilization. Some of the best management practices identified in Soil Conservation and Water Quality Plans for implementation on individual farms include grassed waterways, riparian herbaceous and riparian forested buffers, conservation cover, cover crops, shallow water wildlife areas and grade stabilization structures. The Maryland Agricultural Cost-Share program (MACS), the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP and CREP) and the Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) are some of the state and federal programs promoted and administered by the Worcester SCD and Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS). 28 Marina Programs Discharges of sewage from boats are a concern for water quality because they contribute nutrients, biochemical oxygen demand, pathogens, etc. These discharges are preventable if a sufficient number of pumpout facilities are locally available and boat operators take advantage of these services. Boat maintenance and operation also can contribute petroleum and other noxious materials to the aquatic environment. According to DNR's Marina database, there are 24 marinas in Worcester County. One marina serves Newport Bay and four serve Sinepuxent Bay. Map 19 Marinas shows their approximate location. Curently, pumpout facilities are provided by one marina within the Sinepuxent Bay watershed and several marinas close to the WRAS project area. Two of the marinas in Worcester County currently participate in Maryland's Clean Marina Program but none of these are in the WRAS project area. The Clean Marinas Program is a way for marina owners to gain certification and public recognition for voluntarily undertaking a number of actions related to marina design, operation, and maintenance intended to properly manage all kinds of marine products and activities, and to reduce and properly manage waste. DNR also funds installation and maintenance of marine pumpout facilities, including those at certified Clean Marinas. Information is available at DNR's website, www.dnr.state.md.us/boating. Fish Blockage Identification Many fish species need to move from one stream segment to the next in order to maintain healthy, resilient populations. This is particularly true for anadromous fish species because they spawn and hatch from eggs in free flowing streams but live most of their lives in estuarine or ocean waters. Blockages in streams can inhibit or prevent many fish species from moving upstream to otherwise viable habitat. The 2003 Stream Corridor Assessment will be the first accounting of blockages to fish movement that may exist in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds.  44   Stream Buffer Restoration 1. Progress In the Coastal Bays Watersheds 22 As shown on Map 20 Stream Buffer Scenario, stream buffer plantings have occurred at no fewer than 10 project areas between 1996 and the end of 2001 in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. Both the mapped information and the summary table below are drawn from a database maintained by the DNR Forest Service.

Benefits and General Recommendations Natural vegetation in stream riparian zones, particularly forest, provides numerous valuable environmental benefits:  Reducing surface runoff  Preventing erosion and sediment movement  Using nutrients for vegetative growth and moderating nutrient entry into the stream  Moderating temperature, particularly reducing warm season water temperature  Providing organic material (decomposing leaves) that are the foundation of natural food webs in stream systems  Providing overhead and in-stream cover and habitat  Promoting high quality aquatic habitat and diverse populations of aquatic species. To realize these environmental benefits, DNR generally recommends that forested stream buffers be at least 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream. Therefore, DNR is promoting this type of stream buffer for local jurisdictions and land owners who are willing to go beyond the minimum buffer standards. The DNR Watershed Services and other programs like Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), managed by the DNR Forest Service, are available to assist land owners who volunteer to explore these opportunities.  45   3. Headwater Stream Buffers Headwater streams are also called first order streams. For many watersheds, first order streams drain the majority of the land within the entire watershed. Therefore, stream buffers restored along headwater streams (First Order) tend to have greater potential to intercept nutrients and sediments than stream buffers placed elsewhere. In targeting stream buffer restoration projects, giving higher priority to headwater streams is one approach to optimizing nutrient and sediment retention. Restoring headwater stream buffers can also provide habitat benefits that can extend downstream of the project area. Forested headwater streams provide important organic material, like decomposing leaves, that ""feed"" the stream's food web. They also introduce woody debris which enhances in-stream physical habitat. The potential for riparian forest buffers to significantly influence stream temperature is greatest in headwater regions. These factors, in addition to positive water quality effects, are key to improving aquatic habitat. 4. Land Use and Stream Buffers One factor that affects the ability of stream buffers to intercept nonpoint source pollutants is adjacent land use.

DNR encourages creating stream buffers at least 50 feet wide on each side of the stream, which is significantly greater than minimum buffer requirement, to enhance nutrient and habitat benefits beyond minimum buffer requirements. 5. Nutrient Uptake from Hydric Soils in Stream Buffers In general, the nutrient nitrogen moves from the land into streams in surface water runoff and in groundwater. In watersheds like the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay drainage, a significant percentage of nitrogen enters streams in groundwater. Stream buffers can be used to capture nitrogen moving in groundwater if buffer restoration projects have several key attributes:  Plants with roots deep enough to intercept groundwater as it moves toward the stream 46    Plants with high nitrogen uptake capability, and  Targeting buffer restoration projects to maximize groundwater interception by buffer plants. Hydric soils in stream riparian areas can be used as one factor to help select stream buffer restoration sites. Siting buffer restoration on hydric soils would offer several benefits:  Plant roots are more likely to be in contact with groundwater for longer periods of time  Hydric soils tend to be marginal for many agricultural and urban land uses  Natural vegetation in wet areas often offers greater potential for habitat. Map 20 Stream Buffer Scenario identifies lands that are adjacent to streams, that are composed of hydric soil, that are used for crops or pasture and also lack naturally vegetated stream buffers. Restoration of stream buffers in these areas are would be most likely to intercept nitrogen, control sediment and phosphorus movement, and improve stream water quality and habitat in general. Additional assessment and field evaluation should be used to determine land owner interest, the practical implications of creating naturally vegetated stream buffers in areas identified and to evaluate any hydrologic modification of these soils, such as ditching or draining activities. For example, some areas identified on the map (north and east of Berlin) appear to be dense networks of ditching to serve agricultural fields. Creating naturally vegetated stream buffers in such areas is probably only practical if the land owner is no longer interested in using the area for crops. 6. Optimizing Water Quality Benefits by Combining Priorities Strategic targeting of stream buffer restoration projects may provide many different benefits. To maximize multiple benefits, site selection and project design need to incorporate numerous factors. For example, finding a site with a mix of attributes like those in the following list could result in the greatest control of nonpoint source pollution and enhancement to living resources:  land owner willingness / incentives  marginal land use in the riparian zone  headwater stream  hydric soils  selecting appropriate woody/grass species  adjacent to existing wetlands / habitat  Additionally, selecting restoration projects that are likely to produce measurable success is an important consideration in prioritizing projects for implementation. In general, targeting restoration projects in selected tributaries or small watersheds will tend to offer the greatest probability of producing measurable water quality improvement in the short term. By selecting small areas like a small first order stream for restoration, there is greater likelihood that local water quality will improve with relatively limited investment. In addition, local water quality improvements will likely contribute to downstream improvements.  47   Wetland Restoration Wetlands serve important environmental functions such as providing habitat and nursery areas for many organisms, facilitating nutrient uptake and recycling, providing erosion control. However, most watersheds in Maryland have significantly fewer wetland acres today than in the past. This loss due to draining, filling, etc., has led to habitat loss and negative water quality impacts in streams and in the Chesapeake Bay. Reversing this historic trend is an important goal of wetland restoration. In early 2004, the Maryland Department of the Environment will release an extensive assessment of wetland restoration opportunities in a report to be entitled ""Prioirty Areas for Wetland Restoration, Preservation, and Mitigation in Maryland's Coastal Bays"".26 It is anticipated that MDE's work will offer a number of ways to approach the issue of preventing loss of wetlands and enhancing wetland resources in and around the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. Using already available data, one approach to identifying candidate wetland restoration sites uses GIS to help identify ""historic"" wetland areas based on the presence of hydric soils. Map 21 Wetland Restoration Scenario indicates that there appears to be potential for wetland restoration based on identifying crop land and/or pasture on hydric soil within 50 of existing wetlands. This is one of many potential scenarios for finding opportunities for wetland restoration. The steps and priorities used to generate the map scenario are listed below:  Data used: Hydric soils (SSURGO), existing wetlands (DNR Wetlands), land use (Maryland Dept. of Planning, 2000).  Identify candidate hydric soil areas based on land use. Hydric soils used in agricultural fields are selected for consideration. Hydric soils used for development or underlying natural vegetation are not considered in this scenario.  Explore hydric soils based on land use / land cover and proximity to existing wetlands or streams. The potential wetland restoration sites suggested in the scenario can be filtered further by using more accurate wetlands and soil information and by considering land ownership or other factors like like habitat enhancement opportunities, sensitive species protection, targeting specific streams or subwatersheds for intensive restoration, and using Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) information.  48   REFERENCES 1.

The Town is an incorporated municipality and is the county seat of Queen Anne's County, Maryland. In the WRAS project, the Town of Centreville is working closely with Queen Anne's County and other stakeholders to consider local priorities for protection and restoration of water quality and habitat. The WRAS project area encompasses nearly 25,300 acres including nearly 1,400 acres of open water. The Town of Centreville is located at the head of tide on the Corsica River. The lower, tidal portion of the Corsica River enters the Chester River near Town Point in the oligohaline salinity zone. Depths of the tidal portions of Corsica River range from 1-2 feet in the upper tidal waters to greater than 15 feet near its confluence with the Chester River. As part of WRAS project, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is providing technical assistance, including preparation of a watershed characterization (compilation of available water quality and natural resources information and identification of issues), a stream corridor assessment (uses field data to catalog issues and rate severity) and a synoptic survey (analyzes benthic macroinvertebrates, fish and water samples with focus on nutrients). The Town of Centreville, with Queen Anne's County and other stakeholders, will use this information to help assess the watershed and to help generate the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. Water Quality The tidal portion of the Corsica River is mostly designated Use II for shellfish harvesting and the remaining tributary streams are Use I for recreation and aquatic life. Impairments to these uses include nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), fecal coliform bacteria which led to shellfish harvesting limitations, sediment, biological limitations (poor or very poor fish or benthic organism populations/conditions) and toxics (PCBs, Dieldrin and methylmercury) which led to current fish consumption advisories issued in January 2003. A Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) approved for both nitrogen and phosphorus in the Corsica River sets load limits for both nutrients. The TMDL reports that the primary source for both nutrients in the watershed is agriculture. The point source nutrients contribution is relatively small and is anticipated to be significantly reduced when land application of treated sewage effluent from Town of Centreville's Wastewater Treatment Plant begins in 2004. The Landscape Land in the Corsica River watershed is nearly 64% agricultural, over 28% forest/scrub shrub and over 7% developed. Wetlands identified by DNR comprise less than 0.5% of the landscape. The watershed has low population density (0.15 people/acre) and has little impervious cover except in and around the Town of Centreville.  vii   Natural resource lands of statewide or regional significance, identified as Green Infrastructure Hubs, occur in four areas. Connections between these hubs are mostly forest and agricultural land. Land protected from development encompasses 8% of the the Corsica River watershed including conservation easements, agricultural easements and County Parks/open spaces. About two-thirds of the watershed is prime agricultural land and about one-fifth is hydric soil. All other soils amount to about 13% of the watershed. Of the nearly 2,600 acres of wetlands that are identified in the watershed, about 81% are palustrine forested wetlands. Living Resources and Habitat Anadromous fish spawning areas for white perch, yellow perch and herring are identified in the Corsica River mainstem and three major tributaries. Nontidal fish species identified in the watershed are mostly tolerant and moderately tolerant of poor or variable water quality and habitat conditions. However, two intolerant species, roseyside dace and least brook lamprey, found in limited stream segments indicate that good water quality and good habitat conditions coincide in these small areas. Natural oyster beds that were documented shortly after the turn of the century in the Corsica River no longer exist there. Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in the Corsica River has only been identified using aerial photography in a few limited areas near its confluence with the Chester River. Its most frequent location since 1990 has been in Middle Quarter Cove. The bald eagle is the only sensitive species tracked by Maryland that is currently identified in the Corsica River watershed. Restoration Targeting Tools Using GIS, potential opportunities for habitat protection, stream buffer restoration and wetland restoration have been identified. These computer-generated assessments supplement the field information being collected during 2003 in the two field assessments: the Stream Corridor Assessment which catalogs and rates conditions found along and in streams, and the Synoptic Survey that will contribute water quality data, including nutrients, and assessment of fish and benthic communities at selected sampling sites.  vii   CONTRIBUTORS TO THE WATERSHED CHARACTERIZATION Centreville and Queen Anne's County Centreville, Town of Mike Whitehill Chester River Association Eileen McLellan Eastern Shore Land Conservancy Amy Owsley Queen Anne's County Commissioners Loring E.

The assessment, called the Unified Watershed Assessment, was conducted by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) under the direction of the US Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Water Action Plan initiative with assistance from the Maryland Departments of Environment, Agriculture and Planning and the University of Maryland. It moved beyond consideration of water quality in the streams in the state, which had been assessed regularly since the early 1970's, to a larger consideration of living resources in the streams and the landscape conditions which could impact both water quality and living resources.1,2 In response to the findings of the Unified Watershed Assessment, DNR offers technical and financial assistance to local governments who are willing to develop and implement Watershed Restoration Action Strategies (WRAS) addressing needs for restoration and conservation in priority watersheds. One of these projects is the Corsica River Watershed in Queen Anne's County, where the Town of Centreville, the County, DNR and other local cooperators, both public and private, are engaged in developing a watershed management strategy. Location Corsica River Watershed Acreage Summary MDP 2000 Land Use/Land Cover  The Corsica River Watershed is located within the Chester River basin as shown in Map 1 Land Water Total Location. The Corsica River Watershed's geographic location entirely within Centreville and 23,903 1,395 25,298 Queen Anne's County is highlighted in Map 2 WRAS Project Area. This area is the focus of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy and this Watershed Characterization. DNR subdivides the Corsica River Watershed into three ""12-digit"" subwatersheds for analytical purposes as depicted in Map 2. The table Subwatersheds summarizes acreage statistics for these subwatershed areas. Purpose of the Characterization One of the earliest steps in devising a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy is to characterize the watershed using immediately available information. This Watershed Characterization is intended to meet several objectives:  briefly summarize the most important or relevant information and issues;  provide preliminary findings based on this information;  identify sources for more information or analysis;  suggest opportunities for additional characterization and restoration work; and 1    provide a common base of knowledge about the Corsica River Watershed for local governments, citizens, businesses and other organizations. Additional Characterization Work The Watershed Characterization is intended to be one starting point that can be updated as needed. It is part of a framework for a more thorough assessment involving an array of additional inputs:  self-investigation by Centreville and Queen Anne's County  targeted technical assistance and assessment by partner agencies or contractors  input from local citizens  completion of a Stream Corridor Assessment, in which DNR personnel physically walk the streams and catalogue important issues.  completion of a synoptic water quality survey, i.e. a program of water sample analysis, that can be used to focus on local issues like nutrient hot spots, point source discharges or other selected issues. This is also part of the technical assistance offered by DNR. Findings of the 2002 synoptic survey of the streams in the Corsica River Watershed are reported in Appendix D. Identifying Gaps in Information It is important to identify gaps in available watershed knowledge and gauge the importance of these gaps. In assessing data gaps, we have found it helpful to review information in four categories:  Habitat: physical structure, stream stability and biotic community (including the riparian zone)  Water Quantity: high waterstorm flow and flooding; low waterbaseflow problems from dams, water withdrawals, reduced infiltration  Water Quality: water chemistry; toxics, nutrients, sediment, nuisance odors/scums, etc.  Cumulative effects associated with habitat, water quantity and water quality. Because restoration is an active evolving process, the Watershed Characterization and the resulting Watershed Restoration Action Strategy should be maintained as living documents within an active evolving restoration process. These documents will need to be updated periodically as new, more relevant information becomes available and as the watershed response is monitored and reassessed.  2   Subwatersheds In The Corsica River Watershed DNR and MDP 2000 Data Number 02130507XXXX 0395 Name ""12-Digit"" Subwatershed Corsica Direct Drainage Mill Stream Branch Three Bridges Branch and Gravel Run Corsica River Watershed Area in Acres Description With Water 8,382 Land Only 7,053 All tributary areas that drain directly to the estuarine portion of the Corsica River Includes south and west portions of Centreville Includes north and east portions of Centreville Entire ""8-Digit"" watershed  0396 0397 02130507  9,384 7,533 25,299  9,560 7,491 24,104  3   WATER QUALITY Water quality is in many respects the driving condition in the health of Maryland's streams. Historically, efforts to protect water quality have focused on chemical water quality. More recently, interest has focused on the biological conditions in streams and estuaries; active consideration of the physical parameters is even more recent. This developmental path is reflected in the ways in which streams have been monitored, the types of data gathered, and the regulatory approach taken. Water Quality Standards and Designated Uses All streams and other water bodies in Maryland are assigned a ""designated use"" in the Code of Maryland Regulation (COMAR) 26.08.02.08, which is associated with a set of water quality criteria necessary to support that use. Map 3 Designated Uses and Use Restrictions depicts the distribution of surface waters in each category. (COMAR or MDE should be consulted for official regulatory information.) 3,5 The Corsica River Watershed is assigned two uses: Use I: Water Contact Recreation, and Protection of Aquatic Life - all waters not otherwise designated as Use II below. Use II: Shellfish Harvesting Waters - All estuarine portions of Corsica River except above Earl Cove Use Impairments and Restrictions 4  Some streams or other water bodies in the WRAS project area cannot be used to the full extent envisioned by their designated use in Maryland regulation due to water quality or habitat impairments. These areas, known as ""impaired waters"", are tracked by the State of Maryland under Section 303(d) requirements of the Federal Clean Water Act. Maryland's list of impaired waters for the Corsica River watershed includes waters affected by water quality or habitat problems associated with several issues: Nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) Fecal Coliform Bacteria Sediment Biological Limitations (poor or very poor fish or benthic organism populations/conditions) Toxics  PCBs, Dieldrin and Fish Consumption Advisory  These impairments affecting portions of the Corsica River watershed are addressed below. Each water body listed may require preparation of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) to address the water quality and/or habitat impairment.4  4   1. Nutrients The tidal portion of the Corsica River is listed for impairment by nutrients in the 1996 303(d) list. The origins of these nutrients were listed: as natural and two types of human sources: point sources and nonpoint sources. According to the April 2000 report Total Maximum Daily Loads of Nitrogen and Phosphorus for Corsica River, impairment by both nitrogen and phosphorus contribute to excessive algal blooms and concentrations of dissolved oxygen below the minimum State standard of 5.0 milligrams per liter (mg/l). The algae and dissolved oxygen problems impair local conditions and interfere with the designated uses of the Corsica River. (Also see section on TMDL.) Nutrients can cause problems in the Corsica River for several reasons. In Maryland, most water bodies naturally have low levels of the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus. Without these essential nutrients, most water bodies could support aquatic life. However, in the tidal waters of the Corsica River either nitrogen or phosphorus can become too readily available. When this occurs under certain conditions with warm weather, sufficient light, etc., algae populations can grow to excessive levels. These algae can then crowd out other small organisms, cloud the water limiting light penetration, and eventually die-off consuming the dissolved oxygen that other aquatic life needs to survive. Nutrient pollution or over-enrichment problems may arise from numerous sources including all types of land and from the atmosphere. Residential land can be an important contributor of nutrients depending on fertilizer use, extent of lawn and the status of septic systems. Farmers apply nutrients using different approaches, so nutrients entering waterways from crop land vary greatly depending on management techniques. Typically, streams and other surface waters receive relatively small amounts of nutrients from forest land and relatively large amounts from land uses that involve soil disturbance and application of fertilizer. 2. Fecal Coliform Bacteria and Shellfish Harvesting Restrictions The tidal portion of the Corsica River is listed for impairment by fecal coliform bacteria in the 1996 303(d) list. The origins of these bacteria were listed: as natural and two types of human sources: point sources and nonpoint sources. Fecal coliform bacteria are a class of bacteria typically found in the digestive tract of warm-blooded animals, including humans. They are always found in animal waste and human sewage (unless it is treated to kill them). In unpolluted streams and tidal waters, it is common for water samples to contain very few of these bacteria. Water samples exhibiting significantly larger fecal coliform bacteria populations are ""indicators"" of contamination by animal, including human, waste. Depending on local conditions, sources of fecal contamination may include any combination of the following: inadequately treated sewage, failing septic systems, wild or domestic animals, urban stormwater carrying pet waste and similar sources. When fecal coliform bacteria levels are too high in tidal waters containing shellfish, harvesting is restricted to prevent consumption of contaminated food. Map 3 Designated Use and Use Restrictions, shows that portions of Corsica River are affected by shellfish harvesting restrictions. Tidal waters closest to Centreville are ""restricted"" which ""means that no harvesting of oysters and clams is allowed at any time."" This restriction applies to all the waters of the Corsica River east of a line extending in a northeasterly direction from Wash Point (39E04'51.2"" 5   North Latitude, 76E06'42.2"" West Longitude) to Cedar Point (39E04'57.9"" North Latitude, 76E06'29.6"" West Longitude). These restrictions are applied by the Maryland Dept. of the Environment (MDE) to protect public health because elevated fecal coliform counts are commonly found in this area of the River estuary. The elevated counts suggest the presence of contamination by animal or human waste. Restrictions are necessary because oysters and clams are filter feeders that readily absorb pathogens in animal or human waste. 3. Sediment The tidal portion of the Corsica River is listed for impairment due to suspended sediments in the 1996 303(d) list. The origins of these suspended sediments were listed: as natural and two types of human sources: point sources and nonpoint sources. Suspended sediment can cause water quality and habitat problems in several ways. Most unpolluted streams and tidal waters naturally have limited amounts of sediment moving ""suspended"" in the water. Excessive amounts of suspended sediment in waterways are considered pollution because they can inhibit light penetration, prevent plant growth, smother fish eggs, clog fish gills, etc. Sediment in streams tends to arise from stream bed and bank erosion and from land that is poorly vegetated or disturbed. Suspended sediment pollution may arise from construction sites, crop land, bare ground and exposed soil generally. The amount of sediment contributed varies greatly site to site depending upon stream stability, hydrology, management controls and other factors. 4. Biological Impairment One segment of the nontidal stream Gravel Run in the Corsica River watershed is listed for biological impairment in the draft 2002 303(d) list based on poor ratings for fish and benthic organisms (population and/or habitat). In selected stream segments statewide, populations of benthic macroinvertebrates and fish and their associated physical habitat have been assessed by the Maryland Biological Stream Program. Based on criteria developed for each physiographic/ecological zone in Maryland, each stream segment is rated as either good, fair, poor or very poor. Ratings of poor and very poor were listed as biological impairment for the first time in Maryland in the draft 2002 303(d) list of impaired waters. In the Corsica River watershed, one stream site appears in the list because of biological impairment. Gravel Run is listed based on 1995 sampling of the stream in the Town of Centreville. See the section on Maryland Biological Stream Survey Findings for additional details. 5. Toxics  PCBs, Dieldrin, Methylmercury and Fish Consumption Advisory The tidal portion of the Corsica River is listed as an impaired water body for toxic compounds because fish tissue sampling conducted in 2000 by MDE and the University of Maryland Center for Estuarine Studies found elevated concentrations of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) and Dieldrin. PCBs are listed as the cause for listing of the Corsica River area for impairment by toxic compounds. PCBs are a category of synthetic organic compounds that were widely used for several decades but they are now banded from use in the United States. Their resistence to high 6   temperatures and generally very stable chemical characteristics made them popular for use in high voltage electrical equipment like transformers including the type previously used in local electricity distribution networks. PCBs' stability and organic characteristics in the environment allow them to accumulate in the food chain including in fish that humans eat and in humans. These compounds are associated with toxic and carcinogenic effects. Dieldrin is mentioned in the 303(d) list as a toxic compound found in Corsica River area channel catfish tissue but it was not listed as a factor in the river's listing for impairment. Dieldrin is a synthetic organic herbicide that was once widely used but is now no longer in use in the United Stated. It is known to accumulate in the food chain including in fish that humans eat and in humans. This compound is associated with toxic and carcinogenic effects. The Fish Consumption Advisory for channel catfish in the Chester River/Corsica River area arose because of the elevated levels of PCBs and/or dieldrin found in the fish that were tested. Based on these findings, there is a risk that health problems could occur in people who eat these local fish too frequently. Fish tissue sampling conducted in 2001 by MDE led to issuance of a fish consumption advisory in late 2001 and an update to the advisory was issued by MDE in January 2003. The purpose of the advisory is to recommend that human consumption of channel catfish from the Chester River/Corsica River area be limited as described in the table below.

A TMDL is the amount of pollutant that a waterbody can assimilate and still meet its designated use. A waterbody may have multiple impairments and multiple TMDLs to address them. MDE is responsible for establishing TMDLs in Maryland. In general, TMDLs include several key parts: 1- Maximum pollutant load that the water can accept while still allowing the water body to meet its intended use. 2- Allocation of the maximum pollutant load to specific pollutant sources. As of March 2003, one approved TMDL directly affects the Corsica River watershed. The report Total Maximum Daily Loads of Nitrogen and Phosphorus for Corsica River was completed by Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) in April 2000 and was approved by US EPA in May 2000. It established Corsica River TMDLs for both nutrients as listed below. Nitrogen Phosphorus low flow TMDL annual TMDL low flow TMDL annual TMDL 1,379 pounds per month, May 1 through October 31 287,670 pounds per year 202 pounds per month, May 1 through October 31 22,244 pounds per year  These TMDLs mean that water quality impairment can be eliminated in the Corsica River if the total loads of nitrogen and phosphorus reaching the river are both reduced to this level or less. Collectively, these TMDLs are intended to meet two specific goals: a) avoiding harmful algae blooms (i.e., algae population density greater than 50 milligrams per liter (mg/l) of chlorophyll-a), and; b) maintaining adequate oxygen to support aquatic life (i.e. dissolved oxygen concentrations above of 5.0 mg/l as required by State regulation). MDE's computer model results indicate that nonpoint sources of nutrients are a most significant contributor as shown on the next page. The pie charts were adapted from MDE's report. In both cases, agricultural land is the largest nutrient source in the watershed. Based on the assumption that atmospheric deposition of nutrients is evenly distributed across the watershed, these relative load estimates associate nutrients arriving from the atmosphere into the land use type where they are deposited. To meet TMDL requirements, MDE anticipates two general approaches to controlling nutrients:  Nonpoint source nutrients will be controlled through existing programs, like implementing best management practices, and  Point source nutrients will be controlled at the Centreville Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP).  8   Nitrogen Sources Corsica River Watershed Point Source (4.00%) Urban NPS (4.00%) Forest NPS (6.00%)  Phosphorus Sources Corsica River Watershed Point Source (11.00%) Urban NPS (3.00%) Forest NPS (2.00%)  Ag NPS (86.00%)  Ag NPS (84.00%)  The allocations listed will be used by MDE in drafting NPDES permits for dischargers in the Corsica River watershed. For example, that the nutrients discharged from the Centreville WWTP, plus any other point sources in the watershed, must be less than the point source load allocations for the annual and the summer low flow load allocations. Based on the computer model results, MDE anticipates that point source low flow requirements can be met by applying NPDES permit requirements on the Centreville Wastewater Treatment Plant. The annual point source load allocations were based on projected maximum design flow at the Centreville Wastewater Treatment Plant assuming biological nitrogen removal and chemical phosphorus removal. MDE intends to monitor progress toward meeting the TMDLs through routine monitoring and additional TMDL evaluations. The estimated annual nonpoint source loads for both the nitrogen and the phosphorus TMDLs were based on Year 2000 land use projections. Additional details on nonpoint sources are presented in table Average Annual Nonpoint Source Load Estimates.

In the Plan, there were two categories for priority action: highest priority for restoration, and Water Quality Indicator Summary priority for protecting valued resources. Corsica River Watershed As the basis for the prioritization, From: 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment indicators of water quality, landscape and Indicator Name Finding living resources were developed for all watersheds in Maryland. Other approaches Modeled Load: TP 0.66 lbs/acre to assessing water quality have been in use for several years and are further described Modeled Load: TN 8.63 lbs/acre below. In general they do not look comparatively at watersheds as the Unified Comparison with similar Maryland watersheds Assessment did in an effort to set priorities. Green shading: goal or benchmark was met. The Unified Assessment also considered a Orange shading: goal or benchmark not met. range of living resource and landscape indicators described a little later. The Unified Assessment looked at five water quality indicators to compare the State's 138 ""8-digit"" watersheds though not all watersheds had information to allow generation of each indicator. 1. Modeled Loads for Phosphorus and Nitrogen In comparison to the other watersheds that drain to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, it is estimated that the Corsica River watershed receives 0.66 pounds of total phosphorus (TP) per acre in the watershed and 8.63 lbs/acre total nitrogen (TN). The TN yield meets Maryland's 10   benchmarks for these nutrients used in the Unified Watershed Assessment but the TP yield does not. Two of the most important pollutants in the Chesapeake Bay system are the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus, deemed this because of their contribution to excessive growth of algae, speeding the processes of eutrophication. To estimate how much TP and TN reaches the streams and how much of each is available for transport to the Bay, computer models are used. For the computer modeling used to generate the yield estimates reported in the Unified Assessment, the following information was used for the models: 1) monitoring data of point source nutrient discharges; 2) estimated nonpoint sources loads, based on 1996 land use and estimates of selected land management practices, and 3) consideration of other factors like deposition from the air. 2002 modeling conducted by DNR using 2000 data shows that the average yields for the Corsica River watershed are 0.759 pounds per acre annually of total phosphorus and 11.71 pounds per acre annually of total nitrogen. These load estimates may differ from the estimates used in the Unified Watershed Assessment for several reasons: changes in point source discharges and land use, and differing consideration of best management practices and septic system loads. An additional gauge of nutrient loads will be available in the results of the synoptic survey conducted in 2003. Water Quality Monitoring 1. Intensive Surveys 1992 and 1993 Intensive water quality surveys were conducted in 1992 and 1993 near the Centreville Wastewater Treatment Plant discharge and downstream to the Watson Road Bridge. This data was not used in the Corsica River nutrient TMDLs because the geographic coverage was too limited to characterize the entire tidal area of the Corsica River.5 2. 1997 Monitoring for the TMDL Two water quality surveys were conducted in the Corsica River watershed in the summer of 1997 to support work on the TMDL at locations shown in Map 4 Monitoring Water Quality. The summer represents critical conditions for the Corsica River. This is because there is less water flowing in the channel, higher concentrations of nutrients, and the water temperatures are usually warmer creating good conditions for algal growth. Data from these 1997 surveys was used to develop the nutrient TMDLs for the Corsica River.5 3. Long Term Monitoring in Tidal Waters Long term monitoring of tidal waters has been conducted in the Chester River at two locations. Similar long term water quality monitoring has not been conducted in the Corsica River. Based on interpretation of 1997 Corsica River water quality data, influence of the Chester River on Corsica River water quality conditions is not clear. Status and trends information for the Chester River long term monitoring stations is available on the Internet at http://www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/tribstrat/index.html .  11   National Academy Press, Clean Coastal Waters (2000) What Are the Effects of Nutrient Over-Enrichment? 6 The productivity of many [lake, estuary and] coastal marine systems is limited by nutrient availability, and the input of additional nutrients to these systems increases primary productivity [microscopic organisms including algae]. In moderation in some systems, nutrient enrichment can have beneficial impacts such as increasing fish production; however, more generally the consequences of nutrient enrichment for [lake, estuarine and] coastal marine ecosystems are detrimental. Many of these detrimental consequences are associated with eutrophication. The increased productivity from eutrophication increases oxygen consumption in the system and can lead to low-oxygen (hypoxia) or oxygen-free (anoxic) water bodies. This can lead to fish kills as well as more subtle changes in ecological structure and functioning, such as lowered biotic diversity and lowered recruitment of fish populations. Eutrophication can also have deleterious consequences on estuaries even when low-oxygen events do not occur. These changes include loss of biotic diversity, and changes in the ecological structure of both planktonic and benthic communities, some of which may be deleterious to fisheries. Seagrass beds are particularly vulnerable to damage from eutrophication and nutrient over-enrichment. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) harm fish, shellfish, and marine mammals and pose a direct public health threat to humans. The factors that cause HABs remain poorly known, and some events are entirely natural. However, nutrient over-enrichment of coastal waters leads to blooms of some organisms that are both longer in duration and of more frequent occurrence. Although difficult to quantify, the social and economic consequences of nutrient over-enrichment include aesthetic, health, and livelihood impacts  12   Water Quality Analysis The water quality analysis presented here is based on two water quality surveys conducted in summer 1997 by the State of Maryland for the TMDL. This limited data set allows for identification of warm weather problems but does not provide a complete understanding of variability throughout the year. Locations referenced in this section are shown on Map 4 Monitoring Water Quality. 1. Dissolved Oxygen Based on the 1997 water quality monitoring, dissolved oxygen concentrations in the lower Corsica River from the mouth to Miller Creek were consistently higher than the minimum 5.0 mg/l standard which indicates good water quality. Upstream of Miller Creek dissolved oxygen concentrations were commonly near or below the 5.0 milligrams per liter (mg/l) minimum standard. As dissolved oxygen concentrations decline below 5.0 mg/l, aquatic life has increasing difficulty respiring and must leave the area or face suffocation. Violations of this standard in estuarine waters, accompanied by high algae populations, indicate that poor water quality (eutrophic conditions) are present. 2. Algae Upper reaches of the Corsica River experience persistent season algae blooms. Based on the two water quality surveys conducted in the summer of 1997, chlorophyl-a concentrations in the Corsica River upstream of Miller Creek occasionally reached between 50 micrograms per liter (Fg/l) and 146 Fg/l. These chlorophyl-a concentrations indicate significant eutrophication existed in this part of the river. Downstream of Miller Creek, chlorophyl-a concentrations were consistently less than 50 Fg/l which suggests a relatively less significant concern for eutrophication. 3. Phosphorus Inorganic phosphorus concentrations measured in the Corsica River in 1997 ranged between 0.02 mg/l and 0.10 mg/l in most areas. However, in the vicinity of the Mill Stream Branch confluence with the Corsica River inorganic phosphorus concentrations slightly higher that 0.10 mg/l were measured. Though there is no water quality standard for phosphorus, concentrations higher than 0.10 mg/l total phosphorus are commonly considered to be an indication of eutrophication in estuarine waters. In the Corsica River downstream of Miller Creek, inorganic phosphorus concentrations of 0.05 mg/l and less were typical. This finding of lower inorganic phosphorus concentrations near the Chester River compared to upstream areas of the Corsica River suggests that the sources of the elevated phosphorus concentrations within the Corscia River watershed are more important than those potentially entering from the Chester River. 4. Nitrogen Total nitrogen concentrations in the upper tidal waters of the Corsica River (upstream of Emory Creek) ranged from around 1.0 mg/l to over 3.0 mg/l based on monitoring conducted in 1997. The tidal waters around Centreville exhibited total nitrogen concentrations greater than 2.0 13   mg/l. Though there is no water quality standard for total nitrogen, concentrations of 1.0 mg/l and higher in estuarine water are commonly considered to be an indication of eutrophication. Between the mouth of the Corsica River and Emory Creek, total nitrogen concentrations for summer 1997 ranged between 0.5 mg/l and 1.0 mg/l. The concentrations of less than 1.0 mg/l suggests less concern about eutrophication in the lower tidal waters of the Corsica River. 5. Toxics In 2000, MDE collected fish across Maryland, including the Corsica River, so that their tissue could be sampled for contamination by toxic materials as described in the prior section Use Impairments and Restrictions. A 1999 report by the Chesapeake Bay Program listed the Chester River (including tributary areas like the Corsica River) as an Area of Emphasis.14 This designation means that available data indicate that there is significant potential for a chemical contaminant-related problem. The monitoring data used to support this finding was collected in the Chester River mainstem in the vicinity of the Corsica River in both water column and sediment sampling stations. However, none of these sampling sites were in the Corsica River. Sources of Pollution Since European settlement of North America there has been an explosive growth in human population, supported by more intensive agriculture and the growth of industry. The entire continent has been crisscrossed and made mutually interdependent by vast transportation systems. All of this contributes to the decline in water quality and other natural resources. Sources of water pollution, which are grouped into two broad categories point sources and nonpoint sources, and nutrient pollution loads associated with these sources are discussed below. 1. Point Sources Pollution arising from discharges through pipes or other ""discrete conveyances"" are called point sources. Point sources may contribute pollution to surface water or to groundwater. For example, wastewater treatment discharges may contribute nutrients or microbes that consume oxygen (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)) reducing oxygen available for other aquatic life. Industrial point sources may contribute various forms of pollution. Some understanding of point source discharges in a watershed can be useful in helping to identify and prioritize potential restoration measures. The Corsica River Watershed has four permitted discharges, based on information from the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) permit data base. Summary information is presented in the MDE Permits Summary Table and on Map 5 MDE Permits:  The Corsica River's upper tidal waters and the lower Mill Stream Branch may have a localized impairment associated with the Centreville Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) according on MDE's interpretation of 1997 water quality monitoring data. This interpretation arises because 1997 monitoring of these tidal waters found that dissolved oxygen concentrations fell below 5.0 mg/l under some conditions and that total nitrogen 14   concentrations ranged between 1.0 mg/l to 3.0 mg/l. No other facilities with MDE permits appear to be contributing to these water quality problems.  The Town of Centreville anticipates that land application of treated sewage effluent could begin as early as 2004. This change could significantly reduce point source nutrient contributions to the river. Characteristics of permitted discharges (volume, temperature, pollutants, etc.) are tracked by MDE through the permit system. This information is accessible to the public and can be obtained from MDE.

Diffuse or Nonpoint Sources Sources of pollution that include areas of land and other sources that do not have a specific point of origin are called nonpoint sources. Nonpoint sources are commonly significant contributors of pollutants, particularly nutrients and sediment. These diffuse sources include rain water that runs off roofs, streets and parking lots (sometimes via storm drains) into nearby surface waters, as well as run-off from farm fields and, to a much lesser extent, forests. Also included in nonpoint source pollution is deposition from the atmosphere and contributions from ground water, where septic systems are a factor. a. Nutrients According to computer modeling presented in MDE's April 2000 nutrient TMDL report for the Corsica River watershed, nutrients from nonpoint sources dominate the average nutrient load to the river based on 1997 water quality data and projected land use data for the Year 2000:  15    Nitrogen from nonpoint sources accounts for about 96% of the entire nitrogen load to the Corsica River (268,211 lb/yr total nitrogen).  Phosphorus from nonpoint sources accounts for about 89% of the entire phosphorus load to the Corsica River (19,380 lb/yr total phosphorus). These nonpoint source estimates do not distinguish between naturally occurring nonpoint nutrients and those caused by human activity. Both types are accounted for in the load estimates. (Naturally occurring nutrient loads, also called background loads, are the loads that would be generated if the entire watershed was in undisturbed forest and no other human-generated nutrients were contributed through atmospheric deposition.) Given the current understanding of nutrient loads and related problems in the Corsica River, it is reasonable for WRAS partners to identify and prioritize projects with the intention of reducing nutrient loads for several reasons:  Elevated nutrient levels in the Corsica River, which is an indicator of eutrophication, may persist after upgrades to the Centreville WWTP envisioned in MDE's TMDL computer modeling. Elimination of the Corsica River's water quality impairments will likely require reduction of nutrient loads from nonpoint sources in the watershed.  Reduction of nonpoint source nutrient loads can be accomplished, in part, through existing programs that implement best management practices and through education of land managers. b. Sediment Nonpoint source sediment loads have not been estimated for the Corsica River Watershed. However, several current sources of information identify sediment as a problem:  The Corsica River is listed for impairment by sediment / suspended solids in Maryland's 303(d) list.  Phosphorus, which tends to be transported in association with soil particles, is identified as an impairment in the Corsica River. c. Shoreline Erosion Wherever land and open water meet, change in the form of erosion or accretion of land is the inevitable result of natural processes. Human activity in these areas often either inadvertently accentuates these natural processes or purposefully attempts to control movement of water and/or loss of land. Erosion of shorelines can contribute significant amounts of nutrients (mostly phosphorus) and sediment (water column turbidity, habitat loss.) The table Queen Anne's County Shore Erosion Rate Summary provides a brief overview of local conditions. 7  16   Queen Anne's County Shore Erosion Rate Summary (Miles of Shoreline) Total Shoreline Total Eroding Shoreline 95 (29%) Erosion Rate 0 to 2 feet / year 64 2 to 4 feet / year 12  7  4 or more feet / year 2  323  Maps of historic shoreline change were produced in 1999 by the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) in a cooperative effort between DNR and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These maps included digitized shorelines for several different years in Queen Anne's County. The maps show that extensive changes have occurred adjacent to large bodies of open water. Copies of these 1:24000 scale maps are available from the MGS. Currently, DNR is working to improve the ability to predict areas of high-rate shoreline erosion. In addition to considering historic erosion rates, contributory effects of land subsidence and sea level rise are being considered. To help generate predictive tools, two pilot areas have been selected: Queen Anne's County and Dorchester County. Results from this work are not currently available but information will be shared with local jurisdictions and other interests when they become available. Groundwater and Water Supply In the Corsica River Watershed, ground-water is the source for all water supplied to community use. The Town of Centreville operates the only community water supply system in the watershed under MDE permit QA1967G002. The Town's wells are all in the immediate vicinity of the community that they serve as shown in Map 5 MDE Permits. Much of the town is close enough to the wellheads to potentially affect them so it may be anticipated that the wellhead protection areas will encompass the majority of the town.. In general, community water supply systems employ confined aquifers in order to avoid the potential of local near-surface pollution. Therefore, community wells are not likely to affected by near-surface goundwater nutrient loads.  17   LANDSCAPE Water quality, particularly in streams and rivers, is affected by the land in the riparian zone and by soils, vegetative cover and the land use throughout the watershed. In an effort to gauge the affects of land use on water quality, and to allow comparison between watersheds, DNR has developed a series of Landscape Indicators. These indicators can be used to portray landscape conditions on a watershed scale that tend to support good water quality or that tend to degrade water quality. Landscape Indicators The 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan included a unified watershed assessment that used a number of landscape indicators to assess the State's 138 watersheds.2 Most indicators are relative measures by which Maryland's watersheds can be compared. The following sections identify the findings for the Corsica River Watershed from the 1998 Plan, with the exception of the population density, which is based on Year 2000 Census data. Landscape Indicator Summary Corsica River Watershed From: 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment Indicator Name Year 2000 Population Density Historic Wetland Loss Unbuffered Streams Soil Erodibility Finding 0.15 people/acre 4,192 acres 37 % 0.32 value/acre  Comparison with similar Maryland watersheds 1. Population Density Green shading: goal or benchmark was met. Based on the Year 2000 Census, the Orange shading: goal or benchmark not met. population density in the Corsica River Watershed was 0.15 people per acre of land. This is similar to the in the Unified Watershed Assessment estimate 0.17 people/acre based on 2000 population projections. As human population increases, the effects of human activity that degrades, displaces, or eliminates natural habitat also tend to increase. Watersheds with higher populations, assuming other factors are equal, tend to exhibit greater impacts on waterways and habitat. However, growth can be directed in ways to reduce negative impacts. A comparison with other watersheds in the state has not been completed using the 2000 census data.2 2. Historic Wetland Loss DNR mapping indicates that there are nearly 2,600 acres of wetlands in the Corsica River watershed now. However, assuming that all nonwetland hydric soils in the watershed were once wetlands, the estimated loss of wetlands over the years is 4,192 acres. This interpretation is based on the assumption that the hydric soils in the watershed were all, at one time, wetlands. Thoughtful selective restoration of historic wetland areas can be an effective WRAS component. In most of Maryland's watersheds, extensive wetland areas have been converted to other uses by draining and filling. This conversion reduces or eliminates the natural functions that wetlands provide.2 18   3. Unbuffered Streams Approximately 37% of streams in the Corsica River Watershed were not buffered with trees, based on 1998 information. Corridors 100 feet wide (50 feet either side) along streams were combined with forest cover to develop this indicator. This estimate of streams lacking forested buffer was generated for the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan by using Maryland Department of State Planning GIS data for streams and for 1994 land use. The finding for the Corsica River watershed compares well with other Maryland watersheds.2 In most of Maryland, trees are key to healthy natural streams. They provide numerous essential habitat functions: shade to keep water temperatures down in warm months, leaf litter ""food"" for aquatic organisms, roots to stabilize stream banks and vegetative cover for wildlife. In general, reduction or loss of riparian trees / stream buffers degrades stream habitat while replacement of trees / natural buffers enhances stream habitat. (For this indicator, only streams that appear on USGS Topographical Maps, sometimes called ""blue line streams,"" were considered in this estimate). 4. Soil Erodibility Soil erodibility for the Corsica River Watershed is represented by what is known as the K factor, in this case estimated to be 0.32.2 The K factor normally varies from approximately zero to about 0.6. A K value of 0.17 has a very low erosion potential, a value of 0.32 has a moderate erosion potential, a value of 0.37 has a high erosion potential, and a value of 0.43 has a very high erosion potential. This watershed's erodibility is moderate, although its ranking among all watersheds in the state was fairly high. Watersheds with more highly erodible soils are naturally more susceptible to surface erosion, sedimentation, streambank erosion and other problems related to soil movement. These negative effects of soil erodibility on water quality can be minimized through careful management. The soil erodibility indicator accounts for natural soil conditions but not for management of the land. (Existing cropland management was not considered.) The naturally erodible soils in the watershed are addressed by techniques called Best Management Practices (BMPs) to prevent soil loss, practices that are typically in use on local farms. BMPs like no-till or reduced till cropping, planting cover crops, field strips, or retiring erodible soils from production can significantly reduce erosion and sediment movement. These BMPs can be seen in use in many places in the watershed. Because soils can vary significantly within very small areas, a generalized erodibility indicator must be used with caution and supplemented with site-specific evaluation prior to implementing any management action.  19   Land Use / Land Cover  2000 Land Use The following table and pie Corsica River Watershed chart summarize 2000 land use / land cover for the Corsica River Watershed. Developed (7.23%) Wetlands (0.42%) They are based on categories Other (0.09%) established by the Maryland Department of Planning. Nearly 64% of the land in the Forest (28.37%) Corsica River Watershed is agriculture. About 28% is in some form of forest Agriculture (63.89%) and about 7% is covered with some type of developed or urban use. All other types of land together amount to less than 1% of the watershed. Viewing these general land use categories as potential nonpoint sources of nutrients, agricultural lands are likely to contribute the greatest loads to local waterways. Urban lands may also contribute significant nutrient loads. Map 6 Land Use / Land Cover shows the distribution of these land use categories in the watershed. Since this land use / land cover categorization was completed in 2000, significant land use change continues to occur in the watershed. For example, acreage to the east of Rt. 213 north of the Three Bridges Branch is shown as agricultural on the map. Some of this area was annexed by the town of Centreville several years ago and a housing development called North Brook now occupies some of this land.15 Land Use / Land Cover In Corsica River Subwatersheds Acres / Percent, MDP 2000 Data Watershed Corsica Direct Drainage Mill Stream Branch Three Bridges Branch and Gravel Run Corsica River Watershed (land only) Agriculture 3,968 56% 6,495 70% 4,809 65% 15,272 Forest 2,376 34% 2,370 25% 2,036 27% 6,782 Developed 633 9% 470 5% 624 8% 1,727 Wetland 76 1% 2 -22 -100 Other 0 22 -0 22 Total 7,053 9,359 7,491 23,903  Corsica River Watershed including open water 20  25,298   Looking at land use / land cover in the three subwatersheds of the Corsica River watershed, several characteristics can be ascertained from the map and the table below:  Corsica Direct Drainage subwatershed has the greatest percentage of forest and brush cover. It also has the greatest percentage of developed land even though it does not include a town center. Additionally, it has the smallest percentage of agricultural land use. Taken together, it appears that development is the least concentrated in this subwatershed compared to the other two.  Mill Stream Branch subwatershed has the greatest percentage of agricultural land and the smallest percent developed land even though in encompasses part of Centreville. This suggests that development is relatively concentrated in this subwatershed compared to the other two subwatersheds.  Three Bridges Branch and Gravel Run exhibits a mid-range percent of each major land use / land cover category compared to the other two watersheds. It also encompasses part of Centreville. Impervious Surface Roads, parking areas, roofs and other human constructions are collectively called impervious surface. Impervious surface blocks the natural seepage of rain into the ground. Unlike many natural surfaces, impervious surface typically concentrates stormwater runoff, accelerates flow rates and directs stormwater to the nearest stream without significant opportunity for stormwater infiltration into the ground. Watersheds with small amounts of impervious surface tend to have better water quality in local streams than watersheds with greater amounts of impervious surface. Urbanization and the increase in impervious surfaces that accompanies development can significantly impact stream health. Increases in the extent of upstream impervious surface are strongly associated with a decrease in stream quality. As impervious surfaces cover more of the landscape, less water infiltrates the soil and more water enters stream systems through runoff or stormwater discharge. This increased stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces contributes to stream quality degradation by introducing more non-point source pollution, higher temperatures, reduced stream baseflow and more erosive flood flow. The table Upstream Impervious Cover Thresholds shows the relationship between upstream impervious land cover and in-stream quality. These thresholds are based on extensive biological monitoring conducted by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey:10  21   Upstream Impervious Cover Thresholds Percent Less Than 2 Above 2 Above 15 Above 25 Affects on Stream Quality Imperviousness is relatively insignificant compared to other factors affecting habitat quality. In cold-water habitats, brook trout may be found. Negative impacts to stream health begin. Brook trout are never found in streams with watershed imperviousness above this threshold. Stream health is never rated good, based on a combined fish and benthic macroinvertebrate Index of Biotic Integrity. Only hardy, pollution-tolerant reptiles and amphibians can thrive, while more pollution-sensitive species are eliminated.  Map 7 Impervious Surface Corsica River Watershed reflects data developed by the University of Maryland's Regional Earth Sciences Application Center (RESAC).11 The map is color coded to show the relative amount of impervious cover in various areas of the watershed. Overall, there is relatively little impervious surface in the Corsica River watershed. Each of the three subwatersheds have average impervious cover of less than two percent. In appears that impacts associated with impervious surfaces are limited to small localized areas. Some of the local concentrations of impervious surface are in Centreville and adjacent to major roads. These concentrations of impervious surface may be generally suited to stormwater management control. Stormwater management retrofits and other forms of restoration could be targeted to these areas. Lands With Significant Natural Resource Value and Large Area 1. Green Infrastructure DNR has mapped a network of ecologically important lands, comprised of hubs and linking corridors collectively called Green Infrastructure. Hubs contain one or more of the following: - areas containing sensitive plant or animal species; - large blocks of contiguous interior forest (at least 250 contiguous acres, plus the 300 foot transition zone); - wetland complexes with at least 250 acres of unmodified wetlands; - streams or rivers with aquatic species of concern, rare cold water or blackwater ecosystems, or important to anadromous fish, and their associated riparian forest and wetlands; and - conservation areas already protected by public (primarily DNR or the federal government) and private organizations like The Nature Conservancy or Maryland Ornithological Society. This Green Infrastructure provides the bulk of the state's natural support system and ecosystem services, such as cleaning the air, filtering and cooling water, storing and cycling nutrients, conserving and generating soils, pollinating crops and other plants, regulating climate, 22   protecting areas against storm and flood damage, and maintaining hydrologic function. Protection of Green Infrastructure lands may be addressed through various existing programs including Rural Legacy, Program Open Space, conservation easements and others. Within Program Open Space, the Green Print program helps to target funds to protect Green Infrastructure areas. Map 8 Green Infrastructure shows that there is a significant amount of Green Infrastructure in the Corsica River watershed:  Four Green Infrastructure hubs are identified in the Corsica River watershed.  Only a small portion of one hub has some form of environmental resource protection. 2. Large Forest Blocks Large blocks of forest provide habitat for species that are specialized for conditions with relatively little influence by species from open areas or humans. For example, forest interior dwelling birds require forest interior habitat for their survival and they cannot tolerate much human presence. Map 9 Forest Interior shows blocks of contiguous forest that are at least 50 acres in size with at least 10 acres of forest interior (forest edge is at least 300 feet away) that may be important locally within the Corsica River Watershed. This size threshold was chosen to help ensure that the forest interior is probably large enough to provide locally significant habitat for sensitive forest interior dwelling species. The assessment shown in Map 9 differs from the Green Infrastructure assessment which considered only large blocks of forest land cover at least 250 acres in size that are likely to have state or regional importance. Protected Lands Protected Land Summary Corsica River Watershed  Map 10 Protected Land shows the Acres % distribution of protected lands in the Corsica MET / ESLC Easements 810 3 River watershed. As used in the context of watershed restoration, ""protected land"" Agricultural Easements 909 4 includes any land with some form of long term limitation on conversion to urban / developed County Parks, 239 1 land use. This protection may be in various Open Space forms: public ownership for natural resource or Protected Land Total 1,958 8 low impact recreational intent, private ownership where another party acquired the Watershed Land Total 23,903 100 development rights or otherwise acquired the right to limit use through the purchase of an easement, and other approaches. The extent of ""protection"" varies greatly from one circumstance to the next. Therefore, for some protected land, it may be necessary to explore the details of land protection parcel by parcel through the local land records office to determine the true extent of protection. The map also shows some land in the watershed is within a Rural Legacy Area. This land encompasses 564 acres or about 2% of the watershed. The Rural Legacy Area designation has 23   the potential to target Program Open Space funds to help protect additional land from development. Some of this land is already protected by easement and/or by County ownership. The land shown on the map that is not currently under easement or County ownership is open to land use change consistent with local zoning and comprehensive plan requirements. An additional area of land identified on the map is encompassed by the Priority Funding Area. Within these areas, State funding is more likely to be available in support of local development projects. This area closes about 1,441 acres which is about 6% of the watershed. These areas are one of several ways to anticipate where new development or redevelopment is likely to occur. For purposes of watershed restoration, a knowledge of existing protected lands and likely areas for new development can provide a starting point in prioritizing potential restoration activities. In some cases, protected lands may provide opportunities for restoration projects because owners of these lands may value natural resource protection or enhancement goals. Soils of the Corsica River Watershed 1. Interpreting Local Conditions with Natural Soil Groups Soil conditions like soil type and moisture conditions greatly affect how land may be used and the potential for vegetation and habitat on the land. Soil conditions are one determining factor for water quality in streams and rivers. Local soil conditions vary greatly from site to site as published information in the Soil Survey for Centreville and Queen Anne's County shows. This information has been summarized into Natural Soil Groups to help identify useful generalizations about groups of soils. Map 11 Soils By Natural Soils Groups shows the distribution of natural soils groups in the Corsica River Watershed as described in the table below. 2. Soils and Watershed Planning Local soil conditions are a useful element for watershed planning and targeting restoration. Soils with limitations like wetness or slope naturally inhibit active use for farming or development and may then be available as restoration project sites. By comparing Map 11 Soils By Natural Soils Groups with the preceding maps Map 6 Land Use / Land Cover and Map 8 Green Infrastructure, it may be possible to discern how patterns of active or passive land use relate to soil conditions. Natural Soils Groups and other soils assessments can be used to help identify potential areas for restoration projects or habitat protection. Hydric soils, for example, are more easily restored as wetlands than soils that were never saturated with water. See the chapter Restoration Targeting Tools for additional information.  24   Natural Soil Group Area Summary for the Corsica River Watershed Soil Group Description Prime Agricultural Soils Soils With Limitations for Farming B1a - Well drained, moderate erodibility.

Wetland Categories The Coastal Plain Province likely has the highest diversity of emergent estuarine and palustrine (fresh water) wetland communities relative to other Maryland physiographic regions because both tidal and nontidal freshwater marshes occur here. Wetlands are most abundant in the Coastal Plain due to the low topographic relief and high ground water table characteristic of the region. Estuarine Wetlands are abundant throughout the Coastal Plain. These systems consist of salt and brackish tidal waters and contiguous wetlands where ocean water is occasionally diluted by freshwater runoff from the land. These wetlands may extend far upstream in tidal rivers to freshwater areas. Differences in salinity and tidal flooding within estuaries have a significant effect on the distribution of these wetland systems. Salt marshes occur on the intertidal shores of tidal waters in areas of high salinity. Brackish marshes are the predominant estuarine wetland type in Maryland. They are found along the shores of Chesapeake Bay, mostly on the Eastern Shore, and for considerable distance upstream in coastal rivers. Estuarine shrub swamps are common along the Maryland coastal zone. Aquatic beds, comprised mostly of submerged aquatic 25   vegetation (SAV), were historically abundant in shallow water zones of Maryland's estuaries, especially Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Palustrine wetlands are freshwater wetlands that are not associated with streams or lakes. In general, they are associated with freshwater, high water tables or intermittent ponding on land. Forested wetlands are the most abundant and widely distributed palustrine wetland type on the Coastal Plain. These wetlands are found on floodplains along the freshwater tidal and nontidal portions of rivers and streams, in upland depressions, and in broad flat areas between otherwise distinct watersheds. Tidal freshwater swamps occur along coastal rivers in areas subject to tidal influence. Scrub-shrub swamps are represented in the Corsica River Watershed. Emergent wetlands on the Coastal Plain are characterized by a wide range of vegetation, depending on water regime. (Adapted from Wetlands of Maryland, Tiner and Burke, 1995.) 2. Tracking Wetlands Oversight of activities affecting wetlands involves several regulatory jurisdictions. The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) is the lead agency for the State and cooperates with DNR, the Army Corps of Engineers and other Federal and local agencies. As part of its responsibility, MDE tracks State permitting and the net gain or loss of wetlands over time. As the table Tracking Nontidal Wetland Change shows, the State regulatory program has measured a small net decrease of wetland acreage in the Corsica River Watershed over the past 11 years. This slowing of wetland loss in the watershed contrasts significantly with the estimated historic 4,192 acre wetland loss in the watershed as described in the Landscape Indicators section. Tracking Nontidal Wetland Change For The Corsica River Watershed In Acres 1/1/1991 through 12/31/2002 9 Permanent Impacts -0.95 Permittee Mitigation 0.45 Programmatic Gains 0 Other Gains 0 Net -0.49  Notes: 1) Regulatory tracking for authorized nontidal wetland losses began in 1991. Comprehensive tracking of voluntary wetland gains began in 1998. Only nontidal wetland changes are shown; tidal wetland changes are excluded. Acreage presented represents changes for the entire watershed. 2) ""Permanent Impacts"" refers to acres altered (e.g., filled, drained) under permit from MDE. 3) ""Permittee Mitigation"" refers to acres restored by a permit holder as required by terms of the permit from MDE. 4) ""Programmatic Gains"" refers to acres restored by MDE using fees paid into a compensation fund by a permit holder in lieu of undertaking mitigation himself. 5) ""Other Gains"" refers to acres of wetlands restored when not required as mitigation for permitted losses  26   3. Interpreting Wetland Distribution Map 12 Wetlands and Wetland Acreage Summary Table summarize distribution and categories of wetlands in the Corsica River Watershed. Two wetland categories account for all of the wetlands in the watershed:  Estuarine wetlands of all types account for slightly over 7% of all watershed wetlands, and  Palustrine wetlands account for the remaining 93% of watershed wetlands. Forested Palustrine wetlands alone account for over 81% of all watershed wetlands. In comparing the wetlands map to Map 6 Land Use / Land Cover, it can be seen that many of the nontidal wetland areas are depicted as forest on the land use map. And most of the estuarine wetlands are not identified on the land use map These differences are simply the result of two differing views of the landscape. For example, wooded nontidal wetlands can be viewed as ""wetlands"" from a habitat / regulatory perspective and they can be viewed as ""forest"" from a land use perspective. Similarly, most of the estuarine wetlands shown on the wetlands map are considered open water on the land use map. In the Corsica River watershed, differing perspectives on Wetland Acreage Summary Table counting wetlands are significant for Corsica River Watershed watershed management. From a land Wetland Class Acres use perspective, 100 acres of Estuarine tidal emergent 159 wetlands are identified by the scrub shrub 6 Maryland Department of Planning. unconsolidated bottom 4 From a habitat / regulatory unconsolidated shore 17 perspective, there are at least 2,592 Palustrine emergent 102 acres of wetlands in the watershed. flooded semipermanently 56 In the context of the forested 2,104 Watershed Restoration Action scrub shrub 54 Strategy (WRAS), wetlands serve unconsolidated bottom 90 valuable water quality and habitat Total Wetlands (DNR mapped 2,592 functions that may not be provided wetlands) by other land uses. Therefore, protection and enhancement of existing wetlands, and restoration of past wetland areas, can be a valuable element in the WRAS. (Also see the Wetland Restoration section.) Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) None of the wetlands in the table above are subject to WSSC regulations. See the Sensitive Species Section.  27   Floodplains Flooding was identified as a local issue early in the WRAS project. Flooding of public roads crossing streams is a particular concern. Map 13 Floodplain and Sea Level Rise shows that the 100-year floodplain extends far up tributaries beyond Centreville. In recent years, stormwater management requirements have provided a means to limit impacts of new development and impervious area that would otherwise contribute to stream degradation and flooding. However, these requirements may not significantly improve water quality or quantity problems that are driven by systemic watershed factors. For existing development and impervious area, retrofitting controls to enhance water quality and limit peaks in stormwater runoff may offer an additional way to protect waterways. Low Elevation Areas Subject to Sea Level Rise The average rate of sea level rise along Maryland's coastline has been 3-4 mm/yr or approximately on foot per century. Such rates are nearly twice those of the global average (1.8 mm/yr), a result most likely influenced from land subsidence. The rate of sea level rise is expected to accelerate in response to global warming, resulting in a rise of 2-3 feet by the year 2100. The low-lying coastal plains such as those along the eastern shore are vulnerable to impacts associate with rising sea level. Sea level rise threatens to exacerbate erosion and flooding, making areas more vulnerable to land loss, permanent inundation, and storm surge. Recognizing the need for advanced planning, the Department of Natural Resources developed a response strategy in 2000 and has been aggressively acquiring high-resolution elevation data (LIDAR) in the most vulnerable areas. Partial coverage of Queen Anne's County including the Corsica River has been acquired as select areas were defined as being less than 1.5 meters (5 feet) above sea level. Accurate elevation data will significantly improve the State and County's ability to define the most vulnerable areas and determine the most appropriate management measures to mitigate the impacts.8  28   LIVING RESOURCES AND HABITAT Living resources, including all the animals, plants and other organisms in the Corsica River Watershed are being affected by human activity. The information summarized here suggests that some of the significant stresses on living resources in the watershed are associated with alteration and destruction of habitat, excessive movement of sediment and excessive availability of nutrients. In the Corsica River watershed, information is available for fish, oysters, submerged aquatic vegetation, sensitive species. However, other forms of aquatic life, woodland communities, terrestrial habitats, and others should be considered as watershed restoration decisions are being made. Therefore, it is recommended that stakeholders in the watershed identify important living resource issues or priorities so that additional effort can be focused where it is most needed. New information should be added or referenced as it becomes available. Living Resource Indicators  Aquatic organisms are sensitive, in varying degrees, to changes in water quality and aquatic habitat. They are also sensitive Indicator Name Finding to landscape changes. This association SAV Abundance 1.0 offers two perspectives that are important for watershed restoration. First, SAV Habitat Requiremts 3.0 improvements for living resources offer potential goals, objectives and opportunities Nontidal Fish Index 7.9 to gauge progress in watershed restoration. Nontidal Benthic Index 5.8 Second, the status of selected species can be used to gauge local conditions for water Nontidal Habitat Index 4.3 quality, habitat, etc. This second Comparison with similar Maryland watersheds perspective is the basis for using living Green shading: goal or benchmark was met. resources as an ""indicator."" Orange shading: goal or benchmark not met. The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan's Unified Watershed Assessment, published in 1998, included a number of living resource indicators for the Corsica River Watershed.2 Several of these indicators rely on extrapolations from a limited number of sampling sites which were then generalized to represent entire watersheds. Some are indices comprising several conditions. Considering this limitation on field data, it would be beneficial to conduct additional assessments to provide a more complete understanding of local conditions.  Living Resource Indicator Summary Corsica River Watershed From: 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment  29   1. SAV Abundance For tidal areas of the Corsica River Watershed, the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) scored ""1.0"" for the Abundance Indicator, which means that SAV covered 10% or less of the potential SAV habitat. This indicator is designed to allow comparison of watersheds based on actual SAV acreage versus potential SAV acreage. To generate the score for this indicator, two measurements of SAV area were used: 1) area covered by SAV in the year 1996 was estimated using aerial survey data, and 2) the potential SAV area based on water depth (up to two meters deep), physical characteristics and historic occurrence of SAV. The benchmark used in the Unified Watershed Assessment of the Clean Water Action Plan for the SAV Abundance indicator was 10%. If less than 10% of the potential SAV area in a watershed was covered by SAV in 1996, then the watershed was listed in the category ""needs restoration"". If more than 10% of the potential SAV area in a watershed was covered by SAV in 1996, then the watershed was listed in the category ""needs preventative action"" to protect or enhance SAV abundance. No watershed in the State scored higher than 2, reflecting a maximum observed coverage of 20%. 2. SAV Habitat Index For tidal areas of the Corsica River Watershed, the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) scored 3.0 for the Index, which means that SAV habitat requirements were not met based on 1994-1996 data. This index is designed to allow comparison of watersheds based on several measurements of habitat conditions: water clarity as measured by secchi depth, dissolved inorganic nitrogen where applicable, dissolved inorganic phosphorus, abundance of algae as measured by Chlorophyll a and total suspended solids. The benchmark used in the Unified Watershed Assessment for the SAV Habitat Index was 7. A score less than 7 means that the watershed's habitat conditions were not favorable for SAV and the watershed was listed as being in need of restoration (Category 1). A score of 7 or higher means that 1994 through 1996 data showed that habitat conditions for SAV in a watershed were sufficient and the watershed was listed in the category for ""restoration needed"". The Corsica River watershed is among the lowest scoring half of watersheds statewide on this indicator. 3. Nontidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity With an IBI score of 7.9, the Corsica River Watershed met the benchmark set for the Nontidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI). The Fish Index of Biotic Integrity (fish IBI) for fishes have been developed for small (first- to third-order) non-tidal streams. Several characteristics of the fish community are measured: numbers of native species, of benthic species and of tolerant individuals; the percent of tolerant species, of dominant species, and of generalists, omnivores and insectivores; the number of individuals per square meter; biomass in grams per square meter; percent of lithophilic spawners; and percent insectivores. These characteristics are scored and summed to calculate a fish IBI for each sampled stream. Each watersheds score is an average of stream scores within the watershed. These watershed scores were ranked 1 (most degraded) through 10 (best condition). A score of less than 6 does not meet the benchmark set for this index. A score of 6 or greater meets the benchmark.  30   4. Nontidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity With an IBI score of 5.8, the Corsica River watershed does not meet the benchmark set for the Nontidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI). The nontidal benthic IBI looks at the insects and other invertebrates, like crayfish, living on the bottoms of streams, considering the overall community composition, the number and diversity of species and the presence of sensitive species. To calculate the benthic IBI, for the Unified Watershed Assessment, reference conditions were established for minimally-impacted streams. IBI values are relative to conditions in these minimally-impacted streams. An index of 6.0 or less means that restoration is recommended and an index of 8.0 or higher means that protection is recommended. 5. Nontidal Habitat Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) The Corsica River watershed's low overall index of 4.3 for habitat biotic integrity suggests that this watershed has significant physical habitat concerns relative to similar Maryland watersheds. This rank corresponds to an Maryland Biological Stream Survey's score of 2.8 which is in the ""poor"" range. A rank less than 6 means that restoration is recommended. This physical habitat indicator is developed for small (first- to third-order) non-tidal streams. It is based on several measures of in-stream habitat quality that are scored for each site based on observations of habitat condition in streams during sampling visits. The habitat measures rate the quantity and quality of physical habitat available in the stream for fish and benthic macroinvertebrate colonization and rate the degree to which the stream channel has been altered due to changes in watershed landscape. The physical habitat characteristics are measured, scored, weighted, and summed to calculate the indicator for each sampled stream. A low score, or a decline in score over time, reflects both natural disturbances and human-induced alterations of the stream habitat relative to minimally-disturbed reference sites. The mean habitat score for watersheds is reported on a scale of 1 (most degraded) to 10 (best condition). The ranked scores were divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). Watersheds with the best conditions ranked in the highest three quartiles and, thereby, met the benchmark. The watersheds with the worst conditions ranked in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds) and ""exceeded"" the benchmark. Physical habitat conditions in non-tidal streams and rivers are influenced by land use and land cover patterns in the watershed, such as the destruction of riparian forests and increasing the area of impervious land cover. Other major influences are channelization, encroachment by livestock, and blockages to upstream/downstream movements of fish.  31   Biological Monitoring In Streams The Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) sampled stream conditions in the Corsica River watershed in 1995 and 2000. Additionally, citizen volunteers in the Stream Waders program, which is associated with MBSS, assessed the benthic macroinvertebrate community at several sites in the watershed in 2000. Results from these sampling efforts address three broad categories of stream conditions as listed below. The findings in each of these categories, which are each summarized on a separate map, allow comparison of stream conditions across the watershed:  Fish as summarized in Map 14 MBSS Fish Index  Benthic macroinvertebrates (benthos or stream bugs) Map 15 MBSS Benthic Index  Physical habitat Map 16 Physical Habitat Index  Table MBSS Findings for 2000 and 1995 Additionally, overall conditions in a stream or subwatershed may be interpreted by considering fish, benthos and physical habitat together. Several interpretations are offered below.  Conditions that underlie the indices are complex and apply primarily to a local stream segment. No streams ranked as good or very poor for all indices. Typically, a stream segment ranks as a mix of good, fair, poor and/or very poor for the three indices.  There is a tendency for good/fair conditions to be associated with watersheds with the least disturbance (natural vegetation, forest) and for poor/very poor conditions to be assoiciated with greater disturbance (impervious area, agriculture, construction sites). Prior to creation of the MBSS method of assessment and random site selection technique, DNR used a biological assessment approach in nontidal steams known as rapid bio-assessment. While results of this assessment is not directly comparable to the current day MBSS data, it does provide a way to compare stream conditions during the early 1990s. The table DNR Rapid BioAssessment Data Summary lists these results.

Unimpaired natural streams may support a great diversity of species like bacteria, algae, invertebrates like crayfish and insects to fish,birds, reptiles and mammals. All these groups of organisms have been extensively assessed relative to water quality and habitat quality. One group, benthic invertebrates, was found to serve as a good indicator of stream condition including water quality and habitat quality. Benthic invertegrates are sometimes called ""stream bugs"" though that name overly simplifies the diverse membership of this group. This group includes mayflies, caddisflies, crayfish, etc., that inhabit the stream bottom, its sediments, organic debris and live on plant life (macrophytes) within the stream. Benthic macro-invertebrates are an important component of a stream's ecosystem. The food web in streams relies significantly on benthic organisms. Benthos are often the most abundant source of food for fish and other small animals. Many benthic macroinvertebrates live on decomposing leaves and other organic materials in the stream. By this activity, these organisms are significant processors of organic materials in the stream. Benthos often provide the primary means that nutrients from organic debris are transformed to other biologically usable forms. These nutrients become available again and are transported downstream where other organisms use them. Assessment of benthic organisms is a valuable tool for stream evaluation. This group of species has been extensively used in water quality assessment, in evaluating biological conditions of streams and in gauging influences on streams by surrounding lands. These organisms serve as good indicators of water resource integrity because they are fairly sedentary in nature and their diversity offers numerous ways to interpret conditions. They have different sensitivities to changing conditions. They have a wide range of functions in the stream. They use different life cycle strategies for survival.  33   MBSS Findings for 2000 and 1995 * Corsica River Watershed Score Watershed/Stream Mill Stream Branch Station # QA-N-014-219-95 QA-N-014-204-95 CORS-106-R-2000 CORS-205-R-2000 Three Bridges Branch and Tributaries QA-N-079-308-95 QA-N-079-316-95 CORS-107-R-2000 CORS-108-R-2000 Gravel Run QA-N-042-116-95 Fish 4.75 4.5 4.25 4.75 3.75 4 3.5 4 4 Benthos 3 3 2.1 3.9 4 4 2.7 4.7 2 Physical 65 75 --59 59 --21  Key for MBSS Data Table Index of Biotic Integrity Fish Benthic Physical Habitat Ranges for Index 1.0 (worst) to 5.0 (best) 1.0 (worst) to 5.0 (best) 0 (worst) to 100 (best) Very Poor 1.0 - 1.9 1.0 - 1.9 0 - 11.9 Poor 2.0 - 2.9 2.0 - 2.9 12 - 41.9 Fair 3.0 - 3.9 3.0 - 3.9 42 - 71.9 Good 4.0 - 5.0 4.0 - 5.0 72 - 100  * Additional details are available at http://www.dnr.state.md.us/streams/mbss/index.html  Click on ""Search Online Data"" (button on left)  Enter ""Lower Monocacy"" in dialog box for ""8 Digit watershed name"" and click on search  34   Fish and Oysters 1. Tidal Areas Map 17 Fish Spawning and Oysters shows that at least three anadromous fish species are known to spawn in several streams within the Corsica River watershed:  Corsica River mainstem, Emory Creek and Three Bridges Branch: yellow perch and white perch  Mill Stream Branch: yellow perch, white perch and herring Natural oyster beds were historically found in the Corsica River as also shown in Map 17 Fish Spawning and Oysters.13 Currently, there are no oyster beds or oyster leases designated by DNR in the Corsica River. The closest oyster beds currently designated by DNR are in the Chester River mainstem immediately outside of the Corsica River as shown in the map. The closest oyster lease areas are in the Chester River well downstream of the Corsica River in the vicinity of Kent Island. The reasons why the Corsica River oyster beds disappeared have not been established but sedimentation is likely to have been a factor. 2. Nontidal Areas Information on fish in nontidal streams is primarily gathered as part of the Maryland Biological Stream Survey. See Biological Monitoring In Streams for summary information. Additional information on fish populations and related recreational activities will be incorporated as it becomes available. Maryland Fisheries Service does not monitor freshwater fish populations in tributaries to the Corsica River, in part, due to an absence of public demand. Public access for freshwater fishing is unavailable on Corsica River tributaries according to the Maryland Guide to Freshwater Fishing (1992). Sampling of fish populations was conducted in selected stream segments of the Lower Monocacy River watershed in 1995 and 2000 by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS). A complete listing of fish species that were identified are listed in table MBSS Fish Species Findings For County Subwatersheds. While these findings are limited and they are aggregated by County subwatershed, they do offer some insights summarized below:  Portions of stream networks draining to Mill Stream Branch and Three Bridges Branch support Roseyside Dace and Least Brook Lamprey. These ""intolerant"" fish species require good water quality and habitat to survive in the long term.  The majority of the fish found throughout the Corsica River watershed are tolerant and ""moderately tolerant of poor or variable water quality and/or habitat conditions.  35   MBSS Fish Species Findings For Corsica River Subwatersheds Key For Color/Font Code* for fish species in the table below (white: no data) Tolerant Fish that tend to survive greater pollution and poorer habitat conditions Moderate Tolerance Fish with mid-range ability to co-exist with pollution and varied habitat conditions Intolerant Fish that require good water quality and good habitat conditions  Key for table: U means that at least one MBSS site identified the presence of this species.

May 1997.  37   Sensitive Species Sensitive species are generally recognized as being the plants or animals that are most at risk in regards to their ability to maintain healthy population levels. The most widely known are perhaps the Sate and Federally-listed Endangered or Threatened animals such as the bald eagle and Delmarva fox squirrel. In addition to well known animals such as these however, both the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Maryland DNR work through their respective Federal and State programs to protect a wide variety of declining non-game animals, rare plants, and the unique natural communities that support them. For the purposes of watershed restoration, it is valuable to account for the known locations and areas of potential habitat for sensitive species in a given area. They are often indicators, and sometimes important constituents, of the network of natural areas which form the foundation for many essential natural watershed processes. In fact, in addition to conserving biodiversity in general, protecting these species and/or promoting expansion of their habitats can be an effective component for a watershed restoration program. 1. Habitat Conservation Measures DNR's Wildlife and Heritage Service identifies important areas for sensitive species conservation in different ways. The geographic delineations most commonly used are described in the text box Marylands Sensitive Species Conservation Areas. As shown in Map 18 Sensitive Species, there are four Ecological Significant Areas (ESAs) identified by the State of Maryland in the Corsica River watershed. The purpose of utilizing these delineations is to help protect sensitive species by identifying the areas in which they are known to occur. Doing so allows DNR to work toward the conservation of these sensitive resources by evaluating potential impacts of proposed actions that may affect them. Specifically, working within an established procedural framework, the Wildlife and Heritage Service reviews projects and provides recommendations for activities falling within these overlays. The geographic areas covered by these overlays are course filters that allow for uncertainty by incorporating buffers around habitat areas. Accurate on the ground information regarding species locations and habitat delineations for a specific area can be obtained from DNR's Natural Heritage Program. It is also important to note that outside of the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area, DNR generally only places requirements on projects requiring a permit/approval or utilizing State funds. However, there are more broadly applied State and Federal laws and regulations which address ""takings"" of listed species. In addition, many counties have incorporated safeguards for areas associated with sensitive species into their project and permit review processes as well as adopting ordinances to protect them. In all instances, property owners are encouraged to seek advice on protecting the sensitive species / habitat within their ownership. 2. Rare, Threatened and Endangered Species List In the Corsica River watershed, the bald eagle Haliaeetus leucocephalus is the only species tracked in Maryland's rare, threatened and endangered species lists. Additionally, at least one colonial waterbird nesting area is found in the watershed. In general, these species are located within area on the Sensitive Species Map labeled as Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA). 38   Sensitive Species Protection Areas In the Corsica River Watershed Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA) At least four ESAs are identified in the Corsica River watershed as shown in Map 18 Sensitive Species. Each ESA contains one or more sensitive species habitats. However, the entire ESA is not considered sensitive habitat. The ESA is an envelope identified for review purposes to help ensure that applications for permit or approval in or near sensitive areas receive adequate attention and safeguards for the sensitive species / habitat they contain. Natural Heritage Area (NHA) No NHAs are located in the Corsica River Watershed. In general, NHAs have been designated as such because they represent rare ecological communities. These are areas which provide important sensitive species habitat. They are designated in State regulation (COMAR 08.03.08.10) and are afforded specific protections in the Critical Area Law criteria. For proposed projects that could potential affect a particular NHA, recommendations and/or requirements may be put in place during the permit or approval process. These would be specifically aimed at protecting the ecological integrity of the NHA itself. To help ensure that proposed projects which may affect a given NHA are adequately reviewed, an ESA is always designated to encompass each NHA and the area surrounding it. Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) No WSSCs are designated in the Corsica River Watershed. These selected wetlands, which generally represent the best examples of Maryland's nontidal wetland habitats, are afforded additional protection in sate law beyond the permitting requirements that apply to wetlands generally. The Maryland Department of the Environment may be contacted for more information regarding these regulations. To help ensure that proposed projects that may affect a WSSC are adequately reviewed, an ESA is always designated to encompass each WSSC and the area surrounding it. For a listing of designated sites see COMAR 26.23.06.01 at www.dsd.state.md.us  39   Submerged Aquatic Vegetation The well-defined link between water quality and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) distribution/abundance make SAV communities good barometers of the health of estuarine ecosystems. SAV is not only important as an indicator of water quality, but it is also a critical nursery habitat for many estuarine species. For example, blue crab ""post-larvae"" are up to 30 times more abundant in SAV beds than in adjacent unvegetated areas. Additionally, several species of waterfowl depend on SAV for food when they over-winter in the Chesapeake region. Map 19 Submerged Aquatic Vegetation and the adjacent table show SAV Presence in the Corsica River By Year that SAV has intermittently appeared in (Years not listed  No data Available) the Corsica River during the 1980s and 1980 and 1984 absent 1990s based on interpretation of aerial photography. 1985 near River Estates In 1985 and 1987, SAV appeared only on the north side of the river near 1986 absent River Estates.

In partnership with the Town of Centreville and Queen Anne's County, DNR is conducting a Stream Corridor Assessment in the Corsica River Watershed during 2003. In this effort, trained teams from the Maryland Conservation Corps walk along streams to identify and document potential problems and restoration opportunities such as the items listed below: Stream Corridor Assessment Data Collection Categories Pipe Outfalls Pond Sites Tree Blockages Inadequate Buffers Erosion Fish Blockages Exposed Pipe Unusual Conditions Trash Dumping In- or Near-Stream Construction  A stream corridor assessment report will be generated, including maps and photographs, to support targeting decisions for restoration projects. Draft data summaries are expected to be available in late 2003. The results of the stream corridor assessment will provide a valuable foundation for development of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. 2003 Synoptic Survey and Aquatic Community Assessment During 2003 DNR staff collected water quality samples in nontidal streams to supplement knowledge of local conditions. The water quality findings included in the report on this work can help identify problem areas and relative conditions among local streams based on measurements of dissolved oxygen, pH, nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen), conductivity and flow. The findings will include nutrient load estimates at each sampling site and ranking of subwatersheds based on these estimates. For some of these nontidal stream sampling sites, DNR staff has also assessed fish and benthic organism populations. These assessments provide additional perspectives to gauge local water quality and habitat conditions. 41   Agricultural Conservation Programs Many farmers in Queen Anne's County willingly implement management systems that address nutrient runoff and infiltration, erosion and sediment control, and animal waste utilization. Some of the conservation practices in plans include grassed waterways, riparian herbaceous and riparian forested buffers, conservation cover, cover crops, shallow water wildlife areas and grade stabilization structures. The Maryland Agricultural Cost-Share program (MACS), the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP and CREP) and the Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) are some of the state and federal programs promoted and administered by the Queen Anne's SCD and Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS). 28 Fish Blockage Removal The 2003 Stream Corridor Assessment will identify blockages to fish movement that exist in the Corsica River watershed. Many fish species need to move from one stream segment to the next in order to maintain healthy, resilient populations. This is particularly true for anadromous fish species because they spawn and hatch from eggs in free flowing streams but live most of their lives in estuarine or ocean waters. Blockages in streams can inhibit or prevent many fish species from moving upstream to otherwise viable habitat. Marina Programs In the Corsica River watershed, the only marina listed in DNR's Marina database is Centreville Public Landing. According the information available from the database, this marina does not offer pumpout facilities and it is not participating in Maryland's Clean Marina Program. Discharges of sewage from boats are a concern for water quality because they contribute nutrients, biochemical oxygen demand and pathogens. This type of discharge to the Corsica River probably contributes to the problems identified in the River associated with nutrients and bacteria. At this time, the relative contribution of boat discharges to these problems has not been quantified. The Clean Marinas Program is a way for marina owners to gain certification and public recognition for voluntarily undertaking a number of actions related to marina design, operation, and maintenance intended to properly manage all kinds of marine waste, by-products and activities. DNR also funds installation and maintenance of marine pumpout facilities, including those at certified Clean Marinas. Information is available at DNR's website, www.dnr.state.md.us/boating.  42   Stream Buffer Restoration 1. Benefits and General Recommendations Natural vegetation in stream riparian zones, particularly forest, provides numerous valuable environmental benefits:  Reducing surface runoff  Preventing erosion and sediment movement  Using nutrients for vegetative growth and moderating nutrient entry into the stream  Moderating temperature, particularly reducing warm season water temperature  Providing organic material (decomposing leaves) that are the foundation of natural food webs in stream systems  Providing overhead and in-stream cover and habitat  Promoting high quality aquatic habitat and diverse populations of aquatic species. To realize these environmental benefits, DNR generally recommends that forested stream buffers be at least 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream. Therefore, DNR is promoting this type of stream buffer for local jurisdictions and land owners who are willing to go beyond the minimum buffer standards. The DNR Watershed Services and other programs like Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), managed by the DNR Forest Service, are available to assist land owners who volunteer to explore these opportunities. 2. Using GIS Identifying the areas that need buffer restoration and prioritizing them for action can be a time-consuming, expensive project. That is why computerized Geographic Information System (GIS) is used here to manipulate remotely sensed data can help save limited time and funds. However, it is important to verify these scenarios using field information like that gathered by a Stream Corridor Assessment. It is also valuable to consider other potential scenarios or combinations of scenarios to support prioritization and decision making. 3. Headwater Stream Buffers For many watersheds, headwater streams (first order streams) drain the majority of the land within the entire watershed. Therefore, stream buffers restored along headwater streams (First Order) tend to have greater potential to intercept nutrients and sediments than stream buffers placed elsewhere. In targeting stream buffer restoration projects, giving higher priority to headwater streams is one approach to optimizing nutrient and sediment retention. Restoring headwater stream buffers can also provide habitat benefits that can extend downstream of the project area. Forested headwater streams provide important organic material, like decomposing leaves, that ""feed"" the stream's food web. They also introduce woody debris which enhances in-stream physical habitat. The potential for riparian forest buffers to significantly influence stream temperature is greatest in headwater regions. These factors, in addition to positive water quality effects, are key to improving aquatic habitat. Since the Corsica River Watershed has a substantial percentage of its headwater streams in interior forests, protection of these forests against impacts from development may be an important part of WRAS strategies, along with reforestation where necessary. 43   4. Land Use and Stream Buffers One factor that affects the ability of stream buffers to intercept nonpoint source pollutants is adjacent land use. Nutrient and sediment loads from different land uses can vary significantly as shown in the adjacent table. By restoring naturally vegetated stream buffers adjacent to lands Annual Nonpoint Source Pollution Load Rates producing the highest By Land Use pollutant loads, nutrient and Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model (2000) sediment loads can be Land Use Nitrogen Phosphorus Sediment reduced most efficiently. (lbs/ac) (lbs/ac) (tons/ac) Map 20 Stream Buffer Scenario focuses on the Crop land 17.11 1.21 0.74 crop and pasture lands Urban 7.5 0.7 0.09 within 50 feet of a stream and identifies stream Pasture 8.40 1.15 0.30 segments that lack naturally vegetated stream buffers. Forest 1.42 0.00 0.03 DNR encourages creating stream buffers at least 50 feet wide on each side of the stream, which is significantly greater than minimum buffer requirement, to enhance nutrient and habitat benefits beyond minimum buffer requirements. 5. Nutrient Uptake from Hydric Soils in Stream Buffers In general, the nutrient nitrogen moves from the land into streams in surface water runoff and in groundwater with a significant percentage of nitrogen entering streams in groundwater. Stream buffers can be used to capture nitrogen moving in groundwater if buffer restoration projects have several key attributes:  Plants with roots deep enough to intercept groundwater as it moves toward the stream  Plants with high nitrogen uptake capability, and  Targeting buffer restoration projects to maximize groundwater interception by buffer plants. Hydric soils in stream riparian areas can be used as one factor to help select stream buffer restoration sites. Siting buffer restoration on hydric soils would offer several benefits:  Plant roots are more likely to be in contact with groundwater for longer periods of time  Hydric soils tend to be marginal for many agricultural and urban land uses  Natural vegetation in wet areas often offers greater potential for habitat. Map 20 Stream Buffer Scenario identifies lands adjacent to streams that are composed of hydric soil, that are crop or pasture land and also lack naturally vegetated stream buffers. An important next step in using this information is verification of field conditions. Care must be 44   taken during field validation to evaluate any hydrologic modification of these soils, such as ditching or draining activities, which would serve to decrease potential benefits. 6. Optimizing Water Quality Benefits by Combining Priorities Strategic targeting of stream buffer restoration projects may provide many different benefits. To maximize multiple benefits, site selection and project design need to incorporate numerous factors. For example, finding a site with a mix of attributes like those in the following list could result in the greatest control of nonpoint source pollution and enhancement to living resources:  land owner willingness / incentives  marginal land use in the riparian zone  headwater stream  hydric soils  selecting appropriate woody/grass species  adjacent to existing wetlands / habitat  Additionally, selecting restoration projects that are likely to produce measurable success is an important consideration in prioritizing projects for implementation. In general, targeting restoration projects in selected tributaries or small watersheds will tend to offer the greatest probability of producing measurable water quality improvement in the short term. By selecting small areas like a small first order stream for restoration, there is greater likelihood that local water quality will improve with relatively limited investment. In addition, local water quality improvements will likely contribute to downstream improvements. Wetland Restoration Wetlands serve important environmental functions such as providing habitat and nursery areas for many organisms, facilitating nutrient uptake and recycling, providing erosion control. However, most watersheds in Maryland have significantly fewer wetland acres today than in the past. This loss due to draining, filling, etc., has led to habitat loss and negative water quality impacts in streams and in the Chesapeake Bay. Reversing this historic trend is an important goal of wetland restoration. One approach to identifying candidate wetland restoration sites involves identifying ""historic"" wetland areas based on the presence of hydric soils. This process can be accelerated by using GIS to manipulate soils information with other data like land use. The GIS products can then assist in initiating the candidate site search process, targeting site investigations and helping to identify land owners. Map 21 Wetland Restoration Scenario indicates that there is potential for wetland restoration based on identifying agricultural fields (crop or pasture) on hydric soil. This is one of many potential scenarios for finding opportunities for wetland restoration. The steps and priorities used to generate the map are listed below:  Data used: Hydric soils (Maryland Dept. of Planning Data), existing wetlands (DNR Wetlands), land use (Maryland Dept. of Planning, 2000).  Identify candidate hydric soil areas based on land use. Hydric soils used in agricultural fields are selected for consideration. Hydric soils used for development or underlying natural vegetation are not considered in this scenario. 45    Explore hydric soils based on land use / land cover and proximity to existing wetlands or streams. The potential wetland restoration sites suggested in the scenario can be filtered further by using more accurate wetlands and soil information and by considering land ownership or other factors like like habitat enhancement opportunities, sensitive species protection, targeting specific streams or subwatersheds for intensive restoration, and using Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) information.

Land adjacent to a stream. 2. Riparian areas are transitional between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and are distinguished by gradients in biophysical conditions, ecological processes, and biota. They are areas through which surface and subsurface hydrology connect waterbodies with their adjacent uplands. They include those portions of terrestrial ecosystems that significantly influence exchanges of energy and matter with aquatic ecosystems (i.e. a zone of influence). Riparian areas are adjacent to perennial, intermittent, and ephemeral streams, lakes, and estuarine-marine shorelines.

GX046-82-6452988	"This document is also available in pdf format:    fs-021-99.pdf    Maryland   Chesapeake Bay Studies    The Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP), a multiagency restoration effort, has set    a goal of reducing controllable nutrients entering the Chesapeake Bay by 40    percent by the year 2000. The reduction is expected to improve dissolved-oxygen    levels in the Bay. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Ecosystem Program is coordinating    USGS and other agencies' studies to understand the response of water quality    and living resources in the Bay and its watershed to nutrient reduction and    natural variability. The USGS is analyzing trends, identifying nutrient-source    areas, addressing nutrient traveltimes in ground water, determining the relation    of nutrients to fish health, and documenting the long-term change of the ecosystem.    Since 1985, the USGS has provided water-quality information and analyzed the    amounts of nutrients and sediments entering the Bay (fig. 1). An analysis of    the data collected from rivers in the Bay watershed from 1985 to 1997 shows    that although the amounts of nutrients and sediments delivered to the Bay may    have increased, the concentrations of nutrients and sediments in many rivers    are decreasing or remain the same.                                image size 47KB                     Figure 1.  Total nitrogen yields from stream reaches in the Chesapeake        Bay watershed.         The USGS also is relating sources of nutrients to amounts of nutrients delivered    to the Bay by using a statistical model called SPARROW. The SPARROW model is    being adopted by the CBP as one of the tools used for identifying Nutrient Areas    of Concern. SPARROW calculations also will be used to explain the trend results    and to link nutrient sources to nutrients in ground-water loads and their delivery    to surface water.    The USGS is providing preliminary information on the amount and traveltime    of nutrients in shallow aquifers in the Bay watershed. Initial findings indicate    that about half of the water and nutrients entering the Bay travel through the    ground-water system. Nutrients may move through ground water for several years    or several decades before reaching rivers or the Bay, thus significantly delaying    the benefits of nutrient-reduction measures implemented on land.    Reports of high numbers of fish with skin lesions in the Pocomoke River and    other tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay have stimulated a great deal of public    and scientific interest (fig. 2). The USGS, in cooperation with the State of    Maryland, assessed fish health in five tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay throughout    the spring, summer, and fall of 1998 in response to concerns about  Pfiesteria ,    a toxic marine microorganism. This microorganism is believed to be the cause    of some estuarine fish kills and lesion outbreaks, primarily in menhaden, as    well as having potential human-health implications. Although fish kills of this    origin did not occur in 1998, lesioned menhaden were collected from the Pocomoke,    Wico-mico, and Choptank Rivers during the USGS fish-health assessments. Examination    of the lesions showed that all of them contained an invasive fungus, suggesting    that these particular lesions were not necessarily caused by  Pfiesteria .    Further research will be directed toward understanding the invasiveness of the    fungus, causes of stress that may be necessary for infection, and what environmental    factors are related to the high incidence of these fungal lesions in menhaden.                                     image size 38KB                     Figure 2.  Menhaden with lesions; Wicomico River, August 1998.          Although environmental problems such as pollution, urbanization, and deforestation    commonly are attributed to human activities in the Bay's watershed, it is now    recognized that climatic factors also strongly influence the salinity, temperature,    and water quality of the Bay. Concern about the Bay's future is especially acute    for policymakers and landresource managers who are faced with questions such    as: Will the anomalously high and variable river discharge of the past decade    continue? What will be the future effect of possible changes in mean-annual    rainfall projected by climate models? How will the changes in river discharge    and rainfall affect nutrients and levels of dissolved oxygen in the Bay? Have    unique climatic and hydrologic conditions contributed to recent toxic algal    blooms?    The above subjects are being addressed as part of a USGS interdisciplinary    research project investigating year-to-year through long-term variability in    salinity, sediment accumulation rates and budgets, dissolved oxygen, temperature,    sea level, and plant and animal trends, using fossil and geochemical data from    Chesapeake Bay sediment cores.    Stream-Gaging Network    The USGS and its cooperative partners are developing an approach to maintaining    an efficient stream-gaging network in Maryland (fig. 3) through the Maryland    Water Monitoring Council. These efforts produced a gain of several important    gages in the statewide network in 1998.                                image size 30KB                     Figure 3.  Locations of USGS stream-gaging stations in Maryland.         A Council workgroup investigated the status of stream gaging in Maryland and    the issues related to continued operation and needed growth of the current network.    A workgroup is focusing on two specific aspects of stream gaging: the representativeness    of the principal physical characteristics of Maryland watersheds, and an inventory    of streamflow data users and their applications. Preliminary analyses show that    some important geographic areas of Maryland and certain significant physical    characteristics are not well represented by the current network.    Geology of the Washington-Baltimore Area    The USGS, in cooperation with the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS), produces    technical papers and maps about the geology of Maryland. Since 1968, these organizations    have mapped bedrock and surface geology throughout Maryland at scales of 1:62,500    and 1:24,000. This includes 1:24,000-scale mapping of the Maryland Piedmont    region since 1974. Geologic maps contain information that can be used for a    wide range of public and private applications such as land-use planning; ground-water    availability and quality studies; finding and making the best use of earth resources,    such as natural aggregate for construction; hazard assessment; and engineering    and environmental studies for waste-disposal sites and construction projects.     The USGS, in cooperation with the MGS, is producing a geologic map of the Chesapeake    and Ohio Canal National Historical Park for the National Park Service. Personnel    of the Appalachian Geology and Hydrology Project (conducted in cooperation with    the MGS) map geology in the urban, suburban, and outlying rural areas of the    Washington-Baltimore region. The results of the project will be 1:100,000-scale    geologic maps on paper and in electronic formats.    Destruction of Marsh by South American Nutria    A USGS study of South American nutria showed the destructive effect of these    large exotic rodents on marsh habitats in Maryland's Blackwater National Wildlife    Refuge. The research was conducted with the USGS Maryland Cooperative Fish and    Wildlife Research Unit, Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and the    U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.    Research on the role of the plant-eating nutria in marsh loss is also of special    interest to the Chesapeake Bay Program, which seeks to achieve ""no net    loss"" of wetlands within the Bay watershed. Introduced in the 1940's to    bolster Maryland's Eastern Shore fur industry, the South American nutria (fig.    4), which is 4 to 10 times as large as a native muskrat, has been implicated    in the loss of emergent marsh, especially along the Blackwater River in Dorchester    County. Marsh loss has coincided with the introduction and expansion of the    nutria population.                                              image size 67KB                               Figure 4.  Large South American nutria.         A recent study found that within the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, 3,500    acres of marsh have been lost to open water since the late 1930's, and 53 percent    of remaining marsh is considered unhealthy. Although other factors, such as    rising sea level, also contribute to marsh loss, nutria have accelerated the    problem during the past two decades—primarily because a decline in the fur industry    has led to overpopulation of the rodent in lower Eastern Shore marshes.    The overabundance of nutria and the rapid loss of marsh in this region have    prompted State legislation proposing a 10-year nutria eradication program. The    relation between nutria feeding habits and marsh loss, however, remains unclear,    and a long-term eradication program awaits evidence of cause and effect. The    USGS study is intended to determine if excluding nutria from emergent marsh    habitats can stabilize or recover marsh vegetation. Aerial photography and ground-plot    measurements are being used to detect changes.    Research results have already demonstrated the need for animal-control activities    to preserve the marsh. Future results are intended to enable natural-resource    management agencies to determine if more intensive marsh recovery efforts are    needed to restore the more heavily damaged areas.    Urban Growth in the Baltimore-Washington Area    A study team from the USGS and the University of Maryland Baltimore County    (funded by NASA's Mission to Planet Earth) is developing a data base reflecting    200 years of urban development in the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area.    Other organizations, such as the Smith-sonian Institution and the Bureau of    the Census, have entered into this partnership to enhance the scope of the data    base.    Urban areas have a strong impact on local land use and land cover. Modern urban    settlements are characterized by the proliferation of asphalt and concrete surfaces.    Land-cover changes associated with an urban area can be immense. The effect    of urban land on economic and environmental systems is significant compared    to its areal extent.    The Chesapeake Bay's delicate ecosystem has been affected negatively by increasing    urban growth. A data base has been developed by combining information from a    variety of sources into an integrated, multi-scale, multiresolution data set.    This data base reflects regional urban growth from 1792 to 1992.    Temporal urban maps depict past landscapes by combining historical maps, census    statistics, and commerce records to generate progressive pictures of urban growth    in the Baltimore-Washington region during the past two centuries. Remotely sensed    data, existing digital land-use data, digital census information, earth-science    data such as digital line graphs, digital elevation models, and demographic    information are used for analysis.    Mid-Atlantic Region Water-Quality Studies    The USGS is conducting environmental assessments in the Mid-Atlantic region,    including parts of Maryland and the District of Columbia. The USGS assessed    regional water quality in the Delmarva Peninsula (1986-91); and the Potomac River    Basin (1991-98) as part of the National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program.     The Delmarva study showed that agricultural and residential land use have affected    ground-water quality. High concentrations of nitrate are found in ground water    in most parts of the surficial aquifer, including deep parts of the aquifer    used for water supply. Pesticides used on common crops were found at trace concentrations    in very shallow ground water, but pesticides generally were not found in deeper    parts of the ground-water system.    The Potomac study also showed that land use is an important factor in water    quality. The highest concentrations of nutrients and pesticides in streams and    ground water in the Potomac River Basin were found in areas of intensive row    cropping underlain by carbonate rock. The study also showed that concentrations    of nutrients and pesticides in ground water and streams generally are less than    levels that would adversely affect human health or most ecosystems.    In addition the USGS is developing hydrologic and water-quality information    that is intended to assist U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) researchers    in the Landscape Ecology Branch in developing landscape indicators for pesticides    and nutrients in surface water. This project, which includes regionwide sampling    of streams, is being done in conjunction with NAWQA studies of regional ground-water-quality    patterns in the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain (from New Jersey to North Carolina).     Topographic Mapping    The USGS ensures the availability of map data in paper and electronic form    by fostering partnerships among State and Federal agencies to improve data collection    and resource sharing. The DNR, in cooperation with the USGS, is producing 571    1:12,000-scale color-infrared digital orthophoto quadrangles (DOQ). The DNR    will produce the DOQ's to be fully compliant with the current Federal Geographic    Data Committee meta-data standards. This will complete the DOQ-data coverage    in Maryland, which will be made available to the public through the USGS Earth    Resources Observation Systems Data Center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.    Mid-Atlantic Infrastructure Case Study    USGS scientists, in cooperation with the MGS, Virginia Division of Mineral    Resources, Resources for the Future, National Center for Resource Innovations,    and the National Stone Association, are analyzing how population growth and    development zoning regulations, and changes in land-management practices have    influenced and controlled the availability of sand, gravel, and crushed stone    (aggregate) and aggregate production in the Washington-Baltimore urban corridor    during the past 20 years. Projecting these trends into the future is intended    to aid planners with resource allocation. Estimates of the end uses for aggregates    suggest that about 78 percent of aggregates produced in the region is used to    maintain, improve, and modify existing buildings and roads, and 22 percent of    produced aggregate is for constructing new buildings and roads.    Regional growth during the last 10 years includes increased population, housing    units, and roads in the 17,000-square-mile region. In 1995, 76 million metric    tons of natural aggregates, worth $480 million, were produced and consumed.    By 2010, the population of the region is projected to grow by 14 percent, and    demand for natural aggregates is projected to exceed 86 million metric tons    per year. The projections suggest that vast quantities of crushed stone and    sand and gravel will be needed. Most of this aggregate will have to come from    resources yet to be delineated or defined.    Coastal Plain Drinking-Water Studies    The Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 establish an emphasis on delineation    of source-water areas and require an inventory of the potential sources of contamination    for each public water supply. In response to this directive, the USGS is cooperating    with the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE), MGS, and Baltimore City    on several source-water assessment projects. The USGS, MGS, and MDE are conducting    ground-water-quality surveys of gross-alpha and radium content of water in water-supply    wells throughout the outcrop portions of the Magothy, Patapsco, and Patuxent    aquifers in the Atlantic Coastal Plain to determine the distribution and concentrations    of radium. In addition, these studies are correlating contributing factors,    such as low pH and high chloride content of ground water, to observed radium    concentrations greater than the EPA's Maximum Contaminant Levels for drinking    water.    Many water-supply wells in the Coastal Plain tap the shallow unconfined aquifer,    which makes them vulnerable to contamination from disease-causing organisms.    To determine the susceptibility of these water-supply wells to such pathogens,    the USGS and MDE are identifying and documenting the occurrence of organisms    such as viruses in the shallow unconfined aquifer on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.     Loch Raven Reservoir, created in 1881, supplies drinking water to the Baltimore    metropolitan area. The USGS, MGS, Baltimore City, and MDE are creating a bathymetric    map of the reservoir from field data and developing maps of sediment deposition    since 1914, to record the change in storage capacity and sediment accumulation    over time.

This Maryland 8-digit watershed ranked in the highest State priority for protection and restoration. The WRAS project area encompasses the Carroll County portion of the watershed covering 87,040 acres including about 2,137 acres of open water. The remaining 17,762 acres of the watershed are in Baltimore County, Maryland. As part of WRAS project, the Maryland Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) is providing technical assistance. For example, DNR is working with the County to prepare a Watershed Characterization which is a collection of available water quality related information and identification of issues that may be used as the County generates its Watershed Restoration Action Strategy.  Water Quality Waters in the Liberty Reservoir watershed do not support all their designated uses which include public water supply, natural trout waters, recreational trout waters, water contact recreation and protection of aquatic life. The most wide-spread causes of these problems are excessive nutrients and suspended sediment. Other causes that occur in more limited areas are methylmercury in some fish species taken from the reservoir, fecal coliform bacteria in waterways near Finksburg and chromium and lead associated with naturally occurred mineral deposits of the Soldiers Delight area. Baltimore City reported several significant water quality trends. Increasing concentrations of chloride in Liberty Reservoir were identified beginning 1992. Analysis suggests a relationship between increasing chloride and increasing miles of roadway and area of commercial land where salt is used to limit seasonal icy conditions. Dry weather total phosphorus concentrations are decreasing in some Liberty Reservoir subwatersheds. Using total phosphorus as one indicator of reservoir impairment, Liberty reservoir is the least impaired of the three Baltimore City reservoirs. Nitrate-nitrogen concentrations in Liberty Reservoir steadily increased from the 1980's through the mid-1990's, but appear to be leveling off since the mid-1990's.  Land Use / Land Cover Carroll County's portion of the Liberty Reservoir watershed (the WRAS area) covers 83% of the entire watershed and the remaining 17% is in Baltimore County. Agriculture is the dominant land use (44.47%) in Carroll County and it is distributed across the WRAS area. Agricultural land is less pervasive in Baltimore County (33.01%). Nearly all agricultural easements and districts in the Liberty Reservoir watershed are almost entirely in Carroll County. Easements encompass 2,347 acres which is 5.4% of agricultural land. Another 4,186 acres are in agricultural districts which is an additional 9.7%. The largest concentrations of these protective zones are in the northern end of the viii Sept. 2002   watershed. In the Carroll County portion of the Liberty Reservoir watershed, 1,277 agricultural best management practices have been implemented since 1980. Forest accounts for 28.24% of Carroll County's WRAS area with large forest blocks concentrated around the Liberty Reservoir and along its Morgan Run tributary. Baltimore County's portion of the watershed 49.08% forested also with large forest blocks in the vicinity of the reservoir. In the Liberty Reservoir Watershed, natural resource lands identified as Green Infrastructure and/or forest interior are concentrated around the reservoir and along Morgan Run under ownership by Baltimore City and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. Developed land in Carroll County is mostly interspersed among the other land uses covering 27.23% of the WRAS area with concentrations near the communities of Westminster and Elderburg. A total of 167 stormwater management facilities serve about 6,280 acres of residential land in the Carroll County WRAS project area. About 17.74% of Baltimore County's portion of the Liberty Reservoir watershed is developed.  Living Resources and Habitat One report of long term benthic macroinvertebrate monitoring (benthos or stream bugs) on the North Branch of the Potomac River upstream of the Liberty Reservoir found increasing diversity between 1978 and 1990. This reflected a limited improvement in water quality. Assessments of benthos, fish and physical habitat were conducted by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey in the 1990s and 2000. Most sites were rated as good or fair for all three indices. The few sites that were ranked as poor or very poor appeared in limited areas of the watershed with several associated with developed areas. Native brook trout populations were found in several waterways: small streams around the Reservoir, the North Branch / East Branch of the Patapsco River, Morgan Run and Beaver Run. However, not all of these water bodies are designated as natural trout waters which would provide regulatory protection for this use. Several areas of sensitive species are identified in the Liberty Reservoir watershed. They area concentrated at the north end of the watershed near the towns of Hampstead and Manchester and in the southeast corner of the watershed near Soldiers Delight.  Restoration Targeting Tools A stream corridor assessments of Middle Run and Snowdens Run were completed in 2002. Another assessment for Western Run is projected for the end of the year. These efforts conducted by County and DNR personnel identified the status of stream buffers, stream bank erosion, etc. as a foundation for targeting and prioritizing restoration projects. In 2002, DNR personnel also conducted water quality and biological assessments at selected road crossings of waterways in the watershed. Findings from this work will help identify relative nutrient loads at the subwatershed scale. Computerized mapping was used to demonstrate opportunities for targeting protection and restoration projects including restoration of stream buffers, riparian forest and wetlands. ix Sept. 2002   CONTRIBUTORS TO THE WATERSHED CHARACTERIZATION Carroll County Jeanne Joiner, Acting Director, Dept. of Planning and Development Thomas Devilbiss, Water Resources Planning Division Steven Nelson, Water Resources Planning Division Brenda Morgan, Water Resources Planning Division Michael Roberts, Water Resources Planning Division Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service Katharine Dowell, Danielle Lucid, Catherine Rappe, Ted Weber, John Wolf Resource Assessment Service (RAS) Ron Klauda, Martin Hurd, Paul Kazyak, Jay Kilian, Chris Millard, Anthony Prochaska, Scott Stranko Wildlife & Heritage Division Lynn Davidson Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) - Denice Clearwater, Robert Daniel, Patrick Dinicola Maryland Department of Planning (MDP) - Deborah Weller  Maryland Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) Others  Editor and Primary Author Ken Shanks, Watershed Management and Analysis Division Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service Department of the Natural Resources  x  Sept. 2002   INTRODUCTION Purpose of the Characterization The watershed characterization is the initial step of a three-step process to develop a watershed management plan for a portion of the Liberty Reservoir watershed (the watershed). An assessment of the information gathered combined with in-the-field stream monitoring during 2002 is the next step in the process. The assessment will identify, evaluate, and prioritize concerns/threats to water quality of Liberty Reservoir and the condition of its watershed. Based on this assessment, the third step in this process is to develop action strategies to target opportunities to improve water quality by restoration. This process will be completed by the end of 2002. The characterization of Liberty Reservoir's watershed meets three objectives: 1. Summarize relevant information related to the watershed. 2. Describe the condition of the watershed from different perspectives (e.g., water quality, water supply, living resources, land use) 3. Identify sources for more information or analysis.  Watershed Selection Carroll County, the City of Baltimore, and the state of Maryland all consider the Liberty Reservoir Watershed a high priority watershed in need of protection primarily because of its use as a drinking water supply for the City of Baltimore and surrounding counties. Map 1 WRAS Project Area shows the location of the watershed. Carroll County is required to prioritize watersheds and identify areas of restoration due to its National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit. The county's Water Resource Planning Division assigned the highest priority to existing and near future surface drinking water supply reservoir watersheds including Liberty and Piney Run. Existing reservoirs not used by Carroll County citizens and planned reservoirs within Carroll received a lower priority. Other water supply uses such as groundwater received the next lowest priority. Finally, watersheds received the lowest priority that did not serve or planned to serve as water supplies. In 1998, Maryland's Clean Water Action Plan, using a three-step process similar to the process mentioned above, identified watersheds across the state in need of protection and restoration. First, a Unified Watershed Assessment characterized the condition of Maryland's larger watersheds and, based on this condition, classified each into the following categories: Category 1 Category 2 Category 3 Watersheds not meeting clean water and other natural resource goals and therefore needing restoration Watersheds currently meeting goals that need preventive action to sustain water quality and aquatic resources Pristine or sensitive watersheds that need an extra level of protection 1 Sept. 2002   As a result, Liberty Reservoir's watershed was classified as both a category 1 and 3 watershed; consequently, it is viewed in need of both restoration and an extra level of protection. Second, watershed restoration priorities were assigned to each watershed. The Liberty Reservoir watershed received the highest priority for restoration and protection. Only 17 of the 138 larger watersheds (coded with 8-digits) in Maryland were ranked high priority for both restoration and protection. The last step in the Clean Water Action Plan is to develop action strategies that identify ""the most important causes of water pollution and resources degradation, detail the actions that all parties need to take to solve those problems, and set milestones by which to measure progress.""2 Again, this characterization is the first step to develop these action strategies for the watershed. As the basis for the prioritization, indicators of water quality, landscape and living resources were developed for all watersheds in Maryland. These indicators are described in greater detail in separate sections in this watershed characterization. As part of the State's commitment, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) will providefunding and technical assistance to Counties willing to work cooperatively to devise and implement a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) for the impaired water bodies.1,2 Carroll County is one of five Counties participating in the second round of the WRAS grant program. Due to time and staffing constraints, Carroll County's Water Resource Planning Division (WRPD) selected three subwatersheds within the Liberty Reservoir watershed in Carroll County for creation of an action strategy. Together these subwatersheds comprise about ??% of the total area draining to Liberty Reservoir. Location Liberty Reservoir Watershed 2000 Acreage Summary  The Liberty Reservoir County Land Water Total watershed is located within the Pataspco River basin in the Piedmont Carroll 84,903 2,137 87,040 Region of Maryland. This area is the Baltimore 16,549 1,213 17,762 focus of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy and this Watershed Watershed Total 101,452 3,350 104,802 Characterization. Map 1 WRAS Project Area shows the geographic location of the WRAS watershed in Maryland. As shown in Map 2 Streams and Sub-watersheds, DNR has divided the Liberty Reservoir watershed into 17 subwatersheds that can be used for tracking information within the watershed. Map 3 also shows the three subwatersheds selected for development of a WRAS: Middle Run (#1056), Snowdens Run, and the West Branch of the Patapsco River (#1051). A discussion of the rationale behind selecting these three subwatersheds follows in the water quality section of this report. About 83% of the Liberty Reservoir watershed is in Carroll County, Maryland and the remaining 17% of the watershed is in Baltimore County, Maryland.  2  Sept. 2002   Additional Characterization Components The Watershed Characterization is intended to be a starting point. It is part of a framework for a more thorough assessment involving an array of additional inputs: 1. Stream Corridor Assessments will be conducted in the three subwatersheds only. They consist of physically walking the streams and cataloguing important stressors to the stream system such as channel erosion pipe outfalls, or presence of a stream buffer . This effort is part of the technical assistance coordinated by DNR and conducted by the Maryland Conservation Corps. 2. Synoptic water quality surveys will be conducted also in the three subwatersheds. Staff from DNR will collect biological (both aquatic insect and fish data) and chemical water quality data. 3. With the help of the WRAS partner agencies, targettechnical assistance. 4. Collect input from local stakeholders. These additional components will be used in conjunction with the information provided here to further clarify and identify issues of concern and types of restoration. Identifying Gaps in Information It is important to identify gaps in available watershed knowledge and gauge the importance of these gaps. One method is to review available information in the context of four physical / biological assessment categories that have been successfully applied in other watershed restoration efforts. These are the four main categories that impact water supply protection and aquatic biota: 1. Water Quantity: storm flows and flooding events; baseflows reductions from dams, water withdrawals, and reduced infiltration 2. Water Quality: nutrient loadings, toxics, sediment, nuisance odors, algal scums 3. Habitat: physical structure, stream stability and biotic community (including the riparian zone) 4. Cumulative effects associated with habitat, water quantity and water quality.  Adaptive Management In addition, the Watershed Characterization and the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy should be maintained as living documents within an active evolving restoration process. These documents will have to be updated periodically as new, more relevant information becomes available and as the watershed response is monitored and reassessed. This type of approach to watershed restoration and protection is often referred to as ""adaptive management.""  3  Sept. 2002   WATER QUALITY Water quality is in many respects the driving condition in the health of Maryland's streams. Historically, the emphasis has been on water chemistry such as nutrient, metals, temperature and pH. More recently, interest has focused on the biological conditions in streams and estuaries (e.g, condition of the aquatic insect and fish communities), while consideration of the physical parameters is even more recent. This developmental path reflects the ways streams have been monitored, the types of data gathered, and the regulatory approach taken.  Designated Uses All waters of the State are assigned a ""Designated Use"" in regulation, COMAR 26.08.02.08, which is associated with a set of water quality criteria necessary to support that use. A simplified summary of the Designated Uses in the Liberty Reservoir watershed is listed below. Map 3 Designated Uses depicts the distribution of streams in each use category. (Consult COMAR or MDE for official regulatory information.) 3,5 - Use I-P Water Contact Recreation, Protection of Aquatic Life, and Public Water Supply: All surface waters upstream of Liberty Dam that are not designated III-P or IV-P. - Use III-P Natural Trout Waters And Public Water Supply: Norris Run, Cooks Branch, Keysers Run, Beaver Run, East Branch of the Patapsco River, Locust Run, Morgan Run, Snowdens Run and all their tributaries. - Use IV-P Recreational Trout Waters And Public Water Supply: The mainstem of the North and West Branches of the Patapsco River above Liberty Reservoir and Cranberry Branch and all tributaries above MD Route 852 (Old Manchester Road)  4  Sept. 2002   Not Supporting Designated Use  303(d) Listings A statewide assessment of water quality is required under Section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act. As part of the assessment, Maryland tracks waterways that do not support their designated use in a list of ""impaired waters"" and in a prioritized list of ""Water Quality Limited Basin Segments"" also known as the 303(d) priority list. Information considered in setting the 303(d) list priorities includes, but is not limited to, severity of the problem, threat to human health and high value resources, extent of understanding of problem causes and remedies.5 These listings mean that pollution associated with the impairment listed are preventing full use of these water bodies based on State criteria. More complete information on the 303(d) list is available on MDE's Internet site www.mde.state.md.us/tmdl/ . Also see What Causes Water Quality Impairment? 1. 1996 List The current 303(d) list that was first adopted in 1996 and amended in 1998. The list included two listing for Liberty Reservoir as summarized in the table below. Each impairment identified in the 303(d) List is assigned a priority which is intended to help communicate the need for correcting the impairment relative to all impairments listed Statewide. Waterways with impairments having the greatest potential impacts to human health, high value resources, etc. are ranked numerically 1 through 25. All other impairments that are not ranked in the top 25 are ranked high, medium or low. In the table below, chromium and lead were given a high priority because of their potential to affect human health through the public water supply. However, these heavy metals are not currently viewed as an imminent risk to users of water from the Liberty Reservoir. 1996 303(d) List of Impaired Waters Including 1998 Additions Liberty Reservoir Watershed Summary 4 Name Stream or Watershed Liberty Reservoir Liberty Reservoir Impairment Chromium, Lead Nutrients, Suspended Sediment, Chromium, Lead Sources Nonpoint and natural Nonpoint and natural Priority 19 low  5  Sept. 2002   2. Draft 2002 List Some Liberty Reservoir watershed water bodies are identified as ""impaired waters"" by listings in the Draft Maryland's 2002 303(d) List summarized in the table below. Satisfactory completion of a public comment period and approval by US EPA is required before the list can be finalized later in 2002. Each water body listed in the table may require preparation of a TMDL to address the impairment.4 Draft 2002 303(d) List of Impaired Waters Liberty Reservoir Watershed Summary 4 Name Stream or Watershed N.

Biological. Within selected stream segments, populations of benthic macroinvertebrates and fish and their associated physical habitat have been assessed by the Maryland Biological Stream Program. Based on criteria developed for each physiographic/ecological zone in Maryland, each stream segment is rated as either good, fair, poor or very poor. Ratings of poor and very poor were listed as biological impairment for the first time in Maryland in the draft 2002 303(d) list of impaired waters. Nutrients . In Maryland, most water bodies naturally have low levels of the nutrients nitrogen or phosphorus. These nutrients enter waterways from all types of land and from the atmosphere. Nutrient pollution or over-enrichment problems may arise from numerous sources. For example, residential land can be an important contributor of nutrients depending on fertilizer use, extent of lawn and the status of septic systems. Many farmers carefully manage nutrients using different approaches, so nutrients entering waterways from crop land varies greatly depending on management techniques. Typically, smaller amounts of nutrients reach surface waters from an acre of forest land than from an acre of other types of land. The atmosphere can contribute various forms of nitrogen arising from the burning of fossil fuels in power plants and from automobile exhaust. Suspended Sediment . Most unpolluted streams and tidal waters naturally have limited amounts of sediment moving ""suspended"" in the water. Excessive amounts of suspended sediment in waterways are considered pollution because they can inhibit light penetration, prevent plant growth, smother fish eggs, clog fish gills, etc. Sediment in streams tends to arise from stream bed and bank erosion and from land that is poorly vegetated or disturbed. Suspended sediment pollution results fro exposed soil, construction sites and crop land. The amount of sediment contributed varies greatly site to site depending upon stream stability, hydrology, management controls and other factors. Toxic Substances. A wide array of materials may be considered toxic substances because they exhibit poisonous or lethal effects or otherwise harm aquatic life. These materials are very diverse in their sources and effects. Sometimes toxic substances can occur naturally. However, toxic substances of concern for water quality restoration are those types that are the product of human activity. For regulatory purposes, the US Environmental Protection Agency maintains a list of substances that are considered to be toxic. Examples include heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), asbestos and many other materials.  7  Sept. 2002   Total Maximum Daily Loads The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) uses the 303(d) priority list to help set State work schedules for various programs including establishment of Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). The intent of establishing one or more TMDLs for a water body is to estimate a pollutant load that the water body can assimilate and still meet water quality standards. Then a waste load allocation is generated to identify appropriate pollution reduction needs among current pollutant sources. For additional information, see MDE Internet site http://www.mde.state.md.us/tmdl . MDE projects that the draft Liberty Reservoir TMDL for mercury in fish tissue will be available for public review in Autumn 2002 and that EPA approval of the final TMDL will be sought before the end 2002.5 Scheduling for other TMDL work for the Liberty Reservoir watershed area is uncertain based on current work load projections.  Tributary Team Characterization A Cheseapeake Bay Program Tributary Monitoring Station on the North Branch of the Patapsco River at Maryland Route 91 shown on Map 4 City of Baltimore Water Quality Monitoring Stations is a source of long term water quality data for the nontidal streams in the Liberty Reservoir watershed. While caution must be used when drawing conclusions based on findings from a single station, DNR Resource Assessment Service has analyzed this data. A summary of their findings appears in the table below. The status for each parameter in the table is a relative ranking at three levels: good, fair and poor. For example, the ranking of ""good"" means that this area of the Patapsco River ranking is good compared to comparable Chesapeake Bay nontidal tributaries. As part of DNR's work of the Patapsco/Back Rivers Tributary Team, this relative water quality assessment for the North Branch of the Patapsco River is presented in DNR's Internet site http://www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/tribstrat/locator.html . 1 North Branch Patapsco River at Maryland Route 91 Parameter Nitrogen: total Phosphorus: total Suspended Solids: total Status 1998 -2000 data Poor Good Good Trend 1985 through 2000 Degrading (20%) Improving No Trend  8  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Indicators The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan published in 1998 listed the water quality indicators for the Liberty Reservoir watershed described here.2 1. State 303(d) Impairment Number The Liberty Reservoir Watershed appeared on the 303(d) for three impairments when the Unified Water Quality Assessment was completed. For this indicator, presence on the 303(d) list means that the watershed needs restoration. 2. Total Phosphorus Nontidal Index In comparison to the other watersheds that drain to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, the Liberty Reservoir watershed was among those with a lower total phosphorus (TP) concentration based on data from one, long-term ""core"" nontidal stream monitoring station in the watershed. Watersheds in Maryland that had this data available were ranked on a 1(worst) to 10(best) scale to allow comparison of total phosphorus among them using the Tributary Team reporting methods for status/trends. The Liberty Reservoir watershed was ranked ""10"" for TP. To create a benchmark for this indicator, the TP scores for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Liberty Reservoir watershed did not exceed this benchmark. 3. Total Nitrogen Nontidal Index In comparison to the other watersheds that drain to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, the Liberty Reservoir watershed was among those with a high or excessive total nitrogen (TN) concentration based on data from one ""core"" nontidal stream monitoring station in the watershed. Watersheds in Maryland that had this data available were ranked on a 1(worst) to 10(best) scale to allow comparison of total nitrogen among them using the Tributary Team reporting methods for status/trends. The Liberty Reservoir watershed was ranked ""2"" for TN. To create a benchmark for this indicator, the TN scores for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Liberty Reservoir watershed exceeded this benchmark because it was in the lowest quartile.  9  Sept. 2002   Water Quality Assessment The City of Baltimore, Department of Public Works, Water Quality Section has the best available water chemistry data for the watershed. These monitoring stations are located at a down-stream point of six major subwatersheds near the reservoir pool. The subwatersheds sampled include Beaver Run, Bonds Run, Little Morgan Run, Middle Run, Morgan Run, and the North Branch of the Patapsco River. This data set includes wet and dry weather nutrient concentrations from all six of the subwatersheds listed. In addition, flow data are collected for three of the six subwatersheds (Beaver Run, Morgan Run, and the North Branch of the Patapsco River) making pollutant load estimates possible. Refer to Map 4 City of Baltimore Water Quality Monitoring Stations for the location of each of Baltimore City's water chemistry monitoring stations. Additional water quality-related data is available via the Internet. Two recommended Web sites are www.dnr.state.md.us/irc/datasets.html , www.chesapeakebay.net/wquality.htm . 1. Subwatersheds Selected for Evaluation Assessment of the entire Liberty Reservoir watershed was not possible due to limited water quality data and time and staff constraints. To make the best use of available resources, Carroll County Water Resources Planning Division (WRPD) selected three subwatersheds for evaluation: Middle Run, Snowdens Run, and the North Branch of the Patapso River. These subwatersheds were selected primarily based upon evaluation of the City of Baltimore's water quality data. Carroll County's WRPD used the City's nutrient concentration data from 1983 to 1999 to rank the subwatersheds using the total phosphorus and total suspended solids test results. This evaluation identified Middle Run and Bonds Run as the greatest contributors when divided by their contributing drainage areas. These watersheds were also selected because of their geographic distribution throughout the watershed and their level of development. For instance, Snowdens Run, the smallest of the three subwatersheds and located in the Eldersburg area, was added because it is the most densely developed subwatershed in the watershed within Carroll County. The North Branch of the Patapsco River subwatershed, the largest of the three subwatersheds, was added because it is the least densely developed subwatershed in the watershed within Carroll County. 2. Chloride Results from City's most recent interim report completed in 2000 indicate several trends worth mentioning here. First, the most alarming water quality trend reported was a significant increase in chloride levels in Liberty Reservoir measured since 1992.14 An increasing trend was also observed in conductivity readings; conductivity values serve as a suitable substitute when chloride values are absent.14 Several relationships were explored to determine the most likely causes of this increasing trend. The strongest relationship occurred between increasing chloride values and the amount of commercial and industrial land use. Greater chloride results were observed with increasing amounts of commercial and industrial land uses. Typically, these land uses have very high percentages of paving known as impervious surfaces for parking and buildings. Another strong relationship was established between increasing chloride levels and increasing road density. A third trend observed 10 Sept. 2002   was the decreasing chloride levels with an increasing amount of agriculture land. This inverse relationship is expected given the lower amount of impervious surfaces typical of agriculture land use. One likely explanation for this trend is de-icing agents (i.e., road salts) used on roads and parking lots, which wash off of these surfaces during rain events into the adjacent stream system and are ultimately delivered to Liberty Reservoir.14 3. Total Phosphorus Dry weather total phosphorus concentrations are decreasing at several locations throughout all three of the City's reservoirs (Liberty, Loch Raven, and Pretty Boy), although this downward trend in total phosphorus levels was not apparent for the Middle Run watershed.14 Using total phosphorus as one indicator of reservoir impairment, Liberty reservoir is the least impaired of the three reservoirs.14 4. Nitrate-Nitrogen Nitrate-nitrogen concentrations in Liberty steadily increased from the 1980's through the mid-1990's, but appear to be leveling off since the mid-1990's.14  11  Sept. 2002   Point Sources Discharges from pipes or any discrete conveyances are called ""point sources."" Point sources may contribute pollution to surface water or to groundwater. For example, wastewater treatment discharges may contribute nutrients or microbes that consume oxygen (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand) reducingoxygen available for aquatic life. Industrial point sources may contribute various forms of pollution. Some understanding of point source discharges in a watershed targeted for restoration is useful in helping to prioritize potential restoration projects. According to the 2000 Action Report for the Reservoir Watersheds, total phosphorus and nitrogen loads from wastewater treatment plants in the watershed declined substantially in the early 1980's and have leveled off since the 1990's.14 ""Downward trends in effluent phosphorus from wastewater treatment plants are important, not only because they have been reduced, but because most of the phosphorus from these point sources is in a dissolved form that contributes disproportionately to the eutrophication (nutrient enrichment process) of the reservoirs than particulate phosphorus. While phosphorus reductions from treatment plants are important, they should be considered in the context of of total phosphorus loads, both point and nonpoint, flowing into the reservoirs. For instance in the Loch Raven Reservoir, the watste water treatplant portion of the total phosphours load estimates were only 3% of the total load during a wet year and were 9% during a dry year."" 14 There are 31 permitted surface water discharges and 11 permitted groundwater discharges in Carroll County's portion of the Liberty Reservoir watershed according to the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) permit database as summarized in the following table. In Baltimore County, there are three permitted discharges. Map 5 MDE Permits shows the location of these facilities. Information on each permits is briefly summarized in four tables: 1. 2. 3. 4.

Four of the most common pollutants typically associated with non-point sources are listed below. 1. Nutrients Excessive nutrient loads (phosphorus and nitrogen) is a water quality concern. Most of the nutrient load appears to be coming from nonpoint sources because point sources of nitrogen in the watershed are small. The decreasing trends in total phosphorus concentrations both in the tributary streams of the watershed and within the reservoir itself detected by the City of Baltimoresuggest the effectiveness of the extensive adoption of no-till and conservation tillage agricultural practices in Carroll County. 2. Sediments Liberty Reservoir is listed as an impaired for sediment [s3]in the draft 2002 303(d) list. In addition, the 2000 305(b) report notes that monitoring by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) indicated sediment related problems including siltation of the stream bead and stream bank instability affecting physical stream habitat for streams within the watershed. 3. Heavy Metals Chromium and Lead Listings for chromium and lead in the 303(d) list relates generally to the remnants of former chromium mining in the Soldiers Delight area of Baltimore County near Liberty Reservoir.  17  Sept. 2002   Water Supply It is widely accepted that effective watershed management that reduces nutrient and sediment inputs to the receiving streams that feed to a surface water supply reservoir greatly improves the water quality within the reservoir. Numerous watershed implementation measures or best management practices are available to limit the water quality impacts of land use activities. Nutrient and sediment reductions, for instance, can lead to reduced treatment costs at the water treatment plant and ultimately reduced water bills for the users. Recently the City of Baltimore hired a consultant to complete a source water assessment. 1. Source Water Assessment for the City of Westminster Water Supply The surface water portion of the water supply system for the City of Westminster is located within the Cranberry Branch Watershed. Stream flows from this small watershed drain to the West Branch of the Patapsco and eventually into Liberty Reservoir. Beginning in 2000, MDE conducted a source water assessment for the City of Westminster's water supply system. Because of historical water quality problems (e.g., elevated turbidity levels and odors) encountered at the treatment plant, a cooperative arrangement was initiated between City, county and state officials to identify potential sources of sediment and odors within the Cranberry Branch Watershed. Part of the source water assessment involved collecting water chemistry samples and conducting a stream corridor assessment for the Cranberry Watershed. Most of the problems identified were either erosion sites along the stream banks or inadequate forested buffer to the stream within this watershed.15 The estimated stream length effected by these impairments was 1.4 miles or about 35% of the total stream length. The large number of problems identified may account for the elevated total suspended solids and turbidity levels at the treatment plant.15 Considering the distribution of livestock populations throughout the Cranberry Watershed combined with the lack of stream buffers, the pollution sources in the watershed is typical of non-point sources.15 Refer to this document for more information.  18  Sept. 2002   2. Surface Water Permits There are three permit holders that use surface waters for public water supply in the Liberty Reservoir watershed as summarized in the table below. Baltimore City and the Freedom District in Carroll County both draw water from Liberty Reservoir. The City of Westminster obtains water from both stream and reservoir surface water sources and dispersed groundwater sources. Baltimore City owns Liberty Reservoir. The Reservoir is one of three large reservoirs in Baltimore City's water supply system that collectively serves over 1.4 million people in the City and several surrounding Counties. Management, monitoring and protection of this reservoir are a cooperative effort under the 1984 Reservoir Watershed Management Agreement and its subsequent updates and work plans.

Groundwater Permits Surface water and groundwater in the Liberty Reservoir watershed is the source of all water used for agriculture and business and all potable water. In general, these water uses do not employ near-surface groundwater, which is subject to potential local pollution sources. Additionally, near surface groundwater is credited with carrying nutrients, particularly nitrogen, from land source to surface waters where nutrient over-enrichment is occurring. All public water supply systems in the Liberty Reservoir watershed are listed in the table below and are shown on Map 6 Water Supply.

Land condition also largely influences the kinds and quality of habitat on the land and in nearby aquatic environments. In recent years, improved understanding of the relationships between land use, water quality and habitat has suggested new ways protect and restore important natural resources. Within the WRAS project area, assessment of local land use, land cover and related land conditions can help provide a basis for prioritizing watershed management objectives and potential watershed projects.  Piedmont Geology The Liberty Reservoir watershed is entirely in the Piedmont Province in Maryland. The watershed is characterized by rolling terrain varying from gentle slopes to some areas of steep slopes over 15% grade. The geology that characterizes the bedrock that underlies the watershed is generally the Wissahickon Formation as shown in Map 7 Geology. The formation accounts for about 83% of the subsurface condition in the Liberty Reservoir watershed and is the most important geological condition in Carroll County's portion of the watershed. Close to Liberty Reservoir, Lower Pelitic Schist has a significant presence (nearly 7% of the watershed). Two other geological formations, Ultramafic Rocks and Boulder Gneiss (each around 2% of the watershed) are locally important. In the headwaters area of the Liberty Reservoir watershed, several other geologies are locally significant. Sams Creek Metabasalt accounts for nearly 4% of the watershed. Both Marburg Schist and Wakefield Marble account for less than half of one percent of the total watershed geology.  21  Sept. 2002   Soils  Watershed Soil Summary  Liberty Reservoir Watershed 1. Natural Soil Groups Water (2.34%) Soil conditions, like soil Stoney Soils (3.55%) type and moisture conditions, Wet Soil (2.32%) greatly affect how land may be Prime Ag (28.17%) used and the potential for Shallow Soils (27.52%) vegetation and habitat on the land. Soil conditions are one determining factor for water quality in streams and rivers. Well Drained, >8% slope (36.09%) Local soil conditions vary greatly from site to site as published information in the Soil Surveys for Carroll County and Baltimore County show. This complicated information can be effectively categorized using Natural Soil Groups as summarized in the pie chart above to help identify useful generalizations about groups of soils. Considering the distribution of soil groups in Map 8 Soils and the pie chart statistics above, several generalizations about the Liberty Reservoir watershed can be seen. Over one quarter of the watershed is prime agricultural land which tend to be widely dispersed across the watershed. Well drained soils over 8% slope cover slightly more than 1/3 of the watershed. Soils with less than 40 inches to bedrock are about 27% of the watershed. Wet soils tend to be limited to stream and headwater areas. Stoney soils are a small percentage of the watershed but they are scattered in the watershed. All the open water shown in the map are constructed impoundments that relatively recently submerged natural upland soils. 2. Soils and Watershed Planning Local soil conditions can be a useful element in watershed planning and for targeting restoration projects. For example, soils with limitations related to wetness, slope, shallow depth or stoniness naturally inhibit active use for farming or development. By identifying these areas in Map 8 Soils with several following maps Map 12 Generalized 2000 Land Use / Land Cover; Map 13 Green Infrastructure; and Map 14 Forest Interior, it may be possible to identify general areas were marginal lands could be converted to natural vegetation or other low intensity uses. Once areas of interest are targeted and land owner interest is verified, additional detailed soil assessment is an essential step in identifying viable restoration project sites.  22  Sept. 2002   Landscape Indicators In an effort to gauge the affects of land use on water quality, and to allow comparison between watersheds, DNR has developed a series of landscape indicators. These indicators can be used to portray landscape conditions on a watershed scale that tend to either support good water quality or degrade water quality. Landscape conditions in the Liberty Reservoir watershed can be compared to similar watersheds using indicators published in the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan.2 Based on these measurements, conditions in the Liberty Reservoir watershed compare well with similar watershed based on impervious surface, population density, historical wetland loss and unbuffered streams, however, soil erodibility is a potential water quality problem compared to similar watersheds in Maryland's Piedmont region.  1. Impervious Surface On average across the entire Liberty Reservoir watershed, 6.3% of surface cover is impervious. This average imperviousness compares well with similar watersheds in Maryland.2 Roads, parking areas, and roof tops are collectively called impervious surfaces. Impervious surfaces prevents the natural seepage of rain through the soil and eventually into the groundwater. Watersheds with small amounts of impervious surfaces usually are associated with better water quality in streams than watersheds with greater amounts of impervious surfaces. Unlike natural surfaces, impervious surfaces concentrate stormwater runoff delivering storm flows more quickly to the nearest stream. There are many, well-documented, harmful effects of impervious surfaces on receiving stream systems. As the amount of impervious surfaces increases in a watershed, groundwater recharge decreases and stream flows become more exaggerated or ""flashy."" A reduction in stream flows occur between storm events and a significant increase occurs during storm events. This flow imbalance causes an excessive stream channel erosion and corresponding sediment deposition in the stream beds. This deposition results in loss of aquatic habitat. Maryland's Stormwater Management Law, enacted in 1984, attempts to counteract the harmful effects of impervious surfaces on receiving stream systems created when land within a watershed develops. Storm water runoff is collected in storm water management (SWM) facilities and either slowly releases storm water to the stream or infiltrates it through the bottom recharging the groundwater. Map 9 Stormwater shows the distribution of SWM facilities within the watershed. A total of 167 facilities have been constructed within the watershed. Collectively they manage about 6,280 acres of residential land before discharging stormwater to the receiving streams within the watershed. This map also shows a lack of SWM facilities where older residential subdivision exists (e.g., the Middle Run watershed). The Maryland Biological Stream Survey has related the percent of impervious surface in a watershed to the health of aquatic resources. For areas with less than 4% impervious cover, streams generally rate ""Fair"" to ""Good"" for both fish and instream invertebrates. Beyond about 12% impervious surface, streams generally rate ""Poor"" to ""Fair"" for both. Side-effects of impervious 23 Sept. 2002   surfaces become increasingly significant and negative as the percentage of impervious area increases. Examples of related problems include reduction of groundwater infiltration, increased soil and stream bank erosion, sedimentation, destabilization or loss of aquatic habitat, and ""flashy"" stream flows (reduced flow between storms and excessive flows associated with storms.) The impervious surface estimate used for this indicator was generated for the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action report. Each land use type in the 1994 Maryland State Planning land use data was assigned an estimated imperviousness taken from the TR-55 manual used by the former Soil Conservation Service. To create a benchmark for comparing impervious area among Maryland watersheds, the percent of impervious area for 8-digit watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Liberty Reservoir watershed did not exceed this benchmark. 2. Population Density The population density in the Liberty Reservoir watershed was 0.70 people per acre using pre-2000 Census data. This density compares well with similar Maryland watersheds.2 To create a benchmark for comparing population density among Maryland watersheds, the people per acre for 8-digit watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Liberty Reservoir watershed did not exceed this benchmark. While population density may be beyond the scope of a WRAS, directing growth is a potential WRAS component. As human population increases, effects of human activity that tend to degrade, displace or eliminate natural habitat also tends to increase. Watersheds with higher populations, assuming other factors are equal, tend to exhibit greater impacts on waterways and habitat. However, growth can be directed in ways to reduce negative impacts. 3. Historical Wetland Loss The historical loss of wetlands in the Liberty Reservoir watershed is estimated to be 3,987 acres which compares well with other similar Maryland watersheds.2 This interpretation is based on the assumption that the hydric soils were all, at one time, wetlands. Selective restoration of historic wetland areas can be an effective WRAS component. In most of Maryland's watersheds, extensive wetland areas have been converted to other uses by draining and filling. This conversion unavoidably reduces or eliminates the natural functions that wetlands provide. These functions include habitat and nursery areas for many aquatic organisms, flood attenuation, and uptake and redistribution of nutrients, etc. In general, watersheds exhibiting greater wetland loss tend to also exhibit greater loss of the beneficial functions that wetlands provide. Strategic replacement of wetlands can significantly improve natural function in local watershed areas. To create a benchmark for comparing impervious area among Maryland watersheds, the historic wetland loss acreage for 8-digit watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided 24 Sept. 2002   into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Liberty Reservoir watershed did not exceed the benchmark. 4. Unbuffered Streams Approximately 43% of the streams in the Liberty Reservoir watershed were not buffered with trees. This finding is similar to other Maryland watersheds but could be improved.2 DNR recommends a forested stream buffer of 100 feet wide, i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream, which is necessary to promote high quality, aquatic habitat and diverse aquatic populations. Stream buffer plantings are a valuable and relatively inexpensive method to improve stream conditions. In most of Maryland, trees are an important component to healthy, natural streams. They provide numerous essential habitat functions including: 1) filtration of surface and subsurface runoff, 2) flow attenuation, 3) shade to keep water temperatures down in summer and up in the winter, 4) leaf litter or ""food"" for aquatic organisms, 5) roots to stabilize stream banks, 6) vegetative cover for wildlife, etc. In general, reduction or loss of stream buffers degrades stream habitat while their replacement enhances stream habitat. For this indicator only ""blue line streams"" were included; intermittent streams were not considered. This estimate of streams lacking forested buffer was generated for the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan by using Maryland Department of State Planning GIS data for streams and for 1994 land use. To create a benchmark for comparing impervious area among Maryland watersheds, the percent of unbuffered streams for 8-digit watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds in the highest quartile (25% of the watersheds) ""exceeded"" the benchmark. The Liberty Reservoir watershed did not exceed the benchmark. 5. Soil Erodibility The average soil erodibilty of lands within 1000 feet of streams in the Liberty Reservoir watershed is 0.28 value/acre which suggests that control of soil erosion is particularly important here Watersheds with more highly erodible soils are naturally more susceptible to surface erosion, sedimentation, stream bank erosion and other problems related to soil movement. These negative effects of soil erodibility on water quality can be minimized through careful management. The soil erodibility indicator accounts for natural soil conditions but not for management of the land; existing crop land management was not considered. Soil loss from farm land is addressed by techniques grouped together called best management practices (BMPs). BMPs like no-till, reduced till, cover crops, field strips, and others significantly reduce erosion and sediment movement. This estimate of soil erodibility was generated through an analysis of GIS data that incorporated the soil erodibility factor (K), slope steepness, land area within 1000 feet of streams and cropland within that 1000 feet buffer based on 1994 Maryland Department of State Planning land use data. To compare Maryland watersheds for this index, the benchmark of 0.275 value/acre was 25 Sept. 2002   used, i.e. less than 0.275 was considered relatively beneficial for water quality and 0.275 or greater was considered to be a likely factor for water quality problems.  Agricultural BMPs Agricultural Best Management Practices (BMPs) are an effective watershed control measure and their use should be continued and expanded where possible. Since 1980, 1,277 BMPs have been implemented within Carroll County's portion of the Liberty Reservoir watershed. Map 10 Agricultural BMPs shows the distribution of these practices. This map also shows the distribution of agricultural districts, agricultural easements, and soil and water conservation plans throughout the watershed. The table below shows the number of soil and water conservation plans written for farms within the three subwatersheds that are receiving detailed evaluation for the WRAS.

Carroll County Data Summary The Carroll County Department of Planning recently completed its land use inventory for the entire county. Land use categories for the county's analysis are defined differently than the state's analysis; furthermore, those categories are defined in greater detail (i.e, developed land is split into different categories). Refer to Map 11 Detailed Land Use for Liberty WRAS Area for the distribution of land uses throughout the watershed. Some of the categories are self evident, but a few need clarification. For instance, the Mixed Use category means a mixture of both commercial and residential uses. The Public Use category means land open to the public not developed for residential use (e.g., schools, churches parks, gold courses, libraries). The Vacant category means unimproved land, which has the potential to be developed (e.g., abandoned buildings). The rest of the categories are defined as the Standard Land Use Categories within the Departments Community Comprehensive Plan Updates. From this map it is evident that a very small percentage of the watershed is currently used for commercial or industrial purposes. Note that this is not a zoning map, which shows the potential development for a planned area, but simply reflects the County's best estimate of existing land uses.  27  Sept. 2002   2. Maryland Data Summary Based on Maryland 2000 Land Use Department of Planning data for the Liberty Reservior Watershed Year 2000, land use in the Liberty Reservoir watershed was mostly agriculture and forest. As the pie chart Urban (25.69%) shows, it was just over 40% agriculture, nearly 33% forested and about 25% Agriculture (42.60%) developed. Wetlands (0.05%) Map 12 Generalized 2000 Other (0.02%) Land Use / Land Cover shows forest land in the watershed trends to occur Forest (31.64%) near the Reservoir and near streams. However, agricultural land and urban/developed land tends to be dispersed across the watershed. The table below summarizes land use statistics for the watershed. 2000 Land Use / Land Cover Liberty Reservoir Watershed Category Agriculture Forest Urban Wetlands Other Description Field, Pasture, Ag buildings All woodlands and brush All developed areas Emergent wetlands Extractive and bare ground (not graphed) Acres Carroll Co. 37,758 23,979 23,123 29 14 84,903 2,137 87,040 Balto.

It is important to keep this in Urban (17.77%) mind when comparing land use/land cover Agriculture (33.07%) in each County. To help show the difference in relative area, the pie chart for Carroll County on this page has roughly five times the area of the pie chart for Forest-Private (39.83%) Forest-Public (9.33%) Baltimore Co. In Carroll County's portion of the watershed, agriculture accounts for a little less than one half of Carroll County's portion of the watershed. Urban and forest land each covers slightly more than one quarter of Carroll County's total acreage. About 20% of Carroll County's forest land in the watershed (4,760 acres) is publicly owned by either Baltimore City in the reservoir property or by DNR in the Morgan Run Natural Environment Area. In Baltimore County's portion of the watershed, nearly half of the land is forested with about 19% (1,542 acres) in public ownershp by either Baltimore City in the reservoir property or by DNR in the Soldiers Delight Natural Environment Area. The remainder is about one third agriculture and slightly more than one sixth developed land.  2000 Land Use Carroll County Liberty Reservoir Watershed  Urban (27.25%)  Agriculture (44.49%)  Forest-Private (22.65%) Forest-Public (5.61%)  29  Sept. 2002   Green Infrastructure An additional way to interpret land use / land cover information is to identify ""Green Infrastructure."" In the GIS application developed by Maryland DNR and its partners, Green Infrastructure refers to areas of natural vegetation and habitat that have statewide or regional importance as defined by criteria developed by DNR. The criteria for identifying lands as Green Infrastructure is limited to considering natural resource attributes currently found on those lands. One example of the criteria is that interior forest and wetlands complexes must be at least 250 acres in size to be considered as part of Green Infrastructure. As a second example, sensitive species habitat that is located within areas of natural vegetation at least 100 acres in size is also counted as Green Infrastructure. Other potential attributes of Green Infrastructure lands, such as ownership or if the current natural conditions are protected in some way, are not criteria for Green Infrastructure but they may be considered independently. Within the Green Infrastructure network, large blocks of natural areas are called hubs, and the existing or potential connections between them, called links or corridors. Together the hubs and corridors form the Green Infrastructure network which can be considered the backbone of the region's natural environment.6 Protection of Green Infrastructure lands may be addressed through various existing programs including Rural Legacy, Program Open Space, conservation easements and others. The 2001 Maryland General Assembly approved $35 million for the Green Print program which is targeted primarily to protecting Green Infrastructure areas. This funding category is administered by Program Open Space. Map 13 Green Infrastructure shows several significant local characteristics of Green Infrastructure:  Green Infrastructure in the Liberty Reservoir watershed is concentrated near Liberty Reservoir. The largest hub surrounding the reservoir includes Baltimore City's land ownership.  Along Morgan Run and Joe Branch, the second Green Infrastructure hub connects to the Liberty Reservoir hub creating a relatively contiguous block of naturally vegetated land.  Snowdens Run subwatershed includes a portion of the Green Infrastructure hub near Liberty Reservoir and a potential corridor along the stream that would link two hub areas. The corridor, shown on Map 13, was identified using a computer assessment of existing land cover.  Most of the woodlands and wetland areas in the Liberty Reservoir watershed are less than 100 acres in size. Therefore, they are too small to meet the size criteria adopted as the minimum threshold for Green Infrastructure.  30  Sept. 2002   Large Forest Blocks / Forest Interior Within large blocks of forest, habitat is available for species that are specialized for conditions with relatively little influence by species from open areas or humans. For example, forest interior dwelling birds require forest interior habitat for their survival and they can not tolerate much human presence. Map 14 Forest Interior shows blocks of contiguous forest that are at least 50 acres in size with at least 10 acres of forest interior (forest edge is at least 300 feet away) that may be important locally within the Liberty Reservoir watershed. This size threshold was chosen to help ensure that the forest interior is large enough to likely provide locally significant habitat for sensitive forest interior dwelling species. The assessment shown in Map 14 differs from the Green Infrastructure assessment which considered only large blocks of forest land cover at least 250 acres in size that are likely to have state or regional importance. Forest interior covers about 16,000 acres (nearly 16%) of the land in the Liberty Reservoir watershed. Contributing to the total forest interior area is about 10,200 acres that are considered to be high quality habitat for forest interior dwelling birds (FIDS). The map shows that a high percentage of the forest interior in the watershed is owned by either Baltimore City around the reservoir or by DNR in the Morgan Run Natural Environment Area.  31  Sept. 2002   Protected Lands As used in the context of watershed restoration, ""protected land"" includes any land with some form of long term limitation on conversion to urban / developed land use. This protection may be in various forms: public ownership for natural resource or recreational intent, private ownership where a third party acquired the development rights or otherwise acquired the right to limit use through the purchase of an easement, etc. The extent of protection varies greatly from one circumstance to the next. Map 15 Protected Land and Smart Growth shows the location of protected lands in the Liberty Reservoir watershed and additional details are listed below. 1. Public Lands  Baltimore City owns about 6,290 acres around the Liberty Reservoir within the Liberty Reservoir watershed. Of this land, 4,780 acres in Carroll County. (Additionally, Baltimore City owns additional Liberty Reservoir land downstream of the dam, which is outside of the watershed.) This land is managed primarily to provide a naturally vegetated buffer surrounding the reservoir. The property also provided for low intensity recreation like hunting and fishing.  Carroll County has10 community parks in the watershed encompassing 244 acres. The largest of these parks is 40 acres.  Baltimore County has one park area in the watershed covering 26 acres.  DNR manages two areas in the watershed: the 1570-acre Morgan Run Natural Environment Area in Carroll County and a portion of the Soldiers Delight Area (1080 acres) in Baltimore County.  No Federal land is identified in the Liberty Reservoir watershed. 2. Private Lands  Conservation Easements on private land in Carroll County were not identified in DNR's database. In Baltimore County's portion of the watershed, the Maryland Environment Trust holds two perpetual easements covering nearly 180 acres.  Agricultural Easements cover nearly 2200 acres in the watershed (all in Carroll County).  Agricultural Districts encompass about 4010 acres that are not under agricultural easement in the watershed (nearly all in Carroll County).  Through the development review process, two private conservation easements are required where applicable (e.g., Forest Conservation Easements and Water Resource Protection Easements). Forest Conservation easements are required when forest disturbance exceeds about an acre. Reforestation is required on an acre for acre basis, and when the development site has little or no forest at the time of development. When land is subdivided, Water Resource Protection Easements are required for all land within 100 feet of any stream channel.  32  Sept. 2002   Smart Growth Within Maryland's Smart Growth program, there are two targeting programs that should be considered as potential watershed restoration projects are considered. In Priority Funding Areas, State funding for infrastructure may be available to support development and redevelopment. In Rural Legacy Areas, protection of land from future development through purchase of easements (or in fee simple) is promoted. Map 15 Protected Land and Smart Growth shows areas addressed by these programs in the Liberty Reservoir watershed and the summary below provides some details. - Priority Funding Areas (PFAs) in the Carroll County cover the four largest developed areas in the Liberty Reservoir watershed: Eldersburg, Hampstead, Manchester and Westminster. About ten other small communities are also PFAs in Carroll County. Collectively, the PFA areas in Carroll County's portion of the watershed totals about 13,490 acres which is about 15% of the County's total acreage in the watershed. - Priority Funding Area covering the Baltimore Metropolitan Area in Baltimore County extends into the Liberty Reservoir watershed in two small areas in the vicinity of Glyndon and Owings Mills. Collectively, the PFA areas in Baltimore County's portion of the watershed totals about 590 acres which is about 3% of the County's total acreage in the watershed. - Currently, there is no Rural Legacy project in the Liberty Reservoir watershed. Carroll County's Little Pipe Creek Rural Legacy Area is in the Monocacy River watershed immediately west of Liberty Reservoir Watershed and the Westminster Priority Funding Area. Baltimore County's Piney Run Rural Legacy Areas is immediately east of the Liberty Reservoir Watershed in another part of the Patapsco River watershed. - There have been two unsuccessful attempts to establish the Upper Patapsco Watershed Rural Legacy Area which would include part of the Liberty Reservoir watershed. This area is bounded on the east by Baltimore County (nearly adjacent to Baltimore County's Piney Run Rural Legacy Area), and surrounded by the Hampstead, Westminster, and Finksburg community planning areas. The 14,145 acre proposed Rural Legacy Area includes most of the watershed of the East Branch Patapsco River, part of the West Branch and comprises about 16% of the entire Liberty Reservoir watershed in Carroll County.  33  Sept. 2002   Wetlands 1.

They cover Reservoir watershed. Also see the Sensitive Species Section. more than 1500 acres in the watershed primarily because of Liberty Reservoir. Palustrine forested wetlands are the most abundant and widely distributed palustrine wetland in the watershed covering nearly 1500 acres. These wetlands are found on floodplains along the freshwater tidal and nontidal portions of rivers and streams and in upland depressions. Emergent palustrine wetlands are the second most common wetland in the watershed. The table includes National Wetlands Inventory data because the higher resolution DNR Wetlands Inventory data was not available for Baltimore County. However, the difference in data resolution is significant between these two sources. For Carroll County's portion of the Liberty Reservoir watershed, the DNR Inventory identifies nearly 4500 acres of wetlands while the National Inventory identifies less than 2800 acres. Comparing Map 16 Wetlands to Map 12 Generalized 2000 Land Use / Land Cover, it can be seen that many of the wetlands in the wetland map are depicted as forest on the land use map. This difference is simply the result of two differing views of the landscape. For example, wooded nontidal wetlands can be viewed as ""wetlands"" from a habitat / regulatory perspective and they can be viewed as ""forest"" from a land use perspective. In the Liberty Reservoir watershed, differing perspectives on counting wetlands are significant for watershed management. From a land use perspective, only ten acres of wetlands are identified by the Maryland Department of Planning. From a habitat / regulatory perspective, many more wetland 34 Sept. 2002   areas can be identified. In the Carroll County portion of the Liberty Reservoir wetlands, the National Wetlands Inventory identified about 2,760 acres of wetlands. For the same watershed area, the thorough DNR Wetlands Inventory identified at least 4,490 acres of nontidal wetlands 2. Tracking Wetlands Oversight of activities affecting wetlands involves several regulatory jurisdictions. The Maryland Dept. of the Environment (MDE) is the lead agency for the State and cooperates with DNR, the Army Corps of Engineers and other Federal and local agencies. As part of its responsibility, MDE tracks State permitting and the net gain or loss of wetlands over time. As the table Tracking Nontidal Wetland Change By Watershed on the next page shows, the State regulatory program has measured a small net increase of wetland acreage in the Liberty Reservoir watershed over the past 10 years.  Floodplains Floodplains and associated riparian areas are naturally important areas for habitat and hydrologic functioning of streams. Map 17 Floodplains shows that the most 100-year floodplain in the Liberty Reservoir watershed are adjacent to Liberty Reservoir and major streams tributary to the Reservoir. Using the information on the map, a comparison of general floodplain location and location of roads and land use in the watershed, it appears that more identified floodplains are on naturally vegetated land or agricultural land. However, some roads, numerous road crossings and some community areas may have risk of flood damage.  35  Sept. 2002   Tracking Nontidal Wetland Change By Watershed For The Patapsco River Basin In Acres 1/1/1991 through 12/31/2001 7 Watershed Liberty Reservoir South Br.

The information summarized here suggests that some of the significant stresses on living resources in the watershed are manipulation of habitat, excessive movement of sediment and excessive availability of nutrients. The Living Resource information summarized here should be considered a partial representation because numerous areas of potential interest or concern could not be included due to lack of information, time, etc. For example, information on many forms of aquatic life, woodland communities, terrestrial habitats, etc. should be considered as watershed restoration decisions are being made. Therefore, it is recommended that stakeholders in the watershed identify important living resource issues or priorities so that additional effort can be focused where it is most needed. New information should be added or referenced as it becomes available.  Living Resource Indicators Aquatic organisms are sensitive, in varying degrees, to changes in water quality and aquatic habitat. This association offers two perspectives that are important for watershed restoration. First, improvements for living resources offer potential goals, objectives and opportunities to gauge progress in watershed restoration. Second, the status of selected species can be used as to gauge local conditions for water quality, habitat, etc. This second perspective is the basis for using living resources as an ""indicator."" The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan published in 1998 listed the following living resource indicators for the Liberty Reservoir Watershed.2 Several of these indicators rely on index rankings generated from a limited number of sampling sites which were then generalized to represent entire watersheds. Considering this limitation on field data, it may be beneficial to conduct additional assessments to provide a more complete understanding of local conditions as part of the WRAS. 1. Benthic Index of Nontidal Biotic Integrity Streams in the Liberty Reservoir watershed are generally in fair/good condition on average based on assessment of benthic macroinvertebrate communities (stream bugs). For this index, Liberty Reservoir streams scored an average of 6.89 on a scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best). For this index, an average score for an 8-digit watershed less than 6.0 means that restoration is needed and a score of 8.0 or greater means that protection is recommended. To generate this index, each stream site that is assessed is compared to reference conditions that were established for comparable streams that are minimally impacted. Nontidal rivers (streams seventh order and larger) are not incorporated into this index. Also see Why Look at Benthos in Streams? 37 Sept. 2002   2. Fish Index of Nontidal Biotic Integrity Based on assessment of fish communities, streams in the Liberty Reservoir watershed are generally in good condition on average. In this index, protection is recommended for Liberty Reservoir streams based on their average score of 8.87 on a scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best). For this index, an average score for an 8-digit watershed less than 6.0 means that restoration is needed and a score of 8.0 or greater means that protection is recommended. In each stream site where fish are surveyed, the makeup of the overall fish population is measured in nine distinct ways such as the number of native species, number of benthic fish species, percent of individuals that are ""tolerant"" species, etc. These nine scores are then integrated to generate an index ranking for the survey site. To generate the index for the watershed, the scores for all the stream sites assessed within the 8-digit watershed are averaged together. 3. Nontidal In-Stream Habitat Index Based on habitat conditions in nontidal streams in the Liberty Reservoir watershed, conditions are generally fair on average. In this index, Liberty Reservoir streams scored an average of 6.47 on a scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best). This index allows comparison of streams based on habitat for fish and benthic organisms as measured by in-stream and riparian conditions. For each stream site that was assessed, visual field observations are used to score the site for substrate type, habitat features, bank conditions, riparian vegetation width, remoteness, aesthetic value, etc. For each site, the individual scores are integrated to generate a single score for each stream site. The index score reported for each stream site is a relative score to the maximum attainable score for comparable streams. The watershed index is created by averaging the scores for all the sites that were assessed in the watershed.  Benthic Macroinvertebrates  8, 9  Assessments of ""bugs"" (benthic macroinvertebrates or benthos) living in streams in streams that flow into the Liberty Reservoir have been conducted at various times in recent years. The intent of this assessment is to gauge water quality and habitat conditions by interpreting these in-stream populations. See the text box Why Look At Benthos In Streams for more details. Findings reported here represent sites where stream segments of over 200 feet were assessed by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey. Conditions in the same stream can vary significantly upstream or downstream, however, the MBSS employs a random site selection design to allow for general assessments for the entire watershed (provided enough sites have been sampled). 1. One Long Term Station Shows Improvement Trend Assessment of benthos at one long-term stream site provides some insight into changing conditions over time for this station only in the Liberty Reservoir watershed. The ""core"" long-term monitoring station NPA0165, is located at the Route 91 bridge over the East Branch of the Patapsco River as shown on Map 18 Benthic Index. Based on eleven years of information collected between 38 Sept. 2002   1978 and 1992, there was an increase in the kinds of bugs found in the stream. No other macroinvertebrate trends appeared during that period. Field notes taken by State field personnel recorded a problem with filamentous algae on the rocks and gravel in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In the late 1980s, the algae disappeared and a river weed (Podostemon sp.), which is sensitive to pollution appeared. Taken together, these findings reflect a slight improvement in water quality between 1978 and 1992.12 These improvements may be explained by the shift in agricultural practices from conventional till to reduced till that occurred in Carroll County during this period. Sampling by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) of two nearby sites in the North Branch Patapsco River in 1995 and 1996 rated the area as ""fair"" on the Benthic Index. 2. MBSS Monitoring in the 1990s and 2000 The Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) assessed 58 monitoring sites in the Liberty Reservoir watershed as shown on Map 18 Benthic Index between 1995 and the 2000. The map also shows an additional 52 monitoring sites sampled by citizen volunteers cooperating with MBSS in the Stream Waders Program.17 Additional MBSS assessments will be conducted in the watershed in 2003. A corresponding narrative rating is associated with each IBI score generated from examining the numbers and kinds of aquaitic insects present in the stream sample. A ""good"" rating means that a stream is comparable with those streams identified by MBSS that are minimally impacted (reference streams). A ""fair"" rating means that a stream is somewhat degraded compared to the reference streams. ""Poor"" and ""Very Poor"" ratings correspond to degraded and severely degraded streams degraded respectively compared to the reference streams. According to Stranko, et al, 2001, a large number of sampling sites (53%) were associated with minimally degraded conditions for fish or benthos indicating that human influences to the stream biota are likely to be minimal.17 Only two sites were rated as Poor for fish (3%), and 16 sites were rated Poor for benthos 17 (28%). The only site rated as ""very poor"" is located near Westminster that may reflect the impacts of stormwater runoff. Sites rated as ""poor"" are usually associated with both developed and agricultural areas. More detailed findings for each site is available via the Internet.13  39  Sept. 2002   Why Look at Benthos in Streams? Benthos are sometimes called ""stream bugs"" though that name overly simplifies the diverse membership of this group. Unimpaired natural streams may support a great diversity of species ranging from bacteria and algae to invertebrates like crayfish and insects to fish, reptiles and mammals. Benthic macro-invertebrates, collectively called benthos, are an important component of a stream's ecosystem. This group includes mayflies, caddisflies, crayfish, etc. that inhabit the stream bottom, its sediments, organic debris and live on plant life (macrophytes) within the stream. The food web in streams relies significantly on benthos. Benthos are often the most abundant source of food for fish and other small animals. Many benthic macroinvertebrates live on decomposing leaves and other organic materials in the stream. By this activity, these organisms are significant processors of organic materials in the stream. Benthos often provide the primary means that nutrients from organic debris are transformed to other biologically usable forms. These nutrients become available again and are transported downstream where other organisms use them. Benthos are a valuable tool for stream evaluation. This group of species has been extensively evaluated for use in water quality assessment, in evaluating biological conditions of streams and in gauging influences on streams by surrounding lands. Benthos serve as good indicators of water resource integrity because they are fairly sedentary in nature and their diversity offers numerous ways to interpret conditions. They have different sensitivities to changing conditions. They have a wide range of functions in the stream. They use different life cycle strategies for survival.  40  Sept. 2002   Fish 1. Assessments by MBSS The majority of stream segments assessed in the Liberty Reservoir watershed were rated as ""good"" or ""fair"" by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) in the middle 1990s and the Year 2000. Map 19 Fish In Nontidal Streams shows the sampling site locations. In general, a rating of good means that a diverse range of fish species were found at the site. Relatively few sites were rated as ""poor"" and none were ""very poor"". Also see detailed findings on the Internet.13 Sites where brook trout were identified are highlighted on the map because these native fish only in high quality, cool water. 2. Fish Consumption Advisory In late 2001, MDE issued revised fish consumption advisories. Based on fish tissue analyzed in 2000, the public is advised to limit consumption of several fish species from Liberty Reservoir because of potentially unhealthy levels of contaminates. The fish consumption advisories are especially important for children and women of child-bearing age who are or may become pregnant or are nursing. It is important to realize that mercury originates from atmospheric deposition from outside of the watershed; the watershed is not a source of this metal. In this index, Liberty Reservoir streams scored an average of 8.87 on a scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best).

As shown on Map 20 Physical Habitat Index, only one site in the watershed, near the rural community of Warfieldsburg, was rated as very poor. Five other sites were rated as poor. More detailed findings for each site is available via the Internet.13 According to Stranko, et al, 2001, ""The relatively small amount of urbanization and abundance of physical habitat structure in most of the stream in this watershed were also indicative of minimal degradation."" 17 The most common types of stream degradation encountered were stream bank erosion and insufficient, vegetated, riparian buffers.17 As also shown in Map 20, MBSS also found that most of the subwatersheds in the Liberty Reservoir watershed drain toward areas of stream habitat that was in good condition as the time of their field investigations. Watershed management in these areas will likely affect the viability of these habitat areas over time.17 Using the information in Maps 18, 19 and 20, it is possible to make general preliminary interpretations about local conditions in streams where sufficient information is available. For example, the maps show that Morgan Run has generally good physical habitat and fisheries populations that include brown trout. The presence of nature brown trout populations demonstrate that water in the local stream segment is high quality and cool year-round. The Morgan Run Natural Environment Area that encompasses some of these habitat areas may provide management that will protect existing good conditions. In comparison to Morgan Run, the East Branch of the Patapsco River also tends to have good physical habitat and fisheries populations including brown trout. Both waterways have benthic populations that are generally rated as fair.  42  Sept. 2002   Sensitive Species Sensitive species are most widely known in the form of Federally-listed Endangered or Threatened animals such as the bald eagle. In addition to these charismatic rare animals, both US EPA and Maryland DNR work through their respective Federal and State programs to protect numerous endangered, threatened, or rare species of plants and animals and the habitats that support those species. For the purposes of watershed restoration, it is valuable to account for known locations of habitat for these species. These places are often indicators, and sometimes important constituents, of the network of natural areas or ""green infrastructure"" that are the foundation for many essential natural watershed processes. Protecting these species and/or promoting expansion of their habitats can be an effective foundation for a watershed restoration program. DNR's Wildlife and Heritage Division uses three designations for areas providing habitat for sensitive species. These designations are described in the text box Maryland's Sensitive Species Protection Areas. As shown in Map 21 Sensitive Species, one of the three sensitive species designations are found in the Liberty Reservoir watershed. The purpose of these designations is to help protect sensitive species and their habitat through the review of applications for State permits or approvals, and review of projects that involve State funds. For the types of projects potentially described above, DNR makes recommendations and/or requirements to protect sensitive species and their habitat. These categories do not place requirements on any activities that do not require a permit/approval or do not involve State funds. However, there are State and Federal restrictions that address ""takings"" of protected species that apply more broadly. In addition, many counties have incorporated safeguards for these areas into their project and permit review processes. In all instances, property owners are encouraged to seek advice on protecting the sensitive species / habitat within their ownership. More details and guidance can be requested from DNR Natural Heritage Division staff.  43  Sept. 2002   Sensitive Species Protection Areas In the Liberty Reservoir Watershed  Sensitive Species Project Review Area (SSPRA) In Carroll County's portion of the Liberty Reservoir watershed, there at least three SSPRAs. In Baltimore County's portion of the watershed, there are at least two SSPRAs. Each SSPRA contains one or more sensitive species habitats. However, the entire SSPRA is not considered sensitive habitat. The SSPRA is an envelope identified for review purposes to help ensure that applications for permit or approval in or near sensitive areas receive adequate attention and safeguards for the sensitive species / habitat they contain. Also see Map 21 Sensitive Species.  Natural Heritage Area (NHA) No NHAs are located in the Liberty Reservoir watershed. NHAs are rare ecological communities that encompass sensitive species habitat. They are designated in State regulation COMAR 08.03.08.10. For any proposed project that requires a State permit or approval that may affect an NHA, recommendations and/or requirements are placed in the permit or approval that are specifically aimed at protecting the NHA. To help ensure that proposed projects that may affect an NHA are adequately reviewed, an SSPRA is always designated to encompass each NHA and the area surrounding it.  Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) No WSSCs are located in the Liberty Reservoir watershed. WSSC wetlands are associated with one or more sensitive species habitats that are in or near the wetland. For any proposed project that requires a wetland permit, these selected wetlands have additional regulatory requirements beyond the permitting requirements that generally apply to wetlands. To help ensure that proposed projects that may affect a WSSC are adequately reviewed, an SSPRA is always designated to encompass each WSSC and the area surrounding it. For a listing of designated WSSC sites, see COMAR 26.23.06.01 at www.dsd.state.md.us  44  Sept. 2002   RESTORATION TARGETING TOOLS 2002 Stream Corridor Assessment Using the Stream Corridor Assessment Methodology (SCAM) developed and applied by the DNR Watershed Restoration Division, valuable information can be compiled to assist in targeting restoration activities. This information will compliment existing watershed-related information and may explain cause and effect relationships between what is occurring in the watershed and how those activities are impacting the stream systems. Trained teams from the Maryland Conservation Corps will walk along streams to identify and document potential problems and restoration opportunities such as the items listed below: DNR will provide a report for County use. Stream Corridor Assessment Data Collection Categories Pipe Outfalls Pond Sites Tree Blockages Inadequate Buffers Erosion Fish Blockages Exposed Pipes Unusual Conditions Trash Dumping In or Near Stream Construction  The subwatersheds selected by Carroll County for assessment include Middle Run, Snowdens Run, and the West Branch of the Patapsco River. Stream corridor assessements were completed in summer 2002 for Middle and Snowdens Run watersheds. The assessment for the West Branch will be completed in October, 2002.  45  Sept. 2002   2002 Synoptic Survey and Benthic Community Assessment Based on 2002 sampling in the Liberty Reservoir watershed, DNR staff will report on water quality in nontidal streams to supplement knowledge of local conditions. Based on parameters listed below, the survey findings will help identify problem areas and relative conditions among local streams. It will also help rank subwatersheds by their nutrient load contributions to the reservoir. For the same 2002 sampling sites, DNR staff will also report on benthic organism populations in nontidal streams as a gauge of water quality and habitat conditions. DNR's report of 2002 findings will include assessment of water quality, benthic organism populations and the potential relationships that may be drawn from the 2002 data. Synopic Survey Data Collection Parameters Dissolved Oxygen pH Nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) Conductivity  Agricultural Conservation Programs Carroll County has one of the highest levels of conservation participation in the state. Farmers in the county willingly implement management systems that address nutrient runoff and infiltration, erosion and sediment control, and animal waste utilization. The Carroll Soil Conservation District, one of the WRAS partners, works with farmers and landowners in the development of Soil Conservation and Water Quality plans that recommend best management practices that will prevent nutrient and sediment impact on surface and ground water. Some of the conservation practices installed were grassed waterways, riparian herbaceous and riparian forested buffers, conservation cover, cover crops, shallow water wildlife areas and grade stabilization structures. The Maryland Agricultural Cost-Share program (MACS), the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP and CREP) and the Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) are some of the state and federal programs promoted and administered by the Carroll SCD and NRCS. 28 Farmers in the watershed who are already using good management practices that benefit water quality could provide examples to promote adoption of similar practices by other farmers. Also see the Agricultural BMPs section for a summary of existing BMPs in the Liberty Reservoir watershed.  46  Sept. 2002   Fish Blockage Removal Many fish species need to move from one stream segment to the next in order to maintain healthy resilient populations. Blockages in streams can inhibit or prevent many fish species from moving up stream to otherwise viable habitat. To help prioritize stream blockages for mitigation or removal, the DNR Fish Passage Program maintains a database of significant blockages to fish movement. A summary of blockages listed in the database for the Liberty Reservoir watershed appears in the table below and Map 19 Fish In Nontidal Streams . The listings in this database should be considered as supporting information for initiating a thorough Stream Corridor Assessment. Based on experience in other watersheds, it is likely that an assessment would identify additional potential fish blockage problems. Some blockages to fish movement may be structural components of stream gauging weirs, farm ponds, drainage ditches, etc. If a blockage is found to be in this category, circumstances like requirements for drainage control function and public or land owner needs are considered in determining the potential for a restoration project.

Benefits and General Recommendations Natural vegetation in stream riparian zones act as stream buffers that can provide numerous valuable environmental benefits:  Reducing surface runoff  Preventing erosion and sediment movement  Using nutrients for vegetative growth and moderating nutrient entry into the stream  Moderating temperature, particularly reducing warm season water temperature  Providing organic material (decomposing leaves) that are the foundation of natural food webs in stream systems  Providing overhead and in-stream cover and habitat  Promoting high quality aquatic habitat and diverse populations of aquatic species. 2. Using GIS Identifying the areas that need buffer restoration and prioritizing them for action can be a timeconsuming expensive project. Fortunately, use of a computerized Geographic Information System (GIS) to manipulate remote sensing data can help save limited time and funds. To assist in this technical endeavor, DNR Watershed Management and Analysis Division is offering assistance, including GIS work, to help target restoration of naturally vegetated stream buffers, wetlands and other watershed management projects that may be identified locally. With these tools, information generated by a Stream Corridor Assessment and additional on-the-ground verification or ""ground truthing,"" local government may more efficiently and confidently consider stream buffer restoration as part of a local Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. Several scenarios are presented here to help consider potential areas for stream buffer and wetland restoration. These scenarios can be used alone or in combination as models for targeting potential restoration sites for field verification. These maps are intended to demonstrate a methodology that can be used to locate sites having a high probability of optimizing certain ecological benefits of stream buffers. The resolution of the data used to generate these maps is not sufficient for an accurate site assessment, but can be used to identify potential candidate sites for more detailed investigation. The streams presented in the maps are perennial (blue line) streams as generally shown on US Geological Survey Quadrangle Maps. Intermittent streams were not considered in the stream buffer scenario maps. 3. Headwater Stream Buffers Headwater streams are the smallest and most numerous in Maryland watersheds and unlike larger streams (they intercept all of the surface runoff within the watersheds that they drain. Also, these streams at the ""top"" of the watershed are the type and size that are most effected by development. In addition, for many watersheds, headwater streams drain the majority of the land within the entire watershed; therefore, stream buffers restored along headwater streams tend to have greater potential to intercept nutrients and sediments than stream buffers placed elsewhere. The 48 Sept. 2002   nutrient removal function of headwater streams buffers with their associated springheads provides water supply benefits. In targeting stream buffer restoration projects, giving higher priority to headwater streams is one approach to optimizing nutrient and sediment retention. Restoring headwater stream buffers can also provide habitat benefits that can extend downstream of the project area. Forested headwater streams provide important organic material, like decomposing leaves, that ""feed"" the stream's food web. They also introduce woody debris which enhances in-stream physical habitat. The potential for riparian forest buffers to significantly influence stream temperature is greatest in headwater regions. These factors, in addition to positive water quality effects, are key to improving aquatic habitat. 4. Land Use and Stream Buffers One factor that affects the ability of stream buffers to intercept nonpoint source pollutants is adjacent land use. Nutrient and sediment loads from different land uses can vary significantly. The loading rates shown in the table here were calculated for the Lower Potomac River Tributary Basin from the model of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model. In general, restoration of stream buffers has been an agricultural Best Annual Nonpoint Source Pollution Load Rates Management Practice By Land Use (BMP), with less Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model (2000) applicability in urban areas. Land Use Nitrogen Phosphorus Sediment By identifying land uses in (lbs/ac) (lbs/ac) (tons/ac) riparian areas with inadequate stream buffers, Crop land 17.11 1.21 0.74 like crop land adjacent to Urban 7.5 0.7 0.09 streams, the potential to reduce nutrient and sediment Pasture 8.40 1.15 0.30 loads can be improved. To assist in finding areas with Forest 1.42 0.00 0.03 crop land adjacent to streams, the same land use data shown in Map 12 Generalized 2000 Land Use / Land Cover can be filtered using GIS. The new scenario shown in the Land Use Scenario for Stream Buffer Restoration focuses on the land use within 150 feet of a stream as shown in Map 22A and Map 22B. This view, supplemented with the land use pollution loading rates, suggests potential buffer restoration opportunities that could minimize nutrient and sediment loads. (Note: DNR is encouraging stream buffers 150 feet wide on each side of the stream, which is significantly greater than minimum buffer requirement, to enhance nutrient and habitat benefits beyond minimum buffer requirements.)  49  Sept. 2002   5. Nutrient Uptake from Hydric Soils in Stream Buffers In general, the nutrient nitrogen moves from the land into streams in surface water runoff and in groundwater. In watersheds like the Liberty Reservoir watershed, a significant percentage of nitrogen enters streams in groundwater. Stream buffers can be used to capture nitrogen moving in groundwater if buffer restoration projects have several key attributes:  Plant with roots deep enough to intercept groundwater as it moves toward the stream  Plants with high nitrogen uptake capability, and  Targeting buffer restoration projects to maximize groundwater interception by buffer plants. Hydric soils in stream riparian areas can be used as one factor to help select stream buffer restoration sites. Siting buffer restoration on hydric soils would offer several benefits:  Plant roots are more likely to be in contact with groundwater for longer periods of time  Hydric soils tend to be marginal for many agricultural and urban land uses  Natural vegetation in wet areas often offers greater potential for habitat. Map 23 Stream Buffer Hydric Soil On Open Land Scenario identifies lands adjacent to streams that are composed of hydric soil and also have insufficient stream buffers in the Liberty Reservoir watershed. An important next step in using this information is verification of field conditions. Care must be taken during field validation to evaluate any hydrologic modification of these soils, like subsurface drains, which would serve to decrease potential benefits. 6. Optimizing Water Quality Benefits by Combining Priorities Strategic targeting of stream buffer restoration projects may promote many different potential benefits. To maximize multiple benefits, site selection and project design need to incorporate numerous factors. For example, finding a site with a mix of attributes like those in the following list could result in the greatest control of nonpoint source pollution and enhancement to living resources:  land owner willingness / incentives  marginal land use in the riparian zone  headwater stream  hydric soils  selecting appropriate woody/grass species  adjacent to existing wetlands / habitat  Additionally, selecting restoration projects that are likely to produce measurable success is an important consideration in prioritizing projects for implementation. In the early stages of a watershed restoration program, measurable water quality improvement can be one of the strongest ways to demonstrate project success. In general, targeting restoration projects to one or a few selected tributaries or small watersheds will tend to offer the greatest probability of producing measurable water quality improvement. By selecting small areas like a small first order stream for restoration, there is greater likelihood that water quality problems arise locally and that they can be corrected by limited investment in carefully selected local restoration projects.  50  Sept. 2002   Wetland Restoration Wetlands serve important environmental functions such as erosion control, habitat and nursery areas for many organisms and nutrient uptake/recycling. However, most watersheds in Maryland have significantly fewer wetland acres today than in the past. This loss due to draining, filling, etc. has led to habitat loss and negative water quality impacts in streams and in the Chesapeake Bay. Reversing this historic trend is an important goal of wetland restoration. One approach to identifying candidate wetland restoration sites involves using GIS to identify open land and ""historic"" wetland areas based on the presence of hydric soils. For the Liberty Reservoir watershed, Map 24 Hydric Soils Near Wetlands shows where nonwetland hydric soils are near wetlands identified in the DNR wetland GIS data. These areas are more likely to offer conditions for wetland restoration than upland sites that do not have hydric soil. The steps used to generate the map are listed below and findings are summarized in the table below:  Data used: Hydric soils (Natural Soil Groups), existing wetlands (DNR Wetlands covering Carroll County, NWI wetlands covering Baltimore County), land use (Md. Dept. of Planning 2000).  Identify candidate hydric soil areas based on land use. Hydric soils on open land including farm fields, bare ground, etc. Hydric soils underlying natural vegetation and developed lands were excluded but opportunities on developed lands could be considered in other scenarios.  Explore hydric soils based on public land ownership and proximity to existing wetlands. Open Lands on Hydric Soil Near Wetlands In Selected Subwatersheds Morgan Run - About 17 acres total with 5 acres within 100 feet of existing wetlands. Some of these opportunities may be on the Morgan Run NEA and the remainder are on adjacent private lands Little Morgan Run #1 - About 9 acres total with 2 acres within 100 feet of existing wetlands. Little Morgan Run #2 - About 135 acres total with 44 acres within 100 feet of existing wetlands. Middle Run - About 170 acres total with 64 acres within 100 feet of existing wetlands.  51  Sept. 2002   CURRENT AND HISTORICAL RESTORATION PROJECTS Overview There are numerous projects and programs that have the potential to contribute to successful development and implementation of a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). The listing included here suggests opportunities for cooperation and coordination that can improve the likelihood of success for the WRAS. This listing is not all-inclusive. It is recommended that this list be augmented as new information becomes available and that follow-up should continue to promote the WRAS process with these and other projects and programs.  319(h)-Funded Projects Within the watershed, Carroll County has participated in three 319-funded projects. The first two involved stream channel restoration efforts along Linton Road and adjacent to the Hodges Landfill. The third project, a much larger effort, examined watershed restoration opportunities within the Longwell Branch Watershed in the City of Westminster. A number of projects were completed including the creation of several stormwater management facilities for previously developed land, improvements to an older stormwater management pond, and another stream channel restoration. Currently, MBSS is assisting the county with post-implementation monitoring to see what improvements have occurred with respect to the stream channel restoration and how quickly the improvements are detected.  Other Projects Currently, the two stormwater management dry ponds at Liberty High School in Eldersburg are being reconstructed to provide much greater water quality benefits. A large amount of stream channel erosion has occurred in the past and the improvements will greatly reduce the stream flows to the receiving stream.  52  Sept. 2002   POTENTIAL BENCHMARKS FOR WRAS GOAL SETTING Several programs designed to manage water quality and/or living resources have existing or proposed goals that are relevant to setting goals for the Liberty Reservoir Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). The goals from these other programs tend to overlap and run parallel to potential interests for developing WRAS goals. Therefore, to assist in WRAS development, selected goals from other programs are included here as points of reference. Chesapeake 2000 Agreement The Chesapeake 2000 Agreement (C2K) includes several significant commitments pertaining to local watershed management planning and implementation. The goal in the C2K Agreement that is directly related to the development of watershed management plans and action strategies is ""By 2010, work with local governments, community watershed groups and watershed organizations to develop and implement locally supported watershed management plans in two-thirds of the Bay watershed covered by this Agreement. These plans would address the protection, conservation and restoration of stream corridors, riparian buffers and wetlands for the purposes of improving habitat and water quality, with the collateral benefits for optimizing flow and water supply."" Four common elements of watershed management planning were adopted by the Chesapeake Bay Program member jurisdictions to be applied Bay-wide. Those elements support the WRAS components which were also identified as common Bay-wide criteria for watershed management planning. The four approved C2K Agreement watershed planning elements are as follows: 1. Does the plan ""address the protection, conservation and restoration of stream corridors, riparian forest buffers and wetlands?"" Each watershed management plan needs to be based on sitespecific assessments of natural resources within the watershed. At a minimum, the assessment will evaluate the condition of stream corridors, riparian buffers and wetlands within the watershed. 2. Does the plan reflect the goals and objectives of ""improving habitat and water quality?"" The plan should reflect the issues that the stakeholders feel are important, and, at a minimum, exhibit a benefit to habitat and water quality within the watershed. The goals should be based on priority issues identified by the watershed assessment. 3. Chesapeake 2000 Watershed Commitments (CWiC) Criteria #3-- Does the plan identify implementation mechanisms? Capacity to implement the plan will be demonstrated by identifying: - What are the specific management actions? - What are the resources necessary for implementation? - Who will implement the plan? - When will the actions be implemented?  53  Sept. 2002   The implementation mechanisms should also incorporate a periodic re-evaluation to ensure the plan is ""living"" and flexible to the changes in the watershed. 4. Does the plan have demonstrated local support? Every effort should be made to demonstrate a diversity of local support. At a minimum, local governments, community groups and watershed organizations should be encouraged to participate in developing and implementing the watershed management plan. Goals from the Clean Water Action Plan 2:  Clean Water Goals - Maryland watersheds should meet water quality standards, including numerical criteria as well as narrative standards and designated uses.  Watersheds should achieve healthy conditions as indicated by natural resource indicators related to the condition of the water itself (e.g. water chemistry), aquatic living resources and physical habitat, as well as landscape factors (e.g. buffered streams and wetland restoration).  54  Sept. 2002   REFERENCES  1.

GX266-36-16643273	"TMDLs What is a TMDL?  Fact Sheet  A TMDL (Total Maximum Daily Load) is an estimate of the maximum amount of an impairing substance or stressor (pollutant) that a waterbody can assimilate without violating water quality standards. This total load includes pollutants that come from the end of a pipe (point sources), stormwater runoff and groundwater flow (nonpoint sources), and a ""margin of safety"" that provides a cushion needed because of uncertainties associated with estimates. A TMDL also may include an allowance for future increases in pollutant loads due to changes in land use, population growth, and the expansion of business activity. What are the benefits of TMDLs? Maryland's cultural heritage is closely tied to its rivers, coastal waters and the Chesapeake Bay. The seafood industry, recreational activities and the quality of life for Maryland's citizens depend on the quality of our waters. Maryland's waters are currently managed through the use of ""water-quality-based permits"", which place limits on the discharge of wastewater to ensure receiving waters will remain ""fishable and swimmable"". As part of the Chesapeake Bay Agreement, Maryland also has defined upper limits on the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus that may go into the Bay. TMDLs formalize these procedures for setting upper limits on pollutants and will create a lasting framework to ensure clean waters for generations to come. Why is Maryland developing TMDLs? All states are required by the federal Clean Water Act to consider the development of TMDLs. Every four years, states must submit a prioritized list of waterbodies that do not meet water quality standards or will not meet the standards after all technology-based pollution controls are in place. Technology-based controls, defined under the Code of Federal Regulations, 40 CFR 130.7(b)(1)(i-iii), are the basic pollution controls for point sources and nonpoint sources that are uniformly required by federal, state or local law. What waterbodies are currently on the TMDL list? Across the State, there are approximately 130 rivers, streams, lakes, reservoirs and estuaries that are impaired by one or more of the following pollutants: nutrients, sediments, toxics, acidity or fecal coliform bacteria. Maryland's most recent TMDL list was approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in September 1998. The next TMDL list must be submitted to the EPA by April 1, 2002. What are the steps in developing a TMDL? The first step in the TMDL process is to identify waterbodies that are impaired and should have TMDLs. This involves assessing existing water quality information collected by a variety of monitoring techniques. Computer modeling is then used to estimate pollutant loadings to the waterbodies and water quality impacts of the pollutant loadings under varying conditions, such as low stream flows. The modeling is used to estimate the amount of pollutants waterbodies can assimilate without violating water quality standards. Once this maximum pollutant load (TMDL) is defined, it must be allocated between point and nonpoint sources, accounting for a margin of safety and future allocation. The allocation will balance equity and cost considerations, and may involve innovative approaches such as trading between different pollutant sources. The public, affected dischargers, regional agencies, and local governments will be involved in the TMDL development process.   How do TMDLs fit into Maryland's existing water quality efforts? Many of Maryland's existing efforts to protect and restore water quality will help the State meet its TMDL goals. Some examples include Maryland's Tributary Strategies for Nutrient Reduction, the Gunpowder Watershed Project, the Coastal Bays of the National Estuaries Program, the Baltimore Harbor Toxics Regional Action Plan, and a variety of pollution prevention efforts. The waters identified for TMDLs are also at the core of Maryland's Clean Water Action Plan. In many ways, Maryland's ongoing effort to reduce nutrients entering the Chesapeake Bay has been very similar to a TMDL process. Stakeholders and researchers recognized water quality problems, set an achievable goal, and then identified specific controls for point and nonpoint pollution sources intended to achieve the goal. This is the essence of a TMDL. How can TMDL goals be achieved? Because a TMDL represents an upper limit, or ""cap"", on pollutant loads to a waterbody, there must be mechanisms to ensure that the cap is not exceeded. These mechanisms include state and local permitting and regulatory authority, and voluntary efforts under the Chesapeake Bay Agreement that are supported by technical and financial assistance. Maryland has one of the most comprehensive, multi-level, community-based estuary restoration programs in the country. We are committed to building on our existing efforts and believe that a combination of voluntary commitments and regulatory procedures is the best course to take in Maryland. Maryland will make use of existing programs that provide technical and financial assistance to control and allocate pollutant loads. Examples include cost share programs for nutrient removal at municipal wastewater treatment plants, low-cost loans from the State's revolving loan program, grants for stormwater retrofits, cost share grant funds for stream restoration, agricultural cost share programs, agricultural technical assistance programs, and acid mine drainage remediation assistance.

These watersheds are in the central portion of the Maryland Coastal Bays drainage area. The WRAS project area encompasses about 46,204 acres including about 11,471 acres of open water. The purpose of the WRAS project is for Worcester County and various stakeholders to determine local priorities for protection and restoration of water quality and habitat. As part of the WRAS project, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is providing technical assistance, including preparation of a watershed characterization (compilation of available water quality and natural resources information and identification of issues), a stream corridor assessment (uses field inspection data to catalog issues and rate problem severity) and a synoptic survey (analyzes benthic macroinvertebrates, fish and water samples with focus on nutrients). The County will use this information to help generate the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. Water Quality Maryland's Coastal Bays, including the WRAS project area, are salty water bodies with salinty that varies between 27 parts per thousand (ppt) to 34 ppt. Tidal portions of Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay are listed by the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) for impairments associated with low dissolved oxygen, nutrients and fecal coliform bacteria. Both watersheds are affected by MDE's statewide fish consumption advisory due to methylmercury. The Newport Bay watershed has an approved Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) that addresses nitrogen in three tidal creeks and the bay and biological oxygen demand in Kitts Branch. Nutrient loads in this watershed are mostly from nonpoint sources. Nonpoint sources generate about 49% of the nitrogen load, point sources contribute about 30%and the remainder comes from atmospheric deposition and groundwater. Phosphorus loads are about 80% from nonpoint sources and 20% from point sources. Nonpoint source phosphorus in the water is mostly associated with movement of sediment. Sinepuxent Bay has a small area closed to shellfish harvesting due to a sewage effluent discharge from the Assateague Island Park visitor facility. The average stream base flow nitrate concentration for nontidal streams flowing into Maryland's Coastal Bays south of Berlin was measured at 1.75 milligrams per liter (mg/l) during the winters of 1999 and 2000. This level is significantly higher than the previously assumed level of 0.72 mg/l. Average groundwater nitrate was found to be low in most areas. However, high nitrates in groundwater, ranging from 5.01 mg/l to 8.00 mg/l, characterized the area bounded by the tidal portion of Ayer Creek on the west, Newport Creek on the south and Sinepuxent Bay on the east. Several smaller areas exhibited higher average nitrate levels.  vi   The Landscape According to Maryland Department of Planning 2000 data, land use differs in the two watersheds. The Newport Bay watershed is relatively rural: 11% developed, 34% agriculture, 43% forest/scrub and 12% wetland. The Sinpuxent Bay watershed has twice the developed area and one-third the agricultural area. However, the greatest concentration of impervious area is in the Town of Berlin, which drains to Newport Bay. Both watersheds have significant green infrastructure, forest with large interior area and wetlands. In the Newport Bay watershed, most of this land is not protected from land use conversion. A large proportion of these areas in Sinepuxent Bay watershed are protected by the Assateague Island parks system. About 37% of these watersheds is prime agricultural land. Over 48% of the soils in these watersheds exhibit hydric conditions. Some areas of hydric soils are ditched to improve drainage. The most prevalent wetland type in both watersheds is emergent wetland. However, the Newport Bay watershed has a large portion of forested palustrine wetlands (freshwater wetlands not associated with lakes, rivers or streams. Sinepuxent Bay watershed has a relatively large portion of unconsolidated shore wetlands  mostly on the bay-side of the barrier island. In the long term, a large area of the WRAS Project Area may be affected by sea level rise. Living Resources and Habitat Tidal fish species of commercial and recreational importance are showing signs of improvement following significant declines in population in the 1980s and 1990s. Sensitive species identified in these watersheds include 20 plant and five animal species including two Federally listed birds: the bald eagle and the piping plover. Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV) beds have been increasing their coverage since monitoring began in the 1980s. SAV in Maryland's Coastal Bays was nearly eliminated by disease in the 1930s. Sinepuxent Bay has a significantly larger area of SAV than Newport Bay. Restoration Targeting Tools Scenarios for potential stream buffer restoration and wetland restoration targeting suggests that opportunities for further assessment may be available. Current field data gathered by the Stream Corridor Assessment and the Synoptic Survey will help develop a list of issues for further investigation and identify sites that could be used in restoration efforts.  vii   CONTRIBUTORS TO THE WATERSHED CHARACTERIZATION Worcester County Department of Comprehensive Planning Maryland Dept. of Natural Resources Sandy Coyman, David Honick, Katherine Munson, Keota Silaphone  Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service David Bleil, Mary Conley, Katharine Dowell, Greta Guzman, Danielle Lucid, Robin Pelicano, Niles Primrose, Ted Weber, John Wolf, Ken Yetman Forest Service Anne Hairston-Strang Fisheries Service Harley Speir Resource Assessment Service Ellen Friedman, Renee Karrh, Catherine Wazniak Wildlife & Heritage Division Lynn Davidson, Tim Larney Maryland Department of the Environment John Grace, Kelly Neff, John Smith, Robert Daniel  Others  Editor and Primary Author: Ken Shanks, Maryland Department of the Natural Resources, Watershed Services, Landscape and Watershed Analysis Division  viii   INTRODUCTION Background In 1998, Maryland completed an assessment of all the state's watersheds in order to identify high priorities for restoration action based on impaired waters and high priorities for conservation action based on high or unique natural resource value. The assessment, called the Unified Watershed Assessment, was conducted by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) under the direction of the US Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Water Action Plan initiative with assistance from the Maryland Departments of Environment, Agriculture and Planning and the University of Maryland. It moved beyond consideration of water quality in the streams in the state, which had been assessed regularly since the early 1970's, to a larger consideration of living resources in the streams and the landscape conditions which could impact both water quality and living resources.1,2 In response to the findings of the Unified Watershed Assessment, DNR offers technical and financial assistance to local governments who are willing to develop and implement Watershed Restoration Action Strategies (WRAS) addressing needs for restoration and conservation in priority watersheds. One of these projects is the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay Watersheds in Worcester County, where the County, DNR and other local cooperators, both public and private, are engaged in developing a watershed management strategy. Location Watershed Acreage Summary MDP 2000 Land Use/Land Cover  The Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds are located Watershed Land Water Total within the Maryland Coastal Bays drainage area as shown in Map 1 Newport Bay 27,229 5,264 32,493 Location. These watersheds are Sinepuxent Bay 7,504 6,207 13,711 located entirely within Worcester County as highlighted in Map 2 Newport and 34,733 11,471 46,204 Project Area. This area is the focus of Sinepuxent Bays the WRAS and this Watershed Characterization. The adjacent table shows that about one quarter of the WRAS project area is open water. Map 2 also shows that DNR subdivides the Newport Bay watershed into four ""12-digit"" subwatersheds for analytical purposes. No Sinepuxent Bay subwatersheds are defined by DNR. The table Subwatersheds provides additional details on these subwatersheds. Purpose of the Characterization One of the earliest steps in devising a WRAS is to characterize the watershed using available information. This Watershed Characterization is intended to meet several objectives:  briefly summarize the most important information and issues 1        provide preliminary findings identify information or analysis needs suggest opportunities for additional characterization and restoration work. provide a common base of knowledge about the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay Watersheds for local governments, citizens, businesses and other organizations  Additional Characterization Work The Watershed Characterization is intended to be one starting point that can be updated as needed. It is part of a framework for a more thorough assessment involving an array of additional inputs:  self-investigation by Worcester County  targeted technical assistance and assessment by partner agencies or contractors  input from local citizens  completion of a Stream Corridor Assessment, in which DNR personnel physically walk the streams and catalogue important issues.  completion of a synoptic water quality survey, i.e. a program of water sample analysis, that can be used to focus on local issues like nutrient hot spots, point source discharges or other selected issues. This is also part of the technical assistance offered by DNR. Findings of the 2002 synoptic survey of the streams in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds are reported in Appendix D. Identifying Gaps in Information It is important to identify gaps in available watershed knowledge and gauge the importance of these gaps. In assessing data gaps, we have found it helpful to review information in four categories:  Habitat: physical structure, stream stability and biotic community (including the riparian zone)  Water Quantity: high waterstorm flow and flooding; low waterbaseflow problems from dams, water withdrawals, reduced infiltration  Water Quality: water chemistry; toxics, nutrients, sediment, nuisance odors/scums, etc.  Cumulative effects associated with habitat, water quantity and water quality. Because restoration is an active evolving process, the Watershed Characterization and the resulting Watershed Restoration Action Strategy should be maintained as living documents within an active evolving restoration process. These documents will need to be updated periodically as new, more relevant information becomes available and as the watershed response is monitored and reassessed.  2   Subwatersheds Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay WRAS Project Area ""8-Digit"" Watershed Number/ Name 02130104 Sinepuxent Bay ""12-Digit"" Subwatershed Name and Number same as 8-digit 0681 Area in Acres Description Water 6,207 Land* 7,504 Total 13,711 Entire 8-digit Watershed Includes Massey Br.

Historically, the emphasis has been on chemical water quality. More recently, additional factors are being considered like measurements of selected biological conditions and physical conditions that affect habitat quality in streams and estuaries. This developmental path is reflected in the ways in which streams have been monitored, the types of data gathered, and the regulatory approach taken. Water Quality Standards and Designated Uses All streams and other water bodies in Maryland are assigned a ""designated use"" in the Code of Maryland Regulation (COMAR) 26.08.02.08, which is associated with a set of water quality criteria necessary to support that use. The Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds are assigned two uses: - Use I, Water Contact Recreation and Protection of Aquatic Life: All surface waters not designated as Use II. - Use II, Shellfish Harvesting Waters: All portions of the territorial seas and estuarine portions of bays and tributaries except: Ocean City Harbor above the entrance to West Ocean City Harbor Map 3 Designated Uses and Use Restrictions depicts the distribution of surface waters in each category. (COMAR or MDE should be consulted for official regulatory information.) 3,5 Use Impairments and Restrictions 4  Some streams or other water bodies in the WRAS project area cannot be used to the full extent envisioned by their designated use in Maryland regulation due to water quality or habitat impairments. These areas, known as ""impaired waters"", are tracked by the State of Maryland under Section 303(d) requirements of the Federal Clean Water Act. Each impairment listed may require preparation of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) to address the water quality and/or habitat impairment in the affected water body.5 Maryland's list of impaired waters for the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds include waters affected by the water quality or habitat problems listed and discussed below: Dissolved Oxygen Fecal Coliform Bacteria and Shellfish Harvesting Restrictions Nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) Fish Consumption Advisory  4   1. Dissolved Oxygen The draft 2002 303(d) list identifies dissolved oxygen impairment in tidal portions of both Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay. The origins of the dissolved oxygen problem are listed: as natural and nonpoint sources related to human activity. Aquatic life requires a range of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in water to allow for respiration and survival. If DO concentrations diminish beyond the range of tolerance for the species in a water body, mobile species like fish attempt to leave low DO areas in search more suitable areas. Individuals unable to escape die when DO concentrations drop below tolerance levels. To help ensure that waters of the State provide sufficient levels of dissolved oxygen to support aquatic life, the State of Maryland has a DO water quality standard in regulation. The standard requires that dissolved oxygen concentrations be maintained at 5.0 mg/l or higher. Water bodies in which DO levels are known to fall below 5.0 mg/l on a reoccurring basis are listed as impaired in the 303(d) list. 2. Fecal Coliform Bacteria and Shellfish Harvesting Restrictions The tidal portions of Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay are listed for impairment by fecal coliform bacteria in the draft 2002 303(d) list. The origins of these bacteria were listed: as natural and nonpoint sources. As shown in Map 3 Designated Uses and Use Restrictions, a small portion of Sinepuxent Bay is affected by shellfish harvesting restrictions. Tidal waters closest to the Assateague Island State Park Visitor Center are ""restricted"" which ""means that no harvesting of oysters and clams is allowed at any time."" These restrictions are applied by the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) to protect public health because areas near treated sewage effluent discharges have the potential to receive elevated levels fecal coliform bacteria. Fecal coliform bacteria are a class of bacteria typically found in the digestive tract of warm-blooded animals, including humans. Fecal coliform bacteria are always found in animal waste and human sewage (unless it is treated to kill them). In unpolluted streams and tidal waters, it is common for water samples to contain very few of these bacteria. Water samples exhibiting significantly larger fecal coliform bacteria populations are ""indicators"" of contamination by animal or human, waste. Depending on local conditions, sources of fecal contamination may include any of the following: inadequately treated sewage, failing septic systems, wild or domestic animals, urban stormwater carrying pet waste and similar sources. 3. Nutrients The tidal portions of Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay are listed for impairment by nutrients in the 1996 303(d) list and in the draft 2002 303(d) list. The origins of these nutrients were listed: as natural and nonpoint sources related to human activity. According to the November 2002 TMDL report for Newport Bay, nutrients are significant contributors to the use impairments in the Newport Bay system. High nutrient loads, particularly nitrogen in the Newport Bay, contribute to excessive algal blooms and concentrations of dissolved oxygen below the minimum State standard of 5.0 milligrams per liter (mg/l). The algae and dissolved oxygen problems impair local conditions and interfere with the designated uses of the Newport Bay system. The section Total Maximum Daily Loads gives additional information. 5   In general, nutrients can lead to the problems noted above in several ways. In Maryland, most water bodies naturally have low levels of the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus. Without these essential nutrients, most water bodies could support aquatic life. However, in the tidal waters of the Coastal Bays, when high nutrient loads coincide with warm weather and sufficient light, algae populations can grow to excessive levels. These algae can then crowd out other small organisms, cloud the water limiting light penetration, and eventually die-off consuming the dissolved oxygen that other aquatic life needs to survive. Nutrient pollution or over-enrichment problems may arise from numerous sources including all types of land and from the atmosphere. However, most of the nutrients in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bays are generated within their respective watersheds. Residential land can be an important contributor of nutrients depending on fertilizer use, extent of lawn and the status of septic systems. Farmers apply nutrients using different approaches, so nutrients entering waterways from crop land vary greatly depending on management techniques. Typically, streams and other surface waters receive relatively small amounts of nutrients from forest land and relatively large amounts from land uses that involve soil disturbance and application of fertilizer. The fraction of the total nitrogen load contributed by the atmosphere typically originates at burning fossil fuels in power plants and other industries, and from automobiles. Also see What Are the Effects of Nutrient Over-Enrichment? 4. Fish Consumption Advisory Fish tissue sampling conducted in 2001 by MDE led to issuance of a fish consumption advisory in late 2001. An update to the advisory was issued by MDE in January 2003. The purpose of the advisory is to recommend limiting human consumption as described in the table below. The table is adapted from www.mde.state.md.us/CitizensInfoCenter/FishandShellfish 2003 Advisory On Fish Consumption Affecting Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay Recommended Maximum Allowable Meals Per Month Species Smallmouth & Largemouth Bass, Pickerel, Northern Pike, Walleye Bluegill Area Affected Statewide Lakes and other impoundments Rivers and streams Lakes and other impoundments General Population 8oz meal 4 no advisory 8 Women 6oz meal 4 8 8 Children 3oz. meal 2 8 8 Methylmercury Contaminant  6   Total Maximum Daily Loads The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) uses the 303(d) list to determine the need for establishing Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). A TMDL is the amount of pollutant that a waterbody can assimilate and still meet its designated use. A waterbody may have multiple impairments and multiple TMDLs to address them. MDE is responsible for establishing TMDLs in Maryland. In general, TMDLs include several key parts: 1- Maximum pollutant load that the water body can accept while still allowing it to meet its intended use. 2- Allocation of the maximum pollutant load to specific pollutant sources. As of March 2003, one TMDL has been drafted that directly affects the WRAS project area encompassing the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. The report Total Maximum Daily Loads of Nitrogen for Three Tidal Tributaries and Total Maximum Daily Load of Biological Oxygen Demand for One Tributary in the Newport Bay System, Worcester County, Maryland, was submitted to EPA in January 2003. The following sections summarize key parts of the TMDLs set in the report. 1. Nitrogen TMDLs In The Newport Bay Watershed The Newport Bay mainstem receives flows and pollutants from numerous tributaries. In 1998, MDE conducted water quality monitoring to support its TMDL work. Analysis of this data and data from other sources covering the same time frame lead MDE to the conclusion that control of nitrogen would limit algae growth in the Newport Bay system. In response, MDE has designed nitrogen TMDLs for several areas in the Newport Bay watershed as described below and summarized in the table Newport Bay Watershed Nitrogen TMDLs:  There are five subwatersheds in the Newport Bay system that were addressed in the TMDL report. Three subwatersheds received nitrogen TMDLs (Ayer Creek, Newport Creek/Trappe Creek and Newport Bay), one BOD TMDL (Kitts Branch) and Marshall Creek had insufficient data and modeling limitations to allow generation of a TMDL.  Nitrogen TMDLs are designed to address needs in specific areas of the Newport Bay system. The goals of these TMDLs are to improve water quality by maintaining dissolved oxygen concentrations above the State standard of 5.0 mg/l and by reducing algae blooms as measured by chlorophyll a. The nitrogen TMDL for Newport Bay is intended to constrain the total nitrogen load from the entire Newport Bay watershed while the TMDLs for its tributaries are intended to control local problem areas.  The nitrogen TMDL for Newport Bay will require nearly a 47% total load reduction from current nitrogen loads. MDE reported that the total nitrogen load to Newport Bay is 407,551 pounds per year based on water quality monitoring. The sum of the monthly nitrogen loads listed as limits for Newport Bay in table Newport Bay Watershed Nitrogen TMDLs is 218,209 pounds per year of nitrogen.  7   Newport Bay Watershed Nitrogen TMDLs in Pounds/Month Watershed Area Ayer Creek Newport Cr. / Trappe Cr.

Biological Oxygen Demand TMDL for Kitts Branch Kitts Branch, which drains an area around the town of Berlin, flows into Trappe Creek and then to Newport Bay. The Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) TMDL for Kitts Branch is designed to protect water quality by maintaining dissolved oxygen concentrations above the State standard of 5.0 mg/l during spring and summer low-flow conditions. The spring TMDL is 6,132 pounds per month from April 1 to May 31. Based on 1998 monitoring data, the typical spring nitrogen load in Kitts Branch is about 100 pounds per day (around 3,000 pounds per month). The summer TMDL is 1,369 pounds per month from June1 to Oct. 31. Based on 1998 monitoring data, the typical summer nitrogen load in Kitts Branch is about 28 pounds per day (around 840 pounds per month). There are no BOD TMDL limits applied in winter from November 1 through March 31.  8   Water Quality IndicatorsSetting Priority for Restoration and Protection In Maryland's 1998 Clean Water Action Plan, the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds were included in two categories for priority action: highest priority for restoration, and priority for protecting valued resources. As the basis for the 1998 prioritization, a Unified Watershed Assessment was conducted to establish priorities for restoration and protection all for all watersheds (134) covering the State of Maryland. Part of this assessment employed indicators of water quality, landscape and living resources for each watershed where sufficient information was available. Other approaches to assessing water quality have been in use for several years and are further described below. In general they do Water Quality Indicator Summary not look comparatively at watersheds Coastal Bay Tidal Index as the Unified Assessment did in an Watershed effort to set priorities. The Unified Habitat Eutrophication Assessment also considered a range of living resource and landscape Assawoman Category 1 Category 2 indicators described in the following Isle of Wight Category 1 Category 2 sections. The Coastal Bays watersheds, Sinepuxent Category 2 Category 2 the table summarizes the rankings for the water quality indicators used to Newport Category 1 Category 2 allow comparison among them. The Chincoteague Category 2 Category 2 definition each category is listed below: Category 1  watersheds in this category have the greatest problems compared to other watersheds. These watersheds are assigned the highest priority for restoration. Category 2  watersheds that do not have conditions to qualify for either Category 1 or Category 3. Both restoration and protection would be addressed in these watersheds as practicable. Category 3  watersheds with relatively very few problems and high quality conditions. These watershed are assigned the highest priority for protection.  9   National Academy Press, Clean Coastal Waters (2000) What Are the Effects of Nutrient Over-Enrichment? 6 The productivity of many [lake, estuary and] coastal marine systems is limited by nutrient availability, and the input of additional nutrients to these systems increases primary productivity [microscopic organisms including algae]. In moderation in some systems, nutrient enrichment can have beneficial impacts such as increasing fish production; however, more generally the consequences of nutrient enrichment for [lake, estuarine and] coastal marine ecosystems are detrimental. Many of these detrimental consequences are associated with eutrophication. The increased productivity from eutrophication increases oxygen consumption in the system and can lead to low-oxygen (hypoxia) or oxygen-free (anoxic) water bodies. This can lead to fish kills as well as more subtle changes in ecological structure and functioning, such as lowered biotic diversity and lowered recruitment of fish populations. Eutrophication can also have deleterious consequences on estuaries even when low-oxygen events do not occur. These changes include loss of biotic diversity, and changes in the ecological structure of both planktonic and benthic communities, some of which may be deleterious to fisheries. Seagrass beds are particularly vulnerable to damage from eutrophication and nutrient over-enrichment. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) harm fish, shellfish, and marine mammals and pose a direct public health threat to humans. The factors that cause HABs remain poorly known, and some events are entirely natural. However, nutrient over-enrichment of coastal waters leads to blooms of some organisms that are both longer in duration and of more frequent occurrence. Although difficult to quantify, the social and economic consequences of nutrient over-enrichment include aesthetic, health, and livelihood impacts  10   Water Quality Monitoring Various agencies conduct on-going water quality-related monitoring in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay area, including DNR, MDE, the National Park Service and volunteers working with Maryland's Coastal Bays Program. Map 4 Monitoring Water Quality shows some of these monitoring stations (mostly those used for the Newport Bay TMDL). Maryland's Coastal Bays Program distributes information relevant to the WRAS Project via the Internet at http://www.dnr.state.md.us/coastalbays/index.html . An example of the information available under the heading Water Quality is shown below. The Internet site offers other information like analysis of data from the four fixed monitoring stations listed below and labeled on Map 4.

Algae 7 To estimate relative population levels of green and blue-green algae present in a water body, the concentration of Chlorophyll a in water is used as an indirect estimate of the aggregate population. Higher Chlorophyll a concentrations indicate higher algae populations. Algae problems tend to occur more in Trappe, Ayer and Newport Creeks rather than the open tidal waters of Newport Bay itself based on 1998 data. In Newport Bay, Chlorophyll a concentrations were 50 micrograms per liter (Fg/l) or less under high flow (spring) and low flow (summer) conditions. The greatest algae populations were found in Trappe Creek where chlorophyll a concentrations from 100 to 200 Fg/l occurred during low flow conditions. Under high flow conditions in Trappe Creek, chlorophyll a concentrations as high as 125 Fg/l were measured. Ayer Creek and Newport Creek both exhibited elevated chlorophyll a concentrations during low flow conditions up to 125 Fg/l and up to 90 Fg/l respectively. In Kitts Branch, chlorophyll a concentrations were consistently less than 40 Fg/l which indicates that algae is not a problem in this tributary. Overall, the 1998 data suggests that the algae problem is related to conditions arising up in the watershed rather than from problems arising from tidal inputs from Sinepuxent or Chincoteague Bay. 2. Dissolved Oxygen During spring high flow conditions, all the tidal waters monitored during 1998 exhibited dissolved oxygen concentrations that were consistent with the State water quality standard of 5.0 milligrams per liter (mg/l).7 During summer months dissolved oxygen below the State standard was found in several areas:  In Newport Bay, Newport Creek, Ayer Creek, Trappe Creek and Kitts Branch for all the tidal waters monitored in 1998. The lowest dissolved oxygen measurement, less than 2.5 mg/l, was observed in Ayer Creek.7  Throughout Newport Bay (1999 through 2001 monitoring, DNR Resource Assessment Service)18  Newport Creek and Marshall Creek (Aug. 2001 monitoring, DNR Resource Assessment Service)18  Sinepuxent Bay (DNR Fisheries Service, sampling typically below a depth of 4 feet)18 3. Biological Oxygen Demand 7 Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) is a measure of oxygen consumption associated with living matter including algae, bacteria, plants and animals. BOD at various levels occurs naturally in water bodies and is only considered a problem if it causes problems such as violation of the 5.0 mg/l dissolved oxygen standard. In most areas of Newport Bay system, low dissolved oxygen problems can be traced to algal activity and nutrients that feed the algae. However, 1998 monitoring of Kitts Branch found occasional low dissolved oxygen that was not accompanied by high algal activity. This suggests that BOD may be the cause.  12   4. Nitrogen In Tidal Waters 7 Excessive livels of nitrogen was Newport Bay detected in1998 monitoring of the T otal Nitrogen Loads Newport Bay mainstem and Ayer and Newport Creeks at sites shown on Map 4 Agriculture Monitoring Water Quality. 30% Forest 38% Modeling analysis conducted by MDE to support their TMDL work Urban determined that nitrogen is the limiting Atmosphere nutrient in tidal waters of the Newport Bay Groundwater system. This means that controlling 12% Point Sources nitrogen loads affecting tidal waters can 7% 9% 4% effectively limit algae growth. The relative sources of nutrient loads to Newport Bay are shown in the adjacent pie charts adapted from MDE's TMDL report for Newport Bay. For total nitrogen, about two-thirds comes from point sources and agricultural lands based on MDE's estimates. Less than one-fifth of the nitrogen load comes from sources that are not locally controllable (groundwater and atmospheric deposition). Overall, these estimates suggest that control of locally generated nitrogen loads would reduce the total nitrogen load reaching Newport Bay. 5. Nitrogen in Nontidal Streams 20 The United States Geological Survey (USGS) measured stream base flow and water quality in 17 nontidal streams discharging to Chincoteague, Newport and Sinepuxent Bays during the winters of 1999 and 2000. Map 4 Monitoring Water Quality shows the USGS monitoring sites that were within the WRAS project area. USGS reports that the average stream base flow nitrate concentration for nontidal streams flowing into Maryland's Coastal Bays south of Berlin is 1.75 milligrams per liter (mg/l). Previously, nitrate concentration in this area was assumed be 0.72 mg/l. They also indicate that the majority of their samples found nitrate concentrations higher than natural levels for stream base flow in this area which is 0.4 mg/l or less. This finding indicates that the nonpoint contribution of nitrate to the Coastal Bays may be more significant than previously believed. USGS also reports that base flow nitrate concentrations in streams ranged from below 0.5 to 5.28 mg/l as nitrogen. They found a significant positive correlation between the percentage of watershed area used for row crops and nitrate concentration. This finding indicates the nitrogen management for row crops is a significant contributor of nitrogen to the Coastal Bays. 6. Nitrogen in Groundwater US Geological Survey (USGS) reports that the dominant nutrients in groundwater for the Chincoteague Bay and Sinepuxent Bay vicinities are dissolved ammonia and dissolved nitrate. The highest ammonia concentrations, up to 23.4 mg/l as nitrogen, were associated with anoxic groundwater, i.e. well water with little or no dissolved oxygen. The highest nitrate concentrations, up to 15.5 mg/l, were associated oxic groundwater, i.e. well water that also contained dissolved oxygen. Nitrate concentrations ranged as low as 0.05 mg/l. These findings 13   came from monitoring of 28 wells during the winters of 1999 and 2000. The wells were drilled into the surficial aquifer and the underlying confining layer so that water level and water quality measurements could be taken at different depths. 20 USGS also sampled 388 wells in the Maryland Coastal Bays watershed to help map the distribution of groundwater nitrate concentration. Throughout most of the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds, nitrate concentrations less than 1.0 mg/l were prevalent. However, several areas exhibited significantly higher nitrate concentrations. For example, nitrate concentrations in the 5.01 mg/l to 8.00 mg/l range characterized the area bounded by the tidal portion of Ayer Creek west, Newport Creek on the south and Sinepuxent Bay on the east. 7. Phosphorus The 1998 monitoring described above was also the basis for assessing total phosphorus. As shown in the pie chart, phosphorus from agricultural lands and point sources Newport Bay dominate loads to Newport Bay according T otal Phosphorus Loads to MDE's estimates. Groundwater and atmospheric deposition, which are Agriculture represented by ""0%"" labels on the pie 20% chart, are not significant sources of Forest phosphorus in the Newport Bay Urban watershed. Based on this assessment, 0% Atmosphere 67% essentially all sources of phosphorus are 0% Groundwater locally controllable. 5%  Point Sources  8% 8. Salinty Based on monitoring in Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay in 2001 and 2002 during a study of macroalgae, the range of salinity in the two bays is similar, varying from about 27 parts per thousand (ppt) to 34 ppt.19  14   Sources of Pollution Since European settlement of North America there has been an explosive growth in human population, supported by more intensive agriculture and the growth of industry. The entire continent has become mutually interdependent by employing vast transportation systems. All of this contributes to the decline in quality of our water and other natural resources. 1. Point Sources Discharges from pipes or other ""discrete conveyances"" are called ""point sources."" Point sources may contribute pollution to surface water or to groundwater. For example, wastewater treatment discharges may contribute nutrients or microbes that consume oxygen (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)) reducing oxygen available for other aquatic life. Industrial point sources may contribute various forms of pollution. Some understanding of point source discharges in a watershed can be useful in helping to identify and prioritize potential restoration measures. The information from the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) permit data base for the Sinepuxent Bay and Newport Bay watershed is presented in two forms  MDE Discharge Permits Summary Table and  Map 5 MDE Discharge Permits:  The Sinepuxent Bay watershed has seven surface water discharges and three groundwater discharges. Only one of these, the Visitors Center at the Assateague National Seashore, may contribute significant nutrients to the Bay. The groundwater discharges all involve land application of treated sewage affluent.  The Newport Bay watershed has 13 surface water discharges. The two most significant contributors of nitrogen to the Newport Bay system are the Berlin Wastewater Treatment Plant and Tyson Foods, Inc. Two lesser contributors are Kelly Foods, Inc. and the Newark Wastewater Treatment Plant. These four facilities may be affected by implementation of the nitrogen TMDLs in the Newport Bay watershed. The other nine surface water discharges in the watershed are not significant sources of nutrients.7  Kitts Branch, where BOD was addressed in the TMDL, receives effluent from several significant point source dischargers. Of these, Tyson Foods, Inc. is the greatest. A lesser point source of BOD is Kelly Foods, Inc. During cold-weather months, the Berlin Wastewater Treatment Plant, which discharges to Bottle Branch/Kitts Branch only during the months of November through March, is the second greatest point source of BOD. Characteristics of these permitted discharges (volume, temperature, pollutants, etc.) are tracked by MDE through the permit system. Most of this information is accessible to the public and can be obtained from MDE.  15   MDE Discharge Permits Summary Table  Page 1 of 3 Sinepuxent Bay Watershed  All Permitted Discharges (2/2003 data) Type / MDE Category Surface Water Discharge Water Treatment Sewage Effluent Industrial Gen.

Diffuse or Nonpoint Sources Sources of pollution that include areas of land and other sources that do not have a specific point of origin are called nonpoint sources. Nonpoint sources are commonly significant contributors of pollutants, particularly nutrients and sediment. These diffuse sources include rain water that runs off roofs, streets and parking lots (sometimes via storm drains) into nearby surface waters, as well as run-off from farm fields and, to a much lesser extent, forests. Also included in nonpoint source pollution is deposition from the atmosphere and contributions from ground water, where septic systems are a factor. A. Nutrients According to the November 2002 TMDL report for Newport Bay, nonpoint source (NPS) nutrients, particularly nitrogen, are significant contributors to the use impairments in the Newport Bay system. On average for Newport Bay, 49% of the total nitrogen load arises from nonpoint sources (urban, residential and agricultural lands) and 80% of the total phosphorus load arises from nonpoint sources. However, the relative importance of nonpoint source nutrient loads varies significantly among subwatersheds of the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay area. For nitrogen, the Newport Bay watershed is dominated by nonpoint sources in all subwatersheds except Kitts Branch which has significant point source nitrogen loads. Phosphorus loads in all Newport Bay subwatersheds are entirely are nonpoint sources except Kitts Branch which has significant point source nutrient loads. B. Shoreline Erosion Wherever land and open water meet, change in the form of erosion or accretion of land is the inevitable result of natural processes. Human activity in these areas often interferes with these natural processes by attempting to control movement of water and/or loss of land. Erosion 18   of shorelines can contribute significant amounts of nutrients (mostly phosphorus) and sediment (water column turbidity, habitat loss). Countywide shoreline erosion is summarized in the following table. These figures group together shoreline for both the Coastal Bays and the Chesapeake Bay drainage. 8 Worcester County Shore Erosion Rate Summary (Miles of Shoreline) Total Shoreline Total Eroding Shoreline 919 (32%) Erosion Rate 0 to 2 feet / year 74 2 to 4 feet / year 26 4 or more feet / year 10  407  Maps of historic shoreline change were produced in 1999 by the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) in a cooperative effort between DNR and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These maps included digitized shorelines for several different years in Worcester County. The maps show that extensive changes have occurred adjacent to large bodies of open water. Copies of these 1:24000 scale maps are available from the MGS. Currently, DNR is working to improve our ability to predict and address areas of high-rate shoreline erosion. In addition to considering historic erosion rates, contributory effects of land subsidence and sea level rise are being considered. To help generate predictive tools, two pilot areas have been selected: St. Mary's County and Dorchester County. Results from this work are not currently available.  19   Groundwater and Water Supply Groundwater is the source of nearly all water used for agriculture and business, and all potable water in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. In general, these water uses do not employ near-surface groundwater, which is subject to potential local pollution sources. Additionally, near surface groundwater is credited with carrying nutrients, particularly nitrogen, from land source to surface waters where nutrient over-enrichment is occurring. Groundwater is the source of all potable water for all community systems in the WRAS project area. As shown on Map 6 Community Water Systems, several public water supply systems are located in the Newport Bay watershed and none are located in the Sinepuxent Bay watershed. Permit information is summarized in the table below.

In an effort to gauge the affects of land use on water quality, and to allow comparison between watersheds, DNR has developed a series of Landscape Indicators. These indicators can be used to portray landscape conditions on a watershed scale that either tend to support good water quality or that tend to degrade water quality. Landscape Indicators The 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan included a unified watershed assessment that used a number of landscape indicators to assess the State's 138 watersheds.2 Most indicators are relative measures by which Maryland's watersheds can be compared. The following sections identify the findings for the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds from the 1998 Plan, with the exception of the Year 2000 population density estimates. Summary of Coastal Bays Landscape Indicators Watershed Population Density (people/acre) 0.65 0.57 0.25 0.22 0.03 Wetland Loss (acre) 3,531 16,129 2,662 17,025 28,820 Unbuffered Streams (percent) 61 44 79 25 26 Soil Erodibility (value/acre) 0.13 0.23 0.13 0.08 0.13  Assawoman Bay Isle of Wight Bay Sinepuxent Bay Newport Bay Chincoteague Bay  Color Key: Green- benchmark met, conditions better than some other comparable watersheds. Orange- benchmark not met, condition is poorer than many other comparable watersheds. 1. Population Density The Year 2000 population density in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds was 0.22 and 0.25 people per acre of land respectively. A comparison with other watersheds in Maryland has not been completed using the 2000 census data.2 While population density may be beyond the scope of a WRAS, directing growth is a potential WRAS component. As human population increases, the effects of human activity that degrades, displaces, or eliminates natural habitat also tend to increase. Watersheds with higher populations, assuming other factors are equal, tend to exhibit greater impacts on waterways and habitat. However, growth can be directed in ways to reduce negative impacts.  21   2. Historic Wetland Loss The Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds are estimated to have lost about 2,662 and 17,025 acres of wetlands, respectively, over the years.2 This interpretation is based on the assumption that the hydric soils in the watershed were all, at one time, wetlands. Thoughtful selective restoration of historic wetland areas can be an effective WRAS component. In most of Maryland's watersheds, extensive wetland areas have been converted to other uses by draining and filling. This conversion unavoidably reduces or eliminates the natural functions that wetlands provide. 3. Unbuffered Streams Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds differ significantly on the extent of unbuffered streams, 79% and 25% respectively based on 1998 information. To develop this indicator, the presence or absence of forest cover adjacent to streams in corridors 100 feet wide (50 feet either side of the stream) was assessed. The estimate of streams lacking forested buffer was generated for the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan by using Maryland Department of State Planning GIS data for streams and for 1994 land use.2 In most of Maryland, trees are key to healthy natural streams. They provide numerous essential habitat functions: shade to keep water temperatures down in warm months, leaf litter ""food"" for aquatic organisms, roots to stabilize stream banks, vegetative cover for wildlife, etc. In general, reduction or loss of riparian trees in stream buffers degrades stream habitat while replacement of trees to create natural stream buffers enhances stream habitat. For this indicator, only streams that are shown on USGS Quadrangle maps are addressed. 4. Soil Erodibility Soil erodibility for Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds are both in the range of very low erosion potential as measured by the K factor: 0.13 and 0.08 respectively.2 The K factor normally varies from approximately zero to about 0.6. A K value of 0.17 has a very low erosion potential, a value of 0.32 has a moderate erosion potential, a value of 0.37 has a high erosion potential, and a value of 0.43 has a very high erosion potential. Watersheds with more highly erodible soils are naturally more susceptible to surface erosion, sedimentation, streambank erosion and other problems related to soil movement. These negative effects of soil erodibility on water quality can be minimized through careful management. The soil erodibility indicator accounts for natural soil conditions but not for management of the land. Existing cropland management was not considered. The naturally erodible soils in the watershed are addressed by techniques called Best Management Practices (BMPs) to prevent soil loss, practices that are typically in use on local farms. BMPs like no-till or reduced till cropping, planting cover crops, field strips, or retiring erodible soils from production can significantly reduce erosion and sediment movement. These BMPs can be seen in use in many places in the watershed. Because soils can vary significantly within very small areas, a generalized erodibility indicator must be used with caution and supplemented with site-specific evaluation prior to implementing any management action.  22   Land Use The table Land Use / Land Sinepuxent Bay Watershed Cover and pie charts summarize 2000 data for the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds as Agriculture (11.34%) Developed (21.91%) categorized by the Maryland Department of Planning.

Wetlands (23.31%) In general, the forest and brush cover the greatest percentage of land in Other (12.07%) both the Newport Bay watershed and the Sinepuxent Bay watershed. Viewing these general land use categories as potential nonpoint sources of nutrients, agricultural lands are likely to contribute the greatest loads to local waterways. Urban lands may also contribute significant nutrient loads.  2000 Land Use  2000 Land Use Newport Bay Watershed Developed (10.99%) Wetlands (11.86%) Other (0.58%) Agriculture (33.93%)  Forest (42.63%)  23   Land Use / Land Cover Summary Table In Sinepuxent Bay Watershed and Newport Bay's Subwatersheds MDP 2000 Data, Acres / Percent Subwatershed Name / Number Sinepuxent Bay Trappe Creek Headwaters Newport Bay Ayer Creek & Trappe Creek Newport and Porter Creeks Marshall Creek Newport Bay Total Ag 851 11% 1,262 33% 2,550 37% 3,523 33% 1,905 34% 9,240 Forest & Brush 2,354 32% 1,355 33% 3,164 46% 4,277 40% 2,813 51% 11,609 Developed 1644 22% 1,425 34% 386 6% 989 9% 192 3% 2,992 Wetland 1,749 23% 6 -774 11% 1,763 17% 687 12% 3,230 Other Land 906 12% 75 -3 -80 1% --158 Total Land 7,504 4,123 6,877 10,632 5,597 27,229  Impervious Surface Roads, parking areas, roofs and other human constructions are collectively called impervious surface. Impervious surface blocks the natural seepage of rain into the ground. Unlike many natural surfaces, impervious surface typically concentrates stormwater runoff, accelerates flow rates and directs stormwater to the nearest stream. Watersheds with small amounts of impervious surface tend to have better water quality in local streams than watersheds with greater amounts of impervious surface. Urbanization and the increase in impervious surfaces that accompanies development can significantly impact stream health. Increases in the extent of upstream impervious surface are strongly associated with a decrease in stream quality. As impervious surfaces cover more of the landscape, less water infiltrates the soil and more water enters stream systems through runoff or stormwater discharge. This increased stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces contributes to stream quality degradation by introducing more nonpoint source pollution, higher temperatures, reduced stream baseflow and more erosive flood flow. Map 8 Impervious Surface Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay Watersheds and the table below reflects data developed by the University of Maryland's Regional Earth Sciences Application Center (RESAC).10 The map shows relative average impervious cover for each subwatershed and it shows local concentrations of impervious coverage as darker areas. The map shows that the subwatersheds closest to Route 50 have the highest average impervious cover (Sinepuxent Bay, Trappe Creek Headwaters, Ayer and Trappe Creeks). The subwatersheds south of Berlin have very low average impervious surface. 24   Map 9 Impervious Cover Town of Berlin Vicinity shows the distribution of impervious surface around the most developed portion of the Newport Bay watershed. At this scale, it is possible to see that the majority of the area has little impervious surface. However, concentrations of impervious cover in and around Berlin and adjacent to major roads may have significant affect on local waterways. The findings presented in the maps suggest potential directions for watershed management activities:  Large areas of the WRAS project watershed probably have very little impact from impervious surfaces. These areas could be prioritized for controls on new impervious surface or other forms of protection. In these areas, if any restoration action is needed, relatively limited restoration projects may be able to eliminate impacts associated with impervious surfaces.  Limited areas near Berlin and major roads, where impervious surface is concentrated, could be prioritized for protects like stormwater infiltration retrofits.

These thresholds are based on extensive biological monitoring conducted by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey:9 Upstream Impervious Cover Thresholds Percent Less Than 2 Above 2 Above 15 Above 25 Affects on Stream Quality Imperviousness is relatively insignificant compared to other factors affecting habitat quality. In cold-water habitats, brook trout may be found. Negative impacts to stream health begin. Brook trout are never found in streams with watershed imperviousness above this threshold. Stream health is never rated good, based on a combined fish and benthic macroinvertebrate Index of Biotic Integrity. Only hardy, pollution-tolerant reptiles and amphibians can thrive, while more pollution-sensitive species are eliminated.  25   Lands With Significant Natural Resource Value and Large Area 1. Green Infrastructure DNR has mapped a network of ecologically important lands, comprised of hubs and linking corridors, using several GIS data layers to identify hubs that contain one or more of the following: - areas containing sensitive plant or animal species; - large blocks of contiguous interior forest (at least 250 contiguous acres, plus the 300 foot transition zone); - wetland complexes with at least 250 acres of unmodified wetlands; - streams or rivers with aquatic species of concern, rare coldwater or blackwater ecosystems, or important to anadromous fish, and their associated riparian forest and wetlands; and - conservation areas already protected by public (primarily DNR or the federal government) and private organizations like The Nature Conservancy or Maryland Ornithological Society. This ""Green Infrastructure"" provides the bulk of the state's natural support system. Ecosystem services, such as cleaning the air, filtering and cooling water, storing and cycling nutrients, conserving and generating soils, pollinating crops and other plants, regulating climate, protecting areas against storm and flood damage, and maintaining hydrologic function. For more information on the Green Infrastructure identification project in Maryland, see http://www.dnr.state.md.us/greenways/gi/gi.html Protection of Green Infrastructure lands may be addressed through various existing programs including Rural Legacy, Program Open Space, conservation easements and others. Map 10 Green Infrastructure shows that, even from the statewide perspective that guided the analysis, there is a significant amount of Green Infrastructure in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds:  Numerous Green Infrastructure hubs are in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds.  Assateague Island is the only Green Infrastructure hub where natural resource values are protected. Other Green Infrastructure hubs are not protected. 2. Large Forest Blocks Large blocks of forest provide habitat for species that are specialized for conditions with relatively little influence by species from open areas or humans. For example, forest interior dwelling birds require forest interior habitat for their survival and they cannot tolerate much human presence. Map 11 Forest Interior shows blocks of contiguous forest that are at least 50 acres in size with at least 10 acres of forest interior (forest edge is at least 300 feet away) that may be important locally within the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. This size threshold was chosen to help ensure that the forest interior is large enough to likely provide locally significant habitat for sensitive forest interior dwelling species. The assessment shown in Map 11 differs from the Green Infrastructure assessment which considered only large blocks of forest land cover at least 250 acres in size that are likely to have state or regional importance.  26   Protected Lands For purposes of watershed restoration, a knowledge of existing protected lands and likely areas for new development can provide a starting point in prioritizing potential restoration activities. In some cases, protected lands may provide opportunities for restoration projects because owners of these lands may value natural resource protection or enhancement goals. As used in the context of watershed restoration, ""protected land"" is any land with some form of long term limitation on conversion to developed land use. This protection may be in various forms: public ownership for natural resource or low impact recreational uses or, private ownership where a third party acquired the development rights or limits use through an easement. The extent of ""protection"" varies greatly from one circumstance to the next. Therefore, for some protected land, it may be necessary to explore the details of land protection parcel by parcel through the local land records office to determine the true extent of protection.

Interpreting Local Conditions with Natural Soil Groups Soil conditions like soil type and moisture conditions greatly affect how land may be used and the potential for vegetation and habitat on the land. Soil conditions are one determining factor for water quality in streams and rivers. Map 13 Soils shows soil variation in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. The table and pie chart summarized information from the map.

Soils and Watershed Planning Local soil conditions can be a useful element in watershed planning and for targeting restoration projects. Soils with limitations like wetness or slope naturally inhibit active use for farming or development and may then be available as restoration project sites. By comparing Map13 Soils with the three preceding maps listed below, it may be possible to discern how patterns of active or passive land use relate to soil conditions:  Map 7 Land Use / Land Cover  Map 10 Green Infrastructure Natural Soils Groups and other soils assessments can be used to help identify potential areas for restoration projects or habitat protection. Hydric soils, for example, are more easily restored as wetlands than soils that were never saturated with water. Once areas of interest are targeted and landowner interest is verified, additional detailed soil assessment is an essential step in identifying viable restoration project sites. Floodplains And Low Elevation Areas Subject To Sea Level Rise The average rate of sea level rise along Maryland's coastline has been 3-4 mm/yr or approximately one foot per century. Such rates are nearly twice those of the global average (1.8 mm/yr), a result most likely influenced from land subsidence. The rate of sea level rise is expected to accelerate in response to global warming, resulting in a rise of 2-3 feet by the year 2100. The low-lying coastal plains such as those along the eastern shore are vulnerable to impacts associate with rising sea level. Sea level rise threatens to exacerbate erosion and flooding, making areas more vulnerable to land loss, permanent inundation, and storm surge. Recognizing the need for advanced planning, the Department of Natural Resources developed a response strategy in 2000 and has been aggressively acquiring high-resolution elevation data (LIDAR) in the most vulnerable areas. Complete coverage of Worcester County including the Sinepuxent and Newport Bay has been acquired as select areas were defined as being less than 1.5 meters (5 feet) above sea level. Accurate elevation data will significantly improve the State and County's ability to define the most vulnerable areas and determine the most appropriate management measures to mitigate the impacts. Map 14 Floodplains shows the 100-year floodplain extending over a majority of the land near open water in the Sinepuxent Bay and Newport Bay. Small areas of floodplain also occur along the tributaries to Trappe Creek in the vicinity of the Town of Berlin. As sea level rises and land development increases, the 100-year floodplain is likely to expand putting more infrastructure and resources at risk from permanent inundation and flooding.  29   Wetlands 1. Wetland Categories The Coastal Plain Province has the highest diversity of emergent estuarine and palustrine (fresh water) wetland communities relative to other Maryland physiographic regions because both tidal and nontidal freshwater marshes occur here. Wetlands are most abundant in the Coastal Plain due to the low topographic relief and high ground water table characteristic of the region. Estuarine Wetlands. Estuarine wetlands are abundant throughout the Coastal Plain. These systems consist of salt and brackish tidal waters and contiguous wetlands where ocean water is at least occasionally diluted by freshwater runoff from the land. These wetlands may extend far upstream in tidal rivers to freshwater areas. Differences in salinity and tidal flooding within estuaries have a significant effect on the distribution of these wetland systems. Salt marshes occur on the intertidal shores of tidal waters in areas of high salinity. Brackish marshes are the predominant estuarine wetland type in Maryland. They are found along the shores of Chesapeake Bay, mostly on the Eastern Shore, and for considerable distance upstream in coastal rivers. Estuarine shrub swamps are common along the Maryland coastal zone. Aquatic beds, comprised mostly of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), were historically abundant in shallow water zones of Maryland's estuaries, especially Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Palustrine wetlands. These are freshwater wetlands that are not associated with streams or lakes. In general, palustrine wetlands are associated with freshwater, high water tables or intermittent ponding on land. Forested wetlands are the most abundant and widely distributed palustrine wetland type on the Coastal Plain. These wetlands are found on floodplains along the freshwater tidal and nontidal portions of rivers and streams, in upland depressions, and in broad flat areas between otherwise distinct watersheds. Tidal freshwater swamps occur along coastal rivers in areas subject to tidal influence. Scrub-shrub swamps are represented in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. Emergent wetlands on the Coastal Plain are characterized by a wide range of vegetation, depending on water regime. (Adapted from Wetlands of Maryland, Tiner and Burke, 1995.) 2. Tracking Wetlands Oversight of activities affecting wetlands involves several regulatory jurisdictions. The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) is the lead agency for the State and cooperates with DNR, the Army Corps of Engineers and other Federal and local agencies. As part of its responsibility, MDE tracks State permitting and the net gain or loss of wetlands over time. As the table Tracking Nontidal Wetland Change shows, the State regulatory program has measured a small net increase of wetland acreage in the Sinepuxent Bay watershed over the past 11 years. A small net decrease occurred in the Newport Bay watershed. This slowing of wetland loss in the watershed contrasts significantly with the estimated historic wetland loss in the watershed as described in the Landscape Indicators section.  30   Tracking Nontidal Wetland Change In The Newport Bay/Sinepuxent Bay Watersheds In Acres 1/1/1991 through 12/31/2002 11 Basin Code 02130104 Watershed Sinepuxent Bay Permanent Impacts -3.67 Permittee Mitigation 3.11 Programmatic Gains 3.00 Other Gains 0.09 Net 2.53  02130105 Newport Bay -4.80 3.45 0.50 0.80 -0.05 Notes: 1) Regulatory tracking for authorized nontidal wetland losses began in 1991.

Interpreting Wetland Distribution Map 15 Wetlands and the table below summarize distribution and categories of wetlands in the WRAS area. In the Newport Bay watershed, 94% of wetlands are emergent estuarine or forested palustrine. The Sinepuxent Bay watershed is dominated by three wetland types: estuarine emergent 43%, unconsolidated shore (beach) 40% and forested palustrine 11%.

The information summarized here suggests that some of the significant stresses on living resources in the watershed are alteration and destruction of habitat, excessive movement of sediment and excessive availability of nutrients. The living resource information summarized here should be considered a partial representation, because numerous areas of potential interest or concern could not be included due to lack of information, time, etc. For example, information on many forms of aquatic life, woodland communities, terrestrial habitats, etc. should be considered as watershed restoration decisions are being made. Therefore, it is recommended that stakeholders in the watershed identify important living resource issues or priorities so that additional effort can be focused where it is most needed. New information should be added or referenced as it becomes available. Living Resource Indicators  Aquatic organisms are sensitive, in varying degrees, to changes in water quality and aquatic habitat. They are also sensitive Indicator Name Finding to landscape changes. This association Nontidal Benthic Index 3.2 offers two perspectives that are important for watershed restoration. First, Only one Living Resource Indicator was improvements for living resources offer developed for the Newport Bay watershed in the potential goals, objectives and opportunities Maryland Clean Water Action Plan's Unified to gauge progress in watershed restoration.

For used to gauge local conditions for water comparison with similar Maryland watersheds, quality, habitat, etc. This second the benchmark for this indicator was not met. perspective is the basis for using living resources as an ""indicator."" The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan's Unified Watershed Assessment, published in 1998, included a number of living resource indicator for the Newport Bay watershed.2 Several of these indicators rely on extrapolations from a limited number of sampling sites, which were then generalized to represent entire watersheds. Some indicators represent indices comprising several conditions. Considering this limitation on field data, it would be beneficial to conduct additional assessments to provide a more complete understanding of local conditions.  Living Resource Indicator Summary Newport Bay Watershed From: 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment  32   1. Nontidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity With an IBI score of 3.2, the Newport Bay watershed does not meet the benchmark set for the Nontidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI). The nontidal benthic IBI looks at the insects and other invertebrates, like crayfish, living on the bottoms of streams, considering the overall community composition, the number and diversity of species and the presence of sensitive species. To calculate the benthic IBI, for the Unified Watershed Assessment, reference conditions were established for minimally-impacted streams. IBI values are relative to conditions in these minimally-impacted streams. An index of 6.0 or less means that restoration is recommended and an index of 8.0 or higher means that protection is recommended. Fish and Oysters Fish in Kitts Branch  MBSS 2001 Data 1. Fish In Nontidal Streams Information on fish in nontidal streams has been gathered as part of the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) for one stream in the Newport Bay watershed. The table shows that all the fish species identified are either tolerant or moderately tolerant of pollution and/or poor habitat conditions. The ranking of pollution tolerance is taken from work associated with MBSS.15 Tolerant Species Fish that tend to survive greater pollution and poorer habitat conditions American Eel Bluegill* Eastern Mudminnow Moderately Tolerant Species Fish with mid-range ability to co-exist with pollution and varied habitat conditions Banded Killfish Inland Silverside Largemouth Bass* Mosquitofish  Pumpkinseed 2.

Yates conducted between 1906 and 1912. As shown on Map 16 MBSS Sampling Sites and Oyster Status, about half of one 129-acre historic oyster bed was located within Newport Bay as it is currently delineated.17 Currently, no legally designated oyster beds are located in Maryland's Coastal Bays, including Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay. Oyster lease areas are currently located in the Assawoman Bay, Sinepuxent Bay and Chincoteague Bay. The only oyster lease in the WRAS area, in Sinepuxent Bay, covers about 1.5 acres as shown on Map 16 MBSS Sampling Sites and Oyster Status.  33   3. Tidal Fisheries Immediately available information on tidal fisheries does not segregate data on Newport Bay or Sinepuxent Bay. However, the following information that represents all of Maryland's Coastal Bays can be used as a frame of reference for the WRAS project area:  Blue crabs comprise the most valuable commercial fishery product from Maryland's Coastal Bays. Due to high salinity in these bays, blue crabs are relatively small compared to their Chesapeake Bay counterparts. According to DNR trawl survey results, only 5% of the blue crabs inspected are greater than five inches across while 21% of Chesapeake Bay blue crabs are over five inches. 23  In 2002 surveys conducted by DNR, 80 species of fish were identified. In the prior 30 years of surveys, an additional 50 species have also been identified. Twenty of the species identified in 2002 included juveniles. The Coastal Bays serve as important nursery areas for these species. 23  Four fish species are highly abundant in Maryland's Coastal Bays: Atlantic menhaden, Atlantic silverside, spot and bay anchovy. These fish are important forage for other fish species that are valued for commercial and recreational purposes. 23  Adults of many fish species are seasonally common in Maryland's Coastal Bays: summer and winter flounder, weakfish, bluefish, croaker, white perch, spot, black sea bass, tautog, eel and sharks.24  Recreational catches for some fish species are significant: summer flounder, weakfish, bluefish, croaker, tautog, striped bass and black sea bass.24  Some of the important fish species in Maryland's Coastal Bays have declined in population over time. This has necessitated management the affects to address the decline:25  Between the early 1970s and 1999, a coastal bay forage index based on Atlantic menhaden, spot, bay anchovy and Atlantic silverside has shown a gradual decline.  Summer flounder has strict harvest controls that were set after severe declines in the late 1980s. Increases in recruitment are evident based on presence of coastal bay juveniles and increasing average size in the offshore population.  Atlantic croaker has exhibited variable population size that may be associated with weather conditions and harvest rate. Stocks are showing consistent improvement which is attributed to current restrictions and bycatch reduction devices in commercial nets.  Spot have declined substantially since the late 1980s. The causes of this change is not understood. Spot is valuable for both commercial and recreational interests and as a forage species for game fish.  Bluefish was a major sportfish as late as 1989 but has exhibited substantial decline since that time.  Black sea bass is at a low biomass level and is believed to be over-exploited. In the late 1990s, the average size in the population increased which suggests the potential for a trend toward recovery.  34   Benthic Macroinvertebrates In Nontidal Streams During the past 25 years, DNR has conducted biological assessment of selected stream sites in the Newport Bay watershed using three different methods. Map 16 MBSS Sampling Sites and Oyster Status shows sampling sites were data is available. The Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) samples stream conditions for fish, benthic population and habitat conditions. Rresults from this sampling are summarized in the table below. Prior to creation of the MBSS method of assessment and random site selection technique, DNR used other biological assessment approaches in nontidal steams known as artificial substrate samplers and rapid bio-assessment. While results of this assessment is not directly comparable to the current day MBSS data, it does provide a way to compare stream conditions during the early 1990s. Information from these efforts is summarized in the text that follows. 2001 MBSS Findings in the Newport Bay Watershed Score Location Kitts Branch Bassett Creek / Tukesburg Branch Station # NEWP-116-R-2001 NEWP-110-R-2001 Fish 3.0 -Benthos 2.71 1.29 Physical ---  Key for MBSS Findings Table Index of Biotic Integrity Fish Benthic Physical Habitat Ranges for Index 1.0 (worst) to 5.0 (best) 1.0 (worst) to 5.0 (best) 0 (worst) to 100 (best) Very Poor 1.0 - 1.9 1.0 - 1.9 0 - 11.9 Poor 2.0 - 2.9 2.0 - 2.9 12 - 41.9 Fair 3.0 - 3.9 3.0 - 3.9 42 - 71.9 Good 4.0 - 5.0 4.0 - 5.0 72 - 100  * Additional details are available at http://www.dnr.state.md.us/streams/mbss/index.html  Click on ""Search Online Data"" (button on left); Enter ""Newport Bay"" or ""Sinepuxent Bay"" in dialog box for ""8 Digit watershed name""; click on search.  35   1. Bottle Branch at Harrison Road In 1994 and 1996, sampling of benthic macroinvertebrates in Bottle Branch at Harrison Road was conducted using the rapid bioassessment technique. The following ratings summarize the findings:  Benthic community quality  poor  Habitat quality  poor  Water quality  fair Since 1978, DNR has sampled macroinvertebrates in Bottle Branch at the Harrison Road crossing using artificial substrate samplers. Assessment of the benthic community shows a significant improvement in species diversity and a shift in species type, which together indicate that conditions have improved at this site over the past 25 years. Most of the improvement has occurred since 1997. The data shows that there was a significant correlation between time and biotic index and taxa number, with both improving. The taxa number is the total number of genera found at the site at the time of sampling. It reflects the health of the community but a direct measure of the types of organisms and the number will increase with better water quality and better suitability for the organisms. The biotic index is used to detect organic pollution and its influence on the macroinvertebrate community. When it improves it means that there are more pollution intolerant organisms present and less pollution tolerant. The macroinvertebrate community showed that over the years the site has been sampled that the water quality went from the upper poor range to the lower fair range, which is considered a moderate improvement in the water quality. 2. Kitts Branch at Flower Road In 1990, 1994 and 1996, sampling of benthic macroinvertebrates in Kitts Branch at Flower Road was conducted using the rapid bioassessment technique. The following ratings summarize the findings. Comments listed with the data indicate that the stream channel was ditched and a discharge from poultry plant was evident:  Benthic community quality  poor  Habitat quality  poor  Water quality  poor  36   Why Look at Benthos in Streams? Unimpaired natural streams may support a great diversity of species like bacteria, algae, invertebrates like crayfish and insects to fish,birds, reptiles and mammals. All these groups of organisms have been extensively assessed relative to water quality and habitat quality. One group, benthic invertebrates, was found to serve as a good indicator of stream condition including water quality and habitat quality. Benthic invertegrates are sometimes called ""stream bugs"" though that name overly simplifies the diverse membership of this group. This group includes mayflies, caddisflies, crayfish, and other invertebrates, that inhabit the stream bottom, its sediments, organic debris and live on plant life (macrophytes) within the stream. Benthic macro-invertebrates are an important component of a stream's ecosystem. The food web in streams relies significantly on benthic organisms. Benthos are often the most abundant source of food for fish and other small animals. Many benthic macroinvertebrates live on decomposing leaves and other organic materials in the stream. By this activity, these organisms are significant processors of organic materials in the stream. Benthos often provide the primary means that nutrients from organic debris are transformed to other biologically usable forms. These nutrients become available again and are transported downstream where other organisms use them. Assessment of benthic organisms is a valuable tool for stream evaluation. This group of species has been extensively used in water quality assessment, in evaluating biological conditions of streams and in gauging influences on streams by surrounding lands. These organisms serve as good indicators of water resource integrity because they are fairly sedentary in nature and their diversity offers numerous ways to interpret conditions. They have different sensitivities to changing conditions. They have a wide range of functions in the stream. They use different life cycle strategies for survival.  37   Sensitive Species Sensitive species are generally recognized as being the plants or animals that are most at risk in regards to their ability to maintain healthy population levels. The most widely known are perhaps the State and Federally-listed Endangered or Threatened animals such as the bald eagle and Delmarva fox squirrel. In addition to charismatic animals such as these however, both the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Maryland DNR work through their respective Federal and State programs to protect a wide variety of declining non-game animals, rare plants, and the unique natural communities that support them. The table, Sensitive Species Tracked By Maryland in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay Watersheds, lists animals and plants of concern within the WRAS project area. For the purposes of watershed restoration, it is valuable to account for the known locations and areas of potential habitat for sensitive species in a given area. They are often indicators, and sometimes important constituents, of the network of natural areas which form the foundation for many essential natural watershed processes. In fact, in addition to conserving biodiversity in general, protecting these species and/or promoting expansion of their habitats can be an effective component for a watershed restoration program. DNR's Wildlife and Heritage Service identifies important areas for sensitive species conservation in different ways. The geographic delineations most commonly used are described in the text box Marylands Sensitive Species Conservation Areas. As shown in Map 17 Sensitive Species, three specific sensitive species overlays used by the State of Maryland are found in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. The purpose of utilizing these delineations is to help protect sensitive species by identifying the areas in which they are known to occur. Doing so allows DNR to work toward the conservation of these sensitive resources by evaluating potential impacts of proposed actions that may affect them. Specifically, working within an established procedural framework, the Wildlife and Heritage Service reviews projects and provides recommendations for activities falling within these overlays. The geographic areas covered by these overlays are designed to serve as coarse filters. To allow for uncertainty pertaining to interpretation discrepancies, the polygons used on the map to depict these locations have been buffered. Accurate on-the-ground information regarding species locations and habitat delineations for a specific area can be obtained from DNR's Natural Heritage Program. It is also important to note that outside of the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area, DNR generally only places requirements on projects requiring a permit/approval or those which are utilizing State funds. However, there are more broadly applied State and Federal laws and regulations which address ""takings"" of listed species. In addition, many counties have incorporated safeguards for areas associated with sensitive species into their project and permit review processes as well as adopting specific ordinances in some cases to protect them. In all instances, property owners are encouraged to seek advice on protecting the sensitive species and habitat within their ownership.  38   Sensitive Species Tracked By Maryland In The Newport Bay And Sinepuxent Bay Watersheds Scientific Name Animals Charadrius melodus Cicindela dorsalis media Haliaeetus leucocephalus Rynchops niger Sterna antillarum Plants Almus maritima Antennaria solitaria Asclepias rubra Carex silicea Cleistes divaricata Cyperus retrofractus Dryopteris celsa Eleocharis albida Eleocharis rostellata Fimbristylis caroliniana Fuirena pumila Gymnopogon brevifolius Ludwigia hirtella Panicum scabriusculum Polygonum glaucum Prunus maritima Scleria verticillata Sesuvium maritimum Spiranthes praecox Triglochin striata Common Name Piping plover White tiger beetle Bald eagle Black skimmer Least tern Seaside Alder Single-headed pussytoes Red milkweed Sea-beach sedge Spreading pogonia Rough cyperus Log fern White spikerush Beaked spikerush Carolina fimbry Smooth fuirena Broad-leaved beardgrass Hairy ludwigia Tall swamp panicgrass Seaside knotweed Beach plum Whorled nutrush Sea-purslane Grass-leaved ladys' tres Three-ribbed arrow-grass Status Md.

Each ESA contains one or more sensitive species habitats. However, the entire ESA is not considered sensitive habitat. The ESA is an envelope identified for review purposes to help ensure that applications for permit or approval in or near sensitive areas receive adequate attention and safeguards for the sensitive species / habitat they contain. Natural Heritage Area (NHA) As shown in Map 17 Sensitive Species, one NHA is located in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. It covers the entire Assateague Island National Seashore. In general, NHAs have been designated as such because they represent rare ecological communities. These are areas which provide important sensitive species habitat. They are designated in State regulation (COMAR 08.03.08.10) and are afforded specific protections in the Critical Area Law criteria. For proposed projects that could potentially affect a particular NHA, recommendations and/or requirements may be put in place during the permit or approval process. These would be specifically aimed at protecting the ecological integrity of the NHA itself. To help ensure that proposed projects which may affect a given NHA are adequately reviewed, an ESA is always designated to encompass each NHA and the area surrounding it. Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) As shown on Map 17 Sensitive Species, numerous WSSCs, totaling about 57 acres, are designated in the Newport Bay Watershed. These important and ecologically unique wetlands are mostly located between Bassett Creek and Porter Creek. There are no WSSCs in the Sinepuxent Bay watershed. These selected wetlands, which generally represent the best examples of Maryland's nontidal wetland habitats, are afforded additional protection in state law beyond the permitting requirements that apply to wetlands generally. The Maryland Department of the Environment may be contacted for more information regarding these regulations. To help ensure that proposed projects that may affect a WSSC are adequately reviewed, an EA is always designated to encompass each WSSC and the area surrounding it. For a listing of designated sites see COMAR 26.23.06.01 at www.dsd.state.md.us  40   Seaweed / Macroalgae Macroalgae, commonly called seaweed, are the simple aquatic plants that grow in shallow high salinity aquatic environments like the Coastal Bays. A two-year study beginning in 1998 was the first to characterize macroalgae in Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay. The random sampling technique used throughout the Coastal Bays of Maryland and Delaware, found that macroalgae are more abundant that previously suspected and that no significant difference in abundance among embayments was detected. A second study conducted in May, August and November 2001 and March 2002 assessed over 600 monitoring sites in Maryland's Coastal Bays returned several findings in the WRAS area:19  The objective of the study was to determine if there is a relationship between nutrient enrichment and the relative abundance of phytoplankton (associated with high nutrients), macroalgae (associated with mid-range nutrients) and SAV (associated with low nutrients). The study did not establish the presence or absence of a correlation. However, considering only the WRAS project area, its findings for Newport Bay (higher nurients and Chlorophyll a, less macroalgae and SAV) and Sinepuxent Bay (lower nutrients and Chlorophyll a, more macroalgae and SAV) are consistent with the hypothesis.  Red algae was the diverse group identified by the study. These algae are commercially grown as a source of ingredients for food, cosmetics and medicines. The most common group, known as red weeds (genera Agardhiella and Gracilaria), were well distributed throughout the bays in all season except for Newport Bay where their presence was limited to spring.  Green macroalgae was the second most diverse group found and sea lettuce (Ulva spp.) Was the most prevalent. It was generally distributed throughout the Coastal Bays and was most consistently found in Sinepuxent Bay and in embayments to its north. In Newport Bay, these macroalgae were consistently absent.  Brown algae was less diverse than the other two groups. Brown algae in some form was found in Sinepuxent Bay during all seasons but no genera was found year-round. In Newport Bay, brown algae is generally absent but appears in winter/spring in the south end of the bay.  41   Submerged Aquatic Vegetation The well-defined link between water quality and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) distribution/abundance make SAV communities good barometers of the health of estuarine ecosystems. SAV is not only important as an indicator of water quality, but it is also a critical nursery habitat for many estuarine species. For example, blue crab ""post-larvae"" are up to 30 times more abundant in SAV beds than in adjacent unvegetated areas. Additionally, several species of waterfowl depend on SAV for food when they over-winter in the Chesapeake region. In the 1930s, a disease nearly eliminated all SAV Acreage for Selected Years SAV in Maryland's Coastal Bays. Since about 1986, in general there has been a steady increase in area Year Newport Sinepuxent covered by SAV beds. For example SAV acreage increased from 2000 to 2001 in most Coastal Bay 1999 52 1,925 Areas. However, a few areas including Sinepuxent 1998 66 1,463 Bay experienced a decrease in SAV acreage from 2000 to 2001. Coverage in Sinepuxent Bay 1997 68 1,264 decreased approximately 2 percent from 2000 to a total of 1,654 acres in 2001.13 1996 19 1,058 The size of SAV beds in Sinepuxent Bay has 1995 23 718 been generally consistent with the Coastal Bayswide trend toward increasing acreage covered based 1989 0 425 on data collected since1989 as shown in the adjacent table. Map 18 Submerged Aquatic Vegetation also shows the difference in area covered in 1989 versus 1999. In Newport Bay, the adjacent table shows that SAV beds have covered a relatively small acreage and the trend toward increasing acreage is less pronounced. In general, SAV beds large enough to be identified via aerial photography have always been limited to the eastern bank of Newport Bay.

Some of these tools are described below. 2003 Stream Corridor Assessment Using the Stream Corridor Assessment Methodology (SCAM) developed and applied by the DNR Watershed Restoration Division, valuable information can be compiled to assist in targeting restoration activities. In partnership with Worcester County, DNR is conducting a Stream Corridor Assessment in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds during 2003. In this effort, trained teams from the Maryland Conservation Corps walk along streams to document potential problems and restoration opportunities associated with the issues listed in the table below: Stream Corridor Assessment Data Collection Categories Pipe Outfalls Pond Sites Tree Blockages Inadequate Buffers Erosion Fish Blockages Exposed Pipe Unusual Conditions Trash Dumping In- or Near-Stream Construction  A stream corridor assessment report will be generated, including maps and photographs, to support targeting decisions for restoration projects. The results of the stream corridor assessment will provide a valuable foundation for development of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. 2003 Synoptic Survey and Aquatic Community Assessment During 2003 DNR staff collected water quality samples in nontidal streams to supplement knowledge of local conditions. The water quality findings included in the report on this work can help identify problem areas and relative conditions among local streams based on measurements of dissolved oxygen, pH, nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen), conductivity and flow. The findings include nutrient loads at each sampling site and allow the ranking of subwatersheds based on the nutrient load estimates. For some of these nontidal stream sampling sites, DNR staff has also assessed fish and benthic organism populations. These assessments provide additional perspectives to gauge local water quality and habitat conditions. 43   Agricultural Conservation Programs Many farmers in Worcester County willingly implement management systems that address nutrient runoff and infiltration, erosion and sediment control, and animal waste utilization. Some of the best management practices identified in Soil Conservation and Water Quality Plans for implementation on individual farms include grassed waterways, riparian herbaceous and riparian forested buffers, conservation cover, cover crops, shallow water wildlife areas and grade stabilization structures. The Maryland Agricultural Cost-Share program (MACS), the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP and CREP) and the Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) are some of the state and federal programs promoted and administered by the Worcester SCD and Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS). 28 Marina Programs Discharges of sewage from boats are a concern for water quality because they contribute nutrients, biochemical oxygen demand, pathogens, etc. These discharges are preventable if a sufficient number of pumpout facilities are locally available and boat operators take advantage of these services. Boat maintenance and operation also can contribute petroleum and other noxious materials to the aquatic environment. According to DNR's Marina database, there are 24 marinas in Worcester County. One marina serves Newport Bay and four serve Sinepuxent Bay. Map 19 Marinas shows their approximate location. Curently, pumpout facilities are provided by one marina within the Sinepuxent Bay watershed and several marinas close to the WRAS project area. Two of the marinas in Worcester County currently participate in Maryland's Clean Marina Program but none of these are in the WRAS project area. The Clean Marinas Program is a way for marina owners to gain certification and public recognition for voluntarily undertaking a number of actions related to marina design, operation, and maintenance intended to properly manage all kinds of marine products and activities, and to reduce and properly manage waste. DNR also funds installation and maintenance of marine pumpout facilities, including those at certified Clean Marinas. Information is available at DNR's website, www.dnr.state.md.us/boating. Fish Blockage Identification Many fish species need to move from one stream segment to the next in order to maintain healthy, resilient populations. This is particularly true for anadromous fish species because they spawn and hatch from eggs in free flowing streams but live most of their lives in estuarine or ocean waters. Blockages in streams can inhibit or prevent many fish species from moving upstream to otherwise viable habitat. The 2003 Stream Corridor Assessment will be the first accounting of blockages to fish movement that may exist in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds.  44   Stream Buffer Restoration 1. Progress In the Coastal Bays Watersheds 22 As shown on Map 20 Stream Buffer Scenario, stream buffer plantings have occurred at no fewer than 10 project areas between 1996 and the end of 2001 in the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. Both the mapped information and the summary table below are drawn from a database maintained by the DNR Forest Service. Riparian Forest Buffer Creation Maryland Coastal Bays 1996 - 2001 Watershed Assawoman Isle of Wight Sinepuxent Newport Chincoteague Total Length (ft.) 8,300 7,198 5,412 14,880 78,925 114,715 Average Width (ft.) 120 161 210 126 160 -Area (acres) 22 30.9 20.5 46.4 246.5 366.3  2. Benefits and General Recommendations Natural vegetation in stream riparian zones, particularly forest, provides numerous valuable environmental benefits:  Reducing surface runoff  Preventing erosion and sediment movement  Using nutrients for vegetative growth and moderating nutrient entry into the stream  Moderating temperature, particularly reducing warm season water temperature  Providing organic material (decomposing leaves) that are the foundation of natural food webs in stream systems  Providing overhead and in-stream cover and habitat  Promoting high quality aquatic habitat and diverse populations of aquatic species. To realize these environmental benefits, DNR generally recommends that forested stream buffers be at least 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream. Therefore, DNR is promoting this type of stream buffer for local jurisdictions and land owners who are willing to go beyond the minimum buffer standards. The DNR Watershed Services and other programs like Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), managed by the DNR Forest Service, are available to assist land owners who volunteer to explore these opportunities.  45   3. Headwater Stream Buffers Headwater streams are also called first order streams. For many watersheds, first order streams drain the majority of the land within the entire watershed. Therefore, stream buffers restored along headwater streams (First Order) tend to have greater potential to intercept nutrients and sediments than stream buffers placed elsewhere. In targeting stream buffer restoration projects, giving higher priority to headwater streams is one approach to optimizing nutrient and sediment retention. Restoring headwater stream buffers can also provide habitat benefits that can extend downstream of the project area. Forested headwater streams provide important organic material, like decomposing leaves, that ""feed"" the stream's food web. They also introduce woody debris which enhances in-stream physical habitat. The potential for riparian forest buffers to significantly influence stream temperature is greatest in headwater regions. These factors, in addition to positive water quality effects, are key to improving aquatic habitat. 4. Land Use and Stream Buffers One factor that affects the ability of stream buffers to intercept nonpoint source pollutants is adjacent land use. Nutrient and sediment loads from different land uses can vary significantly as shown in the adjacent table. By restoring naturally vegetated stream Annual Nonpoint Source Pollution Load Rates buffers adjacent to lands By Land Use producing the highest Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model (2000) pollutant loads, nutrient and sediment loads can be Land Use Nitrogen Phosphorus Sediment reduced most efficiently. (lbs/ac) (lbs/ac) (tons/ac) Map 20 Stream Buffer Crop land 17.11 1.21 0.74 Scenario focuses on the crop and pasture lands Urban 7.5 0.7 0.09 within 50 feet of a stream and identifies stream Pasture 8.40 1.15 0.30 segments that lack naturally Forest 1.42 0.00 0.03 vegetated stream buffers using computer GIS. DNR encourages creating stream buffers at least 50 feet wide on each side of the stream, which is significantly greater than minimum buffer requirement, to enhance nutrient and habitat benefits beyond minimum buffer requirements. 5. Nutrient Uptake from Hydric Soils in Stream Buffers In general, the nutrient nitrogen moves from the land into streams in surface water runoff and in groundwater. In watersheds like the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay drainage, a significant percentage of nitrogen enters streams in groundwater. Stream buffers can be used to capture nitrogen moving in groundwater if buffer restoration projects have several key attributes:  Plants with roots deep enough to intercept groundwater as it moves toward the stream 46    Plants with high nitrogen uptake capability, and  Targeting buffer restoration projects to maximize groundwater interception by buffer plants. Hydric soils in stream riparian areas can be used as one factor to help select stream buffer restoration sites. Siting buffer restoration on hydric soils would offer several benefits:  Plant roots are more likely to be in contact with groundwater for longer periods of time  Hydric soils tend to be marginal for many agricultural and urban land uses  Natural vegetation in wet areas often offers greater potential for habitat. Map 20 Stream Buffer Scenario identifies lands that are adjacent to streams, that are composed of hydric soil, that are used for crops or pasture and also lack naturally vegetated stream buffers. Restoration of stream buffers in these areas are would be most likely to intercept nitrogen, control sediment and phosphorus movement, and improve stream water quality and habitat in general. Additional assessment and field evaluation should be used to determine land owner interest, the practical implications of creating naturally vegetated stream buffers in areas identified and to evaluate any hydrologic modification of these soils, such as ditching or draining activities. For example, some areas identified on the map (north and east of Berlin) appear to be dense networks of ditching to serve agricultural fields. Creating naturally vegetated stream buffers in such areas is probably only practical if the land owner is no longer interested in using the area for crops. 6. Optimizing Water Quality Benefits by Combining Priorities Strategic targeting of stream buffer restoration projects may provide many different benefits. To maximize multiple benefits, site selection and project design need to incorporate numerous factors. For example, finding a site with a mix of attributes like those in the following list could result in the greatest control of nonpoint source pollution and enhancement to living resources:  land owner willingness / incentives  marginal land use in the riparian zone  headwater stream  hydric soils  selecting appropriate woody/grass species  adjacent to existing wetlands / habitat  Additionally, selecting restoration projects that are likely to produce measurable success is an important consideration in prioritizing projects for implementation. In general, targeting restoration projects in selected tributaries or small watersheds will tend to offer the greatest probability of producing measurable water quality improvement in the short term. By selecting small areas like a small first order stream for restoration, there is greater likelihood that local water quality will improve with relatively limited investment. In addition, local water quality improvements will likely contribute to downstream improvements.  47   Wetland Restoration Wetlands serve important environmental functions such as providing habitat and nursery areas for many organisms, facilitating nutrient uptake and recycling, providing erosion control. However, most watersheds in Maryland have significantly fewer wetland acres today than in the past. This loss due to draining, filling, etc., has led to habitat loss and negative water quality impacts in streams and in the Chesapeake Bay. Reversing this historic trend is an important goal of wetland restoration. In early 2004, the Maryland Department of the Environment will release an extensive assessment of wetland restoration opportunities in a report to be entitled ""Prioirty Areas for Wetland Restoration, Preservation, and Mitigation in Maryland's Coastal Bays"".26 It is anticipated that MDE's work will offer a number of ways to approach the issue of preventing loss of wetlands and enhancing wetland resources in and around the Newport Bay and Sinepuxent Bay watersheds. Using already available data, one approach to identifying candidate wetland restoration sites uses GIS to help identify ""historic"" wetland areas based on the presence of hydric soils. Map 21 Wetland Restoration Scenario indicates that there appears to be potential for wetland restoration based on identifying crop land and/or pasture on hydric soil within 50 of existing wetlands. This is one of many potential scenarios for finding opportunities for wetland restoration. The steps and priorities used to generate the map scenario are listed below:  Data used: Hydric soils (SSURGO), existing wetlands (DNR Wetlands), land use (Maryland Dept. of Planning, 2000).  Identify candidate hydric soil areas based on land use. Hydric soils used in agricultural fields are selected for consideration. Hydric soils used for development or underlying natural vegetation are not considered in this scenario.  Explore hydric soils based on land use / land cover and proximity to existing wetlands or streams. The potential wetland restoration sites suggested in the scenario can be filtered further by using more accurate wetlands and soil information and by considering land ownership or other factors like like habitat enhancement opportunities, sensitive species protection, targeting specific streams or subwatersheds for intensive restoration, and using Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) information.  48   REFERENCES 1.

Anne Arundel County has reorganized its nonpoint source responsibilities, creating a centralized nonpoint source pollution program. The County is in the process of developing a comprehensive Master Plan for new development and significant redevelopment. Under the new plan, the County's storm water management program will be integrated with nonpoint source planning programs such as wetlands, designated watersheds, agricultural pollution control, and land use management. Road Maintenance. Anne Arundel will perform an assessment regarding the effects of road maintenance activities (street sweeping, litter control, deicing procedures, and the application of herbicides for vegetation control) on storm water discharges. The assessment will include an analysis of alternative practices for reducing pollutants associated with road maintenance activities, and effective practices will be incorporated into the management program. Sensitive Areas Program. The Sensitive Areas Program requires various construction controls in areas such as steep slopes, natural channels, flood plains, habitat areas, and identified ""critical areas."" The Critical Areas program addresses land use management, water dependent facilities, shore erosion protection, forest and woodland protection, agricultural protection, mineral resources, natural parks, and habitat protection within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. Illicit Connections. The County's illicit connection detection and enforcement program will include procedures for public identification and reporting of illicit discharges, fines for continued noncompliance by illicit dischargers, and provisions for field screening data to be recorded on MDE's Part 1 field screening database. Interagency Coordination. The County's storm water management plan review process involves many agencies. The Department of Public Works reviews plans for storm water management on capital projects. If a project is in a critical or growth management area, the Office of Planning and Zoning reviews storm water management plans to ensure they address water quality. Geographic Information System (GIS). The permit provides that Anne Arundel will develop a schedule for implementation of a GIS in an effort to better maintain and analyze source identification data. Flood Plain Management Ordinance. The County's flood plain management ordinance prohibits development within the 100year flood plain in the County. The ordinance also provides open space and preserves natural features such as wetlands. Landfills. Trash that enters landfills is inspected for toxins, hazardous materials, etc. under the trash inspection program. A County landfill erosion and sediment control program is being established for all County-owned landfills. Under this program, landfills will be visually inspected and monitored for up to 20 years after closure. Educational Programs. In the Baysavers program (for the Chesapeake Bay), students participate in projects such as channel restoration. The Citizens Monitoring Program allows residents to participate in water quality sampling in targeted areas.  S)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))Q  ""Clean Water...

Minimum sampling requirements include monitoring at least once per month. If extended dry weather periods occur, baseflow samples shall be taken at least once per month. Three discrete samples shall be taken for storm water flow at both outfall and in-stream monitoring stations. If no flow is observed at the outfall during periods of dry weather, samples will be taken at the in-stream monitoring stations only. In-stream Monitoring. The County is required to use data from existing in-stream monitoring stations and, if possible, from the USGS monitoring stations to further refine pollutant load estimates. ))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))) Annual Progress Reports: Laboratory Results. Laboratory results of monitoring will be recorded on MDE's long-term monitoring database and submitted with annual reports. Management Spreadsheet.

Versar's work and this report were prepared under Maryland's Power Plant Research Program (Contracts No. PR-96-055-001 and K00B0200109 to Versar, Inc.). A major goal of the MBSS is to assess the ecological condition of Maryland's streams, with a particular focus on biological resources, but also evaluating water chemistry and physical habitat. Round Two of the MBSS was designed to characterize and assess watersheds over a five year cycle (2000-2004). This annual report presents results from watersheds sampled in 2001. This report includes a history of the program, a description of methods and survey design, comparative assessments by watershed, detailed results for individual watersheds, and comparisons with Round One results (from 1995-1997).  iii   iv   ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The 2001 MBSS has been a cooperative effort among several agencies and consultants. We at Versar wish to thank Ronald Klauda and Paul Kazyak from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) for directing the program and supporting Versar in preparing this report. DNR and the University of Maryland's Appalachian Laboratory (AL) each provided field crews and did a great job collecting the data. DNR digitized watersheds and calculated land use data, provided quality assurance, conducted crew training, and performed field sampling. Paul Kazyak and Tony Prochaska of DNR contributed to writing this report. Mark Southerland and Paul Kazyak served as its editors. Dr. Ray Morgan of the University of Maryland's Appalachian Laboratory supervised one field crew and oversaw water chemistry laboratory analysis. Dr. Rich Raesly of Frostburg State University provided taxonomic verifications of voucher fish specimens. Versar designed the sampling program, obtained landowners' permissions, conducted statistical analyses, and prepared this report. The success of the project resulted from the strong efforts of all these groups.

The year 2001 was the second of five years of sampling planned for Round Two. Results for each year of Round Two will be reported annually and a summary report will be published when Round Two sampling is completed. Background. Supported and led by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR), the MBSS is a comprehensive program to assess the status of biological resources in Maryland's non-tidal streams; quantify the extent to which acidic deposition affects critical biological resources in the state; examine which other water chemistry, physical habitat, and land use factors are important in explaining stream conditions; provide a statewide inventory of stream biota; establish a benchmark for long-term monitoring; and target future local-scale assessments and mitigation measures needed to restore degraded biological resources. To meet these and other objectives, the Survey has established a list of questions of interest to environmental decision makers to guide its design, implementation, and analysis. These questions fall into three categories: (1) characterizing biological resources and ecological conditions (such as the number of stream miles with pH < 5), (2) assessing their condition, and (3) identifying likely sources of degradation. To answer these questions, a number of steps have been taken since the Survey's inception, including (1) devising a sampling design, (2) field testing sampling protocols and logistics to assure data quality and precision, (3) conducting an extensive, multi-year field sampling program, (4) developing reference-based indicators of biological integrity, and (5) using analytical methods to evaluate contributions of different anthropogenic stresses, including land use. Three characteristics of the Survey differentiate it from other stream monitoring efforts in Maryland. First, sampling is probability-based, allowing accurate and robust population estimates of variables and sampling variance, so that estimates of status can be made with quantifiable confidence. Second, the Survey focuses on biological responses to stress, but also collects data to characterize pollutant stress and habitat condition. Third, its scale is watershedwide and statewide, rather than local. MBSS Round Two Design. 2001 was the second year of sampling for Round Two of the Survey. Round Two includes both (1) a core survey based on statewide sampling of random stream segments and (2) ancillary sampling dedicated to additional monitoring and special studies. The core survey produces the majority of MBSS results and is the focus of this report. Some information gathered by the ancillary sampling is included, but extensive data analysis of these additional results is reserved for separate reports. To meet the State's growing need for information at finer spatial scales, Round Two's core survey was redesigned to focus on Maryland's 8-digit watersheds (averaging 75 mi2 in area) rather than drainage basins (averaging 500 mi2). The Round Two design is based on first-through fourth-order, non-tidal streams on a new 1:100,000-scale base map. The study design allows estimates at the level of 84 individual or combined Maryland 8-digit watersheds that serve as primary sampling units (PSUs). Each PSU has 10 or more sample sites. To achieve this sample density while sampling approximately 210 sites each year, Round Two will take five years to complete, running from 2000 through 2004 (rather than the three years in Round One, 1995-1997). The MBSS uses a probability-based survey design called lattice sampling to schedule sampling statewide over a multi-year period. The lattice design of Round Two stratifies by year and PSU and restricts the sampling each year to about one-fifth of the state's 138 watersheds. Approximately 300 stream segments (210 in the core survey) of fixed length (75 m) are sampled each year, with biological, chemical, and physical parameters measured at each segment using standardized methods. Biological measurements include the abundance, size, and individual health of fish; taxa composition of benthic macroinvertebrates; and presence of amphibians and reptiles, mussels, and aquatic vegetation. Chemical analytes include pH, acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC), nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfate, chloride, conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Physical habitat parameters include commonly used observational measurements such as in stream habitat structure, embeddedness, pool and riffle quality, shading, and riparian vegetation, and quantitative measurements such as stream gradient, maximum depth, wetted width, and discharge. Channelization, bank erosion, bar formation, and land use immediately visible from the segment are assessed. Additional land use data for the entire catchment upstream of each sample site are incorporated from statewide geographic information system (GIS) coverages. For the most part, methods used in Round Two are identical to those of Round One. However, some changes were made to improve the quality and/or usefulness of the data  vii   generated. These changes in sampling methods include (1) modifications to habitat assessment and characterization, (2) the addition of new chemical analytes (total dissolved nitrogen, total particulate nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, ammonia, ortho-phosphate, total dissolved phosphorus, total particulate phosphorus, chloride, and turbidity), (3) collection of continuous temperature readings in the summer, (4) characterization of invasive plant abundance, and (5) the addition of altitude as a physical variable. In addition, the reach file used to select sites is the USGS 1:100,000-scale map; this is a change from the 1:250,000scale map used in Round One, meaning that more small streams will be sampled in Round Two. Another change to the sample frame is the inclusion of fourth-order streams. Although the Survey will provide the data needed to characterize the status of all 8-digit watersheds, it will not have sufficient sampling density to characterize most of the 1066 12-digit subwatersheds. Therefore, Round Two of the MBSS has been expanded to include coordination with volunteer efforts (such as DNR's Maryland Stream Waders) and County stream monitoring programs. Ultimately, by incorporating these data, the MBSS hopes to characterize many areas of the state at this finer spatial scale. In addition to improving the spatial intensity of sampling, Round Two will address temporal variability by regular monitoring of fixed ""sentinel"" sites. In 2000, DNR established a network of approximately 25 sentinel sites deemed to be minimally impacted by human activities, in areas where land uses were unlikely to change over time (e.g., state parklands). With some modifications, these sites were again sampled in 2001, and will continued to be sampled throughout Round Two. In 2001, 19 PSU's containing 212 sites were sampled. Ancillary sampling was conducted in 2001 to serve two additional purposes: (1) to collect additional data in coldwater streams to support indicator development for this stream type (16 new sites) and (2) to support Carroll County with three new sites in the Liberty Reservoir watershed. MBSS 2001 Results. In 2001, the Survey continued to provide invaluable information on the abundance and distribution of rare species, in order to support a more thorough understanding of Maryland's biodiversity. During MBSS sampling in 2001, a number of occurrences of rare fish were documented, including one state-listed endangered species, glassy darter, and eight state-listed rare species: ironcolor shiner, logperch , mud sunfish, flier, banded sunfish, swamp darter, comely shiner, and shield darter.  The status of sampled watersheds and individual stream segments was assessed, focusing on the condition ratings of the fish and benthic Indices of Biotic Integrity (IBI), indicators previously developed by MBSS and employed in evaluating Round One results. IBI scores for each site were determined by comparing the fish or benthic assemblage to those found at minimally impacted reference sites. IBI data for each PSU are depicted in box-and-whisker plots; mean IBIs for PSUs sampled in 2001 were mapped. Over the next three years of Round Two sampling, data will be collected in remaining PSUs to complete an updated statewide picture of biological conditions. Data were also used to estimate the extent of streams in poor to very poor condition (IBI < 3) within each PSU. The MBSS Round Two study design, based on simple random sampling, makes it possible to calculate an exact confidence interval around each estimate based on the binomial distribution. The extent of streams within a given condition (e.g., IBI < 3) is expressed as a percentage of all first-through fourth-order stream miles in the PSU, with an associated 90% confidence interval around the estimate. The indicators used were developed during Round One of the MBSS and have been deemed reliable for representing ecological condition by field verification and expert peer review. Nonetheless, the MBSS continues to pursue refinements to its indicators including improvements to the provisional physical habitat index (PHI), methods for combining indicators that do not lose information (e.g., combined biotic index), and changes to the indicator thresholds and scoring methods to make them more intuitive and accessible to the public. Fish IBI scores at sites sampled in the 2001 MBSS spanned the full range of biological condition, from 1.0 (very poor) to 5.0 (good). Mean fish IBI per PSU ranged from 1.90 (Potomac River Upper North Branch) to 3.86 (Little Gunpowder Falls). Fish IBI scores were less variable within some PSUs (e.g., Northeast River/Furnace Bay) than others (e.g., Potomac River Upper Tidal/Oxon Creek). Benthic IBI scores spanned the full range of biological conditions, from 1.0 (very poor) to 4.78 (good). The lowest mean benthic IBI was 1.60 in Coastal Bays PSU. The highest mean benthic IBI was 4.17 in Prettyboy Reservoir PSU. Within-PSU variability ranged from low to high. The greatest extent of occurrence of streams with benthic IBI < 3 (expressed as 90% confidence intervals) was in Piscataway Creek (71 to 100% of stream miles), Potomac River Upper  viii   Tidal/Oxon Creek (65 to 100%), and Coastal Bays (47 to 100%). To integrate the results of fish and benthic IBI assessments, a Combined Biotic Index (CBI) was calculated as the mean of the fish and benthic IBI values at a site. If only one score was available (e.g., benthic but no fish IBI) the single score was assigned as the CBI. CBI scores from core MBSS sites ranged from 1.00 (very poor) to 4.60 (good). Mean CBI per PSU ranged from 1.96 (Coastal Bays) to 3.98 (Deer Creek), paralleling benthic IBI results. The effects of acidic deposition and acid mine drainage (AMD) on stream chemistry are well documented. Round One MBSS results (Roth et al. 1999) and an assessment of these results in comparison with critical loads (Miller et al. 1998) confirmed that stream acidification remains a problem in Maryland freshwater streams. In 2001, estimates of the percentage of stream miles sensitive to acidification (i.e., those with ANC < 200 :eq/l) followed the geographic pattern noted in the MSSCS and Round One MBSS, with the greatest extent of acid-sensitive streams in Western Maryland and the Southern Coastal Plain. Seven PSUs, primarily in the same regions, had sites highly sensitive to acidification (ANC < 50 :eq/l). Also paralleling the Round One results, acidic deposition effects were more widespread than effects from acid mine drainage or agriculture. Although many water resource programs tend to focus on water chemistry-based definitions of stream quality, physical habitat degradation can have an equal or greater effect on stream ecosystems and their biological communities. A provisional Physical Habitat Index (PHI), developed using earlier MBSS data (Hall et al. 1999) was used to score sites sampled in 2001. PHI scores varied widely within and among PSUs. The mean PHI fell into the range of good in two PSUs (Potomac Upper River North Branch and Youghiogheny River), while mean PHI was poor in one PSU (Bodkin Creek/Baltimore Harbor) and fair in the remaining 16 PSUs. Stream mile estimates of the occurrence of poor to very poor PHI scores suggest that physical habitat degradation is widespread. MBSS 2001 results indicate that stream channelization is common in some Maryland watersheds, particularly in the Coastal Plain. Moderate to severe bank erosion also occurs commonly in Maryland streams. Mean values by PSU were used to estimate the extent of eroded area (square meters) per stream mile. Highest values were in Patuxent River Middle, Northeast River/Furnace Bay, Piscataway Creek, Seneca Creek, and Western Branch PSUs. The combined area of eroded bank in all 19 PSUs totaled more than 330 acres. Exacerbated bar formation was observed in most  watersheds sampled in 2001. Lack of riparian vegetation on at least one stream bank was observed within 9 of 19 PSUs. Most watersheds of appeared particularly affected by the presence of exotic plants, such as multiflora rose, mile-aminute, and Japanese honeysuckle. The total number of instream pieces of woody debris and rootwads was highest in Zekiah Swamp, due primarily to one site where 118 total instream woody debris and rootwads were counted. During 2001, MBSS deployed continuous reading temperature loggers at more than 200 sites between the months of June and August. The long-term goal is to use temperature data to (1) better characterize coldwater streams and (2) identify streams stressed by temperature changes, such as spikes from rapid inputs of warm water running off impervious surfaces during summer storms. Among all sites assessed, mean average daily temperatures ranged from 12.8 to 24.8 C, indicating the presence of both coldwater and warmwater sites in the data set. Future analyses of data from coldwater streams will assist in interpretation of IBI scores and will contribute to development of a fish IBI tailored to these systems, because trout and several nongame species require cool to cold waters. Fourteen sites had occasional readings above 32 C, including Dividing Creek/ Nassawango Creek where the temperature exceeded 32 C more than 2% of the time. In Maryland, concern for nutrient loadings to the Chesapeake Bay has drawn attention to the amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus transported from throughout the watershed by streams. In MBSS 2001 sampling, total nitrogen tended to be highest in Central Maryland and the Eastern Shore. In general, nitrate nitrogen made up the largest fraction of total nitrogen. Nitrate nitrogen concentrations greater than 1 mg/l are commonly considered to indicate anthropogenic influence; mean nitrate nitrogen concentrations exceeded this level in 10 of 19 PSUs. In several PSUs, nearly 100% of stream miles had high nitrate nitrogen concentrations. Total phosphorus tended to be substantially higher on the Eastern Shore, lower in Western Maryland, and moderate in the central part of the state. Dissolved oxygen concentrations at most locations were greater than 5 mg/l, the COMAR standard and a level generally considered healthy for aquatic life. The only PSU with a mean DO < 5 mg/l was Upper Pocomoke River, where swampy blackwater streams and sluggish waters are naturally lower in DO, but are also particularly susceptible to BOD loading from anthropogenic sources. Because sampling is done when the water is fairly clear, turbidity was generally low; a more complete characterization of turbidity would require sampling during storm events. Sulfate values were not generally high. Chloride tended to be highest in  ix   urban areas, especially Bodkin Creek/ Baltimore Harbor, and also at several sites near roadways that probably received substantial amounts of road salt. As expected, mean DOC and particulate carbon were highest in Coastal Plain basins, especially on the Eastern Shore. Since the primary focus of the Round Two Survey is on smaller watersheds than in Round One, more attention has been paid to examining sampling results and potential stressors at individual sites. This report includes a snapshot of good and bad conditions that is illustrated by sites with the 10 best and 10 worst CBI scores. The report also includes a summary of results for each of the 19 PSUs sampled in the core (random) sampling for MBSS 2001. Each summary includes maps, land use statistics, and tables containing a variety of information on the sites sampled in each PSU. The benthic assessment results for the 708 sites sampled by the volunteer Stream Waders program in 2001 are also indicated on each map. In addition, the Seneca Creek map includes site assessment results for sites sampled by Montgomery County. These examples illustrate the Survey's efforts to incorporate data from other sources to provide more thorough monitoring coverage of Maryland's watersheds. Additional data for each PSU are available on a Web-based searchable database at www.dnr.state.md. us/streams. As each round of statewide sampling by the Survey is conducted at regular intervals over time, temporal changes (trends) in the stream condition statewide or for individual 8-digit watersheds can be evaluated. A comparison with data from Round One (1995-1997) was conducted where sample sizes were sufficient (i.e., in the six 8-digit watersheds sampled in 2001 that also had more than 10 samples in one or two years of MBSS Round One). Yearly estimated 90% confidence intervals for fish or benthic IBI scores overlapped for all watersheds except for Deer Creek, which had an interval of 3.93 to 4.31 for the benthic IBI in 2001 as compared to the 3.31 to 3.81 interval in Round One sampling. In 2000 the Survey initiated an annual monitoring effort at minimally disturbed sites (referred to as Sentinel sites) to help interpret the degree to which changes in biological indicator scores stem from natural variability. Sentinel sites are those most likely to remain undisturbed in the foreseeable future within four geographic regions o Maryland. In 2001, the original list of Sentinel sites was modified slightly and 26 sites were sampled. Although no more than three years of sampling is now available for any site, comparison of CBIs indicated that approximately 82% of all Sentinel sites varied less than 1.0.  Management Implications and Future Directions. The information being obtained by Round Two of the MBSS will continue to support a wide array of management decisions by Maryland DNR and other agencies. Major initiatives that have or will benefit from MBSS data include the Chesapeake Bay Agreement, Maryland Land Conservation, Clean Water Action Plan, State water quality standards, Maryland biodiversity, and other local monitoring programs. The Survey results are expected to be highly useful for the new stream corridor commitments of the Chesapeake Bay Program. The Chesapeake 2000 Agreement (signed by Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, District of Columbia, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Chesapeake Bay Commission) newly recognizes ""the need to focus on the individuality of each river, stream and creek"" to meet the goal--""Preserve, protect and restore those habitats and natural areas that are vital to the survival and diversity of the living resources of the Bay and its rivers."" The stream corridor information provided by the Survey will also prove invaluable for other statewide programs. As part of the Chesapeake Bay-wide goal of restoring 2,010 miles of riparian buffers in the Chesapeake Bay watershed by the year 2010, Maryland has committed to restoring 600 miles of riparian vegetation along its stream corridors. MBSS data on the condition of constituent streams will help assign priorities for the purchase of GreenPrint and Rural Legacy lands. The results of Round Two will continue to support Maryland's participation in the federal Clean Water Action Plan. Round One MBSS data were an essential component of the first Unified Watershed Assessment, helping designate both Category 1 (priorities for restoration) and Category 3 (priorities for protection) watersheds within Maryland. Restoration strategies have been developed for many of these priority watersheds, and 2000 sampling results will be used to help implement them (e.g., in Little Patuxent River watershed). Because the design of Round Two focuses on the finer geographic scale of Maryland 8-digit watersheds, future Unified Watershed Assessments will be more complete. In addition to supporting these targeting initiatives, the identification of degraded stream segments has implications for comprehensive protection under the Clean Water Act, including use of MBSS 2001 (along with other data) to prepare the State's Clean Water Act 303(d) list and biennial 305(b) water quality report. In particular, the Maryland Department of the Environment has developed an interim framework for the application of biocriteria in the State's water quality standards and list of impaired waters (303(d)  x   list). At present, the proposed biocriteria for wadeable, nontidal (first- to fourth-order) streams rely on two biological indicators from the MBSS, the fish and benthic IBIs. The approach centers on identifying impaired waterbodies at the Maryland 8-digit watershed and 12-digit subwatershed levels. Ultimately these MBSS biological data may also contribute to refinement of the States' aquatic life use designations. The information on biological diversity collected by the Survey exceeds that needed to designate the ecological condition of individual watersheds. The extensive geo-graphic reach and quantitative sampling results of the Survey provide an unusual opportunity for evaluating the distribution and abundance of species previously designated as rare only by anecdotal evidence. For example, the endemic checkered sculpin and several other species have been collected in previously unreported locations. Based on the information gathered in Round One, Maryland DNR's Heritage and Biodiversity Programs are reevaluating state designations of rare, threatened, and endangered species. One of the most promising trends related to the Survey has been the increase in interest and activity among Maryland county governments, non-governmental organizations, private businesses, and volunteers in stream monitoring. The success of the Survey has encouraged these groups to base their water resource management more directly on monitoring results. Many have instituted their own monitoring programs, often drawing upon or adopting MBSS sampling protocols. This report highlights the improved watershed coverage that can be obtained by incorporating volunteer Stream Waders data and the increased precision in stream assessments that can be attained by integrated MBSS data with that from local government monitoring programs such as Montgomery County. Maryland DNR expects to continue integration of the MBSS with those local government agencies that already have or are planning to initiate their own stream monitoring programs. The Maryland Water Monitoring Council (MWMC) will play an active role in encouraging collaborations between the state and local agencies. As described above, the Round Two design provides significantly improved geographic resolution and additional stressor data, although more comprehensive understanding of watershed stressors will require data from other sources. Issues that require continued scrutiny in future years include the following:  C C C  Extending the Survey into tidal streams Delineating more stream types requiring new indicators (e.g., coldwater and blackwater streams) Refining existing indicators (e.g., physical habitat) and developing new ones (e.g., streamside salamanders in small streams) Better characterization of existing and new stressors (e.g., estimating the contribution of eroded soil to sediment loading) Improving identification of rare species habitats and other biodiversity components Comparing among sample rounds for the detection of trends More coordination with counties for greater sample density or cost savings in areas of shared interest  C  C C C  In 2001, the Survey continued to make progress toward addressing these issues. Specifically, temperature loggers were deployed at nearly all randomly selected stream sites in 2000 and 2001 (and will continue to be deployed throughout Round Two) to improve our ability to identify coldwater streams. In both 2000 and 2001, 16 ancillary coldwater sites were sampled in both stressed and healthy coldwater streams. Analysis of existing coldwater and blackwater stream data has begun in hopes of developing separate reference conditions, and ultimately separate indicators, for these stream types. Two years of targeted sampling of MBSS streams for streamside salamanders have been completed in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey. Analysis of these data are underway and should determine whether it is feasible to use streamside salamander sampling in small MBSS streams as a second vertebrate indicator of condition for this stream type. In 2001, the Survey also revisited its approach for assessing stream physical habitat quality, based on Round One data, by reanalyzing all existing physical habitat data and developing a new indicator. Following validation, this new PHI may be incorporated into MBSS analyses. In 2001, the Survey had two papers accepted for publication in peer-review journals that address the issue of stressor diagnosis in freshwater streams. One study analyzed MBSS  xi   data in drainage basins of mixed land uses and determined that urban land use is a strong indicator of the likelihood that IBIs will fail biocriteria thresholds. In the other, the Survey developed an ""expected species model"" that diagnoses  ecological stressors to stream fishes using species tolerances to 31 physical, chemical, and landscape variables. Like the other study, this approach found that impervious land cover was the most influential stressor on Maryland streams.  xii   TABLE OF CONTENTS Page FOREWORD . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . iii ACKNOWLEDGMENTS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . v EXECUTIVE SUMMARY . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . vii 1 INTRODUCTION . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.1 HISTORY OF THE MBSS . . . 1.2 ROUND TWO OF THE MBSS 1.3 ROADMAP TO THIS REPORT .... .... .... ... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 -1 -1 -3 -5  2 METHODS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.1 BACKGROUND . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.2 STATISTICAL METHODS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 .2 .1 Survey Design . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 .2 .2 Sample Frame . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 .2 .3 Sample Selection . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 .2 .4 Site Selection . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 .2 .5 Permissions from Landowners . . . . . 2.3 ANALYTICAL METHODS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.3.1 Estimation of Means, Proportions and 2.4 LANDOWNER PERMISSION RESULTS . . . 2.5 NUMBER OF SITES SAMPLED IN 2001 . . . 2.6 FIELD AND LABORATORY METHODS . . . 2 .6 .1 Spring and Summer Index Periods . . 2 .6 .2 Water Chemistry . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 .6 .3 Benthic Macroinvertebrates . . . . . . . 2 .6 .4 Fish . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 .6 .5 Amphibians and Reptiles . . . . . . . . . 2 .6 .6 Mussels . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 .6 .7 Aquatic and Streamside Vegetation . 2 .6 .8 Physical Habitat . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.7 QUALITY ASSURANCE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 .7 .1 Data Management . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 .7 .2 QA/QC for Field Sampling . . . . . . . . 2.8 CLIMATIC CONDITIONS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3  .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... ....

The year 2001 was the second of five years of sampling planned for Round Two. Sampling for the three-year Round One of the Survey was completed in 1997 and was summarized in Roth et al. (1999) and Boward et al. (1999). Results for each year of Round Two are reported annually and a summary report will be published when Round Two sampling is completed (for 2000 results, see Roth et al. 2001b). This introductory chapter describes the history of the Survey, describes its components, and provides a roadmap to this year 2001 annual report.  assess the current status of biological resources in Maryland's non-tidal streams; quantify the extent to which acidic deposition has affected or may be affecting biological resources in the state; examine which other water chemistry, physical habitat, and land use factors are important in explaining the current status of biological resources in streams; provide a statewide inventory of stream biota; establish a benchmark for long-term monitoring of trends in these biological resources; and target future local-scale assessments and mitigation measures needed to restore degraded biological resources.         1.1 HISTORY OF THE MBSS In the 1980s, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) recognized that atmospheric deposition was one of the most important environmental problems resulting from the generation of electric power. The link between acidification of surface waters and acidic deposition resulting from pollutant emissions was well established and many studies pointed to adverse biological effects of low pH and acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) and elevated levels of inorganic aluminum. To determine the extent of acidification of Maryland streams resulting from acidic deposition, DNR conducted the Maryland Synoptic Stream Chemistry Survey (MSSCS) in 1987. The MSSCS estimated the number of streams affected by or sensitive to acidification statewide, concluding that the greatest concentration of fish resources at risk may be in streams throughout the Appalachian Plateau and Southern Coastal Plain physiographic provinces (Knapp et al. 1988). While the MSSCS demonstrated the potential for adverse effects on biota from acidification, little direct information was available from the field on the biological responses of Maryland streams to water chemistry conditions. For this reason, in 1993, DNR created the MBSS to provide comprehensive information on the status of biological resources in Maryland streams and how they are affected by acidic deposition and other cumulative effects of anthropogenic stresses. The MBSS is now nine years old and continues to help environmental decision-makers protect and restore the natural resources of Maryland. The primary objectives of the MBSS are to    To meet these and other objectives of the MBSS, a list of 64 questions that the Survey will try to answer was developed. These questions fall into three categories: (1) characterizing biological resources, physical habitat, and water quality (such as the number of fish in a watershed or the number of stream miles with pH < 5); (2) assessing the condition of these resources (as deviation from minimally impaired expectations); and (3) identifying likely sources of degradation (by delineating relationships between biological conditions and anthropogenic stresses). Answering these questions has required a progression of steps in the implementation of the Survey, including (1) devising a sampling design to monitor wadeable, non-tidal streams throughout the state and allow area-wide estimates of the extent of the biological resources, (2) implementing sampling protocols and quality assurance/quality control procedures to assure data quality and precision, (3) developing indicators of biological condition so that degradation can be evaluated as a deviation from reference expectations, and (4) using a variety of analytical methods to evaluate the relative contributions of different anthropogenic stresses. In creating the Survey, DNR implemented a probabilitybased sampling design as a cost-effective way to characterize statewide stream resources. By randomly selecting sites, the Survey can make quantitative inferences about the characteristics of the more than 10,000 miles of non-tidal  1-1   streams in Maryland. The EPA is encouraging the use of random sampling designs to assess status and trends in surface water quality (EPA 1993). The Round One MBSS design began with the MSSCS sample frame and was modified during the 1993 pilot and 1994 demonstration phases to provide answers to the questions of greatest interest (Vlstad et al. 1995, 1996). That design allowed robust estimates at the level of stream size (Strahler orders 1, 2, and 3), large watershed (17 river basins), and the entire state. Estimates by other categories, such as counties or smaller watersheds (138 in Maryland), were possible depending on the number of sample points in each unit. Round Two of the MBSS has a slightly different design that allows estimates at the level of smaller watersheds (85 individual or combined Maryland 8-digit watersheds); to achieve the necessary sample density at the available level of effort, Round Two will take five years to complete (rather than the three years in Round One). DNR recognized that the utility of these estimates depended on accurately measuring appropriate attributes of streams. The Survey focuses on biology for two reasons: (1) organisms themselves have direct societal value and (2) biological communities integrate stresses over time and are a valuable and cost-effective means of assessing ecological integrity (i.e., the capacity of a resource to sustain its inherent potential). Inevitably, overall environmental degradation is tied to a failure of the system to support biological processes at a desired level (Karr 1993). It is equally important to recognize that the natural variability in biota requires that several components of the biological system be monitored. Fish are an important component of stream integrity and one that also contributes substantial recreational values. The Survey collects quantitative data for the calculation of population estimates for individual fish species (both game and nongame). These data can also be used to evaluate fish community composition, individual fish health, and the geographic distribution of commercially important, rare, or non-indigenous fish species. Benthic (bottom-dwelling) macroinvertebrates are another essential component of streams and they constitute the second principal focus of the Survey. The Survey uses rapid bioassessment procedures for collecting benthic macroinvertebrates; these semiquantitative methods permit comparisons of relative abundance and community composition, and have proven to be an effective way of assessing biological integrity in streams (Hilsenhoff 1987, Lenat 1988, Plafkin et al. 1989, Kerans and Karr 1994, Resh 1995, Barbour et al. 1999). The Survey also records the presence of amphibians and reptiles (herpetofauna), freshwater mussels, and aquatic plants (both submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) and emergent macrophytes). The Survey has established rigorous protocols (Kazyak 2001) for each of these sampling components, as  well as training and auditing procedures to assure that data quality objectives are met. Although the MBSS sampling design and protocols provide exceptional information for characterizing the stream resources in Maryland, designation of degraded areas and identification of likely stresses requires additional activities. Assessing the condition of biological resources (whether they are degraded or undegraded) requires the development of ecological indicators that permit the comparison of sampled segment results to minimally impacted reference conditions (i.e., the biological community expected in watersheds with little or no human-induced impacts). The Survey has used its growing database of information collected with consistent methods and broad coverage across the state to develop and test indicators of individual biological components (i.e., fish and benthic macroinvertebrates) and a provisional indicator of physical habitat quality (Roth et al. 2000, Stribling et al. 1998, Hall et al. 1999). These three indices are the basis for estimating the number of stream miles in varying degrees of degradation (good, fair, poor, and very poor condition) and mapping the locations of sites by their condition. Each of these indicators consists of multiple metrics using the general approach developed for the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) (Karr et al. 1986, Karr 1991) and the Chesapeake Bay Benthic Restoration Goals (Ranasinghe et al. 1994). The fish and benthic IBIs (which combine attributes of both the number and the type of species found) are widely accepted indicators that have been adapted for use in a variety of geographic locations (Miller et al. 1988, Cairns and Pratt 1993, Simon 1999). The Survey currently reports a composite fish and benthic indicator (Combined Biotic Index, or CBI) and is investigating the possibility of developing additional indicators (e.g., salamanders in small streams with few or no fish). In addition to using reference-based indicators, the Survey applies a variety of analytical methods to the question of which stresses are most closely associated with degraded streams. This involves correlational and multivariate analyses of water chemistry, physical habitat, land use, and biological information (e.g., presence of non-native species). The biological information also provides an unusual opportunity for evaluating the status of biodiversity across the state; the distribution and abundance of species previously designated as rare only by anecdotal evidence can be determined and unique combinations of species at the ecosystem and landscape levels can be identified. Land use and other landscape-scale metrics also play an important role in identifying the relative contributions of different stresses to the cumulative impact on stream resources. Ultimately, the Survey seeks to provide an integrated assessment of the  1-2   problems facing Maryland streams that will facilitate interdisciplinary solutions. The research progress and assessment results of Round One of the MBSS are reported in Roth et al. (1999) and Boward et al. (1999). Among other findings, Round One collected 83 fish species, including rare occurrences of the endemic checkered sculpin and non-native cutthroat trout. According to the fish IBI, 45% of stream miles fell into the range of good to fair, while 49% fell into this range according to the benthic IBI. Similarly, 49% of stream miles were rated good to fair by the physical habitat index. Statewide, 28% of stream miles were acidic or acid sensitive, indicating a slight improvement since the 1987 MSSCS. Acidic deposition was by far the most common source of stream acidification, dominating 19% of stream miles. Statewide, 59% of stream miles had nitrate-nitrogen concentration greater than 1.0 mg/l, indicating anthropogenic sources. Nearly all sites with greater than 50% urban land use had IBI scores indicative of poor to very poor biological condition. These and other results are already being used by Maryland DNR to target resource management efforts and to reevaluate state designations of rare, threatened, and endangered species. MBSS Round One Results have also been used to support Maryland's Unified Watershed Assessment and other components of the Federal Clean Water Action Plan, the Maryland Tributary Strategy Teams' plans to reduce nutrient contributions to the Chesapeake Bay, and the Maryland Department of the Environment's water quality standards program that lists impaired waters and develops total maximum daily loads (TMDLs). Round Two of the Survey will continue to contribute to these activities and, by refining the assessment of watershed conditions, may provide even greater utility to managers.  majority of MBSS results and is the focus of this report. The information gathered by the ancillary sampling is included where convenient for completeness, but extensive data analysis of these additional results is reserved for separate reports (but see Chapter 6 on Sentinel Site sampling). To meet the state's growing need for information at finer spatial scales, Round Two's core survey was redesigned to focus on Maryland's 8-digit watersheds (Table 1-1). The Round Two design was also based on a new 1:100,000-scale base map; this means that more small streams will be sampled than were sampled in Round One. Specifically, Round Two's design allows estimates at the level of 85 individual or combined Maryland 8-digit watersheds by ensuring that each watershed has 10 or more sample sites. To achieve this sample density at the same annual level of effort, Round Two will take five years to complete (rather than the three years in Round One), running from 2000 through 2004. The details of the Round Two study design are presented Section 2.2 of this report. The results of Round Two's core survey will be presented in much the same way as for Round One. Unusual or rare or important species will be included to highlight our improving understanding of the state's biodiversity. The status of sampled watersheds and individual stream segments will be reported, focusing on the conditions ratings of the fish and benthic IBI. Stressor results (for acidification, physical habitat, and nutrients) will be reported within and among watersheds. The 2001 report will also present preliminary comparisons with the Round One data and begin to discuss trends in the condition of Maryland's streams. Individual sites' results for each watershed will be included, with additional information available on a Web-based searchable database at www.dnr.state.md.us/streams. The sampling frame for Round Two is based on a 1:100,000 scale map, and includes a substantial number of streams (primarily first-order) that were not included in the sampling frame used for Round One (1:250,000 map). In the estimation of differences in statewide stream condition between the two rounds, the bias resulting from differences in sampling frames can be corrected for by limiting the analysis to the population of streams that overlaps for the two sampling frames. The difference in map scale is likely to have  1.2 ROUND TWO OF THE MBSS 2000 was the first year of sampling for Round Two of the Survey. Results from 2000 can be found in Roth et al. (2001b). Round Two is a natural extension of the MBSS as it began in 1993 and it includes both (1) a core survey based on statewide sampling of random stream segments and (2) ancillary targeted sampling dedicated to additional monitoring and special studies. The core survey produces the  Table 1-1.

Results in Vlstad et al. (2001) suggest the mean fish IBI scores for an 8-digit watershed in Montgomery County (Seneca Creek) based on the County survey (1:24,000 map scale) is similar to the mean score based on the MBSS (1:100,000 scale). While the data obtained from Round Two can still be aggregated to characterize basin or statewide conditions, the new design was intended primarily to provide estimates of stream condition at the smaller watershed level needed by many of the State's watershed assessment and management programs and by local governments. For example, both the State's Unified Watershed Assessment / Clean Water Action Plan and its interim biological criteria framework for nontidal streams (MDE 2000) employ data to assess and rank Maryland 8-digit watersheds. The interim biocriteria framework for Maryland incorporates stream ratings based on fish and benthic IBIs developed by the MBSS (Roth et al. 2000, Stribling et al. 1998) to identify 8-digit watersheds and 12-digit subwatersheds that are impaired. Results from MBSS 2000 will be used to prepare the State's Clean Water Act 303(d) list and 305(b) water quality report. Although the Survey will provide the data needed to characterize the status of all 8-digit watersheds (averaging 75 mi2 in area), it will not have sufficient sampling density to characterize most of the 1066 smaller 12-digit subwatersheds (averaging 8 mi2 in area). Therefore, Round Two of the MBSS has been expanded by DNR to include a new volunteer effort (Maryland Stream Waders) and closer coordination with County stream monitoring programs. Maryland DNR is evaluating the feasibility of integrating data from these other monitoring programs by studying the comparability of each program's sampling and analytical methods. By incorporating these data, the MBSS hopes to characterize many areas of the state at this finer spatial scale. In 2000, Maryland DNR launched its volunteer-based Maryland Stream Waders initiative, a benthic sampling program. Each volunteer was trained by Maryland DNR staff in methods documented in the Maryland Stream Waders stream sampling manual (Boward 2000) and quality was assured through 5% duplicate sampling, taxonomic confirmations, and laboratory subsampling. In 2001, volunteers sampled 708 sites within the same watersheds sampled by MBSS crews. A benthic family-level IBI was calculated for these sites (MDNR 2000). Stream Wader results are presented in Chapter 4 of this report. For further information on Stream Waders, see http://www.dnr.state.md.us/  streams/mbss/mbss_volun. html. The goals of the program are to:  increase the density of sampling sites for use in stream quality assessments; improve stream stewardship ethics and encourage local action to improve watershed management; educate local communities about the relationship between land use and stream quality; and provide quality-assured information on stream quality to state, local, and federal agencies, environmental organizations, and others.        At the same time, Maryland DNR is working with several County (and Baltimore City) stream monitoring programs to coordinate monitoring and assessment efforts. Issues of study design, site selection, comparability of field and laboratory protocols, quality control, and integrated analysis are being addressed as cooperative efforts with the counties. For example, the MBSS and Montgomery County Department of Environmental Protection recently completed a EPA-sponsored case study that outlines general guidelines for integrating state and county programs (Roth et al. 2001a). Currently, the MBSS is also working with the Prince George's County, Howard County, and Baltimore County/City (using Maryland Save Our Streams) programs. Where feasible, the more spatially intensive monitoring results from the counties will be incorporated into MBSS reporting. Both state and county stream monitoring programs may also realize cost savings by sharing sampling results. In addition to improving the spatial intensity of sampling, Round Two will address temporal variability by regular monitoring of fixed ""sentinel"" sites. In 2000, DNR established a network of sentinel sites deemed to be minimally impacted by human activities. A total of 25 sentinel sites were selected in areas where land uses were unlikely to change over time (e.g., state parklands) from a pool of leastimpacted reference sites identified in Round One (i.e., sites meeting designated water chemistry, physical habitat, and land use criteria). Chapter 6 of this report describes sampling efforts at the Sentinel sites in 2001. Another 16 coldwater sites were sampled in 2001 to provide additional data from both stressed and healthy coldwater streams that can be used in the future development of a coldwater fish IBI. In addition, three sites were sampled in the Liberty Reservoir watershed during 2001 at the request of Carroll County government.  1-4   1.3 ROADMAP TO THIS REPORT This report presents the results of the 2001 annual sampling of Round Two of the MBSS and includes 8 chapters and 4 appendices.

This chapter presents the study design and procedures used to implement Round Two of the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS or the Survey). Details of the study design and sample frame are included below, along with a summary of landowner permission results and the number of sites sampled in watersheds selected for sampling in 2001. This background material is followed by a summary of field and laboratory methods for each component: water chemistry, benthic macroinvertebrates, fish, amphibians and reptiles, vegetation, and physical habitat. Quality assurance (QA) activities are also described. For further details on Round Two methods, see the MBSS Sampling Manual (Kazyak 2001). For the most part, methods used in Round Two of the MBSS (2000-2004) are identical to those of Round One (19951997). However, some changes were made to improve the quality and/or usefulness of the data generated. These changes in sampling methods include (1) modifications to the physical habitat assessment and characterization, (2) the addition of new chemical analytes (total nitrogen, nitrite, ammonia, ortho-phosphate, total phosphorous, chloride, and turbidity), (3) collection of continuous in-stream temperature readings at all randomly-selected sample sites throughout the summer, and (4) characterization of invasive terrestrial plant abundance. In addition, the reach file used to select sites is the 1:100,000-scale map developed by USGS; this is a change from the 1:250,000-scale map used in Round One. Another change to the sample frame, is the expansion of the Survey to include fourth-order, non-tidal streams.  2.2.2 Sample Frame The sample frame for the 2000-2004 MBSS is based on the 1:100,000-scale stream network, a map scale consistent with that used by EPA and other states. The frame was constructed by overlaying the 138 Maryland 8-digit watershed boundaries (Figure 2-1) on a map of all stream reaches in the study area as digitized on a U.S. Geological Survey 1:100,000-scale map. It includes all non-tidal stream reaches of fourth-order and smaller, excluding impoundments that are non-wadeable or that substantially alter the riverine nature of the reach (see Kazyak 1994). Fourth-order streams were included to ensure that all the streams classified as third-order by the 1:250,000 map (and sampled in the 1995-1997 MBSS) were also covered in the 2000-2004 MBSS. Four 8-digit watersheds (Atlantic Ocean, plus the Upper, Middle, and Lower Chesapeake Bay) were excluded from the sample frame because they describe marine/estuarine waters and do not contain non-tidal streams. Of the 134 watersheds included in the frame, 79 contained less than 100 non-tidal stream miles each; these were combined into 29 ""super-watersheds"" with between 2 and 7 constituent 8-digit watersheds each. When combined with the 55 remaining ""stand alone"" watersheds, a total of 84 watersheds of concern were identified as discrete sampling units for the Round Two (Table 2-1). The Strahler convention (Strahler 1957) was used for identifying stream reaches in each 8-digit watershed by order. First order reaches, for example, are the most upstream reaches in the branching stream system. The designation of stream order for a particular reach depends on the scale and accuracy of the map.  2 .2  STATISTICAL METHODS  2.2.1 Survey Design 2.2.3 Sample Selection The second round of the MBSS is being conducted over five years starting in the year 2000. The Round Two Survey was designed to provide an assessment of stream condition in each of the Maryland 8-digit watersheds that contain nontidal streams. It also facilitates the assessment of average stream condition over the five-year period for (1) the entire state, (2) the 17 major (Maryland 6-digit) drainage basins, and (3) other areas of interest such as counties and regions. The design was subject to the following level-of-effort constraints: (1) that a maximum of 300 sites be sampled per year, with approximately 210 allocated to the core random The second round of MBSS was restricted to a maximum of 300 sampling sites per year (210 within the core survey). Hence, it was not practical to stratify the network of streams in Maryland by 8-digit watersheds and sample them annually  2-1   2-2 Figure 2-1. Maryland 8-digit watersheds by region   Table 2-1.

In addition, the costs of traveling to sample each watershed each year would be high, resulting in fewer than 210 sites being sampled annually. As an alternative to stratifying by watershed, the Survey designated the 84 watershed units of concern (both 55 single watershed units and 29 superwatersheds) as primary sampling units (PSUs). A subset of the 84 PSUs will be selected randomly each year, with restrictions to ensure that all 8-digit watersheds are sampled once during the five-year sampling period. Using this approach, a representative sub-set of watersheds can be studied each year, covering all the 84 watersheds of concern over a five-year period.  being selected. This probability-based sampling facilitates the estimation of statewide average condition over the 5-year study period with quantifiable precision based on the Horvitz-Thompson estimator (Horvitz and Thompson 1952; Thompson 1992). It also allows estimation of statewide conditions for each year of the Survey. 2.2.3.2 Stratified Random Sampling within PSUs Within each PSU, the elementary sampling units from which field data are collected (i.e., the 75-m stream segments or sites) are selected using either stratified random sampling with proportional allocation, or simple random sampling (Cochran 1977). This allocation ensures that all sites in a PSU stream network have the same probability of being selected. The target sample size in each PSU is a minimum of 10 sites for the spring benthic sampling. Because of imperfections in the sample frame, a list of random replacement sites is provided for each PSU. When the Round Two design was proposed, the target minimum of 10 sites per PSU was determined by analyzing the expected variability in IBI mean scores and percentage stream mile estimates as a function of varying sample size. Analysis (as presented in Southerland et al. 2000) indicated that fewer than 10 sites per PSU would not yield sufficient precision in stream mile estimates. Working with DNR, the survey designers determined that 10 sites per watershed would yield an acceptable level of precision while remaining within other design constraints (i.e., the annual level of effort available for sampling and the maximum sampling interval of five years for the statewide survey). When feasible, the streams in each of the 55 PSUs consisting of a single 8-digit watershed were grouped into two strata based on stream order. One stratum includes all the first- and second-order streams, while the other includes all the third- and fourth-order streams. The number of sites in each of the two strata are allocated proportional to their stream length, resulting in equal sampling density for the two strata. In watersheds where the proportion of stream miles in one stratum (e.g., third- and fourth-order streams) is significantly below 10%, the stringent proportional allocation could not be achieved because it would result in allocation of less than one sample site to this stratum. Samples were not forced into strata that contained a minimal portion of stream miles, because this would eliminate the simplicity of equal probability sampling. Instead, the strata for such  2.2.3.1 Lattice Sampling of Watersheds (PSUs) Lattice sampling was used to schedule the sampling of all 84 watersheds (PSUs) over a 5-year period (see Cochran 1977; Jessen 1978). A sampling frame for selecting watersheds across time was formed by arranging the PSUs into a lattice with 84 rows and one column for each year (Table 2-1). The 84 PSUs were stratified into five physiographic regions (strata) to ensure that their sampling is spread out geographically during each sample year (Figure 2-2). These five regions include whole major (Maryland 6-digit) drainage basins and divide the State into approximately equal parts. This stratification by region was done to spread out the sampling in space and thereby increase precision in statewide estimates; the geographic strata are not considered important reporting units. A first-stage random sample of PSUs is drawn from each region in each year, with restrictions to ensure that all 84 watersheds (PSUs) of concern are sampled at least once during the 5-year sampling period. The lattice sampling supports an estimate of average statewide condition over the 5-year period. This strategy is similar to the lattice design used in the 1994 Demonstration Study (Vlstad et. al 1996) and the 1995-1997 MBSS Round One design (Roth et al. 1999); it takes into account the restrictions in annual sampling effort. About one-fifth of the watersheds in each of the five regions are randomly selected (without replacement) each year. In addition, two randomly selected watersheds in each region are being sampled twice during the five-year Survey (in randomly selected years). The representative sampling over time, augmented by repeated sampling of watersheds, ensures that all PSUs and pairs of PSU combinations have a known probability (greater than zero) of  2-6   2-7  Figure 2-2. MBSS 2000-2004 Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) and sampling schedule   PSUs were collapsed, and a simple random sample of sites from all streams was selected. A different stratification was used for the 29 PSUs consisting of more than one 8-digit watershed (i.e., the superwatersheds). For these PSUs, each constituent 8-digit watershed was designated a stratum, and the strata receive equal sampling fractions (i.e., proportional to stream miles in each 8-digit watershed). This stratification of super-watersheds was done to ensure that the non-tidal streams in each individual 8-digit watershed were sampled. While this approach may increase precision of stratified estimates for the super-watershed, the precision in estimates for individual 8-digit watersheds will generally be low because of low sample sizes. The limited sample sizes allocated to each PSU did not allow further stratification of the superwatersheds by stream order. When one or more of the initial sample of stream segments in a PSU could not be sampled (e.g., dry stream or no permission to access), the stratification of the PSU was  abandoned, and the replacement sites were selected from a list of simple random sites. This adjustment was made because the fraction of unsampleable sites cannot be adequately quantified for individual strata with low sample sizes.  2.2.3.3 Allocation of Additional Sites to Large Watersheds Additional sites were allocated to 22 watersheds with more than 100 non-tidal stream miles. Increased sample sizes in these watersheds will reduce the variance of key estimates and improve statewide estimates (by more closely approximating statewide allocation proportional to stream miles). Over the five-year Survey, a total of 106 additional sites were allocated proportional to stream miles within these large watersheds (Table 2-2).  Table 2-2.

The stream order of each reach was attributed on the 1:100,000-scale USGS Digital Line Graph (DLG) maps. If necessary, 1:24,000-scale USGS topographic maps were used as references to identify flow patterns or to see more detail. Where necessary, maps from Pennsylvania and Delaware were used to identify the stream order of water bodies originating outside of Maryland. Random Site Picks. Once the sample frame was developed for a PSU, sites were randomly assigned according to the stratified design described above using a FORTRAN-based program. If the proportion of stream miles in the smallest strata (either stream-orderbased in single watershed PSUs or watershed-based in the super-watersheds) was greater than or equal to 10%, sites were allocated proportionally among strata; if it was less than 10%, the strata were collapsed and sites allocated by simple random sampling. After the target number of sites was selected (10 to 21 sites depending on PSU size), a simple random selection of ""extra sites"" to a total of 50 was chosen in each PSU using the GIS. This was done to ensure that a sufficient number of sites remained available for sampling after permission denials and unsampleable sites were removed from consideration. Each sample point chosen on the GIS was designated as the midpoint of the 75-m sampling segment in the field. Sites selected less than 75 meters from another randomly-selected site (both upstream and downstream) were eliminated. Sites that could possibly cross stream network nodes were not eliminated from the program; it was assumed that these sites could be adjusted in the field by moving the starting point away from the node, but staying within the designated stream order. Each site was then attributed with the following information:      stream order county basin physiographic region northing, easting     latitude and longitude (both in decimal degrees and in degrees, minutes, seconds) watershed name and MD 8-digit watershed code.  2.2.5 Permissions from Landowners  Extra Permissions. Permission was solicited to sample from landowners at twice the number of sites allocated to each PSU by the design (usually 20 sites, but from 26 to 42 in the larger watersheds). While the allocated number of sites (usually 10) were selected from the appropriate strata (see above), the ""extra sites"" were chosen to fill out the list, regardless of stream order. At the completion of site selection for each county, sites were sent to DNR for generation of 1:24,000-scale topographic maps and communication of sites to local governments planning stream monitoring. Landowner Identification. Each site was plotted on county tax maps using the Maryland Office of Planning Maryland Property View System obtained from DNR. From this, property owners could be identified, both for the site containing the point and for any areas required to access the stream. Phone numbers were obtained from the internet using a white pages directory (http://www.switchboard.com). Landowner Contact. If the phone number was unlisted, a letter was prepared requesting permission to access the property, including a written form and telephone contact information through which the landowner could respond. The letter also provided a MBSS brochure and telephone number to call for more information. If the number was listed, the property owner was called and permission to access the site was requested. After 2-3 calls and no success, a letter was sent. If the owner gave permission, the caller requested additional information about the site, such as whether the stream was often dry or hard to access. The caller also recorded whether the crew needed to make a pre-visit call to the landowner or whether the owner had to be available to open gates or walk the crew through the property. All property owner information was entered and maintained in a Microsoft Access database. Field Crew Information. Permission packets were then prepared for the field crews. Packets contained a printout of the property owner information for each site and a tax map showing possible access routes. The callers attempted to obtain permissions for the          2-9   target sites in the proportions that stream orders occur in each PSU. In addition, permissions were obtained for extra sites (up to 50% more than the targeted number) to account for non-sampleable sites. These extra sites represent a simple random sample and may or may not be of the same stream order as the originally selected sites (for example, if a third- to fourth-order site was unsampleable, the replacement site was the next on the simple random list, regardless of stream order).  For PSUs where stratification could be achieved, stratified estimators were used. Suppose mih sites are chosen randomly in stratum h, within watershed i, and, at each site j, measurements are collected for the variable of interest yihj . Standard stratified estimators (Cochran 1977) are used to estimate means, proportions, and totals when all randomly selected sites in watershed i are sampleable, and the number of stream miles can be determined directly from the sample frame. An estimator for the mean of the variable of interest y is  2 .3  ANALYTICAL METHODS  yi = where    L  h =1  wh y  h  2.3.1 Estimation of Means, Proportions and Totals Within Watersheds (PSUs) 2.3.1.1 Standard Estimators for the MBSS Sampling Program The MBSS sampling design within watersheds (PSUs) involves simple random sampling, or stratified random sampling with proportional allocation of sites across the L strata. Standard PSUs have two strata based on stream order, while the strata in ""super-watersheds"" consist of the constituent 8-digit watersheds (Table 2-3). Table 2-3.

A standard PSU has two strata: (1) 1st - 2nd order streams; and (2) 3rd - 4th order streams. For super-watersheds, the number of strata is equal to the number of 8-digit watersheds within the PSU. Variable of interest associated with site j, j=1,2,...,mrih  where  mrih  1 s= mih 2 ih   j =1  mih  yihj  is the sample variance for the variable of interest in stratum h for watershed i. An estimator for the standard error of yi is  Yrihj  yrihj  Var ( yi  )  .  For simplicity the subscript r for region in the estimators for watersheds was not included. For PSUs with collapsed strata, estimates of means, totals, and proportions are based on the standard estimators for simple random sampling (Cochran 1977).  The same estimators can be used to estimate proportions of stream miles in a specific class by introducing an indicator variable that takes the value 1 when the variable y meets the condition (e.g., pH < 6), and zero otherwise. The mean of this indicator using the estimators above is an estimate of the proportion of stream miles within the specific class (e.g., proportion of stream miles with pH < 6). When estimating  2-10   proportions, the MBSS samples can be treated as repeated independent samples of binary observations (1 if pH < 6, and 0 otherwise) because the samples have equal inclusion probabilities. An exact confidence interval for an estimated proportion ( p ) is obtained from the binomial distribution (Collett 1999, pp. 23-24), with lower and upper confidence bounds  p L = y[ y + ( n - y + 1) F2(  n - y +1),2 y  ( / 2)]  -1  assumption is reasonable because the sampling fractions in the strata are equal, and each stream site has the same probability of being selected. Let the domain of study (MBSS target streams) in watershed i contain M di stream  miles, and let mi be the number of sites of the simple random sample of size mi that happens to fall in this domain. If yk (k=1,2,..., mi ) are the measurements of the  variable of interest from these sites, the mean for domain d is estimated by  pU = ( y + 1)[ y + 1 + ( n - y ) F2(  y +1), 2 ( n - y )  ( / 2)]  -1  yid =    mi  k =1  yk  mi  resp ectively, wh e r e Fv1, v 2 ( / 2) i s the upper (100 / 2 ) % point in the F-distribution with v1 and v2 degrees of freedom, and y is the observed number of successes (e.g., number of sites with IBI < 3) out of the n observations in a watershed. An estimator for the total of a variable of interest (e.g., number of fish) in a watershed i is obtained by extrapolating the mean to all stream miles  and an estimate for the standard error of yid is  sid mi where  $ Yi = Mi yi with standard error  s= 2 id   k =1  mi  ( yk - yid )  mi - 1  2  M i Var ( yi  )  .  In practice some of the random sites m ih selected in a watershed i may fall outside the defined target streams for MBSS. During periods of drought, for example, sections of streams represented on the 1:100,000-scale map used in MBSS may not exist. Also, because of imperfections in the sample frame, some selected sites may fall outside the actual network of target streams defined by MBSS. Loss of samples was anticipated in the MBSS, and a list of randomly selected replacement sites was provided for the sampling crews. For the MBSS, estimates are made for the target streams, which may be a subpopulation of streams within an imperfect sample frame. This subpopulation isreferred to as a domain of study (U.N. Subcommission on Sampling 1950). For the MBSS, unsampleable streams are outside the domain of study. In this case, the Survey is interested in estimating parameters for the domain of study, i.e., for ""MBSS target streams."" All samples in watershed i can be treated as a simple random sample of size mi , because samples were allocated to strata proportional to their stream length. This  The finite population correction factor can safely be ignored because the sampling fraction (i.e., the number of 75-m segments sampled relative to all available) within each watershed is small.  2.3.1.2 Estimators for Combining MBSS with Additional Probability-based Sampling Programs When additional MBSS compatible data for a watershed are available from a probability-based sampling program, it is possible to combine the data by using a composite estimator (Vlstad et al. 2002). Assume that MBSS and a County program provide simultaneous estimates of the mean IBI for  2-11   a watershed, and that the total length of streams covered by each survey j is L j . The combined mean IBI for the watershed can then be estimated by a linear combination of the individual survey weighted means (Korn and Graubard 1999) y1 and y 2 ,  proportion of stream miles within the specific class (e.g., proportion of stream miles with pH < 6). The estimation of exact confidence intervals for pooled data based on the binomial distribution (section 2.3.1.1) is valid only if the County program also employs simple random or an equivalent sampling design .  y=  (  k1 L1 ) y1 + ( k 2 L2 k1 L1 + k 2 L2  )  y  2  2.3.1.3 Estimators for Combining MBSS Data Across Sampling Rounds While IBI data from the two rounds (e.g., 1996 and 2000 data) cannot simply be pooled because of the different study designs, the mean IBIs from the two rounds can be combined. In a watershed where there are sufficient samples in each round to calculate a mean and standard error, the estimates for each round can be combined into a single estimate using composite estimation (Korn and Graubard 1999). It is recommended that the combined estimate only be applied when the combined data represent an effective sample size of at least 10 samples. For MBSS Round One, a minimum of two samples per stratum are required (i.e., two samples in each of stream orders 1, 2, and 3). Assume that two rounds provide estimates for the same population of streams, as defined on the 100,000 scale map, and that the two surveys were independent. Under this assumption temporal differences in the actual stream network caused by variation in rainfall or other factors are not taken into account. Let x1 and x2 be the mean IBIs for two rounds, with respective standard errors SE1 and SE 2 calculated according to the respective survey design. Equal weights are assigned to each year's estimate, and use the simple combined estimator  If y1 and y 2 are approximately unbiased for the population mean IBI, then y will also be unbiased. The variance of y is minimized by using the weights  kj =  L1 + L2 2L j  Var ( y )   1-  Var ( y ) + Var ( y )    j 1 2  ,  which grant more influence to precise estimates and greater survey coverage. To estimate the variance of the combined mean y assume that each survey j has S j number of strata; j = 1,2. The population of stream segments in the watershed is treated as if it was composed of S = S1 + S 2 strata. This stratification controls for survey differences (Korn and Graubard 1999). When the two surveys are independent,  Var ( y ) = where the strata weights   i =1  S  wi Var ( yi )  2  wi =  Li  x=  x1 + x 2  2   i =1  S  Li  for the pooled mean IBI, with variance 1 4  are the fractions of the total stream length (for both surveys) in each stratum. An estimator for the standard error of y is  var( x ) =  {  var( x ) + var( x )} 1 2  Var ( y  )  .  and standard error  The same estimators can be used to estimate proportions of stream miles in a specific class by introducing an indicator variable that takes the value 1 when the variable y meets the condition (e.g., pH < 6), and zero otherwise. The mean of this indicator using the estimators above is an estimate of the  SE =  1 SE12 + SE 2  2 2  This simple approach was applied to avoid that the combined mean would be driven by the estimate for one  2-12   particular year. When more than one survey is conducted in a watershed during the same year it is recommended that the means be weighted based on sample sizes or their variances (Korn and Graubard 1999). When significant differences occur between the sampling frames for two surveys in a watershed because of differences in maps scale (1:24,000 verus 100,000, for example), and their variances this should also be accounted for by adjusting the weights (Korn and Graubard 1999; Vlstad et al. 2002). The difference in map scale between the two MBSS sampling rounds (1:250,000 versus 1:100,000) is likely to have only a small effect on the mean IBI scores because the network of streams on the two maps approximately overlaps. The 1:100,000 map includes a certain number of small headwater streams that are not included on the 1:250,000 map. However, the MBSS IBI scoring is only applied to streams in catchments over 300 acres, and thus it is reasonable to assume that the target population of streams are the same across rounds.  reached and did not respond to letters and telephone messages. The success rate was 91% for landowners who responded to phone or letter permission requests. Reasons for permission denial varied widely and generally reflected the preferences of individual landowners regarding property access, rather than any specific types of land. In rare cases, permission denial may affect the interpretation of MBSS estimates, but only where denials occur in streams with characteristics that differ from the general population of streams. During 2001 sampling, it did not appear that permission denials affected MBSS estimates.  2.5  NUMBER OF SITES SAMPLED IN 2001  2.3.1.4 Testing for Differences in Mean IBI Scores Between Years Comparisons of statistical differences between mean IBI scores from two years were conducted using the standard method recommended by Schenker and Gentleman (2001). This test was used because it is more robust than the commonly used method of examining the overlap between the two associated confidence intervals. Assume ^ ^ that Q 1 and Q 2 are two independent estimates of mean IBI, and that the associated standard errors (SE) are ^ ^ estimated by SE and S E . We estimated the 95% ^ ^ Q 1 - Q 2 by confidence interval for 1 2  As stated in Section 2.2.3.2 above, the target sample size in each PSU is a minimum of 10 sites for the spring benthic sampling. Additional sites were allocated to the larger PSUs sampled in 2001: Youghiogeny River (6 extra), Seneca Creek (5 extra), Deer Creek (4 extra), Zekiah Swamp (3 extra), Patuxent River Middle (3 extra), Upper Pocomoke River (3 extra). Table 2-5 lists the number of sites sampled for spring benthic, physical habitat, and water chemistry sampling. For most nearly all PSUs, the number of sites actually sampled equaled or exceeded the target number specified in the design. Ten sites were unsampleable in the spring for a variety of reasons, including dry stream beds and impoundments. Note that in both Assawoman/Isle of Wight/Sinepuxent/Newport/ Chincoteague Bays and Sassafras River/Stillpond-Fairlee, only nine sites were sampled instead of the targeted ten. This was due to an abundance of dry streams in each of the watersheds and/or lower than anticipated landowner permission rates in those PSUs. During summer sampling, a small number of sites that had been sampled in the spring were unsampleable for several reasons, the most common being that the stream had dried up. Table 2-6 lists the number of sites that were electrofished during the summer of 2001. It also lists the number of sites where summer habitat and water quality measures were taken, as well as the number of sites where amphibians and reptiles, mussels, and aquatic vegetation were qualitatively sampled.  ^ ^ ^ ^ (Q - Q )  1.96 SE + SE 2 1 2 1  [  2  2  ]  1/ 2  and tested (at 5% nominal level) the null hypothesis that ^ ^ Q1 - Q2 = 0 by examining whether the 95% confidence interval contains 0.

For 2001, the overall success rate for obtaining permissions was 68% (Table 2-4). Cases where permissions were not obtained included both denials (9%) as well as non-responses (23%), when landowners were unable to be  2-13   Table 2-4.

While it is recognized that several different index periods may be used for benthic sampling, the MBSS chose the spring index period for logistical purposes. Fish, amphibian, reptile, and aquatic vegetation surveys, along with physical habitat evaluations, were conducted during the low-flow period in summer. Fish community composition tends to be stable during summer, and low flow is advantageous for electrofishing. Because lowflow conditions in summer may be a primary factor limiting the abundance and distribution of fish populations, habitat assessments were performed during the summer.  To reduce temporal variability, sampling was conducted within specific, relatively narrow time intervals, referred to as index periods. The spring index period was defined by degree-day limits for specific parts of the state. The spring index period was between March 1 and about May 1, with the end of the index period determined by degree-day accumulation as specified in Hilsenhoff (1987). In 2001, all spring samples were collected in March, well before degreeday accumulation limits were approached. The targeted summer index period was between June 1 and September 30 (Kazyak 2001). In 2001, all summer sampling was completed by the end of August, well before the end of the targeted index period. While the spring index period is two months in duration because of changing weather conditions (possible rapid warming leading to changes in stream condition), the summer index period is four months long because weather conditions are more consistent throughout the season and fish sampling is more time consuming.  2-14   Table 2-5.

Grab samples were collected in 0.5 and 1-liter bottles for analysis of all analytes except pH. Water samples for pH were collected with 60 ml syringes, which allowed purging of air bubbles to minimize changes in carbon dioxide content (EPA 1987). Samples were stored on wet ice and shipped on wet ice to the analytical laboratory within 48 hours. The requirement to filter for some analytes within 48 hours was exceeded by several hours for some samples. Laboratory analyses were carried out by the University of Maryland's Appalachian Laboratory in Frostburg. Chemical analysis of water samples followed standard methods as listed in Table 2-7. Routine daily quality control (QC) checks included processing duplicate, blank, and calibration samples according to EPA guidelines for each analyte. Field duplicates were taken at 5% of all sites. Routine QC checks helped to identify and correct errors in sampling routines or instrumentation at the earliest possible stage. Standard operating procedures were implemented that detail the requirements for the correct performance of analytical procedures. The internal QA/QC protocols followed guidelines outlined in EPA (1987). The complete QA/QC report for 2001 MBSS laboratory analysis can be found in Kline and Morgan (2001). QC results were examined in conjunction with site data and are summarized in a separate report (Mercurio et al. 2002). During the summer index period, in situ measurements of dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, temperature, and conductivity were collected at each site to further characterize existing water quality conditions that might influence biological communities. Measurements were made at an undisturbed section of the segment, usually in the middle of the stream channel and at the upstream segment boundary, using electrode probes. Instruments were calibrated daily and calibration logbooks were maintained to document instrument performance. In 2001, there were no quality assurance problems apparent in log books and other documentation (Mercurio et al. 2002). 2.6.3 Benthic Macroinvertebrates  (Stribling et al. 1998). Recognizing that Maryland streams vary from high-gradient riffle habitat with abundant cobble substrate to low-gradient Coastal Plain streams with sandy or silty bottoms, MBSS employs a ""D"" net suitable for sampling a wide variety of habitats. This multi-habitat approach is consistent with the recommendations of the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Streams Workgroup (MACS 1996) and the EPA's most recent Rapid Bioassessment Protocols (Barbour et al. 1999). At each segment, a 600-micron mesh ""D"" net was used to collect organisms from habitats likely to support the greatest taxonomic diversity. This habitat often includes a riffle area when present. Other habitats, in order of preference, include gravel, broken peat, or clay lumps in a run area; snags or logs that create a partial dam or are in run habitat; undercut banks and associated root mats; and SAV and detrital/sand areas in moving water. In riffles and most other habitats, sampling involved placing the net downstream, gently rubbing surficial substrates by hand to dislodge organisms, and disrupting deeper substrates using vigorous foot action. Each dip of the net covered one-two square feet, and a total of approximately 2.0 m2 (20 square feet) of combined substrates was sampled; samples were preserved in 70% ethanol. Duplicate benthic samples were taken at 19 MBSS sites to assess the replicability of the field methods. In the laboratory, the preserved sample was transferred to a gridded pan and organisms were picked from randomly selected grid cells until the cell that contained the 100th individual (if possible) was completely picked. Some samples had fewer than 100 individuals. The benthic macroinvertebrates were identified to genus, or lowest practicable taxon, in the laboratory. To aid in identification, oligochaete and chironomid taxa were slide-mounted and identified under a microscope. Laboratory QC procedures included the re-subsampling and identification of every 20th sample. This second sample was identified according to standard procedures and comparisons were made between the two duplicates. For the 2001 sampling year, samples from 13 sites were re-subsampled for QC purposes. The MBSS voucher specimen collection is currently maintained at the Maryland DNR Field Office in Annapolis, Maryland. A complete description of laboratory protocols can be found in Boward and Friedman (2000) and results of the QC analysis can be found in Mercurio et al. (2002). In macroinvertebrate monitoring, the decision to employ a particular subsample size (100 vs. 200 or greater) reflects a balance of how to best utilize program effort. While a  Benthic macroinvertebrates were collected to provide a semi-quantitative description of the community composition at each sampling site. Sampling was conducted during the spring index period. Benthic community data were collected primarily for the purpose of calculating DNR's Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (BIBI) for Maryland streams  2-16   Table 2-7.

If a program goal is better precision in characterizing watersheds, the added effort might be spent on a sampling more sites per watershed. At the outset of the MBSS monitoring program, a decision was made that 100-organism subsamples would provide acceptable precision at the single site level, and that, within a given total cost, effort would instead be focused on maximizing the total number of sites that could be sampled. However, DNR is interested in further investigating the effect of 100vs. 200-organism subsampling. In a related study currently underway with Montgomery County Department of Environmental Protection (with EPA sponsorship), the effects of 100 vs. 200 organism subsampling are being evaluated, including optimization analysis to assess the tradeoffs between subsample size and total number of sites, given a fixed total cost for a monitoring program. 2.6.4 Fish  Fish were sampled during the summer index period using double-pass electrofishing within 75-meter stream segments. Block nets were placed at each end of the segment and direct current backpack electrofishing units were used to sample the entire segment. An attempt was made to thoroughly fish each segment on each pass, sampling all habitat within the entire stream segment. A consistent effort was applied over the two passes. This sampling approach allowed calculation of several metrics constituting the biological index and produced estimates of fish species abundance. In small streams, a single electrofishing unit was used. In larger streams, two or more were employed to effectively sample the site. Captured fish from each pass were identified to species, weighed in aggregate, counted, and released. Any individuals that could not be identified to species were retained for laboratory confirmation, and a voucher series of about 10 individuals was retained for each major (Maryland 6-digit) drainage basin. For each pass, all individuals of each gamefish species (defined as trout, bass,  2-17   walleye, northern pike, chain pickerel, and striped bass) were measured for total length. For each species, unusual occurrences of visible external pathologies or anomalies were noted. All voucher specimens and fish retained for positive identification in the laboratory were examined and verified by Dr. Rich Raesley, an ichthyologist at Frostburg State University, Frostburg, Maryland. All MBSS collections are archived in the fish museum at Frostburg State University. 2.6.5 Amphibians and Reptiles At each segment sampled during the summer, amphibians and reptiles found during the course of electrofishing and other activities were captured, identified, and recorded. Individuals were identified to species when possible, but larval salamanders and tadpoles were not retained. Voucher specimens and individuals not positively identifiable in the field were retained for examination in the laboratory. 2.6.6 Mussels During the summer index period, freshwater mussels were sampled by visual inspection at each 75-meter stream segment. The presence of Unionid mussels or Asiastic clam (Corbicula fluminea ) was recorded as live, old shell, or recent shell. 2.6.7 Aquatic and Streamside Vegetation During the summer index period, aquatic vegetation was sampled qualitatively by examining each 75-meter stream segment for the presence of aquatic plants. The presence and relative abundance of submerged, emergent, and floating aquatic vegetation were recorded. In addition, the presence and relative abundance of invasive terrestrial plant species (e.g., multiflora rose) were recorded during summer sampling. 2.6.8 Physical Habitat Habitat assessments were conducted during summer sampling at all stream segments as a means of assessing the importance of physical habitat to the biological integrity and fishability of freshwater streams in Maryland. Procedures for habitat assessment (Kazyak 2001) were derived from two commo n l y used me t h odol og i e s : EPA's R a pi d Bioassessment Protocols (RBPs) (Plafkin et al. 1989), as modified by Barbour and Stribling (1991), and the Ohio  EPA's Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QHEI) (Ohio EPA 1987, Rankin 1989). During spring, riparian zone vegetation type and width on each bank was estimated to the nearest meter (up to 50 meters from stream). Severity and type of buffer breaks were noted. Local land use type and the extent and type of stream channelization were recorded and stream gradient was measured. Crews also recorded distance from road and assigned a trash rating (based on visible signs of human refuse at a site) to characterize human presence. During summer sampling, several habitat characteristics (instream habitat, epifaunal substrate, velocity/depth diversity, pool/glide/eddy quality, and riffle/run quality) were assessed qualitatively on a 0-20 scale, based on visual observations within each segment. The percentage of embededdness of the stream channel and the percentage of shading of the stream site were estimated. Also recorded were the extent and severity of bank erosion and bar formation, number of woody debris and rootwads within the stream channel, and the presence of various stream features such as substrate types, various morphological characteristics, and beaver ponds. Maximum depth within the segment was measured. Wetted width, thalweg depth, and thalweg velocity were recorded at four transects. A complete velocity/depth profile was taken at one transect to compute discharge (streamflow); for sites with extremely low flow, the speed of a floating object was substituted to allow calculation of discharge. Recognizing that water temperature is an important factor affecting stream condition (but one that varies daily and seasonally), the Survey deployed temperature loggers at most sites. A single Onset Computer Corporation Optic Stowaway model temperature logger was anchored in each sample site during the summer index period. They recorded the water temperature every 20 minutes from approximately June 1 until September 1. Field crews had the option of retrieving the loggers during summer sampling if the site was visited after August 15. In some cases, the same logger was used for two sites if they were close together on the same reach. Also, if a site was nearly dry in the spring, field crews may have elected not to deploy a logger. 2 .7 QUALITY ASSURANCE  Quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) are integral parts of the data collection and management activities of the Survey. The Survey employs well-established QA/QC procedures, as detailed in Kazyak (2001). Some key points are highlighted below.  2-18   2.7.1 Data Management All crews used standardized pre-printed data forms developed for the Survey to ensure that all data for each sampling segment were recorded and standard units of measure were used. Using standard data forms facilitates data entry and minimizes transcription error. The field crew leader and a second reviewer checked all data sheets for completeness and legibility before leaving each sampling location. Original data sheets were sent to the Data Management Officer for further review, another signoff, and data entry, while copies were retained by the field crews. A custom database application (written in Microsoft Access), in which the input module was designed to match each of the field data sheets, was used for data entry. Data were independently entered into two databases and compared using a computer program as a quality-control procedure. Differences between the two databases were resolved from original data sheets or through discussions with field crew leaders. 2.7.2 QA/QC for Field Sampling A Quality Control Officer (QC Officer) experienced in all aspects of the Survey was appointed to administer the quality assurance program. Specific quality assurance activities administered by the QC Officer included preparing a field manual of standard sampling protocols, designing standard forms for recording field data, conducting field crew training and proficiency examinations, conducting field and laboratory audits, making independent habitat assessments, identifying taxa, reviewing all reports, and reporting errors. To ensure consistent implementation of sampling procedures and a high level of technical competency, experienced field biologists were assigned to each crew and all field personnel completed program training before participating in field sampling. Training topics included MBSS program orientation, stream segment location using global positioning system (GPS) equipment, sampling protocols, operation and maintenance of sampling equipment, data transcription, quality assurance/quality control, and safety. The spring field crews received additional training in sampling protocols for water quality and benthic macroinvertebrates. The summer field crews received additional training in habitat assessment methods, taxonomy, and in situ water chemistry assessment. Training included classroom, laboratory, and field activities. Instructors emphasized the objectives of the Survey and the importance of strict adherence to the sampling protocols. The QC Officer conducted proficiency examinations to evaluate the effectiveness of the training program and ensure  that the participants had detailed knowledge of the sampling protocols. Members of the spring sampling crew were required to demonstrate proficiency in techniques for collecting samples for water chemistry and benthic macroinvertebrates. At least one member of each summer sampling crew was required to pass a comprehensive fish taxonomy examination. Each crew also demonstrated proficiency in locating pre-selected stream segments using the GPS receiver and determining if the segment was acceptable for sampling. Comprehensive ""dry runs"" were conducted to simulate actual field conditions and evaluate classroom instruction. Field audits were conducted by the QC Officer during the field sampling to assess the adequacy of training, adherence to sampling protocols, and accuracy of data transcription. The audits included evaluation of the preparation and planning prior to field sampling, stream segment location using GPS equipment and assessment of acceptability for sampling, adherence to sampling protocols, data transcription, and equipment maintenance and calibration. The QC Officer made an independent assessment of habitat at all segments where field audits were done (approximately 7.5% of the total number of sites). A separate QA report (Mercurio et al. 2002) reports on details of QA activities for the 2001 sampling year. 2 .8 CLIMATIC CONDITIONS  Because all flow in Maryland streams ultimately arises from precipitation, weather is an important factor in stream condition. In Maryland, annual precipitation varies geographically, averaging between 40 and 50 inches. In the western half of the state, the prevailing winds are from the west, typically mixing moisture from the south with colder temperatures from the north. Because of these prevailing winds and Maryland's mountain ridges (which create a rainshadow effect), rain and snowfall are greater in the west and precipitation tends to be heavier on west-facing slopes. In the eastern half of the state, prevailing winds are also westerly, but many storm events are also influenced by moisture from the coast and precipitation patterns there reflect that influence. These precipitation patterns have an obvious effect on runoff, a primary factor in determining stream characteristics. Because the flow of water (stream discharge) is one of the critical determinants of stream habitat quantity and quality, drier portions of the state should have less aquatic habitat than areas that are wetter. Temporal changes in the amount of precipitation are also important in determining the amount of habitat available to aquatic organisms. Figures 2-3 through 2-5 show the monthly deviation from normal precipitation (in inches) for the years 1998-2000 (NOAA 1998, NOAA 1999, and  2-19   NOAA 2001). This number is the average of the deviation from normal precipitation (calculated using 100 years of precipitation data) in eight regions of the state, so it is possible that some effects seen only in the eastern portion of the state may be masked by events in the western portion of the state and vice versa. Actual monthly values for each region are shown in Appendix A. In 1998, the first six months of the year were wetter than normal, with January, the wettest month, averaging 2.88 inches of precipitation wetter than normal. The last six months of 1998 were drier than normal, with November averaging 2.45 inches of precipitation less than normal. Total precipitation for 1998 was 1.66 inches above normal. The spring and summer of 1999 experienced drought conditions (especially noticed in the eastern portions of the state) with the average precipitation in April through July  experiencing between 2.44 and 1.64 inches less precipitation than normal. In September, Hurricane Floyd hit most of central and eastern Maryland, causing average precipitation to jump to almost 7 inches above normal. During this month, some streams, including Gwynns Falls in Baltimore, exceeded the flood of record. By October, precipitation had stabilized to normal, and in November and December, the state was experiencing less than normal amounts of precipitation. Total precipitation for 1999 was 0.58 inches below normal, showing that the extended drought had more of influence on precipitation patterns than the hurricane. Spring and summer months of 2000 experienced greater than normal amounts of precipitation (with the exception of May), while fall and winter months experienced less precipitation than normal. While the spring and summer months (with the exception of April) of 2001 received greater than normal amounts of precipitation the fall and winter months' precipitation amounts were drastically below normal. This circumstance lead to a deficit of almost 6 inches of rain for the year 2001, the beginning of a drought condition.  2-20   De v ia t i on f r om No r m a l P r e c ip i t a t ion ( in) 19 98 8 6 Inches from Normal 4 2 0 Ja n -2 -4 Fe b Ma r A pr il Ma y Ju n e July A ug Sep Oc t No v De c T o t a l  Figure 2-3.

Separate sections focus on biodiversity, biological indicator results, and three predominant issues affecting biological resources: acidification, physical habitat, and nutrients and other water chemistry. The indicators used were developed during Round One of the MBSS and have been deemed reliable for representing ecological condition by field verification and expert peer review. Nonetheless, the MBSS continues to pursue refinements to its indicators including improvements to the provisional physical habitat index (PHI), methods for combining indicators that do not lose information (e.g., combined biotic index), and changes to the indicator thresholds and scoring methods to make them more intuitive and accessible to the public. banded sunfish (36 at 3 sites and 26 at 3 sites, respectively). Banded sunfish were also found in Upper Pocomoke (58 at 4 sites). Further west, the following fish were found: logperch in Deer Creek (9 at 1 site), comely shiner at Piscataway Creek (29 at 1 site) and Sideling Hill Creek (2 at 2 sites), and shield darter at Deer Creek (58 at 3 sites) and Little Gunpowder Falls (17 at 2 sites). In addition to state-listed fish species, four species found at less than 2% of the MBSS sites sampled in Round One were also sampled in 2001: American brook lamprey (Lampetra appendix), warmouth (Lepomis gulosus), rainbow darter (Etheostoma caeruleum), and johnny darter (Etheostoma nigrum). The American brook lamprey was found at 1 site in Patuxent River Middle and 4 sites in Western Branch. The warmouth was found at two sentinel sites (in Lower Chester River and Mattawoman Creek), Stillpond-Fairlee, and 4 sites in Zekiah Swamp. The rainbow darter was found at 3 sites in Sideling Hill, while the johnny darter was found at 1 site in Youghiogheny River.  3.1 BIODIVERSITY In addition to assessing the integrity of streams and watersheds, the Survey provides invaluable information on the abundance and distribution of rare species. Documenting the presence (and ultimately abundance in the five-year Round Two report) of rare species, the Survey supports a more thorough characterization of Maryland's biodiversity. During MBSS sampling in 2001, a substantial number of rare or unusual occurrences of fish were documented. This chapter presents a brief summary of particularly noteworthy findings. One state-listed endangered species, glassy darter (Etheostoma vitreum), and eight state-listed rare species were observed at MBSS sites in 2001:, ironcolor shiner (Notropis chalybaeus), logperch (Percina caprodes), mud sunfish (Acantharchus pomotis), flier (Centra rchus ma cropterus), banded sunfish (Enneacanthus obesus), swamp darter (Etheostoma fusiforme), comely shiner (Notropis amoenus), and shield darter (Percina peltata). Complete taxa lists of fish, benthic macroinvertebrates, amphibians, and reptiles observed in each PSU are included in Chapter 4 of this report. Two glassy darters were found at one site in Western Branch. Twenty ironcolor shiners (at 1 site), 23 fliers (at 2 sites),and 6 swamp darters (at 2 sites) were found in Zekiah Swamp. The swamp darter was also found in Dividing Creek (8 individuals at 3 sites), Nassawango Creek (3 at 1 site), Nanticoke River (1 at 1 site), and Upper Pocomoke (2 at 1 site). Dividing Creek and Nassawango Creek also had mud sunfish (18 at 3 sites and 2 at 2 sites, respectively) and  3.2 BIOLOGICAL INDICATORS The Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) is a stream assessment tool that evaluates biological integrity based on characteristics of the fish or benthic assemblage at a site. Biological integrity is defined as the ability to support and maintain a balanced, integrated, adaptive community of organisms having a species composition, diversity, and functional organization comparable to that of the natural habitat of the region. -- Karr and Dudley (1981) as cited in Karr (1991) To develop an IBI, reference sites are selected to represent regional natural habitats, also referred to as ""minimally impacted"" conditions. We recognize that virtually no streams in Maryland are entirely undisturbed by human activities. Atmospheric deposition of contaminants alone reaches all parts of the State; few streams have natural temperature regimes; and more than 1,000 man-made barriers to fish migration have been documented in Maryland. Therefore, reference conditions currently in use should not be viewed as completely natural or pristine.  3-1   They are, however, a representative sample of the best streams that currently exist in the State. Whether these conditions are the best attainable depends on future restoration activities and the goals of DNR, other agencies, and the public. Sites were evaluated using both the fish and benthic IBIs developed for the MBSS, indicators previously employed in evaluating Round One results (Roth et al. 1999). For details about IBI development, see Roth et al. (2000) and Stribling et al. (1998). IBI scores for each site were determined by comparing the fish or benthic assemblage to those found at minimally impacted reference sites. Three separate formulations were employed for the fish IBI, one for each of three distinct geographic areas: Coastal Plain, Eastern Piedmont, and Highlands. Two different formulations of the benthic IBI were used in the Coastal Plain and non-Coastal Plain regions. IBIs were calibrated specifically for each ecological region during their development. The MBSS computes the IBI as the average of individual metric scores. Individual metric scores are based on comparison with the distribution of metric values at reference sites within each geographic stratum. Metrics are scored 1 (if < 10th percentile of reference value), 3 (10th to 50th percentile), or 5 (> 50th percentile). The final IBI scores are calculated as the average of three scores and therefore range from 1 to 5. An IBI > 3 indicates the presence of a biological community with attributes (metric values) comparable to those of reference sites, while an IBI < 3 means that, an average, metric values fall short of reference expectations. Table 3-1 contains narrative descriptions for each of the IBI categories developed for the Survey.  Because an IBI score of 3 represents the threshold of reference condition, values less than 3 (i.e., poor or very poor) represent sites suspected to be degraded. In contrast, values greater than or equal to 3 (i.e., fair or good) indicate that most attributes of the community are within the range of those at reference sites. Highest scores (IBI of 4 to 5) were designated as good, recognizing that available reference sites do not necessarily represent the highest attainable condition nor are these sites pristine or completely natural. The assignment of scores to narrative categories is a useful method for translating scores into a form that is easily communicated. The sections below contain a summary of biological indicator results for MBSS core sites sampled in 2001. Included are the fish IBI, benthic IBI, and an integrated summary of both bioindicators, the Combined Biotic Index (CBI), the average of the fish and benthic IBIs or if only one IBI exists for a site that score is used.  3 .2 .1  Fish IBI Results  Although a target of sampling 10 sites per PSU was set, in some cases fewer than 10 sites received fish IBI scores (Table 3-2). A total of 199 core sites in 19 PSUs were sampled for fish during summer 2001. Of these sites, 41 sites were not rated by the fish IBI, as they were very small headwater streams (each with a catchment area less than 300 acres) where expectations of fish abundance and diversity are too low for development of an effective indicator.  Table 3-1. Good  Narrative descriptions of stream biological integrity associated with each of the IBI categories IBI score 4.0 - 5.0 Comparable to reference streams considered to be minimally impacted. On average, biological metrics fall within the upper 50% of reference site conditions. Comparable to reference conditions, but some aspects of biological integrity may not resemble the qualities of these minimally impacted streams. On average, biological metrics fall within the lower portion of the range of reference sites (10th to 50th percentile). Significant deviation from reference conditions, with many aspects of biological integrity not resembling the qualities of these minimally impacted streams, indicating degradation. On average, biological metrics fall below the 10th percentile of reference site values. Strong deviation from reference conditions, with most aspects of biological integrity not resembling the qualities of these minimally impacted streams, indicating severe degradation. On average, biological metrics fall below the 10th percentile of reference site values; most or all metrics are below this level.  Fair  IBI score 3.0 - 3.9  P oor  IBI score 2.0 - 2.9  Very Poor  IBI score 1.0 - 1.9  3-2   Table 3-2.

Sites where brook trout were present (a clear sign of coldwater conditions) and where fish IBI scores were less than 3 were excluded from analysis and reported as ""not rated."" This situation was rare (4 sites). Along with low species richness, naturally acidic blackwater streams may also be dominated by a few acid-tolerant species. Because of the concern for possibly underrating blackwater streams, the 2 blackwater streams with fish IBI scores less than 3 were excluded from analysis and were instead classified as ""not rated."" Blackwater streams were defined as sites with either pH < 5 or ANC < 200 :eq/l and DOC > 8 mg/l. Over time, the Survey plans to build its database of coldwater and blackwater streams to the point where it can develop biological indicators particular to these special stream types. Other factors that may affect fish IBI scores should be considered in interpreting scores for individual sites. Sites with natural features such as bedrock substrate or a small, shallow stream channel may naturally support few species.  Dams and other barriers to fish migration can block access to formerly inhabited upstream areas. In contrast, proximity of a site to a lake, pond, swamp, or impoundment can make a site more accessible to lentic species not typically found in the streams sampled by the Survey. Nearness to a large river confluence can similarly alter the pool of available species. Finally, high species richness owing to the presence of both Coastal Plain and Piedmont species at sites along the Fall Line may result in artificially high IBI scores in this transitional area. Fish IBI scores for sites sampled in the 2001 MBSS spanned the full range of biological condition, from 1.0 (very poor) to 5.0 (good). Fish IBI data for each PSU are depicted in Figure 3-1 and listed in Appendix Table B-1. Mean fish IBIs for PSUs sampled in 2000 and 2001 are mapped in Figure 3-2. Over the next three years of Round Two sampling, data will be collected in remaining PSUs to complete an updated statewide picture of biological conditions. Mean fish IBI per PSU ranged from 1.90 (Potomac River Upper North Branch) to 3.86 (Little Gunpowder Falls).  3-3   Fish IBI  Youghiogheny Pot UN Branch Pot AL/Sideling Seneca Piscataway Potomac UT/Oxon Zekiah Swamp Gilbert Swamp Coastal Bays Western Branch Patuxent Middle Bodkin/Balt Li.

PSUs sampled in 2001 have bolder outlines than those sampled in 2000.  3-5   Data were also used to estimate the extent of streams in poor to very poor condition within each PSU. The MBSS Round Two study design, based on simple random sampling, makes it possible to calculate an exact confidence interval around each estimate based on the binomial distribution. The extent of streams within a given condition (e.g., IBI < 3) is expressed as a percentage of all first-through fourth-order stream miles in the PSU, with an associated 90% confidence interval around the estimate. The 90% confidence interval was selected as the most appropriate for balancing the variability of the data and the need for information to support management decisions. This recognizes that requiring very high confidence can lead to an unnecessarily larg e n u m b e r o f d e c i sio n s n o t to act. Figure 3-3 shows the 90% confidence intervals for the percentage of stream miles with fish IBI < 3, by PSU. Values are listed in Appendix Table B-2. Results indicate that Northeast River/Furnace Bay has the least extensive occurrence of poor to very poor fish IBI scores. With 90% confidence, we can say that only 0-31% of stream miles in  Northeast River/Furnace Bay PSU had poor to very poor fish IBI. In contrast, with 90% confidence we can say that 48 to 99% of stream miles in Potomac River Upper Tidal/ Oxon Creek PSU had poor to very poor fish IBI. Note that confidence intervals are most narrow where (1) conditions tend to be homogeneous (i.e., one condition occurs at all or nearly all sites, whereas the alternative condition occurs at 0 or few sites) and (2) the number of samples is high. For PSUs with small sample size, the confidence interval is, as expected, fairly wide. For example, the four sites in Assawoman/Isle of Wight/ Sinepuxent/ Newport/Chincoteague Bays (hereafter referred to as Coastal Bays PSU) predict with 90% confidence that 10 to 90% of stream miles are in poor to very poor condition. Completion of all Round Two sampling by 2004 will allow estimation of statewide and basin-specific conditions. At the basin level, larger sample sizes will result in much narrower confidence intervals, with precision comparable to Round One basin results.  MBSS and Montgomery County Integration Study Maryland DNR is currently working with several county stream monitoring programs to coordinate monitoring and assessment efforts. One of the issues being addressed is the feasibility of integrating results from both programs in order to arrive at a combined estimate of stream condition (e.g., mean fish or benthic IBI score) for the entire county or portion of the county. This integration offers two advantages:  the elimination of multiple, conflicting estimates of stream condition generated by separate sampling programs; and  an increase in precision of the MBSS estimate by increasing the size of the sample considered in the estimate. Using methods developed in Volstad et al. (2002) and briefly described in Section 2.3 of this report, MBSS data and Montgomery County were integrated for the Seneca Creek watershed, which was sampled both by the County and by MBSS in 2001. The following table shows the results of this analysis. Note that the integrated mean values for both the benthic and fish IBIs were substantially more precise than the IBIs obtained from MBSS data alone. For example, the integrated standard error for the benthic IBI decreased from 0.22 (for MBSS data) and 0.21 Results of integrated MBSS and Montgomery County analysis, Seneca (Montgomery County data) to 0.12. The siteCreek watershed sampled in 2001 specific results for the Montgomery County sites Benthic IBI Fish IBI for which data were available, as well as the MBSS MBSS Sample Size 15 8 data, are displayed on the Seneca Creek PSU map located in Section 4 of this report.

Where feasible, the integrated data will be used as a substitute for MBSS-only estimates of stream condition in support of water resources management.  3-6   Percentage of Stream Miles with FIBI < 3  Youghiogheny Pot UN Branch Pot AL/Sideling Seneca Piscataway Potomac UT/Oxon Zekiah Swamp Gilbert Swamp Coastal Bays Western Branch Patuxent Middle Bodkin/Balt Li.

Scores spanned the full range of biological conditions, from 1.0 (very poor) to 4.78 (good). Benthic IBI data for each PSU are shown in Figure 3-4 and listed in Appendix B-3. Mean benthic IBIs by PSU are mapped in Figure 3-5. The lowest mean benthic IBI was 1.60 in Coastal Bays PSU. The highest mean benthic IBI as 4.17 in Deer Creek PSU. The extent of occurrence of streams with benthic IBI < 3 were calculated, along with 90% confidence intervals.  Values are listed in Appendix Table B-4. As shown in Figure 3-6, an estimated 72 to 100% of stream miles in Piscataway Creek PSU had benthic IBI < 3, as did an estimated 65 to 100% of stream miles in Potomac River Upper Tidal/Oxon Creek PSU and an estimated 47 to 100% in Coastal Bays PSU. In contrast, estimates for several other PSUs indicated less extensive occurrence of low benthic IBI. For example, an estimated 0 to 26% of stream miles in Zekiah Swamp PSU, 0 to 31% of stream miles in Northeast River/Furnace Bay PSU, and 0 to 45% of stream miles in Potomac River Allegany County/Sideling Hill Creek PSU had benthic IBI < 3.  A snapshot of good and bad conditions is illustrated by sites with the 10 best and 10 worst Combined Biotic Index (CBI) scores. Sites with the best scores were distributed across the state. As expected, many drained forested catchments less disturbed by human impacts. None had a high degree of urbanization. The relative influence of agriculture varied, but the best sites highlighted here tended to have good riparian buffer and good physical habitat, even when located in a highly agricultural catchment. 10 best sites in watersheds sampled by MBSS 2001, as rated by the Combined Biotic Index (CBI) Stream Name Mill Run Wet Stone Branch Deer Creek Little Gunpowder Falls McMillan Fork of Shields Run Zekiah Swamp Run Zekiah Swamp Run UT1 Deer Creek Little Gunpowder Falls Little Gunpowder Falls West Branch (of Northeast Creek) SITEYR YOUG-221-R-2001 DEER-113-R-2001 DEER-408-R-2001 LIGU-105-R-2001 PRUN-102-R-2001 ZEKI-305-R-2001 ZEKI-215-R-2001 DEER-302-R-2001 LIGU-201-R-2001 LIGU-312-R-2001 NEAS-103-R-2001 Order 2 1 4 1 1 3 2 3 2 3 1 Basin Youghigheny River Susquehanna River Susquehanna River Gunpowder River North Branch Potomac River Lower Potomac River Lower Potomac River Susquehanna River Gunpowder River Gunpowder River Elk River Watershed Name Youghiogheny River Deer Creek Deer Creek Little Gunpowder Falls Potomac River Upper North Branch Zekiah Swamp Zekiah Swamp Deer Creek Little Gunpowder Falls Little Gunpowder Falls Northeast River CBI 4.60 4.56 4.56 4.56 4.56 4.48 4.45 4.44 4.44 4.44 4.44  Sites with the worst scores represented a broad range of stream problems.

If only one score was available (e.g., benthic IBI but no fish IBI), the single score was assigned as the CBI. Interpretation of CBI scores follows the guidelines in Table 3-2. CBI scores from core MBSS sites ranged from 1.00 (very poor) to 4.60 (good). CBI data for each PSU are depicted in Figure 3-7 and listed in Appendix Table B-5. Mean CBI values by PSU are mapped in Figure 3-8. Mean CBI per PSU ranged from 1.96 (Coastal Bays PSU) to 3.98 (Deer Creek), paralleling benthic IBI results. The 90% confidence intervals for percentage of stream miles with CBI < 3 are shown in Figure 3-9 and Appendix Table B-6.  By measuring pH, ANC, and several analytes indicative of potential acidification sources (e.g., sulfate, nitrate nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and agricultural land use), the Survey provides an opportunity to examine the current extent and distribution of stream acidification in Maryland watersheds. Results from the 2001 MBSS sampling are presented below.  3.3.1 Low pH During spring 2001 sampling, sites in 8 of 19 PSUs sampled exhibited pH < 5. Sites in 14 PSUs had pH < 6. One PSU sampled had mean pH < 6 during spring - Dividing Creek/Nassawango Creek. Spring pH values are shown in Figure 3-10. Spring pH values of individual sites are depicted in Figure 3-11. Typically, spring pH values are slightly lower than summer because of episodic acidification from spring rain events. As expected, pH tended to be slightly higher in most PSUs during summer. Results were used to estimate the extent of low spring pH conditions within each PSU as the percentage of stream miles with pH < 6 (Figure 3-12, Appendix Table B-7). For spring 2001, the greatest extent of low pH was estimated in Dividing Creek/Nassawango Creek, where the 90% confidence interval indicated 22 to 78% of stream miles had pH < 6. Several other PSUs had slightly lower percentages of stream miles with pH < 6 . Note that even in the five PSUs where no pH values < 6 were observed, the upper limit of the 90% confidence interval ranged from 18 to 26%, indicating the potential for low pH conditions to exist. For summer 2001 (Appendix Table B-8), the greatest extent of low pH was estimated in Dividing Creek/Nassawango Creek, where the 90% confidence interval indicated 22 to 78% of stream miles had pH < 6, the same as the spring estimate for this PSU.  3.3 ACIDIFICATION The effects of acidic deposition and acid mine drainage (AMD) on stream chemistry are well documented. Maryland's 1987 Synoptic Stream Chemistry Survey (MSSCS; Knapp et al. 1988) concluded that approximately one-third of all headwater streams in Maryland are sensitive to acidification or are already acidic. Acidification is known to cause declines in both the diversity and abundance of aquatic biota. Round One MBSS results (Roth et al. 1999) and an assessment of these results in comparison with critical loads (Miller et al. 1998) confirmed that stream acidification remains a problem in Maryland freshwater streams. The defining characteristics of surface waters sensitive to acidification are low to moderate pH and acid neutralizing capacity (ANC). pH is a measure of the acid balance of a stream. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with pH 7 as neutral and pH < 7 signifying acidic conditions. Biological effects are often noted at pH < 5 or 6, except in naturally acidic systems where aquatic biota can tolerate low pH. ANC is a measure of the capacity of dissolved constituents in the water to react with and neutralize acids and is used as an index of the sensitivity of surface water to acidification. The higher the ANC, the more acid a system can assimilate before experiencing a decrease in pH. Repeated additions of acidic materials can cause a decrease in ANC. In many acidic deposition studies (e.g., Schindler 1988), an ANC of 200  eq/l is considered the threshold for defining acidsensitive streams and lakes.  3.3.2 Low Acid Neutralizing Capacity Although pH is the most commonly used measure of acidification, ANC is a better overall measure of acidification and acid sensitivity, because it also indicates which systems are likely to become acidified under episodic conditions. The following critical ANC values are used to characterize streams according to acid sensitivity: < 0  eq/l (acidic), 0 < ANC < 50  eq/l (highly sensitive to acidification), 50 < ANC < 200  eq/l (sensitive to acidification), and > 200  eq/l (not sensitive to acidification).  3-12   Combined Biotic Index  Youghiogheny Pot UN Branch Pot AL/Sideling Seneca Piscataway Potomac UT/Oxon Zekiah Swamp Gilbert Swamp Coastal Bays Western Branch Patuxent Middle Bodkin/Balt Li.

Ten PSUs, primarily those in Western Maryland and the Southern Coastal Plain, had sites with ANC < 50  eq/l. As shown in Figure 3-15 (Appendix Table B-9), PSUs with the greatest estimated stream length with ANC < 50  eq/l were Potomac River Upper North Branch, Dividing Creek/Nassawango Creek, Zekiah Swamp, and Nanticoke River. Estimates of the percentage of stream miles with ANC < 200  eq/l follow the geographic pattern noted in the MSSCS and Round One MBSS, with the greatest extent of acid-sensitive streams in Western Maryland and the Southern Coastal Plain (Figure 3-16, Appendix Table B-10).  3.3.3 Likely Sources of Acidity In estimating the extent of acidification of Maryland streams, it is important to understand how acidic deposition, acid mine drainage, agricultural runoff, and natural organic materials contribute to the observed acidification. Acidic deposition is the contribution of material from atmospheric sources, both as precipitation (wet) and particulate (dry) deposition. Acidic deposition is generally associated with elevated concentrations of sulfate and nitrate in precipitation. AMD results from the oxidation of iron and sulfur from mine spoils and abandoned mine shafts and is known to cause extreme acidification of surface waters. Streams strongly impacted by AMD exhibit high levels of sulfate, manganese, iron, and conductivity. A third source of acidification is surface runoff from agricultural lands that are fertilized with high levels of nitrogen or other acidifying compounds. Lastly, the natural decay of organic materials may contribute acidity in the form of organic anions, as in blackwater streams associated with bald cypress wetlands. Streams dominated by organic sources of acidity are often characterized by high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and organic anions. Available water chemistry and land use data were used to screen for likely acidifying sources following the method employed in Round One analysis (Roth et al.1999). Results of the 2001 acid source screening indicate patterns that closely follow the results found in Round One of the Survey. A total of 101 sites (approximately 47%) sampled in 2001 had ANC < 200 :eq/L, an indication of acidification or acid sensitivity. Evidence of AMD was found at four sites in the Potomac River Upper North Branch PSU, while one site in the Youghiogheny River PSU was likely affected by both AMD and acidic deposition. Organic ions contributed to the acidification of one site in the Coastal Bays PSU. Both organic ions and acidic deposition affected sites in Coastal Bays PSU (1 site), Dividing Creek/ Nassawango  Creek (6 sites), Nanticoke River (1 site), Potomac River Upper Tidal/Oxon Creek (1 site), Sassafras River/StillpondFairlee (1 site), and Upper Pocomoke River (2 sites). Agriculture contributed to acidification at sites in Deer Creek (2 sites), Nanticoke River (3 sites), Patuxent River Middle (5 sites), Seneca Creek (2 sites), Sassafras River/Stillpond-Fairlee (2 sites), and Upper Pocomoke River (4 sites). According to screening criteria, acidic deposition effects were more widespread, affecting PSUs throughout the State. Sixty-five sites were affected in 12 PSUs, located mainly in western and southern Maryland: Bodkin Creek/Baltimore Harbor (1 site), Deer Creek (1 site), Dividing Creek/Nassawango Creek (4 sites), Gilbert Swamp (9 sites), Nanticoke River (1 site), Northeast River/Furnace Bay (2 sites), Patuxent River Middle (5 sites), Piscataway Creek (3 sites), Potomac River Allegany County/Sideling Hill Creek (7 sites), Western Branch (2 sites), Youghiogheny River (13 sites), and Zekiah Swamp (13 sites). Only one PSU sampled in 2001, Little Gunpowder Falls, located in central Maryland, showed no effects of acidification.  3.4 PHYSICAL HABITAT Although many water resource programs tend to focus on water chemistry-based definitions of stream quality, physical habitat degradation can have an equal or greater effect on stream ecosystems and their biological communities. Habitat loss and degradation has been identified as one of six critical factors affecting biological diversity in streams worldwide (Allan and Flecker 1993). Habitat degradation can result from a variety of human impacts occurring within the stream itself and in the surrounding riparian zone and watershed. Typical instream impacts include sedimentation, impoundment, and stream channelization. Urban development, timber harvesting, agriculture, livestock grazing, and the draining or filling of wetlands are well-known examples of human activities affecting streams at a broader scale. In watersheds impacted by anthropogenic stress, riparian (streamside) forests can ameliorate inputs of nutrients, sediments, and other pollutants to streams. They also provide other functions, such as shade, overhead cover, and inputs of leaf litter and large woody debris. The Survey collects data to assess the extent and type of physical habitat degradation occurring in Maryland streams. A provisional Physical Habitat Index (PHI), developed during MBSS Round One, was used to assess the overall status of physical habitat conditions. In addition, examination of individual parameters are useful for assessing geomorphic processes, integrity of riparian vegetation, and alterations to natural temperature regimes.

The reader should note that an improved physical habitat index is now being developed for the MBSS. This revised index will be used to recalculate scores for all sites samples during 2000-2004.  3.4.1 Physical Habitat Index A provisional PHI, developed using earlier MBSS data (Hall et al. 1999), was used to score sites sampled in 2001. Because of underlying differences in stream types, separate PHIs are applied in each of two geographic strata: the Coastal Plain and non-Coastal Plain. Four key physical habitat variables are common to both the Coastal Plain and the non-Coastal Plain indices: (1) instream habitat structure, (2) velocity/depth diversity, (3) embeddedness, and (4) aesthetic rating (trash rating). Two additional variables are important in the Coastal Plain  pool/glide/eddy quality and maximum depth. Two other variables are included in the non-Coastal Plain  riffle/run quality and number of rootwads in a stream reach. Index scores are adjusted to a centile scale that rates each sample segment as follows:     Scores Scores Scores Scores of of of of 72 to 100 are rated good 42 to 71.9 are rated fair 12 to 41.9 are rated poor 0 to 11.9 are rated very poor 3.4.2 Geomorphic Processes Channelization can substantially alter the character of the stream. Historically, streams were commonly channelized to drain fields and to provide flood control. Today, streams in urban areas are often channelized to accommodate roadbuilding or to drain stormwater from developed areas. When previously meandering streams are straightened, they may lose their natural connection to the floodplain, with significant adverse consequences for the stream ecosystem. For example, increased flows during storm events can lead to greater scouring, greater bank instability, and disruption of the natural pattern of riffle and pool habitats. At other times, decreased baseflows can result in stagnant ditches with substrates degraded by heavy sediment deposition. MBSS 2001 results indicate that stream channelization is common in some Maryland watersheds, particularly in the Coastal Plain (Figure 3-20, Appendix Table B-13). The most widespread incidence of channelization was observed in Upper Pocomoke River (90% confidence interval: 51 to 93% of stream miles channelized), Coastal Bays PSU((35 to 90% of stream miles), Dividing Creek/Nassawango Creek, and Potomac River Upper Tidal/Oxon Creek (35 to 90% of stream miles in both PSUs). Bank erosion is a common symptom of stream problems. Erosion within the stream channel, often associated with ""flashy"" flow regimes in highly urbanized watersheds, can scour banks and mobilize sediment. In fact, much of the sediment transported and deposited within the stream often originates from in-channel erosion rather than overland flow. Bank erosion can be a signal of channel instability (sidecutting) when a stream becomes entrenched (i.e., cannot reach its floodplain during high flow events). While the lack of streambank vegetation can contribute to bank erosion, severe erosion can in turn destabilize vegetation, causing even large trees to fall. Moderate to severe bank erosion occurs commonly in Maryland streams, as seen in MBSS 2001 sampling results (Figure 3-21, Appendix Table B-14). Many watersheds had high occurrence of bank erosion. The greatest extent of moderate to severe bank erosion was estimated for Patuxent River Middle (90% confidence interval: 59 to 97% of stream miles) and Northeast River/Furnace Bay (45 to 96% of stream miles) PSUs.  Scores for MBSS 2001 sampling were computed by comparison with the same distributions of metric values that were used to develop the PHI. Thus indicator scores may be interpreted using the same narrative ratings employed in Round One. Provisional PHI results by PSU are shown in Figure 3-17 and Appendix Table B-11. Scores varied widely within and among PSUs. The mean PHI fell into the range of good in two PSUs, both in western Maryland (Potomac River Upper North Branch and Youghiogheny River). Mean PHI was poor in one PSU (Bodkin Creek/Baltimore Harbor) and fair in the remaining 16 PSUs. The geographic distribution of mean PHI scores is shown on a statewide map (Figure 3-18). Stream mile estimates of the occurrence of poor to very poor PHI scores suggest that physical habitat degradation is widespread (Figure 3-19, Appendix Table B-12). The greatest extent of low PHI scores was within Potomac River Allegany County/Sideling Hill Creek, where the 90% confidence interval predicted that 19 to 92% of stream miles were in poor to very poor condition. Many of the streams sampled in this PSU are small mountain streams that may be underrated by the provisional PHI.  3-24   Physical Habitat Indicator  Youghiogheny Pot UN Branch Pot AL/Sideling Seneca Piscataway Potomac UT/Oxon Zekiah Swamp Gilbert Swamp Coastal Bays Western Branch Patuxent Middle Bodkin/Balt Li.

Percentage of stream miles with moderate to severe bank erosion for the MBSS PSUs sampled in 2001  3-29   Within each 75-meter segment sampled, field estimates of the amount of eroded bank area were made. Moderate to severe erosion was included in analysis. Mean values be PSU were used to estimate the extent of eroded area (square meters) per stream mile. The highest values were in Patuxent River Middle, Northeast River/Furnace Bay, Piscataway Creek, Seneca Creek, and Western Branch PSUs. Per-mile areas were then used to project the total surface area of bare, eroded bank in each PSU (Table 3-3). Combined, the eroded bank area in these 19 PSUs totals more than 330 acres. Significant deposition of gravel and fine sediments can lead to mid-channel bar formation. Although some formation of bars is natural, more severe bar formation can signal channel instability related to bank erosion and altered flow regimes. Such streams typically have poor habitat for stream biota because substrate shifts with each high flow event. Sediments can become resuspended, increasing turbidity. Exacerbated bar formation was observed in most watersheds sampled in 2001 (Figure 3-22, Appendix Table B-15). Estimates of the percentage of stream miles experiencing moderate to severe bar formation were highest in Piscataway  Creek (90% confidence interval: 71 to 100% of stream miles), Patuxent River Middle (59 to 97% of stream miles), and Potomac River Upper Tidal/Oxon Creek (39 to 91% of stream miles).  3.4.3 Vegetated Riparian Buffers and Woody Debris A complete characterization of stream habitat goes beyond in-channel measures and includes the riparian zone adjacent to the stream. The effectiveness of the riparian buffer in mitigating nutrient loading and providing other benefits to the stream varies with the type and amount of riparian vegetation. MBSS records data on both the type and extent of local riparian vegetation, estimated as the functional width of the riparian buffer along each side of the 75-m sample segment. Lack of riparian vegetation on at least one stream bank was observed within nine of 19 PSUs sampled. Data were used to estimate the percentage of stream miles lacking riparian buffer vegetation on at least one bank (Figure 3-23) or on both banks (Figure 3-24) (Appendix Tables B-16 and B-17).

Invasive species such as multiflora rose, mile-a-minute, and Japanese honeysuckle can crowd out native plants. Most watersheds appeared affected by the presence of exotic plants (Figure 3-25, Appendix Table B-18). In cases of high abundance along streams, these species can prevent natural regeneration and/or growth of intentionally planted trees and are thus a threat to buffer reestablishment. Rootwads and other types of woody debris provide habitat, cover, and shade for a variety of stream biota. When riparian forests are removed, this important source of woody debris is lost. To assess the availability of this key habitat feature, the numbers of rootwads and other woody debris within each 75-m segment were recorded by MBSS field crews. The total number of instream pieces of woody debris and rootwads was substantially higher in Zekiah Swamp (Figure 3-26, Appendix Table B-19), due primarily to one site where 118 total instream woody debris and rootwads were counted. Along with wood found within the wetted width of the stream itself, other in-channel (but dewatered) woody debris is a potential future source of habitat. Separate results for instream, dewatered, and total counts of woody debris and rootwads are shown in Figures 3-27 to 3-32 (Appendix Tables B-20 to B-25). The amount of rootwads and large woody debris in Maryland streams is expected to grow over time as forestry professionals continue to recognize the critical role that wood plays in stream health.  Summary indicators included:      Mean and an average daily temperature Mean minimum and maximum daily temperatures Absolute maximum temperature 95th percentile temperature Percentage of readings exceeding thresholds in state water quality standards  Maryland water quality standards for temperature state that the maximum temperature may not exceed 32 C (90 F) in most waters, 20 C (68 F) in Class III Natural Trout Waters, or 23.9 C (75 F) in Class IV Recreational Trout Waters (COMAR 1995)Sthe three horizontal lines in Figures 3-33 and 3-34. Results for sites monitored in 2001 are listed in Appendix C. Among all sites assessed, mean average daily temperatures ranged from 12.8 to 24.8 C, indicating the presence of both coldwater and warmwater sites in the data set. The lowest mean daily minimum was 11.5 C at a third-order site in Seneca Creek watershed. Future analyses of data from coldwater streams will assist in interpretation of IBI scores and will contribute to development of a fish IBI tailored to these systems. Trout and several non-game species require cool to cold waters. For example, EPA criteria for growth and survival of brook trout (Maryland's only native salmonid) are maximum weekly means of 19 and 24 C. Research has found a still lower temperature of 14.4 C as the maximum temperature for juvenile growth of brook trout (EPA 1976 and McCormick et al. 1972, as cited in Eaton et al. 1995). Fourteen sites had occasional readings above 32 C, including one in Dividing Creek/Nassawango Creek where the temperature exceeded 32 C more than 2% of the time. A systematic review of whether any Class III or IV streams exceeded standards would require examination of site data by stream class and was beyond the scope of this report. Examples of daily temperature data from coldwater and warmwater sites are shown in Figures 3-33 and 3-34.  3.4.4 Temperature During 2001, MBSS deployed continuous reading temperature loggers at more than 200 sites. The long-term goal is to use temperature data to (1) better classify and characterize coldwater streams and (2) identify streams stressed by temperature changes, such as spikes from rapid inputs of warm water running off impervious surfaces during summer storms. Data were recorded at 20-minute intervals with loggers set to record the highest value observed during each 20 minute interval. Initial data analyses consisted of a quality assurance review (to exclude sites where temp loggers were lost or not submerged in the stream during low flow periods), establishment of a consistent period of record, and computation of several summary indicators. Indicators were calculated for 175 sites where the data record was complete. Generally the period of record considered was June 1 to August 15, although some exceptions were made (e.g., to include sites where monitoring began between June 1 and 15).  3.5 NUTRIENTS AND OTHER WATER CHEMISTRY Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are important for life in all aquatic systems. In the absence of human influence, streams contain relatively low background levels of nutrients that are essential to the survival of the aquatic  3-34   Percentage of Stream Miles with Exotic Plants Observed  Youghiogheny Pot UN Branch Pot AL/Sideling Seneca Piscataway Potomac UT/Oxon Zekiah Swamp Gilbert Swamp Coastal Bays Western Branch Patuxent Middle Bodkin/Balt Li.

However, during the last several hundred years, the amount of nutrients transported to many stream systems has increased greatly as a result of anthropogenic influences such as agricultural runoff, wastewater discharge, urban/suburban nonpoint sources, and atmospheric deposition. Excessive nitrogen and phosphorus loading may lead to eutrophication, particularly in downstream estuaries. Eutrophication often decreases the level of dissolved oxygen available to aquatic organisms. Prolonged exposure to low dissolved oxygen values can suffocate biota or lead to reduced condition. Increased nutrient loads are also thought to be harmful to humans by causing toxic algal blooms and contributing to outbreaks of toxic organisms such as Pfiesteria piscicida. In Maryland, concern for nutrient loadings to the Chesapeake Bay has drawn attention to the amounts of materials transported from throughout the watershed by stream tributaries. The Survey provides a large dataset that can be used to assess nutrient concentrations under spring baseflow conditions. Although a full understanding of nutrient loadings also requires data collected over time, (i.e., taken over multiple years and seasons particularly during highflow events) the Survey's water chemistry results provide extensive spatial coverage and a useful picture of where nutrient levels are high. In addition to various nitrogen and phosphorus measures, the Survey assesses dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, sulfate (as an indicator of AMD), chloride (an indicator of general anthropogenic disturbance), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Key results are summarized below. Where possible, results are compared with threshold levels likely to indicate human influence (Roth et al. 1999 and R. Morgan, personal communication, 2001). To illustrate the potential degree of human impact, many figures referenced below show data in relation to these thresholds, depicted in graphs by a vertical dotted line.  Stillpond Fairlee (Figure 3-39). Appendix Tables B-26 to B-29 detail these results by PSU. Nitrate nitrogen concentrations greater than 1 mg/l are commonly considered to indicate anthropogenic influence. This is several times higher than the concentration of 0.08 mg/l recently reported for streams in undisturbed watersheds (Clark et al. 2000). Mean nitrate nitrogen concentrations in 10 of 19 PSUs exceeded 1 mg/l. Estimates of the percentage of stream miles with nitrate nitrogen > 1 mg/l by PSU dramatically illustrate the extent of elevated nitrate levels, especially in Central Maryland (Figure 3-40, Appendix Table B-30). In several PSUs, nearly 100% of stream miles have high nitrate nitrogen concentrations. Total phosphorus (the sum of total dissolved and particulate phosphorus concentrations) tended to be substantially higher on the Eastern Shore, lower in Western Maryland, and moderate in the central part of the state (Figures 3-41 and 3-42). Results for orthophosphate share a similar pattern and are shown (Figure 3-43). Appendix Tables B-31 and B32 detail these results by PSU.  3.5.2 Other Water Quality Parameters Dissolved oxygen concentrations at most locations were greater than 5 mg/l, the COMAR standard and a level generally considered healthy for aquatic life (Figure 3-44, Appendix Table B-33). The only PSU with a mean DO < 5 mg/l was Upper Pocomoke River, where swampy blackwater streams and sluggish waters are naturally lower in DO, but also particularly susceptible to BOD loading from anthropogenic sources. Individual sites with low DO should be examined for similar, natural causes before concluding that impacts exist. Estimates of the percentage of stream miles with low DO are given in Figure 3-45 (Appendix Table B-34). Seasonal monitoring of streams suspected to have low DO problems and examination of watershed factors would help to diagnose situations where the problem is persistent and can be linked to anthropogenic causes. As expected (because sampling generally is done when water clarity is good), turbidity was generally low (Figure 346, Appendix Table B-35), with the Nanticoke River showing substantially higher turbidity levels than the other PSUs sampled. However, a more complete characterization of turbidity in a given stream would require monitoring during storm events. Sulfate values were not generally high (Figure 3-47, Appendix Table B-36), although values in Potomac River  3.5.1 Nutrients Total nitrogen (the sum of total dissolved and particulate nitrogen concentrations) tended to be highest in Central Maryland and the Eastern Shore (Figures 3-35 and 3-36). In general, nitrate nitrogen (Figure 3-37) made up the largest fraction of total nitrogen. Nitrite nitrogen was higher in Central Maryland and the Eastern Shore than elsewhere in Maryland (Figure 3-38). As expected, ammonia, often associated with agricultural uses and animal wastes, was highest on the Eastern Shore, especially in Sassafras River/  3-44   Figure 3-35.

Chloride (Figure 3-48, Appendix Table B-37) tended to be highest in urban areas, especially Bodkin Creek/Baltimore Harbor. Several sites in this PSU were located close to major highways (such as Interstate 95) where high chloride levels indicate a major impact of road salt application. As expected, mean dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (Figure 3-49, Appendix Table B-38) was highest in Coastal Plain basins, especially on the Eastern Shore.  integrity, water quality, and physical habitat quality (Center for Watershed Protection 1998). Of the 19 PSUs sampled in 2001, the greatest amounts of urban land occurred in PSUs located in the central portion of the State (Figure 3-50, Appendix Table B-39). Bodkin Creek/Baltimore Harbor had the greatest mean percentage of urban land use in the upstream catchments (59%), followed by Potomac River Upper Tidal/Oxon Creek (41%), and Piscataway Creek (34%). PSUs in western Maryland and on the Eastern Shore had much smaller percentages of urban land in catchments upstream of MBSS sites. The percentage of impervious surface (calculated as 75% of the value for high density urban land use plus 25% of the value for low density urban land use) followed the patterns shown in the percentage of urban land use (Appendix Table B-40). The highest mean value of percentage of impervious surface occurred in Bodkin Creek/Baltimore Harbor (24%, followed by Potomac River Upper Tidal/Oxon Creek (14%) and Piscataway Creek (11%). The remaining PSUs all had much lower percentages of impervious surface - with mean values of less than 10%. The greatest amounts of agricultural land uses in upstream catchments occurred in PSUs sampled on the Eastern Shore, and in several watersheds in central Maryland (Figure 3-51, Appendix Table B-41). Sassafras River/Stillpond-Fairlee had the highest mean agricultural land use (81%), followed by Seneca Creek (68%), and Deer Creek (68%, including one site with 100% agricultural land use in the upstream catchment). Western Maryland contains the PSUs with the largest amounts of forested land use in the state (Figure 3-52, Appendix Table B-42). Potomac River Allegany County/ Sideling Hill Creek had the largest mean percentage of forested land use in upstream catchments (92%, including two sites with 100% forested land use in the upstream catchment). Potomac River Upper North Branch and the Youghiogheny River followed (88 and 74%, respectively). The mean amount of forested land in upstream catchments in PSUs in central Maryland and on the Eastern Shore was significantly lower, although several PSUs had sites with 100% or nearly 100% forested land in their upstream catchments (Coastal Bays PSU (100%) and Upper Pocomoke River (99%)).  3.6  Land Use  A measure of anthropogenic influence at the landscape scale is watershed land use. Watersheds form natural geographic units for assessing impacts on streams, because land use within the watershed (or catchment) upstream of a specific stream site is representative of many of the human activities affecting the stream at that point. As such, land cover serves as a surrogate for a variety of stressors. In much of the United States, conversions of naturally vegetated watershed lands to urban and agricultural uses have resulted in serious impacts to streams and their aquatic inhabitants. Some investigations have indicated that development of even small portions of the watershed area can have detrimental effects on streams (Schueler 1994). Impervious surfaces, such as roads, parking lots, sidewalks, and rooftops, cause a rapid increase in the rate at which water is transported from the watershed to its stream channels. Effects include more variable stream flows, increased erosion from runoff, habitat degradation caused by channel instability, increased nonpoint source pollutant loading, elevated temperatures, and losses of biological diversity. Reviews of stream research in numerous watersheds (Center for Watershed Protection 1998, Schueler 1994) indicate that impacts on stream quality are commonly noted at about 10% coverage by impervious surface. Effects on sensitive species may occur at even lower levels. With even more impervious surface, most notably, at about 25-30% of catchment area, studies have shown that numerous aspects of stream quality become degraded, including biological  3-58   Chloride  Youghiogheny Pot UN Branch Pot AL/Sideling Seneca Piscataway Potomac UT/Oxon Zekiah Swamp Gilbert Swamp Coastal Bays Western Branch Patuxent Middle Bodkin/Balt Li.

Although a complete assessment of watershed-wide conditions would require more information, data collected at specific MBSS sites provide a starting point for understanding and describing the condition of the watershed. This chapter includes a summary for each of the 18 primary sampling units or PSUs (single or combined 8-digit watersheds) randomly sampled in the 2001 MBSS. Each summary begins with a map of the PSU, which shows 8-digit watershed and 12-digit subwatershed boundaries, county boundaries, major towns and roads, and selected public lands. This information provides a geographical context for the sites sampled by the Survey. These maps also include the locations of the MBSS sample points and MBSS Stream Waders sample locations (see sidebar in this chapter for further information regarding the MBSS Stream Waders program), with symbols indicating the fish and benthic IBI scores (a key to this map is included in Table 4-1). The same page of each PSU summary lists the total land area and the total number of sampleable stream miles (by individual 8-digit watershed). Each PSU summary includes a land cover map derived from the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Version 98-07 (based on remote sensing data from the early 1990s). A key to this map is provided in Table 4-1. A bar chart for each 8-digit watershed shows the percentage of land in each land cover class. Following the maps are tables containing a variety of information on the sites sampled in each PSU. The first table contains locational information for each site, including the stream name, 12-digit subwatershed code,8-digit watershed name, basin, county, stream order, and upstream catchment area. The second table is one containing information pertinent to the indicators calculated for each site (fish, benthic, and physical habitat). The third table gives the percentage of the upstream catchment area in urban, agricultural, forested, or other (water, barren, and/or wetlands) land cover for each site. Below these tables is a short summary of the conditions in the PSU, including pertinent comments taken from field data sheets. A water chemistry table is provided, including values for the analytes measured at each site (see Chapter 2). Two tables providing information on physical habitat quality and modifications are also included in each PSU report. Throughout these tables, values that exceed or fall short of established thresholds (denoting likely degraded condition or potential stress) are shaded in yellow. The final table is a list of Stream Waders sites in the PSU, along with the family level IBI score calculated for each site. A key to the variables in all of these tables is given in Table 4-1. Finally, each PSU report includes a list of organisms found throughout the PSU. Included on this page are species lists for fish, exotic plants, and herpetofauna, as well as a taxa list for benthic macroinvertebrates. Taken together, these data can be used to begin to assess stream quality in each PSU. For example, in the Potomac River Upper Tidal/Oxon Creek PSU, indicator scores at most sites are generally low, indicating that most streams sampled in the PSU are disturbed. Maps and data also indicate that urban and suburban land uses are widespread and that many sampled sites had elevated chloride, nitrogen (especially ammonia), and phosphorus levels, as well as channelization and erosion problems. In this PSU, development is probably a significant stressor on stream water quality, contributing to elevated pollution and physical habitat degradation, which in turn result in low indicator scores. A similar assessment can be done for each PSU, providing a preliminary identification of the specific stressors of concern in the PSU.  4-1   Table 4-1.

Goals of Stream Waders are     To increase the density of sampling sites for use in stream and watershed assessments; To improve stream stewardship ethics and encourage local action to improve watershed management; To educate the local community about the relationship between land use and stream quality; and To provide quality assured information on stream quality to state, local, and federal agencies, environmental organizations, and others.  Stream Waders data are intended for use in water quality reports (such as Maryland's biennial water quality report to Congress  the 305(b) Report), watershed restoration and protection programs, regulatory programs (such as 303(d) listing), and for local government use. They are also provided to the volunteers themselves who may have an interest in a particular stream or watershed. Methods Stream Waders is designed to be seamless with the MBSS and several other organizations, such as Montgomery County, who are performing stream sampling of benthos in Maryland. MBSS samples are collected at the watershed level (8-digit), while Stream Waders volunteers sample at the subwatershed (12-digit) level. Thus, Stream Waders data should help ""fill the gaps"" left in watershed areas not sampled by MBSS. Each year, local governments and citizen organizations interested in the selected watersheds (the same watersheds chosen to be sampled that year by the core MBSS) are invited to submit site locations to be sampled by Stream Waders volunteers. For 2001, more than 150 sites were requested by local government agencies and citizen organizations. These pre-selected sites, along with others chosen to support DNR-supported programs (e.g., Watershed Restoration Action Strategies) were prioritized over others. For subwatersheds with few or no pre-selected sites, volunteers were asked to distribute additional sites throughout the subwatershed, with one site near the most downstream portion of the catchment. Most sites were either upstream of a road crossing or within an easy walk of a road. Volunteers selected 100-foot sections of stream for their samples. Each team of volunteers was given a GPS unit to record the latitude and longitude of the actual sampling sites. A total of 170 volunteers were trained at four eight-hour training sessions in February 2001. For 2001, 29 watersheds were slated for sampling. Each of the 49 volunteer teams that formed during the training sessions were asked to select four subwatersheds and to sample five sites within each subwatershed. Volunteers sampled during the 1 March to 30 April spring index period. Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled using the same methods as MBSS biologists (Boward 2000 and Kazyak 2001). Samples were preserved in ethanol and organisms were subsampled (about 100 organisms per sample) and identified to family (Boward and Friedman 2000) by DNR staff at DNR's laboratory in Annapolis. From the list of organisms identified from each site, a family-level Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) was calculated and each site was rated either Good (IBI 4-5) Fair (IBI 3-3.9) or Poor (IBI 1-2.9) (Stribling et al. 1998). In addition to sampling benthos at each site, volunteers noted general information about each stream, such as width and depth, as well as a description of the surrounding land and potential problems. Results In all, 708 sites in 29 8-digit watersheds were sampled during the 2001 Maryland Stream Waders Program. IBI results for these sites are included in the appropriate PSU summary located in this Chapter. A summary of those results, by MBSS PSU, is included in the following table.  4-8   Summary of 2001 Stream Waders IBI Results Primary Sampling Unit Assawoman Bay/Isle of Wight/ Sinepuxent Bay/Newport Bay/ Chincoteague Bay BodkinCreek/Baltimore Harbor Number of Stream Waders Sites 41 Summary Most sites were rated Very Poor, with some Fair and Poor ratings. There were no sites rated Good. Stream Waders results generally agreed with those of MBSS. For example, ratings within the cluster of MBSS and Stream Waders sites in the Fivemile Branch subwatershed agree. Most sites were rated Very Poor, with some Poor. There were no sites rated Fair or Good. Stream Waders results generally agreed with those of MBSS, especially those rated Very Poor in the Marley Creek drainage. Most sites were rated Good or Fair by Stream Waders. Only one site was rated Very Poor. Several sites in the Rocks and Susquehanna State Park areas were rated Good by both Stream Waders and MBSS. Most sites were rated Poor or Very Poor, with no sties rated Good. Pairs of Stream Waders and MBSS sites on Tonys Creek and Pusey Branch rated each section of stream similarly (Very Poor). Most Stream Waders sites were rated either Fair or Good. Stream Waders results generally agreed with those of MBSS. Most sites were rated either Fair or Good, with most good sites situated near Gunpowder Falls State Park. Only one site was rated Very Poor. Stream Waders results generally agreed with those of MBSS. Most sites were rated Very Poor or Poor; none were rated Good. Stream Waders results generally agreed with those of MBSS. Most sites were rated Fair or Poor. A few were rated either Good or Very Poor. Stream Waders results generally agreed with those of MBSS. Note the cluster of sites (MBSS and Stream Waders) rated Good near the confluence of Little North East Branch and West Branch. Only one site, on Wilson Owens Branch, was rated Good. Most were rated Very Poor or Fair. Neither MBSS or Stream Waders sites did not rate better in the Patuxent River Park area, as may have been expected. Most good sites were in the southern portion of the watershed and in L.F. Cosca Regional Park, while several Very Poor sites were situated in the upper portion of Piscataway Creek. Stream Waders generally agreed with those of MBSS. Most sites rated Good were in the Sideling Hill Creek drainage and the Potomac River direct drainage to the east. Twenty-one samples were collected by Ridge and Valley Stream Keepers volunteers in the Sideling Hill Creek drainage alone generally agreed with MBSS scores. The two sites rated Good were in the eastern portion of the PSU, other sites were rated Fair or Poor. Most sites were rated either Very Poor or Poor. No sites were rated Good. Stream Waders ratings were generally lower than those from MBSS samples. Most sites were rated Very Poor or Poor, including most of those in Seneca Creek State Park. Only four sites were rated Good. Stream Waders and MBSS results were comparable where sites were close together. Most sites were rated Very Poor. No sites were rated Good or Fair. Stream Waders ratings were generally rated lower than those of MBSS. Stream Waders and MBSS results were comparable where sites were close to one another, for example, in Old Mill Branch. Most sites were rated Poor or Very Poor. Stream Waders samples were generally rated lower than MBSS samples. Most sites were rated Good or Fair. Only one site was rated Very Poor. Stream Waders results compared well with those from MBSS samples. Most sites were rated Good or Fair. These sites were mostly in the lower portion of the watershed. Most MBSS sites were also rated either Good or Fair.  26  Deer Creek  60  Dividing Creek/Nassawango Creek  28  Gilbert Swamp Little Gunpowder Falls  39 18  Nanticoke River Northeast River/Furnace Bay

This Maryland 8-digit watershed (02131104) is ranked as a Priority Watershed in need of restoration by the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan. Anne Arundel and Prince George's Counties applied for grant funding and volunteered to develop a bi-county strategy in this watershed to improve water quality and instream habitat using Low Impact Development (LID) techniques and restoration projects. The purpose of the Watershed Characterization is to assist Anne Arundel and Prince George's Counties in collecting information and identifying issues that may be used as the Counties generate the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. Water Quality The Upper Patuxent River watershed is a Use-I water body with designated uses of water contact recreation and protection of aquatic life. Maryland's 1996 303(d) List for Water Quality Limited Segments reports that the waters of this watershed do not support all their designated uses. Causes for these limitations were attributed to excessive nutrients and sediments. These limitations were given a low priority rank for TMDL development. No new limitations were added in the 1998 303(d) list or in the draft 2002 303(d) list. The most recent 305(b) Water Quality Report (2000) shows no water quality impairment and no impairments to the aquatic community. Land Use The Upper Patuxent River watershed encompasses about 56,278 acres of land and water of which 96 % (54,533 acres) falls within Anne Arundel and Prince George's Counties. This portion of the watershed is referred to as the WRAS study area. The remaining 4 % of the watershed occurs within Howard County and Montgomery Counties and falls outside of the WRAS study area. About 57 % of the WRAS study area occurs within Prince George's County (32,313 acres) with the remaining 39 % located in Anne Arundel County (22,220 acres). The watershed is located in northeastern Prince George's County and western Anne Arundel County, with the Patuxent River mainstem serving as the geographic boundary between the two counties. Ninety-five percent of the land area is located within the Coastal Plain physiographic province with the remainder located within the Piedmont physiographic province. Forested land occupies approximately 45 % of the WRAS study area. Forest land is distributed nearly equally between the two counties. Much of this forest land has been classified as Green Infrastructure or, in Anne Arundel County, as part of the county adopted Greenways Master Plan. A large forest block, found in the upper-mid portion of the watershed, is part of the Federally owned Patuxent Research Refuge. Other forested lands occur along the main stem of the Patuxent River and some of its tributaries in the southern portion of the watershed. Developed land occurs most predominantly in Prince George's county and represents about 32 % of the WRAS study area. Urbanized regions are concentrated around the cities of ix December 2002   Bowie, Laurel and Maryland City. These areas will be evaluated for low impact development retrofits as part of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. Agricultural land occupies 19 % of the WRAS study area and is concentrated in Anne Arundel county. Approximately 1,848 acres of agricultural land are protected through easements. All of these properties occur within Anne Arundel county. Living Resources and Habitat Assessments of benthos, fish and physical habitat were conducted by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey in 1997 at 5 sites. Fish communities were ranked from Very Poor to Good and benthic communities were ranked from Very Poor to Fair. Fish species found during the survey are very common in Maryland and most are tolerant of anthropogenic stressors related to nutrient and sediment pollution. Sites supporting low biological scores were associated with upland urbanization and inadequate riparian buffers. Historically, the Upper Patuxent River basin supported reproducing populations of anadromous and estuarine fish species (shad, herring, white perch and yellow perch). Herring and shad can still be fished from the lower portion of the watershed near the Rt. 214 bridge. Twelve (12) areas of sensitive species are identified in the Upper Patuxent River watershed. A large cluster of these areas occur within the Patuxent Research Refuge and others can be found within the southern portion of the Patuxent River's floodplain. Within these sensitive species areas, 155 acres of wetlands have been designated as Wetlands of Special State Concern and have additional regulatory requirements beyond the general permitting requirements that apply to wetlands. Restoration Targeting Tools During 2002, a stream corridor assessment was conducted to visually assess and characterize approximately 100 miles of stream within this watershed. Information provided through this assessment includes data relative to stream bank stability, riparian habitat, fish passage, pipe crossings, leaking pipes, trash accumulation and any other unusual problems. This information is available in a separate document and will be made available online (http://intranet/watersheds/surf/proj/wras.html) or can be accessed by contacting the counties. In addition, other services provided by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources in 2002 include benthic macroinveterbrate community assessment, fish community assessment, synoptic water quality and flow data collection. This information is also available in a separate document and will be made available online (http://intranet/watersheds/surf/proj/wras.html) or can be accessed by contacting the counties. Computerized mapping was used to demonstrate opportunities for targeting protection and restoration projects incuding restoration of stream buffers, riparian forest and wetlands. Collectively, this information and the computerized map analyses provided in the characterization will be used in assessing current condition, identifying areas in need of rehabilitation or protection, and are tools for developing the restoration strategy.  x  December 2002   CONTRIBUTORS TO THE WATERSHED CHARACTERIZATION Anne Arundel County Janis Markusic, Environmental Division, Office of Planning and Zoning Chris Victoria, Environmental Division, Office of Planning and Zoning John Scarborough, Bureau of Engineering, Department of Public Works Ginger Ellis, Environmental Planning Administrator, Environmental Division, Office of Planning and Zoning Brian Woodward, Chief, Natural and Cultural Resources, Department of Recreation and Parks Jeff Opel, Manager, Anne Arundel Soil Conservation District Sharon Meigs, Senior Environmental Planner, Programs and Planning Division, Department of Environmental Resources Dr. Mow-Soung Cheng, Section Head, Technical Support Section, Programs and Planning Division, Department of Environmental Resources Larry Coffman, Associate Director, Programs and Planning Division, Department of Environmental Resources Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service Danielle Lucid, Mary Conley, Katharine Dowell, Ken Sloate, Ken Yetman, Niles Primrose, Robin Pellicano, Ken Shanks, Anne Sloan, John Wolf, Ted Weber Resource Assessment Service Paul Kazyak Fisheries Service Harley Speir, Jim Mowrer, Don Cosden, Rudy Lucakovic, Jim Thompson, Brian Richardson Maryland Department of the Environment Bill Richardson, Mining Program Herbert Twining; Mining Program Denise Clearwater, Nontidal Wetlands and Waterways Division Maryland Department of Planning Deborah Weller Holiday Obrecht, Patuxent Research Refuge (PRR) Peter Mattejat, Concerned Citizens to Save the Laurel Lakes (CCSL)  Prince Georges County  Maryland Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) Others  Watershed Management and Analysis Division Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service Maryland Department of Natural Resources Christine Conn, Editor and Primary Author Ken Shanks, Associate Author Greta Guzman, Cartographer and GIS Analyst  xi  December 2002   INTRODUCTION Background In 1998, Maryland completed a Unified Watershed Assessment of all 134 of the state's watersheds in order to identify high priorities for restoration action based on impaired waters and high priorities for conservation action based on high or unique natural resource value. The assessment was conducted by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) under the direction of the US Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Water Action Plan initiative with assistance from the Maryland Departments of Environment, Agriculture and Planning and the University of Maryland. It moved beyond consideration of water quality in the streams in the state, which had been assessed regularly since the early 1970's., to a larger consideration of living resources in the streams and the landscape conditions which could impact both water quality and living resources.1,2 As part of the State's response to the findings of the Unified Watershed Assessment, DNR is offering technical and financial assistance to local governments who are willing to work cooperatively to develop and implement Watershed Restoration Action Strategies (WRAS) addressing needs for restoration and conservation in priority watersheds. One of these is the Upper Patuxent River watershed in Prince George's and Anne Arundel Counties in which the Counties, DNR and other local cooperators, both public and private, are engaged in the strategy development program. Location The Upper Patuxent River watershed is located within the Patuxent River basin as shown in Map 1: Regional Context. The majority of the Upper Patuxent River watershed is within Anne Arundel and Prince George's Counties, Maryland. This area is the focus of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy Upper Patuxent River Watershed and this Watershed Characterization. Map Acreage Summary 2: WRAS Project Area shows the county boundaries and highlights major roads, County Land Water Total cities, streams and other features. About Anne Arundel 22,212 8 22,220 39% of the watershed is in Anne Arundel County while Prince George's county Prince George's 32,008 305 32,313 supports 57% of the watershed. The remaining 4% of the watershed falls Howard and 1,745 0 1,745 mostly within Howard county. As shown Montgomery in Map 3 Streams and Watershed Watershed Total 55,965 313 56,278 Management Units, the two Counties are on opposite sides of the Patuxent River. Therefore, their subwatersheds are hydrologically distinct. Each county has delineated subwatersheds that are referred to as Watershed Management units for the purposes of 1 December 2002   this report. The Bear Branch watershed, in the northernmost portion of the Prince George's County WRAS study area, has been a focus area due to its influence on flood management and water quality issues within the City of Laurel and the Laurel Lakes (see Related Projects section in this document). Purpose of the Characterization One of the earliest steps toward devising a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy is to characterize the watershed using immediately available information. This Watershed Characterization is intended to meet several objectives: , , , , , Briefly summarize the most important or relevant information and issues Provide preliminary findings based on this information Identify sources for more information or analysis Suggest opportunities for additional characterization and restoration work. Provide a common base of information for local governments and interested citizens.  Additional Characterization Recommended The Watershed Characterization is intended to be one starting point that can be updated as needed. It is part of a framework for a more thorough assessment involving an array of additional inputs: , , , , , Self-investigation by the local entity Targeted technical assistance and assessment by partner agencies or contractors Input from local citizens Completion of a Stream Corridor Assessment, in which DNR personnel physically walk the streams and catalogue important issues. Completion of a synoptic water quality survey, i.e. a program of water sample analysis, that can be used to focus on local issues like nutrient hot spots, point source discharges or other selected issues. This is also part of the technical assistance offered by DNR.  Identifying Gaps in Information It is important to identify gaps in available watershed knowledge and gauge the importance of these gaps. In assessing data gaps, we have found it helpful to review information in four categories: , Habitat: physical structure, stream stability and biotic community (including riparian zones) , Water Quantity: high water - storm flow & flooding; low water - baseflow problems from dams, water withdrawals, reduced infiltration , Water Quality: water chemistry; toxics, nutrients, sediment, nuisance odors/scums, etc. , Cumulative effects associated with habitat, water quantity and water quality.  2  December 2002   Adaptive Management Because restoration is an active evolving process, the Watershed Characterization and the resulting Watershed Restoration Action Strategy should be maintained as living documents within an active evolving restoration process. These documents will need to be updated periodically as new, more relevant information becomes available and as the watershed response is monitored and reassessed. The term, ""adaptive management"", underscores the idea that this Watershed Restoration Action Strategy is a dynamic work in progress. Strategies for restoration and conservation should address not only current and historic conditions, but should be developed to anticipate future conditions. As new information becomes available and responses from implemented strategies and changing watershed conditions are monitored and assessed, the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy should be revisited and reevaluated. Watershed management planning is a circular process that builds upon itself.  3  December 2002   WATER QUALITY Water quality is in many respects the driving condition in the health of Maryland's streams. Historically, the emphasis has been on chemical water quality. More recently, interest has focused on the biological conditions in streams and estuaries; active consideration of the physical parameters is even more recent. This developmental path is reflected in the ways in which streams have been monitored, the types of data gathered, and the regulatory approach taken. River Basin Context of Local Water Quality Issues The Upper Patuxent River watershed is located just above the midpoint of the Patuxent River Tributary Basin as shown in Map 1 Regional Context. As a result of this hydrologic location, water quality issues in the watershed are attributed both to local origins and upstream origins. The northern portion of the Upper Patuxent River watershed receives the combined stream flow from two in-line watersheds, Brighton Dam and Rocky Gorge. Stream flow from the Brighton Dam discharges into the Rocky Gorge Dam which then, in turn, discharges stream flow into the Upper Patuxent River watershed. This particular combination of reservoirs is unique in Maryland. The reservoir systems supply potable water through the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission system to the Maryland suburban area of Washington, D.C.. These watersheds are included in the Patuxent Reservoir agreement to protect water quality. The dominant land use in these watersheds include crop, pasture and forest land intermingled with mostly low density residential properties. Recently conducted flood studies (see Related Projects section in this document), used zoning maps to assess future land use and concluded that the nature of the watershed would not drastically change. The dominant zoning class is rural residential. However, there are several pockets of denser development zoned. The two dams present in these upstream watersheds have significant effects on the water quality within the Upper Patuxent watershed by acting as sediment traps. Most of the suspended sediments in the waters of the WRAS watershed either originate from non point sources within the watershed or are delivered by the Little Patuxent and the Middle Patuxent watersheds. These watersheds drain into the southern portion of the Upper Patuxent River watershed. In addition to crop, pasture, forest and low density residential land, these watersheds also drain significant land areas supporting high density residential and commercial/industrial use. A watershed characterization and a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy have been completed for the Howard County portion of the Little Patuxent watershed, through the first round of WRAS watersheds, and can be accessed through the internet at http://www.dnr.state.md.us/watersheds/surf/proj/wras.html. Information on the other watersheds draining into the Upper Patuxent River watershed can be found on the Watershed Profiles section at http://mddnr.chesapeakebay.net/wsprofiles/surf/prof/prof.html of the DNR Surf Your Watershed internet site. Upper Patuxent River flows are such that most nutrients are transported downstream to the Patuxent River estuary, rather than settling out in the upper reaches of the river. This results in manifestation of water quality problems in the lower reaches of the Patuxent River. For example, excessive algae growth in the Patuxent estuary during warm months is caused by high nutrient loads that arise from upstream nutrient sources, including the Upper Patuxent River. While this 4 December 2002   characterization does not focus on the larger Patuxent River Basin issues, it is important to realize that other State and Federal programs, and requirements driven by downstream issues, will affect Upper Patuxent River watershed programs such as the future development of a total maximum daily load (TMDL). Water Quality Standards and Designated Uses All streams and other waters of the State are assigned a ""designated use"" in regulation, COMAR 26.08.02.08 which is associated with a set of water quality criteria necessary to support that use. All waters in the Upper Patuxent River watershed are designated as Use I. , Use I, Water Contact Recreation (swimming, boating and fishing) and Protection of Aquatic Life. COMAR or The Maryland Department of the Environment should be contacted for official regulatory information.3,5 Water Quality Indicators - Setting Priority for Restoration and Protection The Clean Water Action Plan's 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment established priorities for watersheds in the State for restoration and protection. In the Plan, the Upper Patuxent River watershed was listed in as a Category 1 Priority watershed, which is a category for watersheds with the highest priority for restoration. , Category 1 Priority watersheds: Watersheds needing restoration and failed to meet at least half of their water quality and natural resource goals.  As the basis for the prioritization, indicators of water quality, landscape and living resources were developed for all watersheds in Maryland. These indicators are presented in the following table which is accompanied by a detailed description of water quality indicators. Other approaches to assessing water quality have been in use for several years and are further described below. In general, they do not look comparatively at watersheds as the Unified Assessment did in an effort to set priorities. The Unified Assessment also considered a range of living resource and landscape indicators described later.  5  December 2002   Unified Watershed Assessment Water Quality Indicators Water Quality Indicator State 303(d) Impairment Number Non-tidal Total Nitrogen Index Non-tidal Total Phosphorus Index Modeled Total Nitrogen Load Modeled Total Phosphorus Load Finding 2 Status* Fail Bench Mark A watershed automatically fails this benchmark if it is listed for 1 or more impairments on the 303(d)  7.0  Fail  In comparison to 138 watersheds in Maryland, this watershed IS among the 25 % having the lowest relative Total Nitrogen Index In comparison to 138 watersheds in Maryland, this watershed IS NOT among the 25 % having the lowest relative Total Phosphorus Index In comparison to 138 watersheds in Maryland, this watershed IS NOT among the 25 % having the highest nitrogen loads. In comparison to 138 watersheds in Maryland, this watershed IS NOT among 25 % having the highest phosphorus loads.  7.0  Pass  9.13  Pass  0.52  Pass  NOTES: See Interpreting Water Quality Indicators for additional explanation for each indicator. * Pass = Average watershed conditions measured by this indicator are better than the Statewide benchmark (unshaded). * Fail = Average watershed conditions measured by this indicator are worse than the Statewide benchmark (shaded).  6  December 2002   Interpreting Water Quality Indicators State 303(d) Impairment Number. This number is used to characterize watersheds relative to regulatory requirements of the Federal Clean Water Act. It is based on numerous water quality-related factors that are tracked by the State of Maryland under these federal requirements. Non-Tidal Total N Index. This index is a mean of monitored data (1994 - 1996) and scored according to a 10-level scale (1 - most degraded to 10 - best conditions). Watersheds whose score value is in the lower 25 percent of scores for the 138 watersheds receive a Category 1 rating for this indicator and receive a rank of ""fail"". Non-Tidal Total P Index. A parallel approach was used for developing the phosphorus index. Modeled TN Load. Nitrogen Load is a measure of how much of this important nutrient is reaching streams and other surface waters. For each type of land use in the watershed, on average, stormwater tends to carry or transport a characteristic amount of nitrogen from the land to nearby streams. Based on these averages, a computer model can be used to estimate how much nitrogen is likely to be reaching local streams. This method was applied Statewide to all the 138 watersheds in Maryland to allow comparison of ""modeled total nitrogen load"" among them. A rank of ""pass"" means that this watershed was among the 104 (75%) out of 138 total watersheds in Maryland that had the lower estimated total nitrogen load. Modeled TP Load. It is a measure of how much of this important nutrient is reaching streams and other surface waters. The ranking for modeled TP Load was performed in parallel to the ranking for modeled TN Load above. (Note: details of the models differ.) The rank of ""pass"" means that this watershed was among the 104 (75%) out of 138 total watersheds in Maryland that had the lower estimated total phosphorus load.  7  December 2002   Not Supporting Designated Use  303(d) Listings As required under Section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act, Maryland tracks waterways that did not support their designated use in a prioritized list of ""Water Quality Limited Basin Segments."" The Upper Patuxent River watershed first appeared on the Maryland's 303(d) list in 1996 (the original list). Since 1996, the status and the impairing pollutants have not been changed.4 The water quality limitations cited for the Upper Patuxent River watershed include: , Nutrients*: This particular impairment, referred to as ""nutrient star""reflects inclusion of the Upper Patuxent River watershed in the Chesapeake Bay Tributary Strategies. ""Nutrient *"" listings first appeared on the 1996 303(d) list and were modeled loadings based upon landuse trends. Waters with this designation may not have supporting water quality data. Nutrient sources resulting in this impairment include nonpoint and natural sources. Localized nutrients impairments may not exist. Suspended Sediment: In the 1996 303(d) list, the Upper Patuxent River watershed is also listed for suspended sediment from nonpoint and natural sources.  ,  Nutrients enter waterways from all types of land and from the atmosphere. The nutrients of primary concern are nitrogen and phosphorus. In general, an acre of forest land contributes smaller amounts of nutrients than a given area of other land uses. Residential land can be an important contributor of nutrients depending on fertilizer use, areal extent of lawn and the status of septic systems. Typically, farmers carefully control nutrient applications so the amount of nutrients entering waterways from crop land varies greatly depending on management techniques employed at a particular farm. The atmosphere can contribute various forms of nitrogen arising from the burning of fossil fuels in power plants and from automobile exhaust. Information on the variety and efficiency of best management practices (BMPs) commonly used to control nutrient loading to waterways can be found in Maryland's Tributary Strategies Technical Reference.6 Suspended sediment arises from stream bed and bank erosion and from land that is poorly vegetated or disturbed. Construction sites, crop land and bare ground are common contributors. The amount of sediment contributed varies greatly site to site depending upon management controls that are used. Without further assessment, no one particular source of suspended sediment can be identified within the Upper Patuxent Watershed. Information collected from the Stream Corridor Assessment will allow site specific identification of probable stream bed and bank suspended sediment sources. The 303(d) list also reflects the priority rankings established by the Maryland Department of the Environment for those waterbodies listed as water quality limited. Priority ranking takes into account the severity of the pollution and the uses made of such water. This approach results in the establishment of a high, medium or low priority designation. The Upper Patuxent River watershed has been designated as a Low priority which means that the degree of impairment is fairly low and has less of an impact on designated uses than a waterbody prioritized as high. These priorities, in addition to other considerations, help the State set the schedule for work needed to conduct water quality assessments and Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) development. 8 December 2002   Total Maximum Daily Loads As of the recently drafted 2002 303(d) list, the Upper Patuxent River remains listed as impaired. The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) has responsibility under the Clean Water Act to take action on the waterbodies listed on the 303(d) list. An action can consist either of a TMDL (total maximum daily load) submitted to the US EPA or a submittal of a water quality analysis indicating the waterbody meets standards. A TMDL calculates the maximum amount of a pollutant that a waterbody can receive and still meet water quality standards. This maximum allowable loading must consider point and nonpoint sources while allowing for future growth and a margin of safety. As of 7/02/2002, a date has not been set to begin work on the Upper Patuxent River watershed TMDL calculation. More information on Maryland's TMDL program and current and future schedules for 303(d) listed waterbodies can be accessed through the MDE Internet site at http://www.mde.state.md.us/tmdl/index.html.  9  December 2002   Comparative Water Quality Status and Trends - Chesapeake Bay Program Water quality status and trends for the Upper Patuxent River watershed were characterized by the parameters that are listed below for two CORE ( a long term monitoring program initiated in 1974) water quality monitoring stations located within the watershed (See Map 4: CORE Water Quality Monitoring Stations and Permitted Discharges). This assessment is part of a broader, tributary basin analysis designed to assist the Patuxent River Commission in its development of Tributary Strategies to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus loading to the Chesapeake Bay. Status and trend information is calculated from data collected as part of the DNR's Chesapeake Bay Water and Habitat Quality Monitoring Program. Water quality samples are collected once or twice a month. Status is a measure of current condition (most recent three years) at a station compared either to scientifically-based benchmark values or to a benchmark data set. Based on this comparison, the station is given a ranking of ""GOOD,"" ""FAIR,"" or ""POOR."" Trends are a measure of how the system has been changing over time, either improving or worsening. The magnitude of the trend is expressed as the percent change since the beginning of the study period. Trends are measured from 1985 to the most recent year of data, for most stations. More details on the methodology and information for other monitoring stations within the Patuxent River Tributary Basin can be accessed through the internet at http://www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/tribstrat/patuxent/pr_status_trends.html. Upstream Site Laurel (Below Rocky Gorge Dam) PXT0809 Parameter Status 1997 -99 data Good Good Fair Trend 1985 through 1999 No Trend No Trend No Trend Downstream Site US50 Bridge PXT0603 (TF1.0) Status 1997 -99 data Fair Poor Fair Trend 1985 through 1999 Improving (43%) Improving (41 %) Improving (21 %)  Total Nitrogen Total Phosphorus Total Suspended Solids  Both total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations increase from the Rocky Gorge Dam to the midpoint of the watershed at the US50 monitoring station as a result of point and non-point source nutrient pollution from the northern portion of the Upper Patuxent River watershed Although mainstem water quality is decreased downstream, overall trends show that water quality, in relation to nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment, are improving at the US50 site. More recent data (01/2000 - 02/2002) collected at the two CORE monitoring stations listed above continue to show trends of increasing nutrient and sediment pollution between Rocky Gorge and the US50 Bridge (table below). On average, at the US50 bridge site, Nitrite-Nitrate 10 December 2002   loads increase 1.6 times and Total Phosphorus loads increase 4 times over those levels observed upstream at the Rocky Gorge Dam station. Likewise, a 5 fold increase in Total Suspended Sediments is apparent between Rocky Gorge and the US50 bridge. It should be recognized that the upstream Rocky Gorge and Brighton Dams will reduce downstream export of sediment by trapping sediment within the reservoir basin. The sediment loads measured at the Route 50 bridge reflect the sediments picked up from within the Upper Patuxent and those which entered the watershed through erosional processes occurring in the Little Patuxent and Middle Patuxent River watersheds (which enter the Upper Patuxent upstream of the Route 50 bridge). 01/2000 - 02/2002 Upstream Site Laurel (Below Rocky Gorge Dam) PXT0809 Average (S.E.) 0.89 (0.34) 0.026 (0.008) 5 (3) Min/Max 0.33/1.45 0.012/0.040 < 1/10 Downstream Site US50 Bridge TF1.0 Average (S.E.) 1.43 (0.26) 0.104 (0.063) 25 (46) Min/Max 0.93/2.05 0.034/0.400 < 1/ 223  Parameter Nitrite-Nitrate* (mg/l) Total Phosphorus (mg/l) Total Suspended Solids (mg/l)  * Nitrite-Nitrate are common forms of inorganic nitrogen that are readily available for plant uptake. This parameter was used for comparison due to the absence of reported Total Nitrogen data for PXT0809 station (S.E.) = Standard Error  Fish Tissue Monitoring Data Metals in fish tissue were also monitored at the two CORE sites. Fish tissue from a variety of species collected between the years 1985 and 1997 were tested for silver, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury, nickel, lead and zinc. None of the samples in this watershed, nor in the entire Patuxent River Basin, exceeded the screening level for these metal pollutants.  11  December 2002   Sources of Pollution 1. Point Sources Discharges from discrete conveyances like pipes are called ""point sources."" Point sources may contribute pollution to surface water or to groundwater. For example, wastewater treatment plant discharges may contribute nutrients or microbes that consume oxygen (measured as Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and reduce oxygen available for aquatic life. Industrial point sources may contribute various forms of pollution. Some understanding of point source discharges in a watershed targeted for restoration is useful in helping to prioritize potential restoration projects. According to the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) permit database as summarized in the following table, there are 22 permitted surface water discharges in the Upper Patuxent River Watershed. Many of these discharges are for stormwater associated with industrial activities and for both small-scale and major wastewater treatment plant discharges. Industrial stormwater discharges that are permitted can be considered point sources of pollution because of endof-pipe conveyance and the possibility that industrial stormwater may transmit some regulated pollutants. The table below provides more detail on these point-source discharges and is accompanied by site location provided in Map 4: CORE Water Quality Monitoring Stations and Permitted Discharges. Characteristics of these permitted discharges (volume, temperature, pollutants, etc.) are tracked by MDE through the permit system. This information is accessible to the public and can be obtained from MDE through a written request.

Discharges of this type have been tracked by the Chesapeake Bay Program since 1985 in order to quantify nitrogen and phosphorus loading to the Bay and identify opportunities for significant point source reductions. Three of the facilities are major wastewater treatment plants and are considered to be significant point sources of nutrient pollution. In the early 1990s, these facilities upgraded to Biological Nutrient Removal (BNR) technologies which resulted in significant reductions in nutrient discharges to adjacent surface waters. The following table presents information on nitrogen and phosphorus discharges from these major facilities and three other minor wastewater treatment plants. The data are presented for discharges (expressed as loading rates and concentrations) observed in 1985 (or whenever the facility first became active) and discharges observed in 2000 (most recent, available data). Loading rates reflect how much nutrient is delivered to receiving waters on an annual basis while concentration reflects the ""strength"" of the discharges. Particularly noticeable in the three major wastewater treatment plants are the significant decreases in both loads and concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus. These decreases can be attributed to the treatment plant BNR upgrades. This information is derived from the Chesapeake Bay Program's Point Source database which can be reviewed on a watershed basis.7  14  December 2002   Nitrogen and Phosphorus Discharges Major and Minor Wastewater Treatment Facilities Name Date N Load (lbs/yr)  N Conc.

Non-point Sources Nonpoint sources are also significant contributors of pollutants, particularly nutrients and sediment. These diffuse sources include rain water that runs off roofs, streets and parking lots (sometimes via storm drains) into nearby surface waters, as well as run-off from farm fields and, to a much lesser extent, forests. Also included in nonpoint source pollution is deposition from the atmosphere and contributions from ground water, where septic systems are a factor. The only readily available estimate of non-point source loads for the Upper Patuxent watershed are based on results from the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program's Watershed Model which address nutrient loading at the scale of larger watersheds. Applying this computer model to the Upper Patuxent watershed provided these estimates: Non-point Source Nitrogen Loading Non-point Source Phosphorus Loading = = 7.43 pounds/acre/year (lb/ac-yr) 0.43 pounds/acre/year (lb/ac-yr)  These estimates take into account data from water quality monitoring and loading rate estimates based on land use. Listed below are land use types characterized with various non-point source loading rates. These estimates are specific to the Patuxent River basin. Estimates are based on Year 2000 scenarios which take into account both the land use activities and the type and extent of BMPs for the control of non-point source pollution. Hot spots, or areas that deserve further attention if non-point source pollution control is desired, can be identified by comparing the approximate non-point source loading rates presented in the table below with the generalized map of land use land cover in the watershed (Chapter 2: Land Use).

GX270-78-5752960	"INTRODUCTION In 1998, Maryland's Clean Water Action Plan identified bodies of water that failed to meet water quality related requirements. One of the water bodies identified in the report was the Little Patuxent River. The Little Patuxent River is a tributary to the Patuxent River, which in turn flows into the Chesapeake Bay. The watershed encompasses over 66,200 acres and includes land in both Howard and Anne Arundel Counties. In response to the findings of the Maryland Clean Water Action Plan, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources has formed a partnership with Howard County to work together to assess and improve environmental conditions in the Little Patuxent Watershed. The main goals of this partnership are to develop and implement a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) for the Howard County portion of the Little Patuxent Watershed. The first step in developing a Restoration Action Strategy for the Little Patuxent Watershed is to do an overall assessment of the condition of the watershed and the streams within it. This initial step is being accomplished using two approaches. First, a watershed characterization is being done that compiles and analyzes existing water quality, land use, and living resources data about the Little Patuxent Watershed (Shanks, 2001). While the watershed characterization provides good overall information on environmental conditions within the Little Patuxent Watershed, for the most part, information on the location of specific environmental problems is limited. To provide specific information on the location of environmental problems and restoration opportunities, a Stream Corridor Assessment (SCA) survey of the Howard County portion of the Little Patuxent River Watershed was also done. The Stream Corridor Assessment survey is a new survey that has been developed by DNR's Watershed Restoration Division as a watershed management tool to identify environmental problems and help prioritize restoration opportunities on a watershed basis. As part of the survey, specially trained personnel walk the watershed's entire stream network and record information on a variety of environmental problems that can be easily observed within the stream corridor. Initial field surveys were done from November 1999 through March 2000, with some follow up investigations of specific problems done during the winter of 2001. The area targeted for a SCA survey includes about 43% of the total Little Patuxent Watershed and lies predominantly within the Maryland Piedmont. The targeted area encompasses 28,000 acres (43.7 square miles), with over 88 miles of stream within the watershed. This watershed lies within the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Corridor. Approximately 60% of the watershed is in urban land use and includes the communities of Columbia, Guilford, and Savage. Figure 1 shows the geographic location of the watershed targeted in this survey. A digital orthophoto map of the Little Patuxent watershed is shown in Figure 2. The map is based on aerial photographs taken in April 1993. Figure 3 shows the same watershed boundaries superimposed on a seven and  minute USGS topographic quadrangle map.  1   As mentioned earlier, data collected during the SCA survey will be combined with information compiled in the watershed's characterization report to develop a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy for the Howard County portion of the Little Patuxent River Watershed. The Watershed Restoration Action Strategy in turn, will help guide future restoration efforts with the ultimate goals of restoring the areas natural resources and meeting State water quality standards.  2   Little Patuxent Watershed Howard County, Maryland  . , 70  ( / 40  Centennial Ln  "" ! 108  "" ! 100  "" ! 175  29 "" !

GX265-21-1079181	"Appendix A  Total Maximum Daily Loads of Nitrogen for Three Tidal Tributaries and Total Maximum Daily Load of Biochemical Oxygen Demand for One Tributary in the Newport Bay System Worcester County, Maryland  FINAL  December 2002  Document version: December 24, 2002  A1   FINAL MODELING FRAMEWORK The computational framework chosen for the modeling of water quality in Newport Bay was the Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program version 5.1 (WASP5.1). WASP5.1 is supported and distributed by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Center for Exposure Assessment Modeling (CEAM) in Athens, GA (Ambrose et al, 1993). This program provides a generalized framework for modeling contaminant fate and transport in surface waters (Di Toro et al, 1993) and is based on the finite-segment approach. It is a very versatile program, capable of being applied in a time-variable or steady-state mode, spatial simulation in one, two or three dimensions, and using linear or non-linear estimations of water quality kinetics. To date, WASP5.1 has been employed in many modeling applications that have included river, lake, estuarine and ocean environments. The model has been used to investigate water quality concerns regarding dissolved oxygen (DO), eutrophication, and toxic substances. WASP5.1 has been used in a wide range of applications by regulatory agencies, consulting firms, academic researches, and others. EUTRO5.1 is the component of WASP5.1 that is applicable for modeling eutrophication, incorporating eight water quality constituents in the water column (Figure A1) and sediment bed. The Newport Bay Eutrophication Model (NBEM) based on a EUTRO5.1 model was implemented in a steady-state mode. This mode of using WASP5.1 simulates constant flow and average waterbody volume over the tidal cycle. The tidal mixing is accounted for using dispersion coefficients, which quantify the exchange of water quality constituents between EUTRO5.1 model segments. The model simulates an equilibrium state of the waterbody, which was applied to summer flow, spring flow and the winter flow conditions. These cases are described in more detail below. WATER QUALITY MONITORING All readily available information was considered in this TMDL analysis. Several sources of recent water quality data were particularly useful in supporting the model calibration: Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) (1998), Department of Natural Resources (DNR) (19981999), Maryland Coastal Bays Program (MCBP) (1997-2000), and National Park Service (NPKS) (1991-1999). MDE's Field Operations Program staff collected physical and chemical samples in the spring and the summer of 1998. The physical parameters, DO, salinity, conductivity, and water temperature were measured in situ at each water quality monitoring station. Grab samples were also collected for laboratory analysis. The samples were collected at a depth of 0.5 m from the surface. Samples were placed in plastic bottles and preserved on ice until they were delivered to the University of Maryland Laboratory in Solomons, MD, or the Department of Health & Mental Hygiene in Baltimore, MD for analysis. The field and laboratory protocols used to collect and process the samples are summarized in Table A1 (MDE, April 2001). The DNR data was collected as part of their Pfisteria monitoring program. The laboratory protocols are similar to those used by MDE. The MCBP maintains a volunteer monitoring program. The sampling and laboratory protocols used by the MCBP are explained in ""Coastal  Document version: December 24, 2002  A2   FINAL Bays Volunteer Monitoring Program, Water Quality Monitoring Manual Maryland Coastal Bays Program, 1997."" The NPKS maintains a monitoring program in coordination with DNR's Pfisteria network, shellfish program and the brown tide program, and its protocol is similar to those used by MDE. Table A2 shows the sampling dates for the data sets from the four programs. Figure A2 shows the locations of the sampling stations. Figures A3  A7 show the high flow and low flow data for chlorophyll a, DO, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, dissolved inorganic phosphorus, and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) (low flow only, no BOD data was collected during high flow). The eutrophication model is calibrated for both high flow and low flow periods. Temporal and spatial data availability as well as temperature and flow measurements were examined to determine the appropriate data to include as part of each calibration. Comprehensive data, that covered both tidal and non-tidal waters, was limited to 1998. Due to this limited data availability, the time period chosen for each of the calibrations focused on this time period. MDE and DNR both collected data in the tributaries that drain to Newport Bay. The MCBP and NPKS both collected near-shore samples for the bay. The model used for Newport Bay is a steady-state depth averaged model, with relatively large segments. The high flow calibration of the model was performed with data from April of 1998 (MDE 4/15, 4/22, 4/29; DNR 4/29; NPKS 1/20, 2/9, 3/13, 4/13, 12/16). The low flow calibration of the model was performed with data from July, August, September and October1998 (MDE 8/12, 9/2; DNR 7/1, 7/28, 8/26, 9/30, 10/21; MCBP 6/17  9/24; NPS 5/22  9/14). INPUT REQUIREMENTS 1  Model Segmentation and Geometry The spatial domain of the NBEM includes Newport Bay, Kitts Branch, Trappe Creek, Ayer Creek, and Newport Creek. The domain extends from the confluence of Sinupuxent Bay to the upper reaches of Kitts Branch, covering all the point sources in the Newport Bay System. Following a review of the bathymetry for Newport Bay, the system was divided into 27 segments. Figure A8 shows the model segmentation (modeling domain) of the NBEM. Figure A8 also shows the subwatershed segmentation for the Newport Bay watershed. Table A3 lists the segment volumes and depths of the 27 segments. Table A4 lists the characteristic lengths and interfacial areas between segment pairs. Dispersion Coefficients The dispersion coefficients were calibrated using the EUTRO5.1 model and in-stream salinity data from 1998. The WASP5.1 model was set up to simulate salinity. As a conservative substance, there are no changes in concentration due to chemical or biological reactions in the water. Thus, concentration is solely determined by mixing. The only sources in the system are 1 The WASP model requires all input data to be in metric units, and to be consistent with the model, all data in the Appendix will appear in metric units except the river length. Following are several conversion factors to aid in the comparison of numbers in the main document: mgd x (0.0438) = m3/s | cfs x (0.0283) = m3/s | lb / (2.2) = kg | mg/l x mgd x (8.34) / (2.2) = kg/d  Document version: December 24, 2002  A3   FINAL at the tidal boundaries. For the model execution, salinity values at all boundaries except the tidal boundaries were set to zero. As discussed above, the NBEM was calibrated for two sets of flow conditions, high flow and low flow. Estimated point and nonpoint source flows for the appropriate flow conditions were included as part of the calibration of the dispersion coefficients. The method used to calibrate the dispersion coefficients is described in more detail below. Figure A9 shows the results of the calibration of the dispersion coefficients for high flow and low flow. The same sets of dispersion coefficients were used for both the high flow and low flow calibrations of the model. The final values of the dispersion coefficients are listed in Table A4. Freshwater Flows In 1998, the model calibration period, there were no active U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gages in the Newport Bay watershed. It was necessary to estimate flows for the ""high"" flow sampling period (spring), and the ""low"" flow period (late summer-early fall). These were estimated using an area to flow ratio approach described below. It should be noted that the term ""high flow"" in this context corresponds to the relatively higher flows observed in spring, and not to rare flood conditions. The drainage basin was subdivided into 10 subwatersheds (Figure A8). A ratio of flow to area was determined for each subwatershed to estimate the flow from each. The flow to area ratio was calculated based on flow data from the nearby USGS gaging station 01485000 on the Pocomoke River near Willards, Maryland. The flow ratio, corresponding to ""high"" (spring-time) flows, was calculated by averaging daily mean stream flow data from April 1 to April 30, 1998, and dividing by the gaged watershed area. The low flow ratio was calculated by averaging daily mean discharge data from July 1 to September 30, 1998, and dividing by the gaged watershed area. Additional sets of flow for 7Q10 conditions, spring flow conditions and winter flow conditions were calculated for use in the model scenarios. An average flow ratio was calculated using the same method as for high and low flow, using discharge data from December 1950 to December 1998. Table A5 presents the flows from each subwatershed for high, low, 7Q10, spring and winter flow conditions. Again, the term ""high flow"" corresponds to the relatively higher flows that occurred in spring 1998, rather than to high flows from a long-term flow record. In fact, as seen in Table A5, the 1998 ""high"" flow is estimated to correspond closely to the long-term average flow or spring flow. Table A6 presents the contributing subwatersheds and flows to various water quality segments of the Newport bay model. Point Source Loadings Sources Considered Six point sources were considered in the TMDL analyses. These are the Berlin Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) (MD0022632), Newark WWTP (MD0020630), Kelly Foods Corporation (MD0001309), Tyson Foods Inc. (MD0002071), Ocean City Ice and Seafood  Document version: December 24, 2002  A4   FINAL (MD0055107), and Berlin Shopping Center (MD0024911). Berlin Shopping Center is now closed; however, it was considered for the calibration of the model, as it existed during the calibration period. Ocean City Ice and Seafood does not discharge any nutrient loads to the system, but its flow effect has been considered for the modeling purposes. Kelly Foods Corp. is a year-round source, but contributes very little nutrient load to the system. Newark WWTP discharges to the open bay section of the model through a small tributary called Marshall Creek, its effect on the bay itself is minimal, and there is no data collected by MDE to investigate any significant impact of this source to Marshall Creek itself. Recent DNR samplings have revealed DO and algal problems in Marshall Creek. The issue related with this point source will be dealt with at a later date when adequate samplings are available. Only the Berlin WWTP and Tyson Foods, Inc. are major point sources to be considered in the model for significant impact in the development of the model. Summary of Point Sources Considered Point Source Name Berlin Shopping Center WWTP Berlin WWTP Kelly Foods Corp. Ocean City Ice and Seafood Newark WWTP Tyson Foods, Inc. Modeling Disposition Considered only for the calibration purposes Major source Minor source Only flow effect considered Minor source Major source Discharge/Capacity (mgd) 0.003 0.6  0.75, current flow 0.006 0.0015 0.07 0.6 - 0.8, current flow  Model Calibration Consideration of Point Sources The Berlin WWTP discharges to Trappe Creek through a small tributary called Bottle Branch (model segment 12). Kelly Foods Corp. and Tyson Foods, Inc. both discharge directly to Kitts Branch (model segments 16 and 18 respectively). The flow from Ocean City Ice and Seafood is considered for the modeling purposes as an input to Trappe Creek through Bottle Branch (model segment 12). The Newark WWTP discharges to the open portion of Newport Bay through a small branch called the Marshall Creek (model segment 2). In 1998, the calibration period, these point sources were jointly contributing about 54,818 lbs/yr of nitrogen and 2,251 lbs/yr of phosphorus to the Newport Bay System. The point source flows and nutrient loadings from all the contributing sources used for the model calibration were calculated from 1998 discharge monitoring reports (DMR) data stored in MDE's Point Source Database (MDE, 2002). The DMR data was supplemented with the comprehensive data provided by John Lister of Tyson Foods Inc. and Randy Danny from the MDE Eastern Shore Field Office. Specifically, the data from April 1998 was used for the high flow calibration of the model. An average of discharge data from July, August, and September of 1998 was used for the low flow calibration of the model. These data are summarized in Table A7.  Document version: December 24, 2002  A5   FINAL Model Scenario Consideration of Point Sources Due to the nature of Newport Bay and changes in the point source operations during different seasons, scenarios are grouped in three categories according to the flow regimes: winter flow (November - March); spring flow (April-May); and summer flow (June  October). For all these flow condition categories, the TMDL analyses consider two primary scenarios: baseline scenarios and TMDL scenarios. Briefly, the baseline scenario for low and average flow conditions simulates a type of no-action situation. Point source flows and loads are increased to planned values with current or anticipated point source treatment technologies. Relatively current land use and nonpoint source loads are simulated, and associated bottom sediment properties are used (e.g., sediment nutrient flux). The TMDL scenarios simulate conditions that correspond to the maximum allowable loads. Municipal Discharges: For municipal WWTPs, the baseline scenarios typically assume approved maximum sewer plan flows, and loads that are consistent with planned treatment, and the season simulated by the particular scenario. Berlin Shopping Center is a discontinued source so it is not considered in any of the scenario runs. For the Newark WWTP, the maximum flow and loads were used in both the baseline and the TMDL scenarios for all the flow conditions except summer flow month, when it does not discharge to the bay. Berlin WWTP only discharges during the winter flow month (discharge permitted from November through March only). For the Berlin WWTP, discharge flow of 1.0 mgd was used for both the winter baseline and the winter TMDL scenarios. Table A14 shows the values of other parameters used in all the baseline scenarios for all Municipal Sources. These loads are further summarized in a technical memorandum, which accompanies this TMDL, entitled ""Significant Nutrient and Biochemical Oxygen Demand Point and Nonpoint Sources in the Newport Bay System."" Industrial Discharges: The maximum flow volumes for discharges of industrial effluents directly to waters of the State are not established in local water and sewer plans. Rather, they are established on the basis of need and other considerations. Kelly Foods Corp. (a small point source) has very little effect on the model outputs; therefore, for all the baseline and TMDL scenario runs, this source has been considered at its maximum flow and concentrations. As mentioned earlier, a flow output for Ocean City Ice and Seafood has been considered for all the baseline and the TMDL scenarios. Tyson Foods, Inc. is one significant source that controls almost all of the summer flow and the spring flow output results and the major proportion of the winter flow output result. For both the baseline and TMDL scenarios in the analyses, the Tyson Foods Inc.flow has been considered to be 0.8 mgd. In the baseline scenario the maximum permitted loads for controlled parameters and performing concentrations, loads for non-permitted parameters were used. Table A14 shows the values of other parameters used in all the baseline scenarios for all industrial sources. The TMDL scenario loads were based on the goals set up for the TMDL. Since the Berlin WWTP (a major source of the TMDL analysis) does not discharge during the summer and spring months, a consideration was given to the carryover effect of the Berlin discharge during winter to  Document version: December 24, 2002  A6   FINAL the summer and spring months scenario runs. Nutrient fluxes and sediment oxygen demand were adjusted to reflect the changes. These parameters were also adjusted for the reduction of loads for the TMDL. Thus, a key difference between the baseline scenarios and TMDL scenarios, were reductions in sediment nutrient fluxes, and SOD that reflect reduced loads from both the carryover effect, if any, and reductions proposed for point and nonpoint sources. The point source discharges simulated in the TMDL scenarios are summarized in a technical memorandum, which accompanies this TMDL, entitled ""Significant Nutrient and Biochemical Oxygen Demand Point and Nonpoint Sources in the Newport Bay System."" Nonpoint Source Loadings Nonpoint source loads were estimated for observed 1998 ""high flow"", observed 1998 ""low flow"", and spring and winter loading conditions. The surface water nonpoint source loads for high flow and low flow conditions were estimated as the product of observed water quality concentrations and the nonpoint source flows estimated as described above. Data from station XCM1562 was used as a boundary condition for segment 1 of the NBEM. The boundary conditions for the remaining non-tidal boundaries (except segments 12 through 19 during high flow) were based on data from station BMC0011. This is the only free-flowing station in the watershed and it was assumed to be a reasonable representation of background water quality in the watershed. Since the station BMC0011 represents mostly a mix of the agriculture and the forest landuses, the average annual load for segments 12 through 19 was used for high flow calibration to represent the predominantly urban watershed segments draining to these water quality segments. BOD data was not available for high flow, and was assumed to be 2.0 mg/l at all boundaries. The observed concentrations account for surface nonpoint source loads from all land uses, loads from septic tanks, atmospheric deposition to the land's surface, and base-flow groundwater loads. An additional nonpoint source load due to direct atmospheric deposition to the water surface was added to both the high flow and low flow nonpoint source loads used in the calibration of the model. Direct groundwater discharge was included in both the high flow and the low flow calibration of the model. The nonpoint source loads used in the high flow and the low flow calibrations of the model for nitrogen and phosphorus can be seen in Table A8 and Table A9, respectively. The average annual NPS load estimate was used in both the spring and winter baseline scenarios, and serves as a starting point in determining an estimate of the reduction needed to meet the winter and the spring flow TMDL goals. The average annual loading rates used for the NBEM was derived from the UMCES study ""Maryland's Coastal Bays: An Assessment of Aquatic Ecosystems, Pollutant Loadings, and Management Options."" A detail of the selection of UMCES study as the best option for calculating loading rates in the State's Coastal Bay Region (including Newport Bay) is described in Appendix A of ""Total Maximum Daily Loads of Nitrogen and Phosphorus for Five Tidal Tributaries in the Northern Coastal Bays System Worcester County, Maryland."" Land use loading rates were derived from the UMCES study described above and applied to the land uses in Newport Bay using a area unit loading rate approach. The land use in Newport Bay  Document version: December 24, 2002  A7   FINAL was calculated based on 1997 Maryland Department of Planning data, and included an adjustment to cropland acres using 1997 Farm Service Agency (FSA) data. The average annual nonpoint source load was calculated for each of the different loading rate options by summing all of the individual land use areas and multiplying by the corresponding land use loading coefficients. The average annual loading rates used in the final analysis reflect loads coming from urban development, agriculture, and forestland. An additional nonpoint source load due to direct atmospheric deposition to the water surface was included, as well as a load due to direct groundwater discharge. The atmospheric deposition load was calculated by multiplying the surface area of each water quality segment by a loading coefficient. The atmospheric loading coefficient was based on the atmospheric deposition monitoring station MD18, Assateague Island National Seashore  Woodcock established by National Atmospheric Deposition Program. The direct groundwater loads included in both the high flow and average annual loads were estimated based on methods described in the USGS report ""Ground-Water Discharge and Nitrate Loadings to the Coastal Bays of Maryland"" (Dillow and Greene, 1999). The direct discharge to Newport Bay was separated out from the total by Jonathan Dillow (USGS). The total annual direct discharge load was then distributed to the water quality segments based on the watershed contribution to the individual segments. The direct groundwater load is assumed to account for loads from septic tanks among other sources. The average spring and winter total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads are presented in Table A10 and Table A11, respectively. For all nonpoint source inputs, the concentrations of the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus are modeled in their speciated forms. The WASP5.1 model simulates nitrogen as ammonia (NH3), nitrate and nitrite (NO23), and organic nitrogen (ON); and phosphorus as ortho-phosphate (PO4) and organic phosphorus (OP). Ammonia, nitrate and nitrite, and ortho-phosphate represent the dissolved forms of nitrogen and phosphorus. The dissolved forms of nutrients are more readily available for biological processes such as algae growth, which can affect chlorophyll a levels and DO concentrations. The ratios of total nutrients to dissolved nutrients used in the model scenarios represent values that have been measured in the field. Environmental Conditions Eight environmental parameters were used for developing the model of Newport Bay. They are solar radiation, photoperiod, temperature (T), extinction coefficient (Ke), salinity, sediment oxygen demand (SOD), sediment ammonium flux (FNH4), and sediment phosphate flux (FPO4) (Table A12). The light extinction coefficient, Ke in the water column was derived from Secchi depth measurements using the following equation: Ke = where: 1.95 Ds  Document version: December 24, 2002  A8   FINAL Ke = light extinction coefficient (m-1) Ds = Secchi depth (m) Varying SOD, FNH4, and FPO4 values were used for different sections of the NBEM segmentation, where ""F"" indicates these are due to sediment fluxes. Initial values were taken from the Northern Coastal Bay TMDL model and adjusted through the calibration process. Several studies, data sets, and literature sources were reviewed to determine appropriate ranges of values for use with the model: Cerco et al., 1994; Seitzinger and DeKorsey, 1994; Sampou, 1994; Mirsajadi, 2000; UMCES, 1999; Institute of Natural Resources, 1986; and Thomann and Mueller, 1987. All values used in the model are within reasonable ranges predicted to occur in the Newport Bay. In general, lower nutrient flux and SOD values occurred in the open bays, while higher values were assumed in the upper reaches of the tributaries. During the high flow period, cooler temperatures and reduced biological activity reduce the expected nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes from the sediment. Thus, during the high flow period, the simulated ammonium flux and the ortho-phosphate flux were reduced by 75%. Nonliving organic nutrient components and phytoplankton settle from the water column into the sediment at various rates throughout the system. In general, it is reasonable to assume that 50% of the nonliving organics are in the particulate form. Such assignments were borne out through model sensitivity analyses and were within the range of literature value. Kinetic Coefficients The water column kinetic coefficients are universal constants used in the NBEM model. They are formulated to characterize the kinetic interactions among the water quality constituents. The initial values were taken from the eutrophication model developed in the State's Northern Coastal Bay System. Kinetic coefficients from past modeling studies of Potomac River (Clark and Roesh, 1978; Thomann and Fitzpatrick, 1982; Cerco, 1985), and of Mattawoman Creek (Haire and Panday, 1985; Panday and Haire, 1986; Domotor et al., 1987), and the Patuxent River (Lung, 1993) were also reviewed. The final kinetic coefficients are listed in Table A13. Initial Conditions The initial conditions used in the model were chosen to reflect the observed values as closely as possible. However, because the model simulation was run for a long period of time before it reached equilibrium, it was found that the final results are independent of initial conditions. CALIBRATION & SENSITIVITY ANALYSES The NBEM model for low flow was calibrated with July, August and September 1998 data. The NBEM was also calibrated for a high flow period with April 1998 data. Tables A6, A7, and A8 show the point source and nonpoint source flows and loads associated with the input files used for the calibrations of the model (See Point Source Loadings and Nonpoint Source Loadings above). Figure A10 shows the results of the low flow calibration of the model for the mainstem and the minor tributaries of Newport Bay. The model has captured the trend of almost all of the  Document version: December 24, 2002  A9   FINAL state variables with the emphasis on DO to capture the lower range. Ammonia near the middle section near segment 12 seems to be lower, but overall the trend is represented. Figure A11 shows the model results for the high flow calibration of the mainstem and the minor tributaries of Newport Bay. All the major variables are captured well. Along with the calibration of the high flow and low flow conditions, a series of sensitivity analyses were conducted to analyze the model response to various nutrient loading conditions. The model was found to be responsive to the loads as expected. A comprehensive set of model runs showed that for all seasonal flow and loading conditions the model was limited for change in nitrogen loading. The low flow condition, dominated by the flow from Tyson Foods, Inc., showed that the model was sensitive to change in phosphorus loading at a very low level of phosphorus input. SYSTEM RESPONSE The EUTRO5.1 model of Newport Bay was applied to several different nonpoint source loading conditions under various stream flow conditions as described earlier to project the impacts of nutrients on algal production (chlorophyll a), and DO. By simulating various stream flows, the analysis accounts for seasonality. Model Run Descriptions The first scenario represents baseline conditions of the stream during summer (low flow). The baseline scenario simulates a type of no-action situation, thus providing a stable point of comparison with the TMDL scenario. Point source flows and loads are increased to maximum planned values under current or anticipated point source treatment technologies. Relatively current land use and nonpoint source loads are simulated, and associated bottom sediment properties are simulated. In this case, the 7Q10 flows were used to present critical conditions during the summer. The flows were estimated using a regression analysis as described above (Table A6). The total nonpoint source loads were computed as the product of observed 1998 base-flow concentrations and the estimated critical low flow with additional loads included to account for direct atmospheric deposition to the water's surface, and the direct groundwater discharge. Because the loads are based on observed concentrations, they account for all natural and human-induced sources. The point source loads were increased to reflect maximum possible loading conditions under existing or draft permits. The maximum load at Tyson Foods, Inc. was calculated based on the highest loading pattern throughout the year (0.8 mgd), as there is currently no flow limit on the plant. The maximum load at Kelly Foods Corp. was calculated by multiplying the plant's maximum capacity flow by its current National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitted concentrations and the reported concentrations for those parameters, which do not have permit values. Flow inputs from Ocean City Ice and Seafood were used as described earlier. All the municipal sources in the basin do not discharge during the summer flow months. The point source loads for Scenario 1 are presented in Table A14. All the environmental parameters and kinetic coefficients established by the low flow calibration of the model remained the same for Scenario 1.  Document version: December 24, 2002  A10   FINAL  The second scenario represents the baseline conditions of the stream during the spring flow months. The baseline scenario simulates a type of no-action situation, thus providing a stable point of comparison with the TMDL scenario. Point source flows and loads are increased to maximum planned values under current or anticipated point source treatment technologies. Relatively current land use and nonpoint source loads are simulated, and associated bottom sediment properties are assumed. The average annual flows and nonpoint source loads were calculated as described above. The nonpoint source loads included direct groundwater discharge and direct atmospheric deposition to the water's surface. The nonpoint source loads are presented in Table A10. The point source flows for Tyson Foods, Inc. and Kelly Foods Corp. remained the same as in the Scenario 1. The loads were changed to reflect the annual plant load discharge and permitted load discharge. Berlin WWTP loads were not considered, as it does not discharge during the spring months. Flow from the Newark WWTP was considered. Loads were calculated based on the current flows and loads reflecting permitted conditions. The point source loads used in Scenario 2 can be seen in Table A14. The method used to estimate average annual nitrogen and phosphorus loads did not include estimations of DO, chlorophyll a, and BOD boundary loads. The missing values for loadings (BOD, CHLa, DO) were assumed to be the same as for the low flow condition. The kinetic coefficients remained the same as for Scenario 1. The environmental parameters, except the temperature, remained the same as Scenario 1. Temperature was changed to reflect average temperature during the spring months (Table A15). The higher solar radiation and temperature during this period represent conservative assumptions as a margin of safety. The third scenario represents the baseline conditions of the stream during the winter flow months. As explained earlier, the baseline scenario simulates a type of no-action situation, thus providing a stable point of comparison with the TMDL scenario. Point source flows and loads were increased to maximum planned values under current or anticipated point source treatment technologies. Relatively current land use and nonpoint source loads are simulated, and associated bottom sediment properties are assumed. The average annual flows and nonpoint source loads were calculated as described above. The nonpoint source loads included direct groundwater discharge and direct atmospheric deposition to the water surface. The nonpoint source loads are presented in Table A11. The point source flows and the loads for Tyson Foods, Inc., Kelly Foods Corp. and Newark WWTP remained the same as in the Scenario 2. The Berlin WWTP loads were considered at its requested expansion of the plant (1.0 mgd). Loads were calculated based on the current flow and loads reflecting permitted conditions. The point source loads used in Scenario 3 can be seen in Table A14. The method used to estimate average annual nitrogen and phosphorus loads did not include estimations of DO, chlorophyll a, and BOD boundary loads. The missing values for loadings (BOD, CHLa, DO) were assumed to be the same as for the high flow condition. The kinetic coefficients remained the same as for Scenario 1. The environmental parameters temperature, fraction of daylight, and solar radiation represent a critical condition in the month of March (Table A15). The higher solar radiation and temperature during this period represent conservative assumptions as a margin of safety.  Document version: December 24, 2002  A11   FINAL  The TMDL scenarios (Scenario 4, Scenario 5, and Scenario 6) were the result of a number of iterative model scenarios involving nutrient reductions that were explored to determine the maximum allowable loads. The fourth, fifth and sixth scenarios yield the water quality response for the maximum allowable loads for summer flow, spring flow, and winter flow, respectively. Model sensitivity analyses were performed to ascertain whether the model predicted nitrogen or phosphorus to limit algal growth during the different flow regimes. Under low flow conditions, the model was found to be sensitive to either reduction in phosphorus or nitrogen, indicating a phosphorus-limited/nitrogen-limited system depending on the situation of the loadings. The flow from Tyson Foods, Inc. controls the nutrient limiting situation as the contribution from the nonpoint source is not that significant to switch the limitation. Under spring and winter flow conditions, the model was not sensitive to reductions in phosphorus, indicating a nitrogen-limited system. These model findings are consistent with nutrient limitation analyses based on the water quality data. The Berlin WWTP does not discharge during warmer months (i.e., summer and spring flow months). An adjustment was made on the bottom sediment fluxes to account for the no flow effect from this plant. Kelly Foods Corp., a very small source, was not reduced for the TMDL scenario. The Newark WWTP was also set to its current level of discharge as there were not much sampling points to do a detailed analysis for localized problem. Sediment fluxes were also decreased proportionally in relation to nonpoint and point source load reductions for each scenario. A method was developed to estimate the reductions in nutrient fluxes and SOD from the sediment layer. First, an initial estimate was made of the total organic nitrogen and organic phosphorus settling to the river bottom, from particulate nutrient organics, living algae, and phaeophytin, in each segment. This was done by running the baseline scenario once with estimated settling of organics and chlorophyll a, then again with no settling. The difference in the organic matter between the two runs was assumed to settle to the river bottom, where it would be available as a source of nutrient flux and SOD. All phaeophytin was assumed to settle to the bottom. The amount of phaeophytin was estimated from in-stream water quality data. To calculate the organic loads from the algae, it was assumed that the nitrogen to chlorophyll a ratio was 6.25, and the phosphorus to chlorophyll a ratio was 0.625. This analysis was then repeated for the reduced nutrient loading conditions. The percentage difference between the amount of nutrients that settled in the expected condition scenarios and the amount that settled in the reduced loading scenarios was then applied to the nutrient fluxes in each segment. The reduced nutrient scenarios were then run again with the updated fluxes, with a new value of settled organics and new fluxes calculated. The process was repeated several times, until the reduced fluxes remained constant. Along with reductions in nutrient fluxes from the sediments, when the nutrient loads to the system are reduced, the sediment oxygen demand was also reduced (US EPA, 1997). It was assumed that the SOD would be reduced in the same proportion as the reduction in nitrogen fluxes. Simulated reductions in nutrients affect the initial concentrations of chlorophyll a in the fresh water flows at the model's boundaries. To estimate the chlorophyll a reductions, the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus available for algae growth was calculated based on reduced nutrient  Document version: December 24, 2002  A12   FINAL loads. The maximum possible amount of chlorophyll a that could be grown was calculated twice, once assuming nitrogen was the limiting nutrient, and again assuming phosphorus was the limiting nutrient. The lower of two values was compared to the baseline scenario boundary value for chlorophyll a, and the lower of these three values was then taken to be the boundary for average flow based on principles of nutrient limitations. The NBEM calculates the daily average DO concentrations in the stream. This is not necessarily protective of water quality when one considers the effects of diurnal DO variation due to photosynthesis and respiration of algae. The photosynthetic process centers about the chlorophyll a containing algae, which utilize radiant energy from the sun to convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose, and release oxygen. Because the photosynthetic process is dependent on solar radiant energy, the production of oxygen proceeds only during daylight hours. Concurrently with this production, however, the algae require oxygen for respiration, which can be considered to proceed continuously. Minimum values of DO usually occur in the early morning predawn hours when the algae have been without light for the longest period of time. Maximum values of DO usually occur in the early afternoon. The diurnal range (maximum minus minimum) may be large. If the daily mean level of DO is low, minimum values of DO during a day may approach zero and create a potential for fish kill. A 1998 study performed on the Pocomoke, captured 24-hour DO measurements from May through September (Boynton and Burger, 1999). This study found that the magnitude of diurnal change in the Pocomoke River was typical of other Chesapeake Bay tributaries, amounting on average to about 2.0 mg/l-day for chlorophyll a concentration ranging from 50-100 g/l and 0.5 mg/l-day for chlorophyll a concentration averaging 25 g/l. Using this as a guideline, the following scenarios include an additional 1.0 mg/l margin of safety to protect for the diurnal variation of DO in the areas of high algal concentration and a 0.3 mg/l margin of safety to protect for the diurnal variation of DO in the areas where the algal concentration averages around 25 g/l. Thus, the goal for the final scenarios will be a DO concentration of 6 mg/l and 5.3 mg/l, respectively. The fourth scenario represents improved conditions associated with the maximum allowable loads to the stream during critical low flow (Summer Flow TMDL Scenario). The stream flows, and nonpoint source loads from which reductions were estimated, were the same as baseline Scenario 1. All of the environmental parameters (except sediment nutrient fluxes and SOD) and kinetic coefficients used for the calibration of the model remained the same as baseline Scenario 1. The nonpoint source load of total nitrogen from runoff was reduced by 45% and the direct atmospheric deposition load of nitrogen to the water's surface was reduced by 20%. It is reasonable to estimate that the direct nitrogen atmospheric deposition loads can be reduced by 20% due to anticipated actions under the Clean Air Act. This is consistent with reductions in the ""TMDL Analysis for Indian River, Indian River Bay, and Rehoboth Bay, Delaware (December, 1998)."" The point source loads reflect maximum flow expected from the plant. The point source concentration was reduced for nitrogen to 4.0 mg/l for Tyson Foods, Inc. All other sources remained at the same level as the baseline Scenario 2. More information about point source loads can be found in the technical memorandum entitled ""Significant Nutrient and Biochemical  Document version: December 24, 2002  A13   FINAL Oxygen Demand Point and Nonpoint Sources in the Newport Bay System,"" and in the section entitled INPUT REQUIREMENTS above. The sediment fluxes were adjusted for reduced nonpoint and point source loading condition as mentioned above and the SOD was adjusted accordingly to reflect the changes of fluxes. In addition to implicit margins of safety discussed below, an explicit margin of safety was included in this scenario. It was computed as 5% of the allowable nonpoint source and direct atmospheric deposition loads. The fifth scenario represents improved conditions associated with the maximum allowable loads to the stream during spring flow (Spring Flow TMDL Scenario). Under spring flow conditions; the algal growth is nitrogen limited. The stream flows and nonpoint source loads from which reductions were estimated were the same as baseline Scenario 2. All the environmental parameters (except nutrient fluxes and SOD) and kinetic coefficients used for the calibration of the model remained the same as Scenario 2. The nonpoint source load of total nitrogen from runoff loads were reduced by 45% in the Newport Bay System except Bottle Branch section where a reduction of 55% was made. In addition, the direct atmospheric deposition of nitrogen to the water's surface was reduced by 20% under the assumption that the load reductions will occur throughout the year. Sediment fluxes were reduced based on the method described above. The point source loads reflect maximum flow expected from the plant. The point source concentration was reduced for nitrogen to 8 mg/l for Tyson Foods, Inc. All other sources stayed at the same level as baseline Scenario 2. More information about point source loads can be found in the technical memorandum entitled ""Significant Nutrient and Biochemical Oxygen Demand Point and Nonpoint Sources in the Newport Bay System,"" and in the section entitled INPUT REQUIREMENTS above. In addition to implicit margins of safety discussed below, an explicit margin of safety was included in this scenario. It was computed as 5% of the allowable nonpoint source and direct atmospheric deposition loads. The sixth scenario represents improved conditions associated with the maximum allowable loads to the stream during high flow (High Flow TMDL Scenario). Under high flow conditions, the algal growth is nitrogen limited. The stream flows, and nonpoint source loads from which reductions were estimated, were the same as baseline Scenario 3. All the environmental parameters (except nutrient fluxes and SOD) and kinetic coefficients used for the calibration of the model remained the same as Scenario 3. The nonpoint source load of total nitrogen from runoff was reduced by 45% and the direct atmospheric deposition load of nitrogen to the water's surface was reduced by 20%. It is reasonable to estimate that the direct nitrogen atmospheric deposition loads can be reduced by 20% due to anticipated actions under the Clean Air Act. This is consistent with reductions in the  Document version: December 24, 2002  A14   FINAL ""TMDL analysis for Indian River, Indian River Bay, and Rehoboth Bay, Delaware (December, 1998)."" The point source loads reflect maximum flow expected from the plant. The point source concentration was reduced for nitrogen to 18 mg/l for Tyson Foods, Inc. and 24 mg/l for the Berlin WWTP. All other sources stayed at the same level as baseline Scenario 3. More information about point source loads can be found in the technical memorandum entitled ""Significant Nutrient and Biochemical Oxygen Demand Point and Nonpoint Sources in the Newport Bay System,"" and in the section entitled INPUT REQUIREMENTS above. In addition to implicit margins of safety discussed below, an explicit margin of safety was included in this scenario. It was computed as 5% of the allowable nonpoint source and direct atmospheric deposition loads. Scenario Results Baseline Scenarios: 1. Summer Flow (Scenario 1): Simulates critical low stream flow conditions during summer season. Surface water quality parameters (e.g., nutrient concentrations) are based on 1998 observed data. Additional loads due to direct atmospheric deposition and from the direct groundwater discharge are also included. Point source loads are based on expected flow from the plant and the current operating conditions. 2. Spring Flow (Scenario 2): Simulates spring flow conditions, with average annual nonpoint source loads estimated on the basis of 1997 land use, and unit area nutrient loading rates (UMCES, 1993). Point source loads are based on expected flow from the plant and the current operating conditions for the annual condition. 3. Winter Flow (Scenario 3): Simulates winter flow conditions, with average annual nonpoint source loads estimated on the basis of 1997 land use, and unit area nutrient loading rates (UMCES, 1993). Point source loads are based on expected flow from the plant and the current operating conditions for the annual condition. The three baseline scenarios represent the conditions when water quality is impaired by high chlorophyll a levels, and low DO concentrations. The results for Scenario 1, Scenario 2, and Scenario 3 can be seen in Figures A12 through A14, respectively. In Scenario 1 (for low flow conditions), the peak chlorophyll a level is around the value of 110 g/l in the Trappe Creek, which is above the goal of 50 g/l. The DO level in the Trappe Creek along with Ayer Creek, Newport Creek and Newport Bay are below the analysis threshold of 6.0 mg/l and 5.3 mg/l. Recall that the threshold of 6.0 mg/l is used to account for diurnal variations in DO, where chlorophyll a concentrations range from 50-100 g/l and 5.3 mg/l where the average concentration is below 25 g/l.  Document version: December 24, 2002  A15   FINAL Scenario 2 (for spring flow conditions), shows high chlorophyll a values in the Trappe Creek, with values exceeding 107 g/l. The DO levels are also below the analysis threshold of 6.0 mg/l throughout the Newport Bay, Newport Creek and Ayer Creek. Scenario 3 (for winter flow conditions), shows high chlorophyll a values in the Trappe Creek, with values exceeding 61 g/l. The DO is above the analysis threshold of 6.0 mg/l throughout the Newport Bay System. Future Condition TMDL Scenarios: 4. Summer Flow (Scenario 4): Simulates the future condition of maximum allowable loads for critical low stream flow conditions during summer season. 5. Spring Flow (Scenario 5): Simulates the future condition of maximum allowable loads for spring stream flow conditions. 6. Winter Flow (Scenario 6): Simulates the future condition of maximum allowable loads for winter stream flow conditions. The results of the scenarios indicate that the water quality targets for DO and chlorophyll a are satisfied at all locations within the Newport Bay System under consideration in the analysis. The results of Scenario 4 are presented in Figure A12. The results show the standards have been met throughout the bay system under consideration in the analyses. The results of Scenario 5 and Scenario 6 are presented in Figures A13 and A14, respectively. With the desired load reduction as mentioned above, the water quality standards are met throughout the Newport Bay System.

The effect of Newark WWTP on Newport Bay is not discernable. Consequently, loads from Newark WWTP are being addressed in this analysis as part of the upstream background NPS load to Newport Bay that comes from Marshall Creek. Newark WWTP will be addressed explicitly when a future analysis is conducted for Marshall Creek. It should be noted that current permit requirements for Newark WWTP include zero allowable discharge for the months of June through August.

Georges Creek is a tributary of the North Branch Potomac River in Maryland. The Georges Creek watershed encompasses about 47,700 acres (74 square miles) of land in Allegany (67%) and Garrett (33%) Counties. The Creek drains north to south a mountain valley bounded by Big Savage Mountain on the west and Dans Mountain on the east. Frostburg, the largest community in the watershed, is situated at the Georges Creek headwaters. Most Georges Creek tributaries on the west side of the mainstem have their headwaters in Garrett County. Fortunately, Garrett County accepted Allegany County's invitation to participate on the WRAS Steering Committee and to have the stream corridor assessment include both Counties. Allegany County, Maryland is receiving Federal grant funding and State technical assistance to prepare a WRAS for the Georges Creek watershed for several reasons:  the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan identified the Georges Creek watershed as a Priority Watershed ""in need of restoration.""  Allegany County applied for grant funding and volunteered to develop a strategy in the watershed to improve water quality using protection and restoration projects. Water Quality Acid mine drainage (AMD) has a significant impact on water quality in the Georges Creek watershed. Excessive acidity and/or high concentrations of metals mobilized by acid complete eliminate aquatic habitat in some stream segments. The extent of AMD impacts on local waterways is not quantified in some stream segments and the severity of AMD water quality degradation varies in most streams. However, it appears that about one third of the watershed's stream miles have degraded water quality associated with AMD. In addition, altered hydrology caused by past mining activity is also dewatering some stream segments in the northern half of the watershed. This condition has caused essentially dry streams during otherwise natural low flow periods. Water quality concerns related to biological oxygen demand (BOD) and nutrients have been noted in the watershed, mostly the Georges Creek mainstem. This led to the watershed being scheduled for a total maximum daily load (TMDL) analysis. The Maryland Dept. of the Environment (MDE) has conducted water monitoring and will prepare a water quality analysis for Georges Creek by the end of 2001. It will focus on concerns associated with nutrients and BOD contributed primarily by inadequately treated sewage, sanitary sewer overflows and failing septic systems.  iv   Land Use Approximately 71% of the Georges Creek watershed is forest land (68% forested in Allegany County and 79% in Garrett County). From a watershed-wide perspective, forest management practices on these lands appear to be contributing to good water quality. Agriculture covers about 12% of the watershed but prime agricultural soil only accounts for 1% of the watersheds soils. Agriculture's impacts on water quality appears to be localized, such as streams in some agricultural lands that do not have riparian forest buffers. Urban land is concentrated in Allegany County along the Georges Creek mainstem and tributaries in response to the steep topography that dominates the watershed. This urban land distribution contributes to flood hazard and tends to ensure that instances of inadequately treated sewage discharge readily enter local waterways. Urban is projected to expand over the next twenty years mostly at the expense of forest land. This change is not projected to be significant. Existing and projected impervious area is anticipated to remain between 4.5% and 5% of the watershed. Living Resources and Habitat Native brook trout populations inhabit headwater areas of at least five of the eight subwatersheds (Maryland 12-digit) in the Georges Creek watershed. However, these high quality aquatic habitats are isolated from each other because waters that degraded by AMD encompass downstream tributary areas and the mainstem of Georges Creek. Fish populations and stream ""bug"" populations (benthic macroinvertebrates) assessed in four Georges Creek mainstem sites and three tributary sites were rated as poor or very poor. The mainstem sites where in AMD-affected areas. Additional characterization of these aquatic populations will be conducted at 10 new sites in 2003. Restoration Targeting Tools Stream corridor assessments were completed for the Neff Run subwatershed in 1999 and for the remainder of the Georges Creek watershed in Winter 2000/2001. These assessments identify the status of stream buffers, stream bank erosion, and other conditions. This information will provide a foundation for targeting restoration projects. Computerized mapping was used to demonstrate concepts for restoration targeting and to help identify areas for additional site investigation for restoration of stream buffers and wetlands. Past flood damage and acid mine drainage (AMD) in the watershed is currently being mitigated through targeted projects and programs. Several projects already underway in the watershed demonstrate that these projects provide opportunities to enhance water quality and habitat improvement. By adding other funding sources to those available through the flood mitigation and/or AMD programs, both environmental and community benefits can be efficiently enhanced because mobilization and administrative costs can be minimized.  v   INTRODUCTION Watershed Selection Maryland's Clean Water Action Plan, completed in 1998, identified water bodies that failed to meet water quality requirements. As part of the State's response, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is offering funding and technical assistance to Counties willing to work cooperatively to devise and implement a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) for the impaired water bodies. Allegany County is one of five Counties participating in the first round of the WRAS program. The portion of the Georges Creek watershed within Allegany County is the area selected for restoration. This watershed has several key characteristics: mountainous location, steep terrain, roads and buildings often located in flood-prone areas, current and past coal mining operations, and generally rural land uses including extensive forests. Location Georges Creek is a tributary to the North Branch of the Potomac River in mountainous Western Maryland. Approximately 67% of the Georges Creek watershed is in Allegany County, Maryland and the remainder is in Garrett County, Maryland. This area is the focus of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy and this Watershed Characterization. Map 1 WRAS Project Area shows the geographic location of the WRAS watershed. Map 2 Streams and Sub-Watersheds shows that the two Counties share most of the tributaries on the west side of the Georges Creek mainstem. Purpose of the Characterization One of the earliest steps toward devising a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy is to characterize the watershed using immediately available information. This Watershed Characterization is intended to meet several objectives:  briefly summarize the most important or relevant information and issues  provide preliminary findings based on this information  identify sources for more information or analysis  suggest opportunities for additional characterization and restoration work.  1   Additional Characterization Recommended The Watershed Characterization is intended to be a starting point. It is part of a framework for a more thorough assessment involving an array of additional inputs:  self-investigation by the local entity  targeted technical assistance by partner agencies or contractors  input from local stakeholders  Stream Corridor Assessment, i.e. physically walking the streams and cataloguing important issues, is part of the technical assistance offered by DNR  Synoptic water quality survey, i.e. a program of water sample analysis, can be used to focus on local issues like nutrient hot spots, point source discharges or other selected issues. This is also part of the technical assistance offered by DNR. Identifying Gaps in Information It is important to identify gaps in available watershed knowledge and gauge the importance of these gaps. One method is to review available information in the context of four physical / biological assessment categories that have been successfully applied in other watershed restoration efforts. These are the main categories that impact aquatic biota:  Habitat: physical structure, stream stability and biotic community (including the riparian zone)  Water Quantity: high water - storm flow & flooding; low water - baseflow problems from dams, water withdrawals, reduced infiltration  Water Quality: water chemistry; toxics, nutrients, sediment, nuisance odors/scums, etc.  Cumulative effects associated with habitat, water quantity and water quality. Adaptive Management In addition, the Watershed Characterization and the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy should be maintained as living documents within an active evolving restoration process. These documents will have to be updated periodically as new, more relevant information becomes available and as the watershed response is monitored and reassessed. This type of approach to watershed restoration and protection is often referred to as ""adaptive management.""  2     WATER QUALITY Designated Uses All waters of the State are assigned a ""Designated Use"" in regulation, COMAR 26.08.02.08, which is associated with a set of water quality criteria necessary to support that use. A simplified summary of the Designation Uses in the Georges Creek watershed is listed below. (The Department of the Environment should be contacted for official regulatory information.) 9 - Use I-P: for water contact recreation, aquatic life, and potable water:  Georges Creek mainstem. - Use III-P: for natural trout populations and potable water:  all tributaries to Georges Creek. Not Supporting Designated Use Listings One of the more recent official statement on use limitations in the Georges Creek watershed is found in the State's water quality report issued August 2000: 13 Georges Creek (02141004) - Data from the CORE station in the mainstem creek above Westernport (GEO0009) show elevated bacterial levels in the mainstem river that may be due to upstream runoff from urban and natural settings and sewerage problems. This reach of Georges Creek between Lonaconing and the North Branch Potomac River (7.8 miles) is considered to be partially supporting all uses. Data from seven biological sampling sites in four sub-watersheds were analyzed using draft biological criteria protocols . Because of poor fish communities (and some sites with poor benthic communities) at each station, the four sub-watersheds (Georges Creek - 12.1 mi. and 7.0 mi.; Staub Run - 10.1 mi.; Sand Spring Run - 7.8 mi.) were identified as not supporting all/aquatic life uses. Biologists noted low pH, siltation, and stream modification (channelization) as site-specific habitat and water quality issues that might affect the aquatic community. Based on 1996 listings, significant portions of the Georges Creek either do not support their designated use or partially do not support their designated use.2 As required under Section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act, Maryland tracks waterways that did not support their designated use in a prioritized list of ""Water Quality Limited Basin Segments"" sometimes simply called the 303(d) list. Georges Creek is referenced in the list in two places: - Nutrients. In the 1996 303(d) list, the North Branch of the Potomac River (which includes Georges Creek) is listed as Priority #11. Nutrients from point, nonpoint and natural sources are identified as the problem. Georges Creek is also listed separately in the 1996 list for nutrients and suspended sediment from point, nonpoint and natural sources. (Recent monitoring by MDE suggests that nutrient 5   loads are not having measurable affects in Georges Creek. See the TMDL section for more information.) - Acid Mine Drainage. In the 1998 Additions to the 303(d) list, Georges Creek is listed as a medium priority for targeting acid mine drainage remediation within two years. Low pH (excessively acidic water) is listed as the problem. The 303(d) priority referenced above is established by the Maryland Department of the Environment. Information considered in setting these priorities include, but is not limited to, severity of the problem and the extent of understanding of problem causes and remedies. These priorities are used to help set State work schedules various programs including total maximum daily loads (TMDLs). Water Quality Indicators The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan published in 1998 listed the following water quality indicators for the Georges Creek.3 The Georges Creek is also identified in the Plan as a Category 1 Priority Watershed ""in need of restoration during the next two years."" For more details on the Clean Water Action Plan see www.dnr.state.md.us/cwap/ Water Quality Indicator (click name for details) State 303(d) Impairment No. Modeled TN Load Finding 3 4.29 lbs/acre 0.37 lbs/acre Rank Fail Pass Bench Mark 3 = additional protection needed. This watershed is included in the 303d list. In comparison to 138 watersheds in Maryland, this watershed is among the 104 watersheds (75%) with lower loadings. In comparison to 138 watersheds in Maryland, this watershed is among the104 watersheds (75%) with lower loadings.  Modeled TP Load  Pass  6   Interpreting Water Quality Indicators State 303(d) Impairment Number. This number is used to characterize watersheds relative to regulatory requirements of the Federal Clean Water Act. It is based on numerous water quality-related factors that are tracked by the State of Maryland under these federal requirements . Modeled TN Load. TN refers to Total Nitrogen. Nitrogen Load is a measure of how much of this important nutrient is reaching streams and other surface waters. For each type of land use in the watershed, on average, stormwater tends to carry or transport a characteristic amount of nitrogen from the land to nearby streams. Based on these averages, computers can be used to estimate (model) how much nitrogen is likely to be reaching local streams. This method was applied Statewide to all the 138 watersheds in Maryland to allow comparison of ""modeled total nitrogen load"" among them. The rank of ""pass"" means that this watershed was among the 104 (75%) out of 138 total watersheds in Maryland that had the lower estimated total phosphorus load. Modeled TP Load. TP refers to Total Phosphorus. It is a measure of how much of this important nutrient is reaching streams and other surface waters. The ranking for modeled TP Load was performed in parallel to the ranking for modeled TN Load above. (Note: details of the models differ.) The rank of ""pass"" means that this watershed was among the 104 (75%) out of 138 total watersheds in Maryland that had the lower estimated total phosphorus load.  7   Tributary Team Characterization As part of the work of the Upper Potomac Tributary Team, Georges Creek water quality measured at Franklin is characterized below: Parameter Nitrogen: total Phosphorus: total Suspended Solids: total Status 1996/1998 Data good fair poor Trend 1985 to 1998 Data improving (31%) no trend no trend  Water Quality Assessment The Georges Creek watershed includes areas of excellent water quality that are mostly found in headwater tributaries. It also has areas exhibiting water quality so poor that aquatic life is eliminated  mostly due to acid mine drainage (AMD). The following summaries indicate the range of water quality issues identified in the watershed. Much of the water quality discussed in this section is available via the Internet at www.dnr.state.md.us/irc/datasets.html and www.chesapeakebay.net/wquality.htm . 1. Dissolved Oxygen For many years, dissolved oxygen levels have been measured at a monitoring station (GEO0009) on Georges Creek upstream of Westernport. Throughout the period 1985 and 2000, dissolved oxygen levels have been consistently better than minimum State standard of 5 mg/l. The range for this time period was from nearly 8 mg/l to over 12 mg/l. See Map 3 Monitoring Stations for the station location. 2. Bacterial Contamination Several sources reported bacterial contamination in Georges Creek between the mouth and Lonaconing.13, 19 One source notes contamination in several tributary streams.19 This problem is associated with failing septic systems, inadequate sewage treatment and direct discharge of untreated sewage. It may be noted that this segment of Georges Creek is also a trout stocking area, which suggests that the severity of the problem may have been reduced in recent years. Bacterial contamination as measured by fecal coliforms in Georges Creek is being tracked at a long term monitoring station just upstream of Westernport. In general, fecal coliform levels are seasonally high in summer months. Peak levels in the late 1990s are generally lower that peaks in the early 1990s and earlier. This station is labeled as GEO0009 on Map 3 Monitoring Stations. It is anticipated that MDE will release a Water Quality Assessment later this year that will address this issue in detail. In addition, the 2001 Maryland General Assembly is considering a funding initiative that could potentially be used to help eliminate this problem. 8   3. High pH and Chemical Concentrations Streams in the Georges Creek watershed that are impacted in varying degrees by acidity associated with AMD are shown in Map 13 Trout Habitat and Acid Mine Drainage. In the most impacted stream segments, pH levels below 3.0 have been measured. This is about the same acidity as stomach acid and generally eliminates most forms of aquatic life. The map does not show the variation in severity of the acidity problem that is know to exist. High concentrations of chemicals such as iron, aluminum, manganese and others are frequently associated with low pH levels. These water column constituents naturally occur at low levels and are beneficial to aquatic life at low concentrations. However, high concentrations can inhibit growth and survival of many aquatic organisms. The pH and chemical concentrations in Georges Creek vary along its course depending upon buffering influences from some tributaries and additional acidic inputs from others. On balance, the magnitude of the pH problem is greater than the available buffering capacity of the stream system. Therefore, Georges Creek is excessively acidic throughout much of its length. At the long term monitoring station (GEO0009) shown in Map 3 Monitoring Stations, iron concentrations are highly variable. Peak iron concentrations measured between 8 and 15 mg/l are indicative of the dissolved metal issue in Georges Creek. In addition, acid mine monitoring data, generally including pH and metals concentrations, have been collected in streams by MDE Bureau of Mines. However, analysis and summarization of the data needs to be accomplished. 4. High Quality Streams In the Georges Creek watershed, the highest quality water tends to be in headwater areas of tributaries that are not affected by AMD. These high water quality areas generally coincide with the trout habitat areas shown in Map 13 Trout Habitat and Acid Mine Drainage. The streams shown as blue lines in the map may not have sufficient water quality data characterize their condition. The map shows that high quality areas are isolated from each other and that downstream water quality problems are not effectively addressed by dilution.  9   5. Total Maximum Daily Loads: Nutrients and BOD In the 2000 Maryland Section 305(b) Water Quality Report issued August 2000, Georges Creek is among the North Branch Potomac River Basin watersheds that is expected to have a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) prepared.13 The report included this information because available historic data suggested that Georges Creek water quality was being degraded by nutrients and/or biological oxygen demand (BOD). Both of these pollutants are were believed to be contributed by a combination of inadequate sewage treatment, sanitary sewer overflows, failing septic systems. MDE recently conducted water quality monitoring to collect sufficient current data for analysis. Their findings indicate that the pollutants of concern, nutrients and biological oxygen demand (BOD) may not be degrading Georges Creek water quality to a degree that warrants completion of a TMDL. Based on this new information and consistent with requirements of the Federal Clean Water Act, MDE will prepare a Water Quality Analysis (WQA) before the end of calendar year 2001 that documents their findings. It is anticipated that the WQA will indicate that TMDL limits for Georges Creek nutrients or BOD are not necessary at this time. The monitoring information and analysis in the WQA report will be an important addition to the WRAS Characterization. In addition, MDE will also consider the impacts of nutrients and BOD in the Potomac River which will include inputs from the Georges Creek watershed. If Georges Creek pollutants are found to be contributing to downstream water quality problems, TMDL limits may be adopted at that time. However, this work has yet to be scheduled. 6. Drinking Water and Reservoirs of the Midland-Lonaconing Water System 25 Concentrations of iron and manganese in the groundwater of the Georges Creek region tend to be high, exceeding the recommended drinking water limit in the National Secondary Drinking Water Regulation of 0.3 mg/l and 0.05 mg/l respectively. In the thorough source water assessment reported by MDE in December 2000, current drinking water quality issues and susceptibility to increasing contamination in the MidlandLonaconing Reservoirs relates primarily to fecal coliform bacteria and turbidity related to sediment. The three reservoirs in the Georges Creek watershed are shown in Map 9 Protected Land, Smart Growth and Reservoirs. In general these reservoirs provide water of acceptable quality for potable uses. The majority of each of the three reservoir watersheds is covered by forest and brush. Mining incorporates a small percentage of these watersheds and is not currently an issue. The synthetic contaminants that have been detected in the reservoirs were found at levels below recommended drinking water limits.  10    Mining Impacts / Acid Mine Drainage 1. Overview Mining for coal and related activities in the Georges Creek watershed have been, and continue to be, an important activities. Map 4 1990 Coal Mining Extent indicates that large areas of the watershed have either been surface mined or have deep mines beneath the surface. The magnitude of coal mining impacts in the Georges Creek watershed are unique in Maryland due to the extent and concentration of the mining activity. 10 These impacts vary greatly from place to place but, overall in the watershed, include: acidified stream and ground waters, seasonally dewatered stream segments, loss of aquatic habitat, lowering of the groundwater table and greatly altered hydrology, and surface subsidence associated with settling over deep mines. To help characterize the relationship of coal mining to surface water and groundwater conditions, several sections of a 1990 report by DNR and MDE are included here in subsections with headings labeled ""History of ..."" or otherwise presented in quotes. The Georges Creek watershed has numerous stream segments where water quality is impacted by acid mine drainage (AMD). In some places acidic waters associated with AMD have severely altered aquatic habitat conditions and have eliminated habitat for species sensitive to low pH. Map 13 Trout Habitat and Acid Mine Drainage shows the extent of streams affected by AMD. The map does not show the variation in pH that occurs as various tributary flows of buffering or acidic waters mix. 2. History of Local Mining and Subsurface Drainage 19 ""Bituminous coal was first mined in the Georges Creek watershed around 1804 for local blacksmith forges, inns and homes. Mining activity increased later in the 1800s as the demand for coal in eastern Maryland made it economically feasible to raft coal downstream. Between 1900 and 1918, coal production in the region peaked and 4.5 to 5 million tons were mined annually in Western Maryland. Production decreased significantly [after World War I] because the region's primary coal seam, the Pittsburg Coal [Big Vein], was exhausted. Around 1945, surface (strip) mining became the predominant method of mining in the Georges Creek watershed and at present [1986 information], about 10 percent of the watershed is used for surface mining. The deep mines are now abandoned; although demand and improved technology could rejuvenate deep mining. The maps shows the approximate extent of deep and surface coal mining (past and present) in the Georges Creek watershed. ""At the turn of the century, subsurface ditches and tunnels were constructed to drain water accumulating in the deep mines. According to Slaughter and Daring (1962), one of the most extensive gravity drainage systems was constructed to drain the Pittsburg Coal seam at the base of the Monongahela Formation. The area drained covers about 14 square miles between Midland and Zihlman and includes the Hoffman drainage tunnel. The Hoffman drainage tunnel, completed in 1907, is two miles long and begins in the upper part of the Monongahela and ends downgrade in the middle of the Conemaugh Formation. Approximately a half-mile of auxiliary tunnels and five miles of ditches, draining both the Tyson and Pitsburg coal veins, are connected to the Hoffman tunnel. Groundwater that enters the underground mine workings above Midland flows to a low point in the coal seam near Borden Shaft and then along the Hoffman Tunnel into 12   Braddock Run near Clarysville, in the adjacent Wills Creek watershed. [The drainage area for the tunnel in shown in Map 4 1990 Coal Mining Extent .]  In 1923, the Maryland Bureau of Mines estimated that discharge from the tunnel ranged from 14,000 to 30,000 gpm. In 1947, however, part of the tunnel collapsed reducing its outflow, and its average discharge in 1959 was 9,170 gpm (ranging from 4,400 to 17,500 gpm depending on the season). [Note: The table below suggests that the Hoffman Tunnel with 14 sq. miles drainage has less variation and sometimes greater in discharge rate than Georges Creek with its 72 sq mile drainage. This is probably because the Tunnel supercedes Georges Creek in access to groundwater.] Comparison of Discharge Rate (Cubic Feet Per Second) Georges Creek at Franklin and Hoffman Tunnel 19 Date Aug. 20, 1981 Sept. 23, 1981 May 17, 1982 Sept. 8, 1982 Creek 9.4 19 38 8.7 Tunnel 21 19 36 16  ""Subsidence also reduces the quantity of water available in the mined areas of Georges Creek watershed. Fractures in the strata above mine workings which may be less than 150 feet below the ground surface increase the capacity of the rocks to hold and transmit water as well as enhancing vertical flow. As a result of water loss to both fractures and tunnels, the water table drops and stream flows are reduced. Consequently, abandoned deep mining operations have diminished the quantity of both ground and surface water in the northern portion of the Georges Creek watershed. ""Georges Creek loses water to the deep mines between Midland and Woodland Creek and between Sand Spring Run and the Route 936 crossing (Green Associated, Inc. and others 1974). 13   Also south of Borden Shaft most or all of the flow of Georges Creek in intercepted by the Hoffman Tunnel drainage system during periods of extremely low basefow. (Slaughter and Darling, 1962). Tributaries of Georges Creek with dewatering problems are located north of Midland and include Vale Run, the lower portion of Squirrel Neck Run, the lower and middle portions of Woodland Creek and Staub Run (Green Associates, Inc. and others 1974). To prevent dewatering, some mining companies reconstructed stream channels but only maintained them long enough for proper mining conduct. Therefore, over the last few decades water has reentered the mine workings. New stream lining projects, however, are being implemented by the Maryland Bureau of Mines to alleviate dewatering problems in the Georges Creek watershed. So far, stream lining projects on Vale Run and Woodland Creek have been completed, and projects on Staub Run and Squirrel Neck Run are in progress [1990]."" 3. Cause and History of Local Acid Mine Drainage 19 ""Pyrite (FeS2), a sulfide mineral, often occurs in association with coal deposits. This mineral may react with water and atmospheric oxygen to produce sulfuric acid which, in turn, can dissolve metals such as iron, aluminum and manganese. Ground and surface waters that come in contact with exposed pyrite may become acidic and their concentrations of sulfate and metals may increase. The concentrations of individual metals vary depending upon local geology. Acidic water, with pH lower than 6.5, must be treated before it is used as drinking water. Acidity also limits recreational water use for swimming and fishing (low pH and fluctuations of pH cannot be tolerated by most fish including trout). ""Mining has deteriorated the quality of surface and groundwater supplies in the Georges Creek watershed by exposing pyrite to air and water, thus promoting the chemical reactions which produce acid. For example, precipitation percolating through mine waste may become polluted with acid, sulphate and metals. It then may infiltrate ground water, stand in pools concentrating toxins or run off into nearby streams. Water quality in the watershed is affected by both direct mine runoff and discharge, and via intermittent nonpoint source discharges from coal tipples (coal handling and loading facilities), gob piles (mine waste) and sediment from both active and abandoned sites. About 290 mine drainage discharge points have been identified in the Georges Creek watershed although not all discharge pollutants (Green Associates, Inc. and others, 1974). About two thirds of these points produce continuous discharge and the remaining third produce intermittent discharge. ""Other mining impacts include increases in surface runoff and erosion following changes in slope and the natural ground cover the may accompany strip mining. Subsequently, larger stream sediment loads are produced. In the Georges Creek watershed, this excess sediment is carried to the Potomac because of steep stream gradients. Abandoned and inadequately restored strip mines collect and contaminate surface and groundwater which may enter adjacent streams or deep mines.""  14   4. Mining Impacts on Drinking and Ground Water Mining is not currently a problem for drinking water reservoirs or municipal wells in the Georges Creek watershed.25 Locations of the three reservoirs in the watershed area shown in Map 9 Protected Lands, Smart Growth and Reservoirs. ""The greatest mining impact on surface water quality is in the southern portion of the watershed. Georges Creek and its tributaries south of Barton are unsuitable for potable water supplies because they have large acid loads (low pH values) and high levels of sulfate and other metals. Therefore, at present, historical mining limits the future development of surface water resources in the Georges Creek watershed. Existing community reservoirs, however, are not affected by mining operations... 19 ""In the Georges Creek watershed, mining only impacts the quality and quantity of water in the relatively shallow Monongahela Formation since it contains coal seams and loses water to the Hoffman Tunnel. The Hoffman tunnel's outflow (approximately 0.94 million gallons per day (mgd) per square mile) is about twice the assumed average rate of groundwater recharge (0.5 mgd per square mile) to local aquifers (Maryland Abandoned Mine Reclamation Plan, 1982). Still, the Monongahela Formation is heavily used for commercial/industrial, institutional and recreational supplies as well as individual domestic wells. The Conemaugh Formation, stratigraphically below the Monongahela Formation, has not been impacted by mining except for possible loss of water to the Hoffman Tunnel. The Conemaugh Formation which is tapped by the communities of Midlothian and Hoffman is the watershed's most important source of groundwater. The Pocono Formation (used by Frostburg) and other deep formations also have not been affected by mining. Therefore, in spite of mining impacts on the Monongahela Formation there is potential to the development of aquifers stratigraphically below it."" 19  15   5. Mine Reclamation ""Negative impacts of both surface and deep mining can be minimized by the diversion of water around mined areas and reclamation once mining operations are complete... The already abandoned mines in the Georges Creek watershed are difficult reclamation projects. Strip mines in Maryland operated without reclamation until 1955 when minimal requirements, far from satisfactory by present standards, were instated... Since 1979, the Maryland Bureau of Mines has administered an Abandoned Mine Reclamation Program which draws upon the Federal Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund... Reclamation projects endeavor to eliminate sediment erosion and acid mine drainage by: stabilizing slopes via backfilling, regrading and revegetation; controlling and redirecting mine drainage; and disposing of mine waste. In addition, stream lining projects aim to remedy dewatering problems. The highest program priority, however, has been given to projects that correct abandoned mine problems constituting a hazard to people or property..."" 19 The Bureau of Mines in MDE is working on many AMD remediation projects in the Georges Creek watershed. During the year 2000, four projects are expected to be constructed 8: - Mill Run Diversion Well - Oak Hill Landslide - AMD Treatment Project - Railroad Street Project - Coney Dry Cleaners AMD Remediation Project The Power Plant Siting Program in DNR has recently tested a new technology to seal mine shafts. Based on one year of monitoring, this new technique appears to be very successful. This Program is currently considering opportunities to apply this new technology in the Georges Creek watershed.10 6. Mill Run Baseline Study 20 In 1995, a baseline study of chemical and biological conditions in Mill Run was completed. The study documented severe AMD in the Michaels Run tributary extending downstream in Mill Run to Georges Creek based on data collected in 1990-1991. Once Mill Run waters mixed with Georges Creek, pH and acidity levels were moderated but levels of other constituents in the water column including iron and aluminum remained above the threshold for good water quality. The sources of the AMD in Michaels Run were from an abandoned deep mine opening and from seeps associated with old gob piles. Five AMD inputs were identified including four that were categorized ""major"" based on loading rate. Several monitoring stations exhibited pH levels averaging around 3. (Most aquatic life can not tolerate pH this low.) Impacts on aquatic life from AMD in the Mill Run watershed were apparent in the study's findings. A viable native brook trout population resides in the good quality waters above the AMD inputs. Below the AMD inputs, fish and macroinvertebrate life (benthos) was completely excluded. Map 13 Trout Habitat and Acid Mine Drainage incorporates findings from this study. Also see Mill Run Watershed Projects for information on recent mitigation efforts.  16   7. AMD Tracking In recent years, the MDE Bureau of Mines has had the most complete documentation of AMD discharges and seeps in the Georges Creek watershed. However, this information was collected at different times in different projects. Compilation of this information could be a valuable element in the Georges Creek watershed WRAS In addition, new information is being added to MDE's base information through recent special projects. On Mill Run20 in 1995 and on Neff Run4 in 1999, AMD entry points where documented. In the 2001 Georges Creek Stream Corridor Assessment, similar AMD documentation has been collected. All three of these efforts included estimates of severity as well as location. All the AMD information referenced here provides a foundation for drafting the Georges Creek WRAS. In addition, Allegany County may elect to incorporate a WRAS component on AMD that addresses compilation, cross-checking and map updating of AMD site and severity information for the Georges Creek watershed. A WRAS component on AMD could also incorporate tracking of mitigation projects and improved stream segments as a measure of WRAS progress.  17    Point Sources Discharges from discrete conveyances like pipes are called ""point sources."" Point sources may contribute pollution to surface water or to groundwater. For example, waste water treatment discharges may contribute nutrients or Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) that reduce oxygen available for aquatic life. Stormwater discharges may contribute excessive flow of water and/or seasonally high temperatures. Industrial point sources may contribute other forms of pollution. Some understanding of point sources discharges in a watershed targeted for restoration is useful in helping to prioritize potential restoration projects. According to the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) permit data base which is summarized in the MDE Permits Table and Map 19 MDE Permits, there are six permitted surface water discharges and no permitted groundwater discharges in the Georges Creek watershed. Not included in the table, but shown in the MDE Permits Map, are 30 general permits (mining related, etc.), three general industrial stormwater permits, and one surface water discharge permit in Garrett County that are listed in MDE's permit data base. Characteristics of the these permitted discharges (volume, temperature, pollutants, etc.) are tracked by MDE through the permit system. Most of this information is accessible to the public and can be obtained from MDE. NonPoint Sources Some of water quality indicators and the landscape indicators provide a generalized assessment of nonpoint source pollution in the Georges Creek watershed. A more detailed assessment of pollutants entering Georges Creek waterways from dispersed sources from the land and air was not immediately available. However, based on the immediately available information, several generalizations to be made. 1- Mining and acid mine drainage is the most widespread significant nonpoint source. 2- Extensive forest cover contributed to the relatively favorable indicators for nutrients. 3- Sedimentation is a significant nonpoint source issue in local stream segments. 5, 7 4- Urban stormwater is significant in a few stream segments such as the Frostburg drainage. 7, 11 5- Failing septic systems could be an issue for consideration in the WRAS if Allegany County feels that the WRAS process would enhance existing programs.  19   MDE Permits in the Georges Creek Watershed Facility Name NPDES Permit / MD Code MD0066541 92DP3019 MD0067059 94DP3083 MD0068152 99DP3287 MD0060071 94DP2048 MD0056804 97DP1608 MD0066958 93DP3074 Discharge Type / MDE Permit Category Surface Water / Industrial (surface mine) Surface Water / Industrial (surface mine) Surface Water / Industrial (surface mine) Surface Water / Municipal Surface Water / Municipal Surface Water / Municipal Location  Barton Mining Co. #SM-96-427 Barton Mining Co.

In an effort to gauge the affects of land use on water quality, and to allow comparison between watersheds, DNR has developed a series of Landscape Indicators. These indicators can be used to portray landscape conditions at a watershed scale that tend to support good water quality or that tend to degrade water quality. The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan published in 1998 listed landscape indicators for the Georges Creek watershed as summarized in the table below.3 Most indicator ranking (pass / fail) is a relative measure that compares the Georges Creek watershed with the other 138 watersheds of similar size that covers the entire State of Maryland.  Landscape Indicator (click name for details) Impervious Surface  Finding 3.7 % of watershed is impervious 0.21 people per acre 2,042 acres  Rank Pass  Bench Mark Of 138 watersheds in Maryland, this one is among the 104 watersheds (75%) with the least impervious surface. Of 138 watersheds in Maryland, this one is among the 104 watersheds (75%) with the lower population density. Of 138 watersheds in Maryland, this one is among the 104 watersheds (75%) with smaller historic losses. Of 138 watersheds in Maryland, this one is among the 104 watersheds (75%) having the smaller percentage of unforested stream buffer. Of 138 watersheds in Maryland, this one is among the highest 25%. (Soil erodibility is a natural condition, see note below.)  Population Density  Pass  Historic Wetland Loss Density Unforested Stream Buffer  Pass  27 percent  Pass  Soil Erodibility  0.31 value per acre  Fail  22   Interpreting Landscape Indicators Page 1 of 2 Impervious Surface. Reduction of impervious area can be a valuable component of a successful Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). Roads, parking areas, roofs and other human constructions are collectively called impervious surface. Impervious surface blocks the natural movement of rain into the ground. Unlike many natural surfaces, impervious surface typically concentrates stormwater runoff, accelerates flow rates and directs stormwater to the nearest stream. Side-effects of impervious surfaces become increasingly significant as the percentage of impervious area increases. Examples include reduction of groundwater infiltration, soil and stream bank erosion, sedimentation, destabilization or loss of aquatic habitat, and ""flashy"" stream flows (reduced flow between storms and excessive flows associated with storms.) In the case of Georges Creek, the high percentage of imperviousness can be attributed to two very different land use types: 1) All areas identified as urban land uses, were assigned an average percentage of imperviousness to account for the typical amount of roofs, roads, etc. 2) All areas that were identified as bare ground associated with mining (in the ""other"" category on the Map) were also assigned an average percentage of imperviousness . Population Density. While population density may be beyond the scope of a WRAS, directing growth is a potential WRAS component. Humans are usually very successful in competing for use of land and water. As human population increases, effects of human activity tend to degrade, displace or eliminate natural habitat. Watersheds with higher populations, assuming other factors are equal, tend to exhibit greater impacts on waterways and habitat. However, growth can be directed in ways to reduce negative impacts. Historic Wetland Loss Density. About 4% of the Georges Creek watershed is hydric soil (about 2000 out of 48000 acres). The historic wetland loss estimate is based on the assumption that the hydric soils were all, at one time, wetlands. Thoughtful selective restoration of historic wetland areas can be an effective WRAS component. In most of Maryland's watersheds, extensive wetland areas have been converted to other uses by draining and filling. This conversion unavoidably reduces or eliminates the natural functions that wetlands provide. These functions include habitat and nursery areas for many aquatic organisms, buffering floods, uptake and redistribution of nutrients, etc. In general, watersheds exhibiting greater wetland loss tend to also exhibit greater loss of the beneficial functions that wetlands provide. Strategic replacement of wetlands can significantly improve natural function in local watershed areas.  23   Interpreting Landscape Indicators Page 2 of 2 Unforested Stream Buffers. The finding listed in the table means that 27% of the ""blue line"" streams (excluding shoreline) in the watershed do not have sufficient stream buffers to promote high quality stream habitat. DNR recommends that forested buffer 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream, is typically necessary to promote high quality aquatic habitat and diverse aquatic populations. Restoration of natural vegetation adjacent to streams can be a valuable and relatively inexpensive WRAS element. In most of Maryland, trees are key to healthy natural streams. They provide numerous essential habitat functions: shade to keep water temperatures down in warm months, leaf litter ""food"" for aquatic organisms, roots to stabilize stream banks, vegetative cover for wildlife, etc. In general, reduction or loss of riparian trees / stream buffers degrades stream habitat while replacement of trees / natural buffers enhance stream habitat. Soil Erodibility. The soil erodibility indicator accounts for natural soil conditions but not for management of the land. A finding of 0.31 means that the Georges Creek watershed has ""high"" soil erodibility considering soils types, steep slopes and extent of cropland within 1000 feet of waterways. Watersheds with more easily erodible soils are naturally more susceptible to surface erosion, sedimentation, streambank erosion and other problems related to soil movement. These negative effects of soil erosion on water quality can be minimized through careful management. A WRAS can reasonably promote a reduction in disturbance of erodible soils and/or effective soil conservation practices planting stream buffers. The naturally erodible soils of the Georges Creek watershed are addressed by techniques called Best Management Practices (BMPs) to prevent soil loss that are typically in use on local farms. BMPs like no-till, reduced till, cover crops, field strips, and others significantly reduce erosion and sediment movement. These BMPs can be seen in use in many places in the watershed.  24   1997 Land Use The following table and pie charts summarize several major categories of land use for the Georges Creek Watershed using Maryland Department of Planning data. Viewing these categories of land uses as potential nonpoint sources of nutrients, agriculture and urban land lands may be significant nutrient sources. In addition, extractive land (""other"" category) may contribute significant sediment and/or acidity depending upon local conditions.  1997 Land Use Georges Creek Watershed (Allegany) Agriculture (12.71%) Other (5.68%) Urban (13.71%)  Forest (67.90%)  Georges Creek Land Use  1997 Acres Category Agriculture Forest Urban Other Description field, Pasture, Ag buildings All woodlands and brush All developed areas Extractive and bare ground Allegany Co. 4,062 21,699 4,382 1,814 31,957 47,686 Map 6 Land Use shows the distribution of watershed land uses for the watershed using the same data as the table and pie charts.

Based on work completed as of December 2000, the 2020 land use Agriculture (12.56%) Urban (14.77%) estimates are shown pie chart and table 23 Other (5.67%) below. For the Allegany County portion of Georges Creek (the WRAS area), urban land uses are projected to increase by about 1% by the year 2020. The majority of land projected for conversion to urban use is Forest (67.00%) anticipated to be forest. A small percent decrease is projected for agricultural land. The projected increase in urban land is anticipated to concentrate around Frostburg and Westernport. However, at least some small increase in urban land area is projected for each subwatershed in the Georges Creek watershed. The increase in impervious area for the WRAS watershed from 1997 to 2020 is projected to be from 4.7% to 4.9% respectively.

Steep slopes are significant morphological features of local streams. Extensive steep areas in the watershed have also contributed to a concentration of development in valleys in close proximity to streams and in floodplains. Existing development in floodplains is common in the watershed as can be seen by comparing Map 6 1997 Land Use and Map 19 Wetlands Restoration Opportunities, which shows floodplains. Distribution of steep slopes is shown in Map 11 Slope. Control of flood waters and repair of flood damage is an important issue for anyone who uses roads in these areas or owns property in this locality. Consequently, flood mitigation programs are well established in the watershed. For example, the 1999 Allegany County Flood Mitigation Plan identifies flood mitigation needs and lists project priorities.18 Projects under flood-related programs can provide opportunities to integrate watershed restoration, water quality improvement and natural resource enhancement objectives through careful project design and by integrating additional funding sources. Allegany County is already demonstrating that watershed restoration and flood management objectives can be effectively and efficiently integrated. Several County projects using this approach with multiple funding sources are summarized in the Related Projects section of the Characterization.  28   Geology In the Georges Creek watershed, geology has strong influence on water movement and quality in the area. The steep terrain, stony soils and hydrologic pattern of the streams are closely tied to local geology. The coal mining in the watershed, which is possible only due to the geology of the area, also contributes to local water quality conditions via layers of rock and crevices that underlie the watershed. The geologic structure known as the Georges Creek Syncline largely defines the local watershed. In general, a syncline is a fold of stratified rock inclining upward on either side of an axis (centerline). Locally, the Georges Creek Syncline includes the folded the rock strata that was pushed up to form Savage Mountain and Dans Mountain on either side of the Georges Creek valley. As a result of this geology, Georges Creek is located near the middle of the valley which is closely aligned with the axis of the syncline. An addition view of local geology is presented in Map 7 Geology. It shows a pattern that indicates its importance to the character of the Georges Creek watershed. The east and west watershed boundaries on the mountains tend to coincide with the Allegany and Pottsville Formations. Therefore, the surface water and groundwater generally flow from areas of the Allegany and Pottsville Formations into and through areas of the Monongahela Formation and the Conemaugh Formation on their way to the Potomac River.  29    Green Infrastructure An additional way to interpret land use / land cover information is to identify ""Green Infrastructure."" In the GIS application developed by Maryland DNR and its partners, Green Infrastructure refers to areas of natural vegetation and habitat that have statewide or regional importance as defined by criteria developed by DNR. The criteria for identifying of lands as Green Infrastructure is limited to considering natural resource attributes currently found on those lands. One example of the criteria is that interior forest and wetlands complexes at least 250 acres in size are considered as part of Green Infrastructure. As a second example, sensitive species habitat that is located within areas of natural vegetation at least 100 acres in size is also counted as Green Infrastructure. Other potential attributes of Green Infrastructure lands, such as ownership or if the current natural conditions are protected in some way, are not criteria for Green Infrastructure but they may be considered independently. Within the Green Infrastructure network, large blocks of natural areas are called hubs, and the existing or potential connections between them, called links or corridors. Together the hubs and corridors form the Green Infrastructure network which can be considered the backbone of the region's natural environment.6 Map 8 Green Infrastructure shows these lands for Georges Creek. Protection of Green Infrastructure lands may be addressed through various existing programs including Rural Legacy, Program Open Space, conservation easements and others. The 2001 Maryland General Assembly approved $35 million for the Green Print program which is targeted primarily to protecting Green Infrastructure areas. This new funding category will be administered by Program Open Space. The Green Infrastructure in the Georges Creek watershed exhibits several significant characteristics: 1- A large portion of the Georges Creek watershed, particularly on slopes around the perimeter of the watershed are considered Green Infrastructure Hubs. These large blocks of natural habitat have regional or Statewide importance. 2- Compared to other portions of the Maryland these natural areas have relatively low risk of conversion to urban use. However, their management, including the potential for natural resource commodity production (timber, coal) will determine their long term viability as a component of the Green Infrastructure network. 3- Additional analysis of Green Infrastructure in the Georges Creek watershed is appropriate to adequately characterize its status.  31    Protected Lands As used in the context of watershed restoration, ""protected land"" includes any land with some form of long term limitation on conversion to urban / developed land use. This protection may be in the forms: public ownership for natural resource or recreational intent, private ownership were a third party acquired development rights or otherwise acquired the right to limit use through the purchase of an easement, etc. The extent of ""protection"" varies greatly from one circumstance to the next and it may be necessary to explore the details of land protection parcel by parcel through the local land records office. For purposes of watershed restoration, a knowledge of existing protected lands can provide a starting point in prioritizing potential restoration activities. In some cases, protected lands may provide opportunities for restoration projects because owners of these lands may value natural resource protection or enhancement goals. The following table and Map 9 Protected Land, Smart Growth and Reservoirs summarize the status of protected lands and reservoir protection in the Georges Creek Watershed.  There are three reservoirs for drinking water in the Georges Creek watershed. All three are partially protected by their headwaters location, local zoning and DNR owned land in part of their watersheds. Allegany County Zoning Maps show these reservoir watersheds as ""Conservation Areas"" which provides some protection through the County Permit process. However, none of these reservoirs' watersheds are completely protected which makes their long term viability a potential issue for the WRAS.  Most land in the watershed has no particular limitation on use other than local zoning and applicable permitting requirements.  Local / County parks tend to be small parcels geared to local recreational interests in towns.  DNR land is the largest block of protected land in the watershed. It is primarily on steep land or ridge tops. While much of this land is covered by natural vegetation, management for timber production is not uncommon.  No easements for conservation or agricultural protection have been identified in the watershed. Smart Growth In Maryland's Smart Growth program, there are two targeting programs that should be considered as potential watershed restoration projects are prioritized. In Rural Legacy Areas, protection of land from future development through purchase of easements (or in fee simple) is promoted. In Primary Funding Areas, State funding for infrastructure may be available to support development and redevelopment. See Map 9 Protected Land, Smart Growth and Reservoirs: - Rural Legacy Areas: There are no Rural Legacy Areas in the Georges Creek watershed. - Priority Funding Areas in the Georges Creek watershed cover less then 10% of the watershed.  33    Soils and Slope 1. Interpreting Local Conditions with Natural Soil Groups Soil conditions, like soil type and moisture conditions, greatly affect how land Natural Soil Groups may be used and the potential for vegetation and habitat on the land. Soil conditions also Georges Creek Watershed, both Counties contribute to water quality in streams, rivers and groundwater. Local soil conditions vary (8.23%) (3.81%) greatly from site to site as published (2.34%) information in the Soil Survey for Allegany County shows. This complicated information can be effectively summarized using Natural Soil Groups to help identify useful H1 Soils generalizations about groups of soils. In Map 10 Soils by Natural Soil Group and the Natural Soil Groups pie chart, most (85.62%) soils in the watershed have limitations like stoniness, shallow depth or wetness. Stony soil categorized as H1 covers nearly 86% of the Georges Creek watershed. C1 and E2 soils account for 8.23% and 2.34% respectively. All other soils types together account for 3.81% of the watershed including the only prime agricultural soil in the watershed which is G1. Slope is a very important factor in determining soil type and potential land use in the watershed. Elevation varies about 2100 feet from 900 feet above sea level at the mouth of Georges Creek to 2,991 feet above sea level at High Rock on Big Savage Mountain.19 About 77% of the watershed has 15% or greater slope as shown in the second pie chart which groups Soils Grouped by Slope the natural soils groups from above by slope. About 9% of the watershed has less than 8% Georges Creek Watershed, both Counties slope and nearly 14% of the watershed has slope between 8% and 15%. (9.22%) A second view of slope in Map 11 Slope is generated from digital elevation model (13.78%) (DEM) information. The map shows the concentration of very steep slopes along lower Georges Creek Slopes greater This generalized slope information than 15% appears to be the best available for the Georges (77.00%) Creek watershed. However, more detailed slope information is commonly generated for development projects on a site by site basis.  35   2. Soils and Watershed Planning Local soil conditions can be a useful element in watershed planning and for targeting restoration projects. Soils with limitations related to wetness or slope naturally limit active use for farming or development. Land owners in the watershed have tended leave many of these areas in natural vegetation or other low intensity use. By comparing Map 10 Soils by Natural Group with two preceding maps, Map 6 1997 General Land Use and Map 8 Green Infrastructure, it is apparent that marginal soils and current areas of natural habitat tend to coincide. Natural Soils Groups or similar soils assessment techniques can be used to help identify potential areas for restoration projects or habitat protection. Once areas of interest are targeted and land owner interest is verified, additional detailed soil assessment is an essential step in identifying viable restoration project sites.  36     Wetlands In the context of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS), wetlands serve valuable water quality and habitat functions that may not served by other land uses. Therefore, protection and enhancement of existing wetlands, and restoration of past wetland areas, can be a valuable element in the WRAS. (Also see Wetland Restoration.) 1. Introduction to Wetland Categories 16  Compared with other regions of Maryland, wetlands are uncommon in Western Maryland, including Georges Creek as indicated in Map 12 Wetlands. In this area, wetlands are often found in topographic depressions and associated with riverine and palustrine environments. The map also indicates that in the Georges Creek watershed, three types of wetlands are most common though wetlands in Western Maryland generally are more diverse. In general, wetlands in the Georges Creek watershed can be briefly characterized (from Wetlands of Maryland, Tiner and Burke, 1995): - Forested wetlands are typically found on floodplains in stream valleys and are characterized by the frequency and duration of flooding (seasonally flooded and temporarily flooded forested wetlands). - Scrub-shrub are wet thickets and shrub bogs found in river floodplains, valleys and meadows. - Emergent wetlands are seasonally-flooded wet meadows and marshes. They can occur in areas of former forested wetlands that were cleared for agricultural, meadows and valleys and are also characterized by the frequency and duration of flooding (seasonally flooded marshes and meadows, and temporarily flooded wet meadows). 2. Tracking Wetlands 16 Oversight of activities affecting wetlands involves several regulatory jurisdictions. The Maryland Dept. of the Environment (MDE) is the lead agency for the State. MDE cooperates with DNR, the Army Corps of Engineers and other Federal and local agencies. As part of its responsibility, MDE tracks State permitting and the net gain or loss of wetlands over time. As the Wetlands Regulatory Status table shows, changes tracked in the State regulatory program have resulted in a small net loss of wetland acreage in the Georges Creek watershed. Tracking Nontidal Wetland Change Georges Creek Watershed Permits Authorized = 6 Letters of Authorization Issued = 17 Wetland Class Acres Permanent Impacts -0.11 Mitigation by Permittee 0 Other Gains (Regulatory) 0 Programmatic Gains 0 -0.11 Net Gain/Loss Note: Regulatory tracking for authorized nontidal wetland losses began in 1991. Comprehensive tracking of voluntary wetland gains began in 1998.  39   3. Interpreting Wetland Distribution Wetlands in the Georges Creek watershed are found in very limited areas as shown in Map 12 Wetlands. In comparing this map to Map 6 1997 Generalized Land Use, it can be seen that many of these small wetland areas do not appear on the land use map. One interpretation may be that some of these wetlands are too Wetland Acreage Summary small to be identified Georges Creek Watershed16 using aerial image Wetland Class Acres interpretation which Estuarine, Intertidal (E2) aquatic bed 0 is the basis for the beach bar 0 land use data. emergent 0 For the larger forested 0 wetland areas along scrub shrub 0 Georges Creek on the Palustrine (P) aquatic bed 0 Wetlands Map that emergent 111 could be interpreted flat 0 be remote imaging, forested 329 additional scrub shrub 7 comparison of the Riverine, Lower Perennial (R2) beach bar 0 two maps shows that Riverine, Upper Perennial (R3) beach bar 0 these large wetlands are depicted as forest Total Wetlands (National Wetlands Inventory) 447 on the land use map. An additional interpretation of this difference is simply the result of two differing views of the landscape. For example, wooded nontidal wetlands can be viewed as ""wetlands"" from a habitat / regulatory perspective and they can be viewed as ""forest"" from a land use perspective. In the Georges Creek watershed, differing perspectives on counting wetlands may be significant for watershed management. From a land use perspective, the Georges Creek watershed's wetlands were not identified by the Maryland Department of Planning. From a habitat / regulatory perspective, there are approximately 447 acres of wetlands in the watershed. In the context of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS), wetlands serve valuable water quality and habitat functions that may not be provided by other land uses. Therefore, protection and enhancement of existing wetlands, and restoration of past wetland areas, can be a valuable element in the WRAS. (Also see Wetland Restoration.)  40    LIVING RESOURCES AND HABITAT Overview Living resources, including all the animals, plants and other organisms that call the land and waters of the Georges Creek watershed home, are being affected by human activity. The information summarized in this characterization suggest some of the significant stresses in the watershed are manipulation of habitat, excessive acidity or sediment and excessive availability of nutrients. The Living Resource information summarized here should be considered a partial representation because numerous areas of potential interest or concern could not be included due to lack of information, time, etc. For example, information on many forms of aquatic life, woodland communities, terrestrial habitats, etc. should be considered as watershed restoration decisions are being made. Therefore, it is recommended that stakeholders in the watershed identify important living resource issues or priorities so that additional effort can be focus where it is most needed. New information should be added or referenced as it becomes available.  42   Living Resource Indicators Aquatic organisms are sensitive, in varying degrees, to changes in water quality and the habitat associated with water. This association offers to perspectives that are important for watershed restoration. First, improvements for living resources offer potential goals, objectives and opportunities to gauge progress in watershed restoration. Second, selected living resources can be used as to gauge local conditions for water quality, habitat, etc. This second perspective is the basis for using living resources as an ""indicator."" The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan published in 1998 listed the following living resource indicators for the Georges Creek watershed.3 Living Resource Indicator (click on name for details) Non-Tidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity Non-Tidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity Score Rank Bench Mark (percent based on 138 watersheds) Scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best) Score less than 6 yields a rank of ""fail"" Score less than 6 yields a rank of ""fail"" and the watershed is designated as a Category 1 watershed in need of restoration. Score greater than or equal to 8 for yields a designation as a Category 3 watershed in need of protection. Scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best) Of 138 watersheds in Maryland, the 34 (25%) with the lowest nontidal in-stream habitat index received a rank of ""fail"" and were designated as Category 1 watersheds in need of restoration. The top 34 (25%) were designated as Category 3 watersheds in need of protection.  3.67 3.33  Fail Fail  Non-Tidal In-stream Habitat Index  5.97  Pass  43   Interpreting Living Resource Indicators General. Several of these indices rely on index rankings generated from a limited number of sampling sites which were then generalized to represent entire watersheds. Considering this limitation on field data, it may be beneficial to conduct additional assessments to provide a more complete understanding of local conditions as part of the WRAS. Non-Tidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity. An index less than 6 indicates that benthic organisms are significantly stressed by local conditions. This index allows comparison of streams based on the populations of bottom-dwelling ""bugs"" (benthic macroinvertebrate organisms) found in the stream. For coastal plain streams, this index employs seven measurements of these populations which is translated into a rank for each sampling site. Non-Tidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity. In index less than 6 indicates that improvements would be beneficial to fish populations. This index allows comparison of selected streams (first through third order nontidal streams) based fish community health. In each sampling site where fish are surveyed, the makeup of the overall fish population is measured in nine distinct ways such as the number of native species, number of benthic fish species, percent of individuals that are ""tolerant"" species, etc. These nine scores are then integrated to generate an index ranking for the survey site. Non-Tidal In-Stream Habitat Index. This index allows comparison of streams based fish and benthic habitat as measured by in-stream and riparian conditions. For each stream site that was assessed, visual field observations are used to score the site for substrate type, habitat features, bank conditions, riparian vegetation width, remoteness, aesthetic value, etc. These scores are then integrated to generate a single rank for each stream site.  44   Benthic Macroinvertebrates In 1996, ""bugs"" living in streams (benthic macroinvertebrates or benthos), fish and their physical habitat were assessed at nine sites in the Georges Creek watershed as shown in Map 3 Monitoring Stations. This data was gathered by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) which is a program in DNR. As summarized in the table below, scores for both benthic populations and fish populations for the sites surveyed were consistently poor and very poor. However, the physical habitat conditions at those same sites ranged from good to very poor. The Georges Creek site that exhibited poor aquatic populations in good physical habitat suggests that water quality is a limiting factor there. In the Georges Creek watershed, the MBSS is scheduled to collect additional data on instream aquatic community and habitat conditions at 10 sites in the year 2003. 12  Findings from the 1996 MBSS in the Georges Creek Watershed Station # AL-A-... 567-126 232-313 229-109 221-107 054-320 343-307 343-330 Stream Location Sand Spring Run Sand Spring Run Staub Run Georges Creek near Moores Run Georges Creek above Mill Run Georges Creek below Mill Run Georges Creek below Mill Run Fish Score --1.86 1.0 1.0 2.14 1.29 2.14 Condition --Very Poor Very Poor Very Poor Poor Very Poor Poor Benthos Score 1.67 1.89 1.89 2.33 1.67 1.67 2.56 Condition Very Poor Very Poor Very Poor Poor Very Poor Very Poor Poor Physical Habitat Score 8.15 49.33 18.23 20.79 22.18 30.9 73.45 Condition Very Poor Fair Poor Poor Poor Poor Good  Index Used In 1996 MBSS Fish Index of Biotic Integrity Benthic Index Biotic Integrity Physical Habitat Index  Description Ranges from 1.0 (worst) to 5.0 (best) Ranges from 1.0 (worst) to 5.0 (best) Range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best)  45   Why Look at Benthos in Streams? Benthos are sometimes called ""stream bugs"" though that name overly simplifies the diverse membership of this group. Unimpaired natural streams may support a great diversity of species ranging from bacteria and algae to invertebrates like crayfish and insects to fish, reptiles and mammals. Benthic macro-invertebrates, collectively called benthos, are an important component of a stream's ecosystem. This group includes mayflies, caddisflies, crayfish, etc. that inhabit the stream bottom, its sediments, organic debris and live on plant life (macrophytes) within the stream. The food web in streams relies significantly on benthos. Benthos are often the most abundant source of food for fish and other small animals. Many benthic macroinvertebrates live on decomposing leaves and other organic materials in the stream. By this activity, these organisms are significant processors of organic materials in the stream. Benthos often provide the primary means that nutrients from organic debris are transformed to other biologically usable forms. These nutrients become available again and are transported downstream where other organisms use them. Benthos are a valuable tool for stream evaluation. This group of species has been extensively evaluated for use in water quality assessment, in evaluating biological conditions of streams and in gauging influences on streams by surrounding lands. Benthos serve as good indicators of water resource integrity because they are fairly sedentary in nature and their diversity offers numerous ways to interpret conditions. They have different sensitivities to changing conditions. They have a wide range of functions in the stream. They use different life cycle strategies for survival.  46   Fish During 1999, sampling was conducted in 16 stream segments within the Georges Creek watershed. Fish species and habitat conditions found there were detailed in an April 2000 report.7 Based on information collected in recent years, the Fishery Conditions Table summarizes selected fish population conditions by stream segment starting at the Potomac River going upstream on the west side of Georges Creek and continuing downstream on the east side of Georges Creek.11 Fish populations in the Georges Creek watershed vary significantly depending on local conditions in each stream segment. While there are numerous reasons for these differences, the presence and severity of acid mine drainage is a locally important factor. For example, Map 13 Trout Habitat and Acid Mine Drainage shows that stream segments supporting naturally reproducing populations of brook trout do not occur in areas of severe acid mine drainage (AMD). However, individual trout move from high quality habitat into and through areas of moderate AMD impacts.20 Currently, the mainstem of Georges Creek from Westernport to Midland is a popular Put & Take recreational trout fishery is stocked by DNR Fisheries Service. Additionally, a portion of Laurel Run is also stocked with trout but it is designated as ""Special Use"" because fishing is limited to participants under 16 years of age. 15 1. Mill Run Trout Recolonization In Mill Run, trout recolonized portions of the stream following artificial addition of fine particle limestone to counteract acid mine drainage (AMD).24 The fish survey conducted in June 1999 found that fish species present before and after the AMD mitigation project had not changed. However, the brook trout population had increased in size in upstream waters unaffected by AMD. The DNR Fisheries Service did not speculate on the cause of the increase. Additionally, significant numbers of brook trout and blacknose dace had moved into Mill Run areas where water quality had improved. This AMD mitigation project successfully counteracted the low-pH symptom of acid mine drainage but it did not eliminate the cause. Even so, it demonstrates the potential to expand the habitat range of desirable fish species here and elsewhere in the watershed. This experience suggests that, in selected streams, either an effort to reduce acid mine drainage and/or an ongoing program to raise pH can make measurable improvements to the fishery.  47   Fishery Conditions in the Georges Creek Watershed Stream / Location West Side Tributaries  7,11  Fisheries Condition  AMD = Acid Mine Drainage  Georges Creek mainstem near Westernport Mill Run Michaels Run Butcher Run Laurel Run Koontz Run Woodland Creek Staub Run Winbrenner Run Sandy Spring Run  Old survey found at least 15 species including young-of-year and adult Brown Trout.

In addition to these charismatic rare animals, both US EPA and Maryland DNR work through their respective Federal and State programs to protect numerous endangered, threatened, or rare species of plants, animals and ecological communities of those species. Map 14 Sensitive Species generally shows areas important to these species. For the purposes of watershed restoration, it is valuable to account for known locations of habitat for these species. These places are often indicators, and sometimes important constituents, of the network of natural areas or ""green infrastructure"" that are the foundation for many essential natural watershed processes. Protecting these species and/or promoting expansion of their habitats can be an effective foundation for a watershed restoration program. 1. Habitat Protection Categories One way to characterize a watershed for sensitive species is to identify known habitat locations using several broad categories employed by DNR's Wildlife and Heritage Division. The following table and map summarize this information. Based on this general information, more detailed information and guidance can be requested from Division staff. The three categories listed below (SSPRA, NHA, WSSC) are considered during review of applications for a State permit or approval or involve State funds. For projects potentially affecting these areas, the State permit or approval will include recommendations and/or requirements to protect sensitive species and their habitat. In addition, many counties have incorporated safeguards for these areas into their permit review process. For purposes of project review, all NHAs and WSSCs have SSPRAs that encompass them. These categories do not place requirements on any activities that do not require a permit or approval or involve State funds. However, property owners are encouraged to seek advice on protecting the sensitive species / habitat within their ownership. 2. Rare Fish and Mussels DNR recently initiated a project to rank watersheds across Maryland to aid in targeting conservation and restoration efforts to benefit known populations of rare fish and mussels. In comparison to the more than 1000 small (12-digit) watersheds identified by DNR in the Maryland, all eight 12-digit sub-watersheds in Georges Creek received a rank of ""neutral."" A ranking of neutral indicates that information is insufficient (not absence of these species or low priority.) In neutral ranked areas, it is reasonable to rely on other available criteria for targeting watershed conservation and restoration projects. This ranking considers information from 1970 to 1997 only for rare species of fish or mussels being tracked in Maryland. Four possible ranks were used for this project: Very High, High, Moderately High and Neutral. Each rare species being tracked contributed to this ranking based on two types of criteria: 1) presence or absence, and 2) if present, weighting relative rarity on worldwide and Statewide scales.  50   Maryland's Sensitive Species Protection Categories Sensitive Species Project Review Area (SSPRA) There is one SSPRA in the Georges Creek WRAS area as shown in Map 14 Sensitive Species Areas. Each SSPRA contains one or more sensitive species habitats. However, the entire SSPRA is not considered sensitive habitat. The SSPRA is an envelope identified for review purposes to help ensure that applications for permit or approval in or near sensitive areas receive adequate attention and safeguards for the sensitive species / habitat they contain. In general, SSPRAs are delineated so that they compass all NHAs and WSSCs. Natural Heritage Area (NHA) No NHAs are located in the Georges Creek WRAS area. NHAs designated in State regulation. NHAs are rare ecological communities that encompass sensitive species habitat. They are designated in State regulation COMAR 08.03.08.10. For any proposed project that requires a State permit or approval that may affect an NHA, recommendations and/or requirements are placed in the permit or approval that are specifically aimed at protecting the NHA. Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) There are no WSSCs in the Georges Creek WRAS area. In general, these wetlands are associated with one or more sensitive species habitats that are in or near the wetland. For any proposed project that requires a wetland permit, these selected wetlands have additional regulatory requirements beyond the permitting requirements that apply to wetlands generally. For a listing of designated sites see COMAR 26.23.06.01 at www.dsd.state.md.us  51    RESTORATION TARGETING TOOLS Stream Corridor Assessment Allegany County, with assistance from DNR, already has experience in using stream corridor assessment information from the 1999 Neff Run stream corridor assessment. Using the Stream Corridor Assessment Methodology (SCAM) developed and applied by the DNR Watershed Restoration Division, on-the-ground issues were assessed and cataloged to assist in targeting restoration activities. (See Neff Run Watershed Integrated Approach to Restoration.) In partnership with Allegany County and in follow-up to the Neff Run assessment, DNR completed a stream corridor assessment in the remaining areas of the Georges Creek watershed during winter 2000/2001. Trained teams from the Maryland Conservation Corps. walked along streams to identify and document potential problems and restoration opportunities such as inadequate stream buffers, erosion, etc. Similar to the 1999 Neff Run products, a report will be generated, including maps and photographs, to support targeting decisions for restoration projects. Draft data summaries are expected to be available in Summer 2001 with a final report by December 2001. The data from this assessment will provide an important companion report for this watershed characterization and will be used in development of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. Fish Blockages Information on the number and extent of blockages to fish movement is generally limited to the Neff Run watershed. There, the 1999 Stream Corridor Assessment identified 24 blockages. While the DNR Fish Passage program maintains a Statewide database of blockages to fish movement, it generally does not have data for Western Maryland. Therefore, extending use of the Stream Corridor Assessment to additional portions of the Georges Creek watershed is essential to cataloging blockages and prioritizing potential removal.  53   Stream Buffer Restoration For the Neff Run tributary to Georges Creek, stream segments needing stream buffer enhancement have already been identified 4 and next-step recommendations (land owner contact, cost-share promotion, site assessment/recommendations) are already in place. 5 The Georges Creek stream corridor assessment conducted during the winter of 2000/2001 also identifies numerous stream buffer restoration opportunities. With this information, Allegany County may select from among numerous approaches to prioritizing these opportunities for further investigation and project development. This section presents several scenarios for stream buffer restoration prioritization based on GIS data. The concepts presented in these scenarios are recommended to help in prioritizing projects for maximizing water quality improvement and habitat enhancement. 1. Benefits and General Recommendations Natural vegetation in stream riparian zones act as stream buffers that can provide numerous valuable environmental benefits:  Reducing surface runoff  Preventing erosion and sediment movement  Using nutrients for vegetative growth and moderating nutrient entry into the stream  Moderating temperature, particularly reducing warm season water temperature  Providing organic material (decomposing leaves) that are the foundation of natural food webs in stream systems  Providing overhead and in-stream cover and habitat  Promoting high quality aquatic habitat and diverse populations of aquatic species. To realize these environmental benefits, DNR generally recommends that forested stream buffers be at least 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream. Therefore, DNR is promoting this type of stream buffer for local jurisdictions and land owners who are willing to go beyond the minimum buffers standards. The DNR Watershed Restoration Division and other programs like CREP are available to assist land owners who volunteer to explore these opportunities.  54   2. Using GIS In additional to the Stream Corridor Assessment information, other factors can be considered that help to prioritize areas for stream buffer restoration. Even with a list of potential restoration sites, it is often important to prioritize opportunities to maximize benefits generated by projects relative to investment of limited human and funding resources. For example, stream buffer restoration opportunities can be considered in the context of land use, wetlands, hydric soils, green infrastructure, land ownership, etc. to assist in prioritizing potential projects achieve multiple benefits. Multiple benefits within a project area could include but are not limited to: habitat improvement, nutrient transport reduction, green infrastructure enhancement, recreational enhancement, buffering sensitive species habitat, etc. Prioritizing areas that have inadequate stream buffers for restoration can be timeconsuming and expensive. Fortunately, use of a computerized Geographic Information System (GIS) to manipulate remote sensing data (and survey data) can help save limited time and funds. To assist in this technical endeavor, DNR Watershed Management and Analysis Division has developed GIS-based tools to assist in the buffer restoration targeting process. Using these tools, selected GIS scenario maps have been generated to supplement the Stream Corridor Assessment. Several scenarios are presented here to help consider prioritizing potential areas for stream buffer restoration. They demonstrate methods that can be used to locate sites having a high probability of optimizing certain ecological benefits. These scenarios are based on remote sensing data, so follow-up is essential to integrate Allegany County's information from the Neff Run and Georges Creek Stream Corridor Assessments. Additionally, sites eventually identified as high priority will also require more intensive investigation. The resolution of the data used to generate these maps is not sufficient for an accurate site assessment, but can be used to identify potential candidate sites for detailed investigation. The streams presented in the maps are ""blue line streams"" as generally shown on US Geological Survey Quadrangle Maps. Intermittent streams were not considered in the stream buffer scenario maps. 3. Headwater Stream Buffers Headwater streams are also called First Order Streams. These streams, unlike other streams (Second Order, etc.), intercept all of the surface runoff within the watersheds that they drain. In addition, for many watersheds, first order streams drain the majority of the land within the entire watershed. Therefore, stream buffers restored along headwater streams (First Order) tend to have greater potential to intercept nutrients and sediments than stream buffers placed elsewhere. Map 15 Stream Order, which shows Georges Creek watershed ""blue line streams"" ranked by stream order. In targeting stream buffer restoration projects, giving higher priority to headwater streams is one approach to optimizing nutrient and sediment retention. In addition, restoring headwater stream buffers can also provide habitat benefits that can extend downstream of the project area. Forested headwater streams provide important organic material, like decomposing leaves, that ""feed"" the stream's food web. They also introduce woody debris which enhances in-stream physical habitat. The potential for riparian forest buffers to significantly influence stream temperature is greatest in headwater regions. These factors, in addition to positive water quality effects, are key to improving habitat for aquatic resources. 55   4. Land Use and Stream Buffers One factor that affects the ability of stream buffers to intercept nonpoint source pollutants is adjacent land use. Nutrient and sediment loads from different land uses can vary significantly. As the following table indicates, crop land typically contributes the greats nutrient and sediment loads. However, under some conditions urban land can contribute higher phosphorus loads. By identifying land uses in riparian areas with inadequate stream buffers, like Nonpoint Source Pollution Load Rates By Land Use Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model, in kg/ha-yr crop land adjacent to streams, potential to reduce nutrient and Land Use Nitrogen Phosphorus Sediment sediment loads can be Crop land 17.11 1.21 0.74 improved. To assist in finding areas with crop land adjacent to Impervious 8.43 0.58 0.00 Urban streams, the same land use data Pervious 10.79 1.56 0.20 shown in Map 6 1997 Pasture 8.40 1.15 0.30 Generalized Land Use can be filtered using GIS. The new Forest 1.42 0.00 0.03 scenario shown in Map 16 Land Use Scenario for Stream Buffer Restoration focuses on the land use within 150 feet of a stream. This view, supplemented with the land use pollution loading rates, suggests potential buffer restoration opportunities that could maximize nutrient and sediment loads. 5. Nutrient Uptake from Hydric Soils in Stream Buffers In general, the nutrient nitrogen moves from the land into streams in surface water runoff and in groundwater. In some soils, a significant percentage of nitrogen enters streams in groundwater. Stream buffer restoration can be used to capture nitrogen moving in groundwater if buffer restoration projects have several attributes:  Plants with roots deep enough to intercept groundwater as it moves toward the stream  Plants with high nitrogen uptake capability, and  Targeting buffer restoration projects to maximize groundwater inception by buffer plants. Hydric soils in stream riparian areas can be used as one factor to help select stream buffer restoration sites. Siting buffer restoration on hydric soils would offer several benefits:  Plant roots are more likely to be in contact with groundwater for longer periods of time  Hydric soils tend to be marginal for many agricultural and urban land uses  Natural vegetation in wet areas often offer greater potential for habitat. Map 17 Hydric Soils and Wetland Proximity identifies lands adjacent to streams that are on hydric soil in the Georges Creek watershed. An important next step in using this information is verification of field conditions. Care must be taken during field validation to evaluate any hydrologic modification of these soils, such as ditching or draining activities, which would likely decrease potential benefits. 56   6. Wetland Associations Wetlands and adjacent natural uplands form complex habitats that offer a range of habitat opportunities for many species. These ""habitat complexes"" tend to offer greater species diversity and other ecological values that are greater than the values that the wetland or uplands could offer independently. Therefore, restoring stream buffers adjacent to or near to existing wetlands tends to offer greater habitat benefits than the restoration project could otherwise produce. Map 17 Hydric Soils and Wetland Proximity identifies unforested buffers zones that are in close proximity (within 300 feet) to wetlands (National Wetlands Inventory). Restoration projects in these areas may offer opportunities to enhance and expand wetland habitat in addition to the other desirable buffer functions. 7. Optimizing Benefits by Combining Priorities Strategic targeting of stream buffer restoration projects can take into account many different potential benefits. Several of these scenarios are presented independently in this section. However, site selection and project design generally incorporates numerous factors to optimize benefits from the project. For example, finding a site with a mix of attributes like those in the following list could result in the greatest control of nonpoint source pollution and enhancement for living resources:  land owner willingness / incentives  marginal land use in the riparian zone  headwater stream  hydric soils  selecting appropriate woody/grass species  adjacent to existing wetlands / habitat  For the Georges Creek watershed, Map 18 Stream Prioritization Scenario suggests stream segments to consider for potential buffer restoration based on the extent of woody vegetation and/or land use in the riparian area. The information for the map is derived from interpretation of photographic images from satellites or high altitude airplanes. This method is useful in identifying areas to target for site assessment but it is not very useful for local site analysis. For example in the Neff Run watershed, the 1999 stream assessment work identified about 15 stream segments with inadequate stream buffers. The map suggests that more than a third of streams in the watershed, mostly nearer to Georges Creek mainstem, are medium priority for buffer restoration (light green on the map). In summary, the GIS approach helps to prioritize areas for field investigation and the stream assessment approach identifies specific sites for potential project prioritization.  57       Wetland Restoration Wetlands serve important environmental functions such as providing habitat and nursery areas for many organisms, nutrient uptake and recycling, erosion control, etc. However, most watersheds in Maryland have significantly fewer wetland acres today than in the past. This loss due to draining, filling, etc. has led to habitat loss and water quality impacts in streams and in the Chesapeake Bay. Reversing this historic trend is an important goal of wetland restoration. One approach to identifying candidate wetland restoration sites involves identifying ""historic"" wetland areas based on the presence of hydric soils. This process can be accelerated by using GIS to manipulate soils information with other data like land use. The GIS products can then assist in initiating the candidate site search process, targeting site investigations and helping to identify land owners. To promote wetland restoration, DNR Watershed Management and Analysis Division has developed GIS capability for these purposes. For the Georges Creek watershed, GIS was used to create Map 19 Wetlands Restoration Opportunities using hydric soils as an indicator for potential wetland restoration sites. The steps and priorities used to generate the map are listed below:  Data used: Hydric soils (Natural Soil Groups), existing wetlands (National Wetland Inventory), land use (Maryland Department Of Planning, 1997).  Identify candidate hydric soil areas based on land use. Hydric soils on open land (agricultural fields, bare ground, etc.) are retained while those underlying natural vegetation and developed lands are excluded.  Explore hydric soils based on proximity to existing wetlands or streams. In the Georges Creek watershed, hydric soils are relatively rare compared to non-mountainous regions in Maryland. Additionally, proximity to wetland and streams supplements the potential to target or prioritize candidate sites for on-the-ground assessment. The Wetland Restoration Opportunities Map highlights open lands on hydric soils in the Georges Creek watershed. Based on the analysis above, the following priorities for further assessment are offered: -- High Priority for site assessment: Considering the limited number of open land / hydric soils sites identified in this analysis, it is reasonable to assess all identified sites as potential wetland restoration sites. However, if assessment opportunities must be even more focused, open land / hydric soil sites that are in the floodplain or adjacent to existing wetlands are more likely to offer multiple benefits as wetland restoration projects.  62    RELATED PROJECTS Overview There are numerous projects and programs that have the potential to contribute to successful development and implementation of a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). Map 20 Construction Projects Affecting Watershed Restoration shows the approximate location of 23 projects. The accompanying Table by the same name serves a key for the map and gives a very brief description of each. Some of these projects are also described in greater detail in this section. The project listing included here suggests opportunities for cooperation and coordination that can improve the likelihood of success for the WRAS. While this listing is not all-inclusive, additions should be made to include important related projects and follow-up should continue to be undertaken to promote the WRAS process with these and other projects and programs. Georges Creek Mainstem Projects Georges Creek has a history of flooding and related property and stream corridor damage. Consequently, many projects along the Georges Creek mainstem integrate flood mitigation with watershed restoration. Two recently funded projects are summarized below. Additional projects may have been previously conducted in the area and they can be added to this section as the discretion of Allegany County. 1. Barton Wall Repair & Stream Restoration In Georges Creek at the town of Barton, eroding and unstable stream bed has undermined a flood control wall and bridge abutments and has exposed waterlines resulting in fish blockage and poor fish habitat. Total project cost is $1,349,000 including $386,000 in Federal Transportation Enhancement Program (TEP) funding. Project contact is Paul Kahl (see Contacts listing). The project has several objectives: - Stabilize 2100 linear feet of stream channel and elevate the stream to pre-existing conditions using hydraulic structures; - Eliminate fish blockage and protect water lines by adjusting the stream profile and using grade stabilization; - Reduce high bedload sediment by stopping stream down-cutting. Boulders, cross vanes and rock vanes will be used; - Improve fish habitat by creating pools and riffles, and; - Repair or replace 1700 linear feet of flood protection wall  64    Georges Creek Construction Projects Affecting Watershed Restoration Key for Map 20 Page 1 of 2 Project Barton Area Stream Restoration Barton Reservoir Barton Walls Church Street Bridge Coney AMD Remediation FEMA Floodplain Mapping Georges Cr.

Lonaconing Island Restoration Project The Lonaconing Island Restoration is needed help address problems from two floods in 1996 flood that damaged the local stream and riparian system and is continuing stream erosion threatens local infrastructure. After the floods, Allegany County purchased several damaged residential properties in this area of the Georges Creek floodplain. The residential structures were removed and the stream was relocated. However, the stream area is degraded and exhibits high to extreme erodibility. In some sections the stream eroded to bedrock and a sewer line is exposed. Also, the site is adjacent to Route 36 which gives the site potential for recreation and environmental education adjacent to the creek. Total project cost is estimated at $272,500 project including $57,500 of Federal 319(h) funding under the year 2000 CWAP project budget, $62,500 in local match and the remainder from flood management programs. As of January 2001, project design was under review by permitting agencies. The project has the following objectives: - Restore approximately 1500 feet of stream, streambank, and adjacent floodplain by grading to a more stable slope condition, adding boulder grade control structures to channel water towards the center of the stream and using bioengineering techniques for bank revetment and planting extensively riparian area. - Design and construct a 3-acre greenway park with community input. The park will include natural habitat, a walking trail, stream access area, benches, activity areas, and interpretive signs. This restoration approach will also reduce the potential for future flood damage and minimize potential repair costs.  68   Neff Run Watershed Integrated Approach to Restoration Allegany County, DNR and other partner agencies including the Allegany Soil Conservation District have established a track record for integrated watershed assessment, planning and restoration in the Neff Run watershed. The stream corridor assessment was completed in 1999 and, using this information a restoration plan was adopted in March 2000. Implementation projects are currently getting under way and others are anticipated to follow. A summary and status of this effort is presented below. 1. 1999 Neff Run Watershed Stream Corridor Assessment The assessment was performed in 1999 and the final report was issued February 2000.4 DNR's Stream Corridor Assessment Methodology (SCAM) was used by trained teams from the Maryland Conservation Corps. These teams walked along streams identifying and recording potential problems. This approach, which includes photographs keyed to maps, adds significantly to the reliability and confidence of targeting decisions for restoration projects. The 1999 findings are summarized in the table. A severity of 1 is most severe and 5 is least severe.

Neff Run Watershed Restoration Plan The Neff Run Watershed Restoration Plan was completed by Allegany County's Neff Run Watershed Restoration Workgroup who worked about one year to develop a coordinated approach to addressing watershed issues. Building on findings from the Neff Run Stream Corridor Assessment, community issues and concerns and other baseline information, the Work Group prioritized projects based on issue areas shown Action Plan Focus Areas table. Neff Run Watershed Restoration Plan  Action Plan Focus Areas Stream stability Flood Hazard Mitigation Acid Mine Drainage Riparian Habitat Enhancement Fish Habitat Improvement Public Utility Concerns - Exposed Pipes Pipe Outfalls Other Observations Monitoring and Evaluation Research: Small Watershed Study Parks, Recreation and Green Development Community Involvement and Education  The work already completed in the Neff Run Watershed Restoration Plan can be viewed both as a progenitor and as a foundation for anticipated work more broadly applied in the Georges Creek watershed. The WRAS can incorporate the Neff Run Watershed Restoration Plan without change or, if Allegany County determines that an update is needed, the WRAS can be a vehicle for that change. Based on the Neff Run experience, several generalizations can be made for the WRAS: - In large measure, the methods and approaches tested in Neff Run can be used and improved for more broad application in the Georges Creek watershed. - The pre-existing working relationships developed in Neff Run will likely begin to pay dividends in increased efficiency now that they can be reinvested throughout Georges Creek WRAS . - With the existing Restoration Plan already in the implementation phase for Neff Run, additional WRAS effort in the Neff Run watershed can focus on resolving known issues.  70   3. Current Neff Run Projects Adoption of the Neff Run Watershed Restoration Plan has spawned a number of complimentary projects that address various needs and interests identified in Plan:  Several acid mine seeps are being addressed by the Maryland Bureau of Mines  Water quality monitoring is being conducted in Neff Run by students from Beall High School, which is located at the headwaters of the watershed  Hydrologic characteristics in the watershed are being assessed by the University of Maryland Appalachian Laboratory 4. Neff Run Restoration Project The Allegany Soil Conservation District proposed this project to help meet at least five objectives in the Neff Run Watershed Restoration Plan listed above and to build upon the accomplishments of projects already underway in the Neff Run watershed. As of March 2001, the grant application for this project is still under review. Total cost for the Neff Run Restoration Project is projected at $188,000 with $110,000 requested from Federal 319(h) funding through the fiscal year 2001 CWAP project budget. The remainder of the project's funding would be local match. The project has the following objectives:  Stabilize 1000 linear feet of stream channel by installing 20 rock vein weirs as channel grade control structures to reduce down-cutting of the stream bed  Install three fish habitat structures  Stabilize 1000 linear feet of stream bank using bioengineering techniques including planting live stakes and live fascines, and installing of root wads  Establish a continuous forest buffer by planting native tree species in 1000 linear feet of riparian corridor  Incorporate watershed restoration action strategies into local governance such as Allegany County land use ordinances and planning. One approach is to sponsor a tour(s) of watershed issue areas for governmental officials to demonstrate opportunities.  Increase environmental awareness among citizens in the watershed via the George's Creek Watershed Association (monthly meetings and quarterly newsletter) and ""watershed awareness days"" for Beall Elementary, Middle and High School students  71   Mill Run Watershed Projects 1. Acid Mine Drainage Mitigation Mill Run is a tributary of George's Creek. It is impaired by excessive acidity and is a targeted restoration priority by the MDE Bureau of Mines (MDE/BOM). Based on assessments sponsored by MDE/BOM, there are three main sources of acid mine drainage(AMD) in the Mill Run watershed: Mill Run AMD Source Church Discharge Harman Seep Ezra Michael Mine Percent of Total Acid Load 68. 29. 2.  The Mill Run Watershed Association has been working cooperatively with the MDE/BOM and the Canaan Valley Institute to restore the watershed to a state capable of supporting aquatic life. The Mill Run Watershed Association has a long term goal to re-establish a trout fishery in the lower reach of the Mill Run for youths aged 16 and under. The MDE/BOM plans to mitigate the two smaller discharges, and the Canaan Valley Institute has committed funds for the operation and maintenance of an AMD treatment system at Church discharge, the largest AMD source in the watershed. CVI has partnered with the Conservation Fund's Freshwater Institute to design and operate the treatment system for this site. This project will employ a unique AMD treatment system that has been developed by the USGS Biological Resources Division in cooperation with the Freshwater Institute. This treatment system uses technology that is based on intermittently fluidized limestone beds integrated with carbon dioxide adsorption and recycling. Intermittent fluidization requires high velocities, which produce sufficient friction to prevent the ""armoring"" that typically renders limestone treatment systems effective. The carbon dioxide pretreatment lowers the influent pH and maintains it at a lower level in order to accelerate limestone dissolution. This system costs 50% less to build and operate than conventional active treatment systems. Besides the benefits of stream restoration, this mitigation project will also foster community action, provide local education opportunities, and enhance larger scale aquatic restoration efforts.

Mill Run Stream Restoration About 6000 linear feet of Mill Run are in Allegany County and the remaining upstream portions of the stream system are in Garrett County. The Allegany County stream segment is channelized, unstable, and exhibits eroding both banks and streambed. The total projected cost of this stream restoration project is shown in the Funding Summary Table. Project contact is Paul Kahl (see Contacts listing). The project has several objectives:        Restore 6,000 linear feet of stream channel to more natural geomorphologic conditions Reduce high bedload sediment loads by using grade controls to stop stream down-cutting Improve riparian buffer by planting natural plant species Improve in-stream habitat by creating step pools and eliminating fish blockages Improve water quality via the MDE Bureau of Mines acid mine abatement projects Acquire two residential properties using other funding, and Protect local roads by installing stabilization structures.

The goals from these other programs tend to overlap and run parallel to potential interests for developing WRAS goals. Therefore, to assist in WRAS development, selected goals from other programs are included here as points of reference. Goals from the Clean Water Action Plan 3:  Clean Water Goals - Maryland watersheds should meet water quality standards, including numerical criteria as well as narrative standards and designated uses.  Other Natural Resource Goals - Watersheds should achieve healthy conditions as indicated by natural resource indicators related to the condition of the water itself (e.g. water chemistry), aquatic living resources and physical habitat, as well as landscape factors (e.g. buffered streams and wetland restoration). Goals from the Neff Run Watershed Restoration Plan 5. This Plan included numerous action recommendations with clear and measurable intent. It may be appropriate to use these specific recommendations as a starting point for generating a set of overarching goals that could help to guide restoration project prioritization throughout the Georges Run Watershed. As one example of many potential examples, first establish a ""goal"" of expanding the range of wild trout populations. Second, identify one or more high priority stream segments where the various problems there could be successfully solved. Third, set forth specific action recommendations as was done for Neff Run to guide implementation. Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998  The most significant feature is requiring nutrient management plans for virtually all Maryland farms. The requirement is being phased in over a several year period: - Nitrogen-based plan implementation will be required in 2002 - Phosphorus-based plan implementation will be required in 2005  Assistance with costs of manure transportation has the potential to move nutrients to sites where they are needed. Citizen Group Recommendations  For example, the Mill Run Watershed Association has a long term goal to re-establish a trout fishery in the lower reach of the Mill Run. Goals of this nature could be developed or adapted in the WRAS process.  74   ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Sources of Information for the Georges Creek Watershed Characterization 1. DNR.

This report describes these conflicts in          the specific context of the Tres Rios Demonstration Constructed Wetlands          Project in central Arizona.  Fourteen acres of demonstration-scale          treatment and habitat wetlands have been created near the Salt River as          a prototype of a larger project envisioned for future effluent          management and wetland habitat restoration.  Monitoring at this          site has documented water quality and wildlife benefits but has also          illustrated the potential for production of nuisance populations of          mosquitoes.  Adjacent uncontrolled aquatic habitats in the Salt          River watershed pose similar mosquito production risks already.           Basic research on mosquito control measures including sources and          migration patterns of mosquitoes, design and operation modifications,          and chemical and biological control is being conducted at this          facility.  Mosquito control practices implemented at Tres Rios in          1998 showed excellent promise for reducing conflicts.  These          efforts are adding to our knowledge of the scope of the problem and          providing a quantitative basis for assessing the effectiveness of the          options available to mitigate the conflict created by constructed          wetlands.  Prudent wetland design dictates the need to incorporate          design features that minimize mosquito production.  Some of these          features include:                       The use of multiple wetland cells and parallel flow paths to allow            operational flexibility             Adequate pretreatment to lessen the production of larval            mosquitoes             Levee design to allow for mowing and maintenance             The incorporation of deep water zones for maintenance of            predaceous vertebrates and invertebrates and to allow access for            control efforts, if needed             Selection of a diverse mix of plant species that optimize            treatment while minimizing creation of productive mosquito habitats             Planning for periodic plant maintenance  Basic research is          still needed to define the cost-effectiveness of the various recommended          design and management options.  A research agenda for the Tres Rios          Project is described that can provide much of this information for          incorporation in the design of the full scale project. This          report summarizes the relevant scientific and engineering information          necessary to evaluate and resolve the mosquito/treatment wetland          conflict.  It describes what is known and what needs further study          regarding:                       The current knowledge about the  ecology  of            mosquitoes that live in wastewater environments (with emphasis on            treatment wetlands), including mosquito taxonomy, life histories, and            natural predators             The most significant aspects of mosquitoes and their implications            to human  health ,            focusing on vector mosquito species and avian reservoirs associated            with treatment wetlands, and the quantification of risk imposed on the            human population             Mosquito control  strategies             including ecological control, source reduction to reduce breeding            success, and chemical controls             Details on  design             considerations for treatment wetlands most likely to reduce mosquito            production, including discussion on each modification relative to its            effect on the primary water treatment and habitat creation goals             Appropriate methods for  assessing             the actual mosquito production of treatment wetlands, including            preconstruction baseline data collection which allows for an            assessment of the net change in mosquito populations resulting from a            treatment wetland project             Sources and  references             for future research needs and a research agenda.  Together,          these sections (in excerpts below) provide a strong and effective          strategy for resolving the mosquito/treatment wetland          conflict. Return to Top                       Ecology  of          Mosquitoes Associated with Wastewater Treatment          Wetlands An Overview           Mosquito species found in treatment wetlands can be classified into          two groups based on their egg laying and hatching behavior.           Females of some species lay their eggs directly on the water surface or          on the leaves of aquatic plants.  The eggs hatch usually within a          few days and do not need an external hatching stimulus.  These          behavioral traits are characteristic of mosquitoes of the following          genera (or subgenera):  Anopheles, Coquillettidia, Culiseta, Culex          (Culex), Mansonia,  and  Uranotaenia.   By contrast, the          eggs of the floodwater mosquitoes in the genera  Aedes  and           Psorophora  normally are deposited on moist soil or debris on the          shore around aquatic systems and do not hatch until submerged by rising          water levels ** .  These          differences in egg laying and hatching have major impacts on the types          of species found in constructed treatment wetlands.  Systems with          minimal or infrequent water level fluctuations seldom generate severe          floodwater mosquito problems. On the other hand, permanent or          semipermanent aquatic systems, especially those containing emergent or          floating plants and nutrient-rich wastewater, may provide suitable          habitats for the immature stages of several species that deposit eggs on          the water surface or aquatic vegetation.  Fifty (50) mosquito          species have been found in Arizona ** .  Life          history, geographic, seasonal and certain habitat features influence the          mosquito species composition at specific sites.  These factors          include the geographic distributions of mosquitoes in permanent or          semipermanent aquatic habitats and floodwater breeds, oviposition site          selection, larval growth and survival, and adult mosquito abundance          relative to seasonal activity, daily activity patterns, energetics,          blood feeding patterns, gonotrophic interactions, dispersal, and          survivorship. Return to Top                       Mosquitoes and          Human Health Considerations An Introduction           What follows is a description of how mosquitoes associated with          wetlands may impact the health and well being of Arizona residents          visiting wetlands or residing in surrounding communities.  Emphasis          is placed on mosquito species **  and pathogens          found or potentially found in the Phoenix, Arizona area and the          southwest United States.  However, these concepts may be          extrapolated to other wetland-mosquito-parasite systems.  Much of          the information available on mosquito and arbovirus ecology in the          Southwest comes from studies conducted in California, especially          irrigated agricultural habitats in the southeastern Sonoran desert          biome.  Based on this information a comprehensive surveillance          program is recommended for arboviruses likely to be found at the Tres          Rios Wetlands. Health is a state of fitness of the body or mind          that may be altered by the deterioration of the internal or external          environment.  Mosquitoes deteriorate the external environment by          creating a biting nuisance that precludes or inhibits outdoor activities          and the internal environment by the transmission of pathogens that may          produce disease.  Both aspects may have a significant economic          impact by driving away visitors resulting in the loss of tourist income          and in costs related to mosquito control and case management.  The          risk of human infection with a mosquito-borne pathogen in the United          States is generally low; however, even the perceived threat of infection          may cause public alarm and a demand for public health action.  In          addition, the clinical management of viral encephalitis cases requires          considerable medical care and may impart a severe economic impact ** .           Potential Health Problems Pathogens are parasites that          harm their host.  For transmission, a female mosquito must acquire          a critical number of pathogens from an infectious host during blood          feeding, survive long enough for the pathogen to replicate/develop and          infect the salivary glands, and then transmit the pathogen to a          susceptible host when salivary secretions are released into the bite          wound during a subsequent blood meal.  Criteria required for a          mosquito species to be considered a vector include: 1) pathogen must be          isolated from infected mosquitoes collected in nature, 2) mosquito must          be associated closely in time and space with infected vertebrate hosts,          3) pathogen must multiply/develop in the mosquito, and 4) infection and          possibly disease should be duplicated by feeding infected mosquitoes on          suitable vertebrate hosts ** .  Parallel          criteria to incriminate a pathogen reservoir indicate that the          vertebrate host: 1) should be abundant, 2) not succumb rapidly to          infection, 3) develop an elevated and lasting parasitemia after dermal          inoculation with a small amount of parasites, 4) not confer long lasting          maternal immunity, and 5) be a preferred blood meal host of the primary          vector mosquito species ** .           Surveillance and control strategies depend upon whether the pathogens          are anthroponoses or zoonoses.  Anthroponoses such as malaria have          a human reservoir and are maintained by a simple human to mosquito          cycle.  Zoonoses such as the mosquito-borne viral encephalitidies          have a primary transmission cycle among mosquitoes and wild birds, with          transmission to humans and domestic animals incidental or tangential to          the basic cycle.  Epidemiological investigation of clinical cases          is critical to detect anthroponoses and focus vector control efforts in          time and space.  Mosquito and reservoir host surveillance are          necessary to maintain mosquito population levels below thresholds that          permit human and/or domestic animal involvement. Expanded wetland          habitats may create ecological conditions suitable for the introduction          of either new mosquito species or new arboviruses.  Rapid travel          allows introduction and colonization as new habitat is created.           For example, new mosquitoes species introduced into southeastern          California during the past decade have included  Ae. pupureipes, Ae.          thelcter  and  Cx. erraticus ** .            Although these species are not vectors of human pathogens, they          demonstrate the ability of species to extend ranges over relatively          large areas. Arboviruses also have the potential for          introduction.  Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus (VEE)          remains epidemic and epizootic in Central America and recent          transmission has occurred as far north as Panama ** .           Historically, this virus has caused equine disease in Texas **  and led to          extensive surveillance efforts along riparian corridors in Arizona ** .  A vector          during this historical epidemic,  Ps. confinnis,  has been trapped          at the Tres Rios wetlands, although these adults most likely emerged          from habitat associated with surrounding agriculture.  Vector Trap          results Return to Top                       Mosquito          Control Strategies Conclusions           The recommendations for water and vegetation management that are          thought to reduce mosquito production can be in conflict with design and          operational features necessary for water quality improvement or wildlife          conservation.  Whereas, the purpose of this section is to provide          an overview of design features and operational procedures for wetlands          from a mosquito control perspective, further research is needed to          evaluate the effectiveness of some of the aforementioned recommendations          for mosquito control and conveyance structures is critical for all          aspects of wetlands functions. A sequential decision plan for          mosquito control should be established.  Three factors need to be          evaluated before a plan can be implemented ** .  The          three factors are (1) establishing a decision threshold that is used to          determine the levels of larval abundance that indicate adequate versus          inadequate control, (2) the statistical distribution of larval counts          and (3) the acceptable rate of error in the assessment of control          status.  In terms of quantification of the three factors,          establishing the decision threshold is probably the most          difficult.  An adequate larval sampling program is required to          determine/evaluate all of the factors.  Mosquito larvae often are          aggregated and a variety of statistical distributions are thought to          describe the spatial patterns for mosquitoes, the negative binomial is          the most common.  Standard statistical assumptions for Type I and          Type II errors in hypothesis testing can be used as a starting point for          (3).  Yet, the treatment threshold will depend on the definitions          of ""control"" by several agencies and is likely to require compromise          from all sides.  A ""zero-tolerance"" threshold is not practical for          a wetland.  Whereas, the lower (control is adequate) and upper          (control is inadequate) decision thresholds for control might be based          on the association between larval counts and complaints about nuisance          biting mosquitoes, factors such as public health concerns, the          difficulty of assigning a probability of disease transmission to          mosquito abundance above ambient levels and such issues need to be          studied further and then addressed in the decision          plan. Maintenance is a critical issue.  There is a strong          association between mosquito production and emergent vegetation          coverage, at least for treatment wetlands in the Southwest.           Whereas, management of emergent macrophytes is needed the utilities of          various wetland designs for emergent macrophytes and for other types of          macrophytes need to be evaluated.  Maintenance of conveyance          structures also can be an issue, of which vegetation funding for          post-construction maintenance activities or maintenance activities are          among the first line items of budgets to be eliminated during periods of          fiscal austerity, an increasing number of mosquito abatement agencies          are requiring documentation that describes a long-term commitment to          maintenance and designates party(ies) responsible for maintenance          operations and the costs of maintenance and mosquito abatement.           The cost of mosquito abatement for small wetlands, such as the Tres Rios          Demonstration Constructed Wetlands, is several hundred dollars for each          application of mosquitocidal materials.  The costs rise rapidly          once aircraft or helicopters are needed; the cost of  each           mosquito abatement treatment (labor, materials, and larvicides) by          helicopter for a moderately SIZEd wetland (10 ha) is approximately          $4000!  Constructed wetlands can provide many important benefits          but there is need for greater communication among wetlands planners,          engineers, biologists, public health personnel and mosquito control          practitioners to try to design mosquitoes out of wetlands to the          greatest extent possible and then maintain this goal after wetlands are          operational. Return to Top                       Constructed Treatment Wetland Design          Considerations Introduction           Treatment wetland design typically has the following primary          objective:           to provide the most cost effective method to chieve            water quality treatment goals and comply with permit            conditions.             There are often several planning and design considerations that must          be balanced to meet this objective.  These considerations may          include:                       Select a treatment wetland technology application that is most            appropriate for the specific project goals (e.g., SF vs. SSF, natural            vs. constructed).             Locate a site that has the most favorable combination of low            topographic relief, distance from the wastewater source, cost per            area, convenience for subsequent discharge, minimum number of land            owners, and the fewest number of land use conflicts.             Achieve the greatest treatment possible with the smallest wetland            area.             Provide consistent compliance with permit conditions.             Design for a project life that meets and exceeds a reasonable            project life expectancy.             Minimize costs for operation and maintenance (O&M) through            selection of easily maintained structures and ease of access.             Minimize nuisance conditions for humans and wildlife.             Provide additional benefits where these are within goals and            budget of the wetland project.            Several of these goals are likely to be in conflict for any specific          treatment wetland project.  Typically, these conflicts will be          resolved by consideration of the different alternative with the lowest          overall cost (capital and O&M costs measured as present          worth).  Detailed methods for these planning and design          considerations are provided elsewhere ** . The          initial decision to select a treatment wetland system from the multiple          available wastewater treatment alternatives is based on  a review          of technical, regulatory, and economic factors.  Considerations of          the potential for mosquito production and concerns about public health          should be among the factors that are reviewed in this decision-making          process.  This section provides a summary of treatment wetland          design considerations following the initial decision to select a wetland          alternative. This section of the report focuses on how each major          treatment wetland design consideration may conflict with published          guidelines to reduce mosquito production or mosquito-related nuisance          conditions.  The apparent ramifications of each wetland design          decision in light of the mosquito issue are described, and the available          alternative design methods are discussed.  When known, the efficacy          of these design alternatives are quantified, both for their effect and          reducing mosquito nuisance conditions and for their effect on meeting          water quality treatment goals.  Whenever practical, prevention or          minimization of mosquito production by source reduction and enhancement          of natural mortality factors are preferred over chemical control of          mosquito populations.           Summary Treatment wetlands receiving pretreated waste          waters and storm waters typically have mosquito production rates equal          to or less than surrounding natural wetlands.  In regions where          wetlands are rare, the addition of enriched standing water will increase          mosquito populations.  In arid regions, slight increases in          mosquito production may create concern among a public that is          unaccustomed to mosquitoes.  Consistent pretreatment, stable water          levels and maintenance of natural mosquito predator populations are          instrumental to minimizing mosquito production from treatment          wetlands.  Other measures including basin design, vegetation          selection and management, and use of chemical control agents are also          effective at reducing mosquito populations.  Common treatment          wetland design practices that do not conflict with minimizing mosquito          production include:                       Wetland siting in rural areas             Use of multiple wetland cells             Adequate pretreatment to increase aerobic conditions in the            wetland             Levee design to allow access for mowing and maintenance             Incorporation of deep water zones up to 50 percent of the wetland            area without creation of hydraulic short circuits             Selection of a diverse mix of wetland plants with different growth            forms             Periodic plant biomass maintenance with fire.            The treatment wetland design practices that may be at odds with          effective mosquito control are:                       The need to have high plant biomass production and dense emergent            plant growth             Maintaining average water depths lees than 30 to 60cm.            Additional quantitative research needs to be conducted to provide a          rational basis for wetland design that optimizes both goals of cost          effective water quality treatment and mosquito control. Return to Top                       Mosquito          Monitoring  in Treatment          Wetlands Recommendations The following          recommendations are made for dip sampling:                       A single method should be used to collect larvae and differences            in technique should be minimized among persons collecting            samples.  Collins and Resh (1989) **  described two            dipping techniques: a quick dipping technique that is adequate for            most mosquitoes and can be used when emergent vegetation is present,            and a slow dipping technique that works best when sampling anopheline            larvae in comparatively open water situations.   A third            technique described by Knight (1964) ** , the            draining-dripping method, was effective for extracting  Culex             larvae associated with the  Typha  root masses ** .             Although named differently, these three techniques (simple scoop,            shallow skim, and flow-in methods, respectively) and four additional            dipping methods were described in O'Malley (1995) ** .  Given            that the effectiveness of the different dipping method among field            personnel is important.  Occasional comparisons should be made            among the field personnel to calibrate their techniques.  The            easiest way to standardize collection technique is to have the same            person(s) collect samples.             Permanent field stations should be established after the wetland            is stratified into ecological regions (e.g., vegetation type, gradient            in water chemistry).  Sampling should be focused in areas that            are likely to produce mosquitoes.  Within each stratum, replicate            samples can be taken at predetermined spatial intervals (e.g., after            every 5 steps a sample is taken).  Often taking a group of            samples within a 2-5 m region, combining and concentrating the samples            using a screened (concentrator) cup and then preserving the samples            with ethanol works well.             Samples should be taken at temporal intervals that are at least            once during the average development time (i.e., time required to            develop from first instar to adult) for the mosquito of concern.             Because control measures against the immature stages usually are more            efficacious and cost-effective than is attempting to control adults            that are dispersing, the sampling interval needs to be less than the            standard generation time (i.e., egg to egg), particularly if diapause            occurs in the egg stage.  This requires that samples are taken            weekly during periods of high environmental temperatures and perhaps            more frequently (i) to determine the efficacy of control measures            (e.g., pretreatment, 2-3 days after treatment, and then weekly until            the next treatment is needed) and (ii) for floodwater mosquitoes that            have a very rapid immature development.            Conclusion Every sampling method has its biases and          limitations.  As Bidlingmayer (1967) **  stated in the          preface to his classic report on a comparison of trapping methods, ""An          understanding of the limitations of each method is essential to the          interpretation of the sampling data.  Only then can sampling be          used effectively to conduct mosquito surveys, evaluate population          changes and determine specific behavior.""  The best way to achieve          this object is to compare the results of various sampling techniques          under a wide range of environmental conditions, and to use multiple          sampling techniques whenever possible.  Southwood (1978) **  and          Service(1993) **           provide detailed descriptions of sampling most insects and mosquitoes,          respectively, and the reader is referred to these texts for further          discussion of the methods outlined above.

GX006-39-9979826	Maryland Nonpoint-Source Study      Project History     To address nutrient and sediment Nonpoint-source pollution problems in the Chesapeake Bay and in Maryland rivers, a cooperative study was undertaken in 1986 by the State of Maryland and the U.S. Geological Survey. One of the major efforts to understand Nonpoint-source (NPS) nutrient and sediment loading has centered around the Patuxent River basin. The Patuxent data and analysis of the data from 1986-96 is now available.    In 1997, the study of NPS nutrient and sediment loading shifted to a more state-wide application; fixed sites in the Patuxent River Basin are slowly being discontinued and trailers are being outfitted as mobile water-quality monitoring stations to be located around the state. Sampling includes monthly fixed sampling, storm sampling, and low-flow synoptic sampling above the monitoring site.    A statistical approach is being called cluster analysis to stratify the state into unique hydrologic response units (HRU’s) based upon geology, soils, and land use. These HRU’s will be used to evaluate current monitoring programs, existing data, and information gaps. The analysis will also be used to help locate water-quality sites for future NPS monitoring. The mobile station water-quality monitoring program that was initiated in 1997 will use the results of the statistical analysis. There will eventually be three sites that will be rotated to different representative areas of the state for three-year monitoring periods.

This report describes these conflicts in the specific context of the Tres    Rios Demonstration Constructed Wetlands Project in central Arizona.     Fourteen acres of demonstration-scale treatment and habitat wetlands have    been created near the Salt River as a prototype of a larger project envisioned    for future effluent management and wetland habitat restoration.     Monitoring at this site has documented water quality and wildlife benefits    but has also illustrated the potential for production of nuisance populations    of mosquitoes.  Adjacent uncontrolled aquatic habitats in the Salt    River watershed pose similar mosquito production risks already.     Basic research on mosquito control measures including sources and migration    patterns of mosquitoes, design and operation modifications, and chemical    and biological control is being conducted at this facility.  Mosquito    control practices implemented at Tres Rios in 1998 showed excellent promise    for reducing conflicts.  These efforts are adding to our knowledge    of the scope of the problem and providing a quantitative basis for assessing    the effectiveness of the options available to mitigate the conflict created    by constructed wetlands.  Prudent wetland design dictates the need    to incorporate design features that minimize mosquito production.     Some of these features include:                      The use of multiple wetland cells and parallel flow paths to allow operational flexibility                    Adequate pretreatment to lessen the production of larval mosquitoes                 Levee design to allow for mowing and maintenance                 The incorporation of deep water zones for maintenance of predaceous vertebrates and invertebrates and to allow access for control efforts, if needed                 Selection of a diverse mix of plant species that optimize treatment while minimizing creation of productive mosquito habitats                 Planning for periodic plant maintenance                         Basic research is still needed to define the cost-effectiveness              of the various recommended design and management options.  A research              agenda for the Tres Rios Project is described that can provide much              of this information for incorporation in the design of the full scale              project.            This report summarizes the relevant scientific and engineering              information necessary to evaluate and resolve the mosquito/treatment              wetland conflict.  It describes what is known and what needs further              study regarding:                             The current knowledge about the   ecology  of mosquitoes that live in wastewater environments (with emphasis on treatment wetlands), including mosquito taxonomy, life histories, and natural predators                 The most significant aspects of mosquitoes and their implications to human  health , focusing on vector mosquito species and avian reservoirs associated with treatment wetlands, and the quantification of risk imposed on the human population                 Mosquito control   strategies  including ecological control, source reduction to reduce breeding success, and chemical controls                 Details on   design  considerations for treatment wetlands most likely to reduce mosquito production, including discussion on each modification relative to its effect on the primary water treatment and habitat creation goals                 Appropriate methods for   assessing  the actual mosquito production of treatment wetlands, including preconstruction baseline data collection which allows for an assessment of the net change in mosquito populations resulting from a treatment wetland project                  Sources and   references  for future research needs and a research agenda.                                  Together, these sections (in excerpts below) provide a strong and effective strategy for resolving the mosquito/treatment wetland conflict.             Return to Top                         Ecology               of Mosquitoes Associated with Wastewater Treatment Wetlands               An Overview             Mosquito species found in treatment wetlands can be classified              into two groups based on their egg laying and hatching behavior.               Females of some species lay their eggs directly on the water surface              or on the leaves of aquatic plants.  The eggs hatch usually within              a few days and do not need an external hatching stimulus.  These              behavioral traits are characteristic of mosquitoes of the following              genera (or subgenera):  Anopheles, Coquillettidia, Culiseta, Culex              (Culex), Mansonia,  and  Uranotaenia.   By contrast, the              eggs of the floodwater mosquitoes in the genera  Aedes  and               Psorophora  normally are deposited on moist soil or debris on the              shore around aquatic systems and do not hatch until submerged by rising              water levels ** .  These differences in egg laying              and hatching have major impacts on the types of species found in constructed              treatment wetlands.  Systems with minimal or infrequent water level              fluctuations seldom generate severe floodwater mosquito problems. On              the other hand, permanent or semipermanent aquatic systems, especially              those containing emergent or floating plants and nutrient-rich wastewater,              may provide suitable habitats for the immature stages of several species              that deposit eggs on the water surface or aquatic vegetation.               Fifty (50) mosquito species have been found in Arizona ** .               Life history, geographic, seasonal and certain habitat features influence              the mosquito species composition at specific sites.  These factors              include the geographic distributions of mosquitoes in permanent or semipermanent              aquatic habitats and floodwater breeds, oviposition site selection,              larval growth and survival, and adult mosquito abundance relative to              seasonal activity, daily activity patterns, energetics, blood feeding              patterns, gonotrophic interactions, dispersal, and survivorship.             Return to Top                         Mosquitoes and Human Health Considerations               An Introduction             What follows is a description of how mosquitoes associated              with wetlands may impact the health and well being of Arizona residents              visiting wetlands or residing in surrounding communities.  Emphasis              is placed on mosquito species **  and pathogens found              or potentially found in the Phoenix, Arizona area and the southwest              United States.  However, these concepts may be extrapolated to              other wetland-mosquito-parasite systems.  Much of the information              available on mosquito and arbovirus ecology in the Southwest comes from              studies conducted in California, especially irrigated agricultural habitats              in the southeastern Sonoran desert biome.  Based on this information              a comprehensive surveillance program is recommended for arboviruses              likely to be found at the Tres Rios Wetlands.            Health is a state of fitness of the body or mind that              may be altered by the deterioration of the internal or external environment.               Mosquitoes deteriorate the external environment by creating a biting              nuisance that precludes or inhibits outdoor activities and the internal              environment by the transmission of pathogens that may produce disease.               Both aspects may have a significant economic impact by driving away              visitors resulting in the loss of tourist income and in costs related              to mosquito control and case management.  The risk of human infection              with a mosquito-borne pathogen in the United States is generally low;              however, even the perceived threat of infection may cause public alarm              and a demand for public health action.  In addition, the clinical              management of viral encephalitis cases requires considerable medical              care and may impart a severe economic impact ** .             Potential Health Problems            Pathogens are parasites that harm their host.  For              transmission, a female mosquito must acquire a critical number of pathogens              from an infectious host during blood feeding, survive long enough for              the pathogen to replicate/develop and infect the salivary glands, and              then transmit the pathogen to a susceptible host when salivary secretions              are released into the bite wound during a subsequent blood meal.               Criteria required for a mosquito species to be considered a vector include:              1) pathogen must be isolated from infected mosquitoes collected in nature,              2) mosquito must be associated closely in time and space with infected              vertebrate hosts, 3) pathogen must multiply/develop in the mosquito,              and 4) infection and possibly disease should be duplicated by feeding              infected mosquitoes on suitable vertebrate hosts ** .               Parallel criteria to incriminate a pathogen reservoir indicate that              the vertebrate host: 1) should be abundant, 2) not succumb rapidly to              infection, 3) develop an elevated and lasting parasitemia after dermal              inoculation with a small amount of parasites, 4) not confer long lasting              maternal immunity, and 5) be a preferred blood meal host of the primary              vector mosquito species ** .  Surveillance and              control strategies depend upon whether the pathogens are anthroponoses              or zoonoses.  Anthroponoses such as malaria have a human reservoir              and are maintained by a simple human to mosquito cycle.  Zoonoses              such as the mosquito-borne viral encephalitidies have a primary transmission              cycle among mosquitoes and wild birds, with transmission to humans and              domestic animals incidental or tangential to the basic cycle.               Epidemiological investigation of clinical cases is critical to detect              anthroponoses and focus vector control efforts in time and space.               Mosquito and reservoir host surveillance are necessary to maintain mosquito              population levels below thresholds that permit human and/or domestic              animal involvement.            Expanded wetland habitats may create ecological conditions              suitable for the introduction of either new mosquito species or new              arboviruses.  Rapid travel allows introduction and colonization              as new habitat is created.  For example, new mosquitoes species              introduced into southeastern California during the past decade have              included  Ae. pupureipes, Ae. thelcter  and  Cx. erraticus ** .                Although these species are not vectors of human pathogens, they demonstrate              the ability of species to extend ranges over relatively large areas.            Arboviruses also have the potential for introduction.               Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus (VEE) remains epidemic and              epizootic in Central America and recent transmission has occurred as              far north as Panama ** .  Historically, this virus              has caused equine disease in Texas **  and led to extensive              surveillance efforts along riparian corridors in Arizona ** .               A vector during this historical epidemic,  Ps. confinnis,  has              been trapped at the Tres Rios wetlands, although these adults most likely              emerged from habitat associated with surrounding agriculture.  Vector              Trap results             Return to Top                         Mosquito Control Strategies               Conclusions             The recommendations for water and vegetation management              that are thought to reduce mosquito production can be in conflict with              design and operational features necessary for water quality improvement              or wildlife conservation.  Whereas, the purpose of this section              is to provide an overview of design features and operational procedures              for wetlands from a mosquito control perspective, further research is              needed to evaluate the effectiveness of some of the aforementioned recommendations              for mosquito control and conveyance structures is critical for all aspects              of wetlands functions.            A sequential decision plan for mosquito control should              be established.  Three factors need to be evaluated before a plan              can be implemented ** .  The three factors are              (1) establishing a decision threshold that is used to determine the              levels of larval abundance that indicate adequate versus inadequate              control, (2) the statistical distribution of larval counts and (3) the              acceptable rate of error in the assessment of control status.               In terms of quantification of the three factors, establishing the decision              threshold is probably the most difficult.  An adequate larval sampling              program is required to determine/evaluate all of the factors.               Mosquito larvae often are aggregated and a variety of statistical distributions              are thought to describe the spatial patterns for mosquitoes, the negative              binomial is the most common.  Standard statistical assumptions              for Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis testing can be used as a              starting point for (3).  Yet, the treatment threshold will depend              on the definitions of ""control"" by several agencies and is              likely to require compromise from all sides.  A ""zero-tolerance""              threshold is not practical for a wetland.  Whereas, the lower (control              is adequate) and upper (control is inadequate) decision thresholds for              control might be based on the association between larval counts and              complaints about nuisance biting mosquitoes, factors such as public              health concerns, the difficulty of assigning a probability of disease              transmission to mosquito abundance above ambient levels and such issues              need to be studied further and then addressed in the decision plan.            Maintenance is a critical issue.  There is a strong              association between mosquito production and emergent vegetation coverage,              at least for treatment wetlands in the Southwest.  Whereas, management              of emergent macrophytes is needed the utilities of various wetland designs              for emergent macrophytes and for other types of macrophytes need to              be evaluated.  Maintenance of conveyance structures also can be              an issue, of which vegetation funding for post-construction maintenance              activities or maintenance activities are among the first line items              of budgets to be eliminated during periods of fiscal austerity, an increasing              number of mosquito abatement agencies are requiring documentation that              describes a long-term commitment to maintenance and designates party(ies)              responsible for maintenance operations and the costs of maintenance              and mosquito abatement.  The cost of mosquito abatement for small              wetlands, such as the Tres Rios Demonstration Constructed Wetlands,              is several hundred dollars for each application of mosquitocidal materials.               The costs rise rapidly once aircraft or helicopters are needed; the              cost of  each  mosquito abatement treatment (labor, materials,              and larvicides) by helicopter for a moderately SIZEd wetland (10 ha)              is approximately $4000!  Constructed wetlands can provide many              important benefits but there is need for greater communication among              wetlands planners, engineers, biologists, public health personnel and              mosquito control practitioners to try to design mosquitoes out of wetlands              to the greatest extent possible and then maintain this goal after wetlands              are operational.             Return to Top                         Constructed Treatment Wetland Design Considerations               Introduction            Treatment wetland design typically has the following primary             objective:                            to provide the most cost effective method to chieve water quality treatment goals and comply with permit conditions.                       There are often several planning and design considerations that must be balanced to meet this objective.  These considerations may include:                              Select a treatment wetland technology application that is most appropriate for the specific project goals (e.g., SF vs. SSF, natural vs. constructed).                 Locate a site that has the most favorable combination of low topographic relief, distance from the wastewater source, cost per area, convenience for subsequent discharge, minimum number of land owners, and the fewest number of land use conflicts.                 Achieve the greatest treatment possible with the smallest wetland area.                 Provide consistent compliance with permit conditions.                  Design for a project life that meets and exceeds a reasonable project life expectancy.         Minimize costs for operation and maintenance (O&M) through selection of easily maintained structures and ease of access.                 Minimize nuisance conditions for humans and wildlife.                 Provide additional benefits where these are within goals and budget of the wetland project.                          Several of these goals are likely to be in conflict for              any specific treatment wetland project.  Typically, these conflicts              will be resolved by consideration of the different alternative with              the lowest overall cost (capital and O&M costs measured as present              worth).  Detailed methods for these planning and design considerations              are provided elsewhere ** .            The initial decision to select a treatment wetland system              from the multiple available wastewater treatment alternatives is based              on  a review of technical, regulatory, and economic factors.               Considerations of the potential for mosquito production and concerns              about public health should be among the factors that are reviewed in              this decision-making process.  This section provides a summary              of treatment wetland design considerations following the initial decision              to select a wetland alternative.            This section of the report focuses on how each major treatment              wetland design consideration may conflict with published guidelines              to reduce mosquito production or mosquito-related nuisance conditions.               The apparent ramifications of each wetland design decision in light              of the mosquito issue are described, and the available alternative design              methods are discussed.  When known, the efficacy of these design              alternatives are quantified, both for their effect and reducing mosquito              nuisance conditions and for their effect on meeting water quality treatment              goals.  Whenever practical, prevention or minimization of mosquito              production by source reduction and enhancement of natural mortality              factors are preferred over chemical control of mosquito populations.             Summary            Treatment wetlands receiving pretreated waste waters and              storm waters typically have mosquito production rates equal to or less              than surrounding natural wetlands.  In regions where wetlands are              rare, the addition of enriched standing water will increase mosquito              populations.  In arid regions, slight increases in mosquito production              may create concern among a public that is unaccustomed to mosquitoes.               Consistent pretreatment, stable water levels and maintenance of natural              mosquito predator populations are instrumental to minimizing mosquito              production from treatment wetlands.  Other measures including basin              design, vegetation selection and management, and use of chemical control              agents are also effective at reducing mosquito populations.  Common              treatment wetland design practices that do not conflict with minimizing              mosquito production include:                      Wetland siting in rural areas                 Use of multiple wetland cells                 Adequate pretreatment to increase aerobic conditions in the wetland                 Levee design to allow access for mowing and maintenance                 Incorporation of deep water zones up to 50 percent of the wetland area without creation of hydraulic short circuits                 Selection of a diverse mix of wetland plants with different growth forms                 Periodic plant biomass maintenance with fire.                          The treatment wetland design practices that may be at odds with effective mosquito control are:                              The need to have high plant biomass production and dense emergent plant growth                 Maintaining average water depths lees than 30 to 60cm.                          Additional quantitative research needs to be conducted              to provide a rational basis for wetland design that optimizes both goals              of cost effective water quality treatment and mosquito control.             Return to Top                         Mosquito Monitoring  in Treatment Wetlands               Recommendations            The following recommendations are made for dip sampling:                              A single method should be used to collect larvae and                   differences in technique should be minimized among persons collecting                   samples.  Collins and Resh (1989) **  described                   two dipping techniques: a quick dipping technique that is adequate                   for most mosquitoes and can be used when emergent vegetation is                   present, and a slow dipping technique that works best when sampling                   anopheline larvae in comparatively open water situations.                     A third technique described by Knight (1964) ** ,                   the draining-dripping method, was effective for extracting  Culex                    larvae associated with the  Typha  root masses ** .                    Although named differently, these three techniques (simple scoop,                   shallow skim, and flow-in methods, respectively) and four additional                   dipping methods were described in O'Malley (1995) ** .                    Given that the effectiveness of the different dipping method among                   field personnel is important.  Occasional comparisons should                   be made among the field personnel to calibrate their techniques.         The easiest way to standardize collection technique is to have the                   same person(s) collect samples.                 Permanent field stations should be established after                   the wetland is stratified into ecological regions (e.g., vegetation                   type, gradient in water chemistry).  Sampling should be focused                   in areas that are likely to produce mosquitoes.  Within each                   stratum, replicate samples can be taken at predetermined spatial                   intervals (e.g., after every 5 steps a sample is taken).  Often                   taking a group of samples within a 2-5 m region, combining and concentrating                   the samples using a screened (concentrator) cup and then preserving                   the samples with ethanol works well.                 Samples should be taken at temporal intervals that                   are at least once during the average development time (i.e., time                   required to develop from first instar to adult) for the mosquito                   of concern.  Because control measures against the immature                   stages usually are more efficacious and cost-effective than is attempting                   to control adults that are dispersing, the sampling interval needs                   to be less than the standard generation time (i.e., egg to egg),                   particularly if diapause occurs in the egg stage.  This requires                   that samples are taken weekly during periods of high environmental                   temperatures and perhaps more frequently (i) to determine the efficacy                   of control measures (e.g., pretreatment, 2-3 days after treatment,                   and then weekly until the next treatment is needed) and (ii) for                   floodwater mosquitoes that have a very rapid immature development.                          Conclusion            Every sampling method has its biases and limitations.               As Bidlingmayer (1967) **  stated in the preface to              his classic report on a comparison of trapping methods, ""An understanding              of the limitations of each method is essential to the interpretation              of the sampling data.  Only then can sampling be used effectively              to conduct mosquito surveys, evaluate population changes and determine              specific behavior.""  The best way to achieve this object is              to compare the results of various sampling techniques under a wide range              of environmental conditions, and to use multiple sampling techniques              whenever possible.  Southwood (1978) **  and Service(1993) **               provide detailed descriptions of sampling most insects and mosquitoes,              respectively, and the reader is referred to these texts for further              discussion of the methods outlined above.

As part of the State's water      quality management program, this report is focused on agency water monitoring      efforts to address key issues identified by the US Environmental Protection      Agency's monitoring strategy guidance (US Environmental Protection Agency,      1984). The existing, overlapping monitoring framework of unique and common      goals, media, observation scales, field and laboratory methods, data management,      analyses, evaluation, and shared uses of information are described herein.      Other aspects of the State's water quality management programs include the      State's Continuing Planning Process for water quality management (MD Dept.

Natural Resources, 1999b) and biennial Section 305(b) reports      (MD Dept. Natural Resources, 1999a).     This report meets two specific goals: (1) to update the State's      existing monitoring strategy as a requirement of the US Environmental Protection      Agency's regulations addressing water management plans (Section 106(e) of      the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1256(e)) prohibits the Administrator from making      Section 106 grants to any state that has not provided or is not carrying out      a water quality monitoring program for use in compiling the 305(b) report)      and (2) provide a baseline for an expanded Statewide water monitoring strategy      that is being developed with assistance from the Maryland Water Monitoring      Council. It is expected that this Statewide strategy will be an evolving document      that will report on water monitoring efforts and identify specific processes      to coordinate these efforts and integrate information. This enhanced strategy      will define the framework of a distributed, but integrated and coordinated      water monitoring effort in Maryland by federal, interstate and local government      agencies, quasi-governmental groups, citizens, private and public corporations,      and academia. It is expected that the first full report of this strategy will      be completed in 2001.                                              ACKNOWLEDGMENTS          This monitoring strategy report was developed with assistance      of staff from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources' Resource Assessment      Service and Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service and the Maryland Department      of the Environment's Technical and Regulatory Services and Water Management      Administrations. Comments received from citizen monitoring groups and members      of the Maryland Water Monitoring Council, its standing committees and the      ad hoc Programmatic Coordination Committee are greatly appreciated.

Ken Medearis , Montgomery County/DEP       9:45-10:00                        ABSTRACT:     In June 2002, the        Maryland Water Monitoring Council sponsored a workshop on Long-Term Ground        Water Monitoring in Maryland. As a result of this meeting, a workgroup was        formed to evaluate the long-term ground-water monitoring network in Maryland.        The workgroup consists of members from local, State, and Federal agencies        that perform ground-water level monitoring programs and projects. The primary        goals of the workgroup are to evaluate existing sources of ground-water        level data and make recommendations for enhancing or optimizing the ground-water        level monitoring networks to evaluate effects of climatic variations, ground-water        withdrawals, and other impacts on ground-water levels.                                            State of the Bay: Where Have We Been, Where Are We Going?   Rob        Magnien , MD DNR/Tidewater Ecosystem Assessment       10:00-10:30                        ABSTRACT:     Maryland’s Chesapeake        Bay Monitoring Program was launched in 1984 and has been providing information        to guide the Bay’s restoration ever since, particularly for nutrient        and sediment pollution that continues to be the Bay’s foremost threat        to living resource habitats. Findings to date show significant declines        in nutrient concentrations, particularly in areas dominated by wastewater        treatment plants where nutrient discharges have been significantly reduced,        but habitat conditions remain largely unchanged in most areas. In recent        years, additional efforts have been made to link monitoring information        with watershed conditions in each major basin to provide better guidance        for management. Reporting has become more “diagnostic”, revealing        the causes of problems so that management solutions are more apparent. New        technologies for measurement and data analysis are providing much more comprehensive        spatial and temporal coverage than was possible in the past, allowing important        connections to be made with living resources, particularly in shallow-water        habitats. New technologies are also providing opportunities to connect interested        citizens, students, researchers and managers with near real-time monitoring        information, raising awareness and hopefully support for the difficult choices        that will be needed to restore the Bay.                                   Maryland        Biological Stream Survey: An update on the status, trends, and other findings        about Maryland’s watersheds and how they affect the Bay .          Paul Kazyak , MD DNR/Monitoring and Non-tidal Assessment        11:00-11:30                        ABSTRACT:     The Maryland Biological        Stream Survey (MBSS) has been monitoring the non-tidal streams of Maryland        since 1993. A stratified random survey design was used and nearly 2000 sites        have now been sampled for physical habitat, water chemistry, and biota.        The survey results have provided information to assess status and trends,        identify outstanding and degraded waters, identify stressors and stressed        areas, establish a biological inventory of stream biota, and document the        response of the stream network to collective management activities such        as watershed restoration and TMDL implementation. Results to date indicate        that nearly one half of the stream miles in the state are in poor condition.        Major causes of degradation are altered hydrology from impervious surfaces,        acid precipitation, eutrophication from agricultural activities, a scarcity        of wood and stream-side trees from historical forestry practices and land        clearing, and excessive silt from bank erosion and surface runoff. The linkage        between the stream network and the Chesapeake Bay and its major tributaries        is clear. However, factors such as distance from the Bay and tidal mixing        seem to obscure these relationships.                Breakout Sessions A        and B                              Breakout Session A , in Bridge Room 1:30-3:00                 Nutrients: From Watershed to Tidal Water          Reducing nutrient pollution in tidal waters remains one of the central          challenges in restoring bay and coastal waters along the mid-Atlantic          coast. As the watershed is deforested and developed, the discharge of          nutrients from streams and overland flows has generally increased. However,          predicting nutrient discharges from watersheds is complicated by temporal          variation in rainfall and the wide range of land uses. There is also an          information gap for the transition zone between non-tidal and tidal waters.          In this session trends and effects of nutrient pollution will be reviewed          and the challenges to connecting tidal nutrient concentrations to watershed          discharges will be discussed.

Brakebill 1           ( 1 U.S. Geological Survey, Baltimore, MD;  2 USGS, Annapolis,        MD;  3 New Cumberland, PA  swphilli@usgs.gov )              Breakout Session A                        ABSTRACT:     In 1987, the Chesapeake        Bay Program (CBP) began an effort to reduce nutrient loads to improve dissolved        oxygen levels to support living resources in the Bay. In 2000, the Chesapeake        Bay was listed as an impaired water body under the Clean Water Act; as a        result, the CBP is developing standards for dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll,        and water clarity. In the Chesapeake 2000 Agreement, the CBP committed to        correct the nutrient and sediment-related problems in the Bay and its tidal        tributaries to remove them from the impaired waters list. Information is        needed by the jurisdictions in the Bay watershed to revise strategies to        reduce nutrients and sediment and assess whether additional nutrient and        sediment reductions are needed to meet water-quality standards by 2010.               The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation        with several agencies, has developed techniques to assess trends in load,        streamflow, and concentrations at stations in the nontidal parts of the        watershed and is conducting an analysis of the factors affecting nutrient        trends in major rivers of the watershed. The analysis revealed there was        not a significant decrease in the load of nitrogen and phosphorus at many        of the monitoring stations. The primary factors affecting the trends in        load were changes in streamflow, nutrient sources, and influence of watershed        characteristics (including in-stream biogeochemical transformations and        the influence of ground water). Further investigation indicated that the        primary nutrient sources (fertilizer and manure) were not being significantly        reduced and there was an increase in nutrients from urban sources in the        Bay watershed.                                     Effects        Of Land Use And Land Use Change On Nutrient Discharges From The Patuxent        River Watershed.

( 1 Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, Edgewater, Maryland;         2 University of North Carolina, Greensboro, North Carolina.  wellerd@ic.si.edu )              Breakout Session A                        ABSTRACT:     We explored the effects        of land use and land use change on water and nutrient discharges from the        Patuxent River watershed, a 2400 km 2  tributary basin of the Chesapeake        Bay. We related two years (one wet year and one drought year) of measured        discharge data from 22 small (0.06-230 km 2 ) watersheds to land        cover and physiographic province. Nitrogen (N) discharges increased with        the proportion of cropland in a watershed, and the rate of increase with        cropland proportion was higher in the Piedmont than in the Coastal Plain        physiographic province. Compared to N discharges, phosphorus (P) discharges        were less strongly related to geographic factors and more strongly driven        by temporal variations in stream flow. Compared to cropland, developed land        had weaker but still significant effects on N and P discharges, and the        effects again differed between physiographic provinces. We developed a set        of statistical models incorporating the effects of geographic and temporal        variability, and then we applied the models to predict the effects of land        use change on nutrient discharges. Land use transitions involving the gain        or loss of cropland had a much stronger effect on nitrogen, phosphorus,        and silicate discharges than gains or losses of developed land. The effects        of land use change and the differences between physiographic provinces were        stronger in the wet year than in the dry year. We also contrasted nonpoint        to point and atmospheric nutrient sources. In the wet year, non-point sources        dominated the delivery of all forms of N and P. In the dry year, point sources        dominated nitrate and total N delivery and direct atmospheric deposition        dominated ammonium delivery. Currently, cropland is the most important non-point        source of N and P, although cropland covers only 10% of the watershed and        developed land covers 12% of the watershed. Our results suggest that the        Chesapeake Bay Program watershed model may underestimate the importance        of agricultural land and overestimate the importance of developed land as        non-point sources of N and P.                                 Nutrient        Conditions In Tidal Waters And Biological Responses, A Case Study .

These data have been used to assess the large scale, status and trends of        the measured water quality parameters, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, chlorophyll        a, and dissolved oxygen. In some cases, managers have effectively used these        data to assess the success of management strategies initiated to curb the        effects of anthropogenic driven nutrient enrichment. For example, data from        the bay show that phosphorus reductions have been realized in response to        the Phosphorus Detergent Bans of the late 1980s. In other cases, however,        reductions in nutrient loadings have not been realized as reductions in        nutrient concentrations.        Recently, new        technologies for spatially and temporally intensive monitoring have become        available that allow researchers and managers to understand nutrient and        water quality dynamics on a finer scale. These data are useful in identifying        the spatial and temporal extent of habitat disruptions in the systems sampled.        In the last two years, this technology has been used to assess water quality        and habitat conditions in several tributaries. With these data, managers        have been able to show the extent of spatial and temporal variation in the        watershed.       The fish communities in these        small systems have been consistently sampled. Comparisons of historical        data to present data show that the fish community has been impacted over        the last thirty years. Present survey data show an absence of several anadromous        fish species that historically used these areas for spawning and juvenile        habitat. One species, yellow perch have shown a dramatic decline, and no        longer support a fishery. Recent work has focused on identifying the cause        of this decline.       In our talk, we will        show examples of both the large scale and small scale data in a western        shore tributary, with emphasis on the utility and shortcomings of these        data for linking management actions to nutrient conditions and for linking        habitat condition to living resources.

Their effects may be immediate or displaced downstream,          depending upon water chemistry and transport characteristics. In this          session we will explore what monitoring and modeling has revealed about          selected toxic contaminant transport, fate and effects in the Chesapeake          Bay and its watershed in Maryland.                 (Organized by Paul Miller, MD DNR/Monitoring          and Non-tidal Assessment, Tel: 410-260-8616,  pmiller@dnr.state.md.us )                            Methylmercury        in Largemouth Bass ( Micropterus salmoides ) in Maryland Reservoirs        and Factors Influencing Uptake.          Auja Sveinsdottir , University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science/CBL             Breakout Session B                          ABSTRACT:     Methylmercury          (MeHg) concentrations were measured in 249 largemouth bass ( Micropterus          salmoides ) from 20 Maryland reservoirs. Results demonstrate a strong          relationship between MeHg body burden in largemouth bass and its weight,          supporting the notion that MeHg accumulates in fish as it grows.                Variability in the rate of bioaccumulation          of MeHg in the largemouth bass from the 20 reservoirs suggest that there          might be other factors including the fish size that influence the bioaccumulation          of MeHg.                Total mercury (HgT) and MeHg concentrations          in reservoir water were measured in addition to various chemical parameters.          Results from multiple regression analysis showed that MeHg concentrations          in the dissolved fraction of the water were found to strongly correlate          with MeHg concentrations in the largemouth bass. Furthermore, chloride          concentrations in the reservoirs correlated strongly with MeHg concentrations          in the largemouth bass, indicating that MeHg uptake from the water into          biota low in the food web can be translated into organisms higher in the          food web, and that MeHg-chloride complexes have higher affinity of crossing          biological membranes via passive diffusion than MeHg–hydroxide species          as predicted by Mason et  al .

Hydrophobic        organic contaminants (HOCs) such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)        and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are particle-reactive; their partitioning        into particles controls the transport and retention in estuaries. HOCs in        urbanized estuaries come from a variety of sources, including industrial        and agricultural activities, municipal effluents, atmospheric deposition        and tributaries within the basin. During the last decade, we have investigated        the distribution and movement of particle-associated HOCs in the urbanized        Baltimore Harbor subestuary. The magnitude and relative abundances of HOCs        are distinct in different types of particles and in specific areas of the        estuary. The spatial and temporal variation of particle characteristics        is reflected in the HOC distribution, sources and transport. The HOC partition        coefficients (i.e. Kp = Cp/Cd) of 136 water samples from 22 sites in Baltimore        Harbor estuary were calculated and related to the ambient particle characteristics        including total suspended particle concentrations, total particulate carbons,        and C/N ratios. Additionally, the intensive samples were analyzed and calculated        for HOC partition every nine days from Baltimore waters (Key Bridge) from        1997 to 1998. Statistical comparisons of the concentrations, proportions,        and specific patterns of HOC are related to various particle characteristics        by using regression analysis and principle component analysis to determine        their impact on contaminant mass budgets in the northern Chesapeake Bay.                                 Assessment        And Risks Associated With Consumption Of Toxics-contaminated Finfish/shellfish        Residing In Maryland Waters.     Beaman J.R , Ecotoxicology        & Standards Section, Environmental Health & Risk Assessment Program,        Technical and Regulatory Services Administration, Maryland Department of        the Environment, Baltimore MD       Concurrent Session C                        ABSTRACT:     The Maryland Department        of the Environment has the responsibility to protect its citizens from harm        due to exposure to environmental contaminants. One potential exposure pathway        is the ingestion of fish tissue in which environmental contaminants have        accumulated. The Department maintains a fish-tissue sampling network throughout        the State and regularly collects and analyzes tissues from a variety of        fish and shellfish. If the contaminant concentration exceeds the human health        risk-based value for that particular contaminant, an advisory was issued        for that location.              The advisory specifies the fish specie(s),        advisory location, chemical(s) of concern, and guidance on consumption for        “at-risk” populations. The values are derived from human health-based        risk assessments for each contaminant. An acceptable risk level of 10-5        was used for both carcinogenic (e.g., PCBs) and non-carcinogenic (e.g.,        mercury) risk evaluations. Only data derived from the analysis of fish fillet(s)        were used, since this tissue is directly applicable as an exposure source.        Finfish fillet analyses from 6 game species and 5 accumulator (benthic-associated)        species indicated that for data collected between 1995-2000, numerous basins        contained finfish with PBT concentrations exceeding the concentration thresholds        for both carcinogenic (PCBs, chlorinated pesticides) and non-carcinogenic        (mercury) risk in the State.        Elevated        levels of mercury were observed in piscivorous game fish inhabiting freshwater        impoundments, whereas elevated organics (PCBs and pesticides) were observed        consistently in accumulator and game species sampled in portions of Chesapeake        Bay tributaries. In some instances, fish were contaminated with more than        one carcinogen (chlordane, heptachlor epoxide, dieldrin and DDT) at levels        above the MDE-established risk-based concentration thresholds, although        PCBs were the primary contaminant of concern. Sampling and risk assessment        methodology, as well as communication, education, and outreach efforts and        strategies will be discussed.

The          development of an understanding of how sediment migrates through watersheds          is complicated by the broad range of factors affecting its supply and          transport.

The primary study area used by the BES is the Gwynns Falls        watershed (GFW), a tributary of the Patapsco draining portions of western        Baltimore City and County. Fluvial systems in the GFW have been impacted        by 50+ years of urbanization that has associated implications to riparian        resources in the basin and the tidal Patapsco River. In Maryland’s        Piedmont, contemporary riparian form and functions are also influenced by        a legacy of sediment accumulation. Large volumes of sediment were disrupted        and introduced to fluvial systems as a result of widespread forest clearance        and agricultural conversion spanning several hundred years. While a portion        of this sediment reached tidal regions and began impacting water commerce        as early as 300 years ago, a significant fraction remains in the watershed        in floodplain deposits. A careful examination of these deposits can provide        information that is useful for current watershed management efforts.                Ongoing research in the GFW uses a unique        tracer to examine the history of post-European settlement-sediment dynamics.        The Red Run watershed, a small basin draining into the Gwynns Falls, was        the location of chromite mining 1820-1880. This activity introduced sediments        enriched with trace metals to the fluvial system at roughly the same time        as the peak of agricultural activity. The approach being used for geomorphic        analysis of the fluvial system uses floodplain trace metal stratigraphies,        specifically chromium, and historical records of mining activity to determine        flood plain sedimentation rates. This technique allows dating of sediments        almost twice as old as radioisotopic techniques (e.g., 210Pb) in an oxidized        environment (precluding preservation of organic tracers). Sedimentation        data and implications to current basin management will be presented.                                  Identifying        Sources of Watershed Sediment to Chesapeake Bay.

Identifying watershed sources of fine-grained        sediment is essential to understanding and solving problems related to water        clarity, water quality, and physical disturbance that are associated with        suspended sediments. The U.S. Geological Survey is engaged in a 5-year study        to examine watershed sources of fine-grained (< 0.062 mm) sediment to        Chesapeake Bay.        The Pocomoke River Basin        on the Eastern Shore was selected as the first watershed where sediment        sources would be identified. Watershed sources in the Pocomoke River Basin        include upland land areas (land uses) and stream channel corridors (bed        and banks). Identifying sediment sources involves sampling suspended sediment        during runoff events and linking their chemical and mineralogical signatures        to potential sources. Signatures of the sediment used in this analysis include:        radionuclides (7Be, 137Cs, 210Pb), stable isotopes (13C, 15N), magnetic        susceptibility, total carbon nitrogen, phosphorous, and clay mineralogy.        Upland and channel corridor sediments are also sampled throughout the watershed        and analyzed for these constituents. Three runoff samples of suspended sediment        have been analyzed to date. Two of the three samples (both collected in        July and August 2001) show that the channel bed and ditch beds may have        been major sediment sources during these events. The third sample (collected        in March 2002), shows that agriculture may be a source of sediment for this        event. The results may indicate that sediment sources vary with seasons,        possibly due to extent of vegetative cover on agricultural fields, and different        rainfall and runoff patterns. An evaluation of sediment sources is also        planned for the Little Conestoga River in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania,        and a river yet to be determined in the Potomac River Basin. This will provide        an opportunity for a comparison of sediment source characteristics in different        land use and physiographic settings within the Chesapeake Bay watershed.                                 Sediment        Production in an Urbanizing Watershed .

Pizzuto, University of Delaware,        Department of Geology, 104 Penny Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA, Phone:(302)        831-6602, Email:  nicholas@udel.edu ,         http://www.geology.udel.edu/~nicholas       Breakout Session C                        ABSTRACT:     Between 1951 and 1996,        the percentage of the Good Hope tributary watershed covered with impervious        surfaces increased from 1.4% to 7.5%. Using surveyed cross-sections and        regression equations relating drainage basin area and imperviousness to        channel area, we estimate that the channel area increased by a factor of        1.7 during the same period. Bank angles are independent of land use or drainage        basin area, suggesting that the morphology of channel cross-sections has        remained constant from 1951-1996. Given the increase in channel area, and        knowledge of the channel morphology, we infer increases in width of 2.4        m and increases in depth of 0.4 m; both values represent increases of 40%.        We also infer changes in sediment production and storage related to channel        enlargement (exclusive of upland sediment yield, which we did not measure).        Enlargement of first-order streams tributary to the Good Hope tributary        supplied 3200 (+/- 1100) m 3  to the main channel, while enlargement        of the Good Hope tributary itself produced an additional 3200 (+/- 600)        m 3 . Sediment is stored on the valley flat that defines most of        the valley floor, and also in small lateral accretion floodplains that are        inset into the older floodplain deposits of the valley flat. Using dendrochronology        to estimate deposition rates on the valley flat, we determine that 4,000        (+/- 1900) m 3  was stored on the valley flat from 1951-1996. By        solving a mass balance equation, we estimate the sediment production associated        with channel enlargement from 1951-1996 to be 2,400 (+/- 2,200) m 3 ,        equivalent to 10.7 t/km 2 /yr. The output is composed of 20% gravel,        40 % sand, and 40% silt and clay. These results indicate that channel enlargement        in urbanizing Piedmont watersheds produces relatively little sediment compared        to many other geomorphic settings. Since 1997, the Montgomery County EPA        has monitored water quality at the mouth of one of the first-order tributaries        to the Good Hope. This data indicates that roughly 95.2 tonnes (37 m 3 )        of suspended solids are transported past the sampling station each year,        and that roughly 349.3 tonnes (135 m 3 ) of suspended material        was removed between April 1, 1997 and December 31, 2000. It is interesting        to note that our estimate is roughly two times as high as Milliman and Meade’s        (1983) estimate for mid-Atlantic watersheds. It is considerably lower than        the estimates made for other suburban and rural watersheds in the Southeastern        United States by Wolman and Schick (1967). It is, however, higher than their        estimates for the Helton Branch, a wooded watershed in Kentucky. Future        work will involve a search for historical data to validate our estimates        of channel enlargement. An assessment of the magnitude of the change in        channel area will be made by comparing photographs of streams from the Paint        Branch watershed taken in 1949 with recent images.

More recently        the group of bacteria known as enterococci have been enumerated since they        appear to be more closely associated with gastrointestinal illness in swimmers.        The Severn River Association has sponsored bacterial water quality monitoring        during the summer in tidal waters of the Severn River for twenty-seven years        and made the transition from coliforms to enterococci in 2001. Comparative        data were collected at five sites in the Magothy and Severn Rivers in 2001;        there was no clear correlation between counts of the two indices. Significantly        elevated counts of either microbial indicator after at least 0.5”        of rain provide evidence of the link between land use, storm water runoff        and water quality. A continuing problem in microbial monitoring is determining        the source of either one of these groups of bacteria, since they are found        in the feces of birds and mammals. Local government regulations call for        closing beaches to swimming only when the source of bacteria is determined        to be human, thus poor microbial water quality due to waterfowl contamination        or undetected human sources may persist without public notification. Sources        of fecal coliforms or enterococci in these subestuaries include boat heads,        failing septic systems, runoff from pet waste as well as ducks and geese.        The protocol established by the Severn River Assn. for monitoring bacterial        water quality will be presented.                                   Evaluation        of Indicators of Sewage Contamination in Urban-Impacted Streams.

Breakout Session D                        ABSTRACT:     Streams have been        monitored in the Baltimore region using several approaches for evidence        of contamination by sewage. Approaches include laboratory analysis for pathogens        and indicator organisms, laboratory analysis for chemical agents that are        associated with sewage, and measurement of physical parameters, such as        flow and temperature, that may indicate anthropogenic influent. Results        from the various approaches are compared for their efficacy in identifying        contamination, including relative costs. Field observations and locations        of known sources of contamination are used to verify results from indicator        monitoring.                                 Bacteria        Monitoring to Support the Development of TMDLs.

Of these, there are 30 8-digit watersheds with a Use I designations        and 34 waterbodies with a Use II shellfish waters designation. These impairments        will need to be addressed in a reasonable time frame through the establishment        of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL). Recently, Maryland Department of the        Environment (MDE) has pursued an initiative to develop a bacteria monitoring        plan that will address these listed water bodies. A strategic monitoring        plan has been developed to address almost all of the Use I waters while        additional monitoring and analysis techniques will be applied to supplement        existing monitoring data from Use II waters.               Maryland’s proposed monitoring plan is based on TMDL work performed        by nearby states and incorporates lessons learned by other states when addressing        bacteria TMDLs. The current plan, for Use I bacteria impairments, addresses        8-digit watersheds by including between one and 10 stations per watershed        to address the spatial distribution of loadings. Samples will be collected        and laboratory analysis will include enumeration of E. coli or enterococci        to compare the results with Maryland’s proposed bacteriological water        quality criteria. EPA’s 1986 ambient water quality criteria for bacteria        will be adopted by Maryland in 2003 as part of the triennial review process        and will be used to evaluate bacteriological water quality for Use I waters        and establish TMDLs for bacteria impaired waters. For shellfish water impairments        (areas restricted to harvesting), MDE will use current routine monitoring        stations to address Use II waters on Maryland’s 303(d) list. Additional        laboratory analysis will include the Antibiotic Resistance Analysis method        of Bacteria Source Tracking (BST) to assist in identifying probable sources        of bacteria.                                     For further information,        click on a link below:                Program       Poster Session Abstracts                 updated     11/22/02               |  Return to      previous page  |  Go to      the MWMC Home Page  |  Next      Page"

Jen Abdella, Research Coordinator, St. Mary's River Project, 18952 East        Fisher Rd., St. Mary's City, MD 20686, (240) 895-4361,  jaabdella@smcm.edu                        ABSTRACT:      The St. Mary's River        Project (SMRP) has studied the health of the St. Mary's River, Maryland        since 1999. SMRP measures water quality data at twelve sites in the tidal        St. Mary's River, a small estuary draining approximately 70 square miles        on the Chesapeake Bay's western shore. Prior to the establishment of SMRP,        little data existed for the St. Mary's River. Instead, regional trends in        water quality were extrapolated from Lower Potomac River observations made        by the Maryland DNR. Based on records from four summers (1999-2002), this        presentation addresses two aspects of the study. First, it examines the        suitability of data from large rivers such as the Potomac for describing        water quality in small watersheds such as St. Mary’s. Second, we explore        the relationship between annual variation in rainfall and water quality        in the each of the rivers with emphasis on habitat standards for submerged        aquatic vegetation (SAV).                                  Nitrate        Removal in a First-Order Riparian Ecosystem: Processes and Effectiveness.        Jonathan T. Angier and Gregory W. McCarty, USDA/ARS-ANRI, Environmental        Quality Laboratory                        ABSTRACT:      Riparian ecosystems        can serve as buffer zones between agricultural and urban contaminant sources        and coastal oceans and embayments. However, the overall remediation capabilities        of these systems have not been adequately evaluated. The removal of contaminants        transmitted to riparian zones through groundwater is particularly difficult        to assess. Nitrate is one of the most common groundwater contaminants, and        can be removed within a riparian system in several ways. Various mechanisms        for nitrate removal have been examined in this study, in an effort to identify        the predominant remediation processes, the relative importance of each,        and how these processes interact in a natural environment. Vegetative uptake        of nutrients, denitrification within wetland soils, and in-stream contaminant        processing were evaluated. The study site consists of a first-order riparian        zone in an agricultural watershed in Beltsville, Maryland. The site is instrumented        with 5 stream sampling/monitoring stations, 160 piezometers, and 2 transects        of trees (9 trees total) fitted with sap flow sensors. The small size and        relative segregation of the site, and extensive instrumentation, allow for        accurate measurements and analyses of processes within the riparian wetland.        We have found that nitrate mitigation is highly variable (spatially and        temporally) in this ecosystem, and that many processes are closely linked,        affecting the overall remediation capacity of the system.                                    Identifying        sediment sources in the Chesapeake Bay: A paleoecological approach.        Angela M. Arnold ( arnold@jhu.edu ), Grace        S. Brush, Johns Hopkins University, Department of Geography and Environmental        Engineering                         ABSTRACT:      Aquatic and terrestrial        interactions are closely linked within the Chesapeake watershed causing        terrestrial alterations to have a large impact on sediment and nutrient        inputs to the estuary. Paleoecological methods were used to evaluate the        degree and nature of this impact to the estuary over its development. Two        long sediment cores collected from the mesohaline section of the Bay were        dated using carbon-14, lead-210, and pollen. The shorter core taken at the        mouth of the Chester River spans 1000 years. The longer core from the central        Bay reaches 50,000 year old glacial sediments deposited when the Bay was        a fresher system. Sedimentation rates are evaluated as well as organic carbon        and nitrogen stable isotopic ratios, organic carbon, total nitrogen, total        phosphorus, and sulfur. Sources of organic matter have relatively distinct        carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures that permit the sources contributing        sediment to the estuary to be identified. Average sedimentation rates have        doubled since European settlement at the Chester River site (from 3.6 to        7.5 mm/yr) while almost tripling in the mid-Bay core (from 0.4 to 1.14 mm/yr).        Preliminary results suggest that increased primary production, fueled by        eutrophication, has had a large impact on inputs to the sediment during        the past three centuries. This is evident from both δ 13 org-C,        δ 15 N, diatom assemblages, and nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations.        There is not strong evidence for increased terrestrial organic carbon inputs        since European settlement. Pre-Holocene sediments of the mid-Bay core are        dominated by terrestrial organic matter.                                            A Framework to Assess Diverse Data in the Nontidal Potomac.        LeAnne Astin, Aquatic Ecologist, Interstate Commission on the Potomac River        Basin, 6110 Executive Blvd. Suite 300, Rockville, MD 20852, (301)984-1908        ext. 108,  lastin@icprb.org                        ABSTRACT:      Merging data collected        with different field and enumeration methods is not usually advisable. However,        information from diverse sources can be combined into an analysis framework        suitable for bioassessment, if the synthesis is done with care. The Interstate        Commission on the Potomac River Basin (ICPRB) is developing an framework        to merge monitoring data collected by the Basin states (MD, PA, VA, WV)        and assess the health of stream biota in a consistent, basin-wide manner.        Objectives include: 1) develop a database to integrate heterogenous data;        2) establish abiotic consistent criteria to identify reference and impaired        sites; 3) select biological metrics that best discriminate reference sites        from impaired sites; 4) evaluate the validity of aggregating data across        geophysical regions; and 5) combine core metrics into an index characterizing        stream conditions in the nontidal Potomac watershed. Bioassessment data        from 1994-2001 were combined within a Microsoft Access database. Abiotic        criteria were established using shared elements from states’ habitat        and water quality assessments. Forty-three candidate biological metrics        were evaluated for range, variability, discriminatory power, and redundancy.        Multiple site classes (Ecoregions, Primary Subwatersheds), ranking schemes        (quartiles, deciles), and metric redundancy thresholds (r>0.70, 0.75,        0.90) were evaluated in parallel scenarios. Results suggest that the Northern        Piedmont is sufficiently different from the ""mountain"" ecoregions        (Blue Ridge, Ridge & Valley, Central Appalachians) to justify the use        of a different suite of metrics for that ecoregion; and that while the same        metrics may be used for all the ""mountain"" ecoregions, they may        need to be scored differently in the individual regions.                                     Spatial        Distributions of Stream Flow and Nutrient Concentrations in Suburban Watersheds:        Implications for Managing Nutrient Loads in the Baltimore Metropolitan Region.        Larry Band, Neely Law, Steve Kenworthy (Univ. of North Carolina –Chapel        Hill, Baltimore Ecosystem Study), Christina Tague (San Diego State University,        Baltimore Ecosystem Study)                         ABSTRACT:      The objective of        this project is to understand how land use and suburban infrastructure influence        nutrient delivery to receiving waters by documenting spatial and temporal        patterns of nitrate fluxes in suburban headwater streams. As part of the        Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES), we have monitored patterns of stream flow        and nutrient concentrations in two small suburban watersheds in the Maryland        Piedmont. Monthly flow measurements and stream water samples have been collected        from a number of subcatchments within the upper Gwynns Fall basin at Glyndon,        MD and in the watershed of Baisman Run, near Cockeysville, MD. Sampling        began in July 2001 and continued through the severe hydrologic drought of        the summer of 2002.        Nitrate concentrations        and fluxes from residential subcatchments in both study watersheds were        higher than those from two small, forested subcatchments in Baisman Run.        These relatively high nitrate concentrations are probably due to anthropogenic        N additions in the form of fertilizer, septic system leachate (at Baisman        Run), and (at Glyndon) sanitary sewer leakage. Nitrate concentrations tend        to be highest in the smaller headwater tributaries and somewhat lower in        downstream reaches, reflecting either dilution effects or instream nitrogen        uptake and denitrification. These observations suggest that headwater tributaries        are important sources of nitrate in streamwater, and that riparian management        and restoration projects aimed at higher-order streams may have limited        impacts on nutrient loads if upstream sources are not also addressed.                                   Real-Time        Continuous Physical and Chemical Monitoring of Surface Waters.         Michael J. Brayton, Hydrologist, U.S. Geological Survey, MD-DE-DC District,        8987 Yellow Brick Road, Baltimore, MD 21237, (voice) 410-238-4315, (fax)        410-238-4210(  http://md.water.usgs.gov         )                         ABSTRACT:      Continuous physical        and chemical monitors have been installed at selected U.S. Geological Survey        stream gages in Maryland and adjacent states. Specific conductance and water        temperature are recorded at 15-minute intervals and are available on-line        for the Potomac River and three small tributaries draining urban, agricultural,        and forested watersheds. At Morgan Creek, a small stream draining an agricultural        watershed on the Delmarva Peninsula, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, and        selected nutrients are measured using a streamside field analyzer in addition        to in-stream probes that measure specific conductance and water temperature.        Unlike traditional auto-samplers, the field analyzer performs actual on-site        chemical analyses for dissolved, non-filtered nutrients including nitrate,        ammonia, and total reactive phosphate. A pumped sample from the stream is        measured hourly for physical parameters and analyzed every 6 hours for nutrients.        Sensor calibrations are automatically performed before each nutrient measurement        and twice daily for all physical parameters. Measurement and calibration        data are saved to a data-logger, which can be accessed remotely using a        modem. Nutrient concentrations from the analyzer are generally within 5        percent of concentrations reported in lab analyses of replicate samples.               Records of water quality and flow variability        over the scale of a single day or single storm event provide valuable insight        into hydrologic and hydrochemical processes in a watershed. Continuous measurements        can offer greater data resolution beyond what would be practical for a water-quality        technician in terms of both time and expense. However, these automated measurements        cannot replace technicians who must perform check measurements, comparative        sampling, and routine servicing of equipment as an integral component of        a good water-quality data collection program.                                   Is        the Grass Always Greener on the Other Side? Effects of Water Quality on        SAV Distributions in Calvert County Creeks.        Sarah Brownlee, 10th Grade, Calvert High School                            ABSTRACT:     Submerged aquatic        vegetation (SAVs) is an important part of the aquatic ecosystem. SAVs provide        habitat for young fish and crabs and provide food for waterfowl. Pollution,        especially excess sediments and nutrients, can harm SAVs. Sediments can        block out light necessary to the SAVs growth and survival. Excess nutrients        cause phytoplankton blooms and stimulate epiphyte (attached microscopic        plants) growth on the SAVs both of which block light from reaching the SAVs.        Previous studies showed that nitrogen was responsible for the decline of        SAVs in the saline portions of the Chesapeake Bay. This project was the        study of the effect of water quality in the Chesapeake Bay and the Patuxent        River on the SAVs in adjacent creek’s, especially the fresh and tidal-fresh        reaches of the creeks. Earlier observations indicated that the SAVs were        more abundant and diverse in the creeks draining to the Patuxent River than        to the Chesapeake Bay and that further downstream the SAVs were more fouled        with epiphytes in the creeks in both drainage areas. The hypothesis was        that water quality of the Patuxent River would be better than the water        quality of the Chesapeake Bay. Five creeks were studied. Three drained to        the Chesapeake Bay (only one had SAVs) and two drained to the Patuxent River.        The abundance and diversity of the SAVs in each creek was mapped. Existing        water quality data for the River, Bay and when available Creeks were used        to compare to SAVs distribution in the creeks. It was found that the creeks        on the Bay side had the least abundant and diverse SAVs and that SAVs extended        down the creek the least distance. It was also found that for all creeks        studied that the SAVs upstream were more abundant and had the least fouling        with epiphytes, while at their downstream extent they were sparse and heavily        fouled with epiphytes. Water quality for the Chesapeake Bay side was poorer        with higher concentrations of the nutrient phosphorus, higher total particulates        and higher concentrations of algae but nitrogen concentrations were better        with lower values on the bay side. There was also a significant correlation        between phosphorous and salinity. It was also found that nitrogen concentrations        were high and phosphorous concentrations were low upstream where the SAVs        were abundant and healthy. The data suggested that phosphorous, released        in the saline waters and moving in with the tides, was the limiting nutrient        for the freshwater epiphytes and phytoplankton and stimulated their growth.        This would have had a negative effect on SAVs, especially downstream, and        could explain the distributions of SAVs in the creeks. The conclusions reached        here agree with the SAV studies on the saline portions of the Chesapeake        Bay in that excess nutrients could explain the decline in SAVs. The major        difference is that for the freshwater species, phosphorous is assumed to        be the main factor causing the decline of SAVs rather than nitrogen as was        found for the saline species. This would support the theory that, in general,        phosphorous is limiting in freshwater systems while nitrogen is limiting        in estuarine and marine ecosystems.                                   Water          Quality Assessment of the Piney Creek Reservoir.          Mark S. Castro, Appalachian Laboratory, University of Maryland Center          for Environmental Science, Frostburg, Maryland 21532 , Patrick DiNicola,          Maryland Department of the Environment, Baltimore, Maryland 21224                        ABSTRACT:      The overall goal        of this study was to characterize the chemical and biological status of        the Piney Creek reservoir. This reservoir is an important drinking water        source and recreational fishery in western Maryland (Garrett County). We        measured numerous chemical and biological parameters in the reservoir and        tributaries that drain into the reservoir in 2000 and 2001. Some of the        major results that will be presented include: (1) the trophic state of the        reservoir, (2) phytoplankton community dynamics, (3) nitrogen and phosphorus        concentrations and ratios in the reservoir, (4) a comparison of the watershed        fluxes of nitrogen and phosphorus into the reservoir and (5) mercury concentrations        and dynamics in the reservoir, fish, and stream waters. Overall, our results        suggest that the Piney Creek reservoir has several water quality problems:        a trophic state indicative of a system on the verge of symptoms similar        to that of a eutrophic lake, elevated concentrations and elemental ratios        of nitrogen and phosphorus, harmful algal blooms, elevated sodium chloride        concentrations, and mercury contamination of fish. The Piney Creek tributary,        a stream that drains a large (1668 ha) watershed (55% forest and 38% cropland),        most of which is in Pennsylvania, is the dominant source of nitrogen and        phosphorus to the Piney Creek reservoir. This tributary accounted from 40%        and 50 to 63% of the total N and total P inputs to the Piney Creek reservoir,        respectively. Our results suggest that we need to implement a multi-state        watershed management plan to improve the water quality in the Piney Creek        reservoir.                                 Stream        Habitat Goals for Maryland's Tributary Strategies.        Christine Conn, Natural Resources Analyst, Watershed Management and Analysis        Division, Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Services, Maryland Department        of Natural Resources, (410) 260-8792,  cconn@dnr.state.md.us                               ABSTRACT:      The State of Maryland          is seeking partnerships with local governmental organizations and community          watershed organizations to develop locally derived stream assessment,          protection and restoration goals. Developing quantitative goals and creating          a project inventory database will support future implementation activities.          These local-scale goals supplement state-wide goals based on maintaining          or improving watershed-scale stream biological integrity. Efforts being          taken today will support the State's pledge to develop Chesapeake 2000          Stream Corridor Restoration Goals by 2004.                                    Study        of  Cryptosporidium  Occurrence In the Potomac River Basin.         Patrick DiNicola, Environmental Specialist, Maryland Department of the Environment,        Water Supply Program                         ABSTRACT:       Cryptosporidium        parvum  is a water-borne parasite that has been implicated in drinking        water outbreaks in areas of the United States. The Maryland Department of        the Environment (MDE) is close to completing a four-phase study to assess        selected sources, occurrence, concentrations, and mobility of  Cryptosporidium         in the Maryland portion of the Potomac River Basin upstream of the fall        line. This project was designed to assist the Water Supply Program in assessing        the susceptibility of drinking water sources to pathogens as mandated in        the 1996 Amendments of the Safe Drinking Water Act. The presence of wastewater        treatment discharges, combined sewer overflows, large numbers of livestock,        and increasing development in the basin has presented a need for evaluating        the occurrence of  Cryptosporidium  in downstream water intakes.               The purpose of the study was to better understand        sources and occurrence of  Cryptosporidium parvum  within the Potomac        River Basin. The main study objectives are listed below:                   Compare and select efficient field sampling and laboratory methods            that can produce a high recovery of  Cryptosporidium  oocysts            in water samples and determine their viability/infectivity.           Characterize the protozoan input from various types of wastewater            treatment plant discharges into the Potomac River and its tributaries.                     To examine the role of sedimentation on the removal of  Cryptosporidium             in the river system.           To characterize the degree of  Cryptosporidium  loading from            watersheds with different land use features, and to provide a profile            of oocyst concentration variability at drinking water intakes during            rainfall events.                      As the project nears completion, the data          generated thus far has shown that:           (1)  Cryptosporidium  oocysts are present and remain viable in          the Potomac River basin during base and storm flow conditions. (2) Wastewater          discharge is a significant source of loading, and may differ depending          on treatment. (3)  Cryptosporidium  oocysts, to some extent, behave          like sediment in the tributaries. (4) Different land uses contribute varying          amounts of  Cryptosporidium  concentrations into the system.                                      The        Severn River Watershed Study; Stream Assesment and Field Data Collection        Using GPS and Handheld data collectors.        Michael Pieper, PE, KCI Technologies, Inc., Environmental Planning / Water        Resources with CH2M Hill, wfrost@kci.com        Client: Anne Arundel County Department of Public Works                         ABSTRACT:      The 68 square mile        Severn River watershed includes tidal and non-tidal surface waters that        connect the land to the Chesapeake Bay. The estuarine portions of the River        are currently on the 303(d) list for nutrients, sediment and bacteria. In        addition, there are concerns about toxic metals in the sediment. Impacts        of urbanization and pollution from existing and future sources require watershed        management to improve water quality and aquatic habitat.       Anne        Arundel County is developing a Watershed Management Master Plan to address        these issues. The Plan will provide information on areas that require protection        or restoration. The study includes GIS updates, H/H and water quality modeling        and monitoring. Monitoring involves water quality, bioassessments and a        comprehensive stream survey which is the topic of this poster.       Scientists        conducted a stream survey to develop a complete catalog of infrastructure        and environmental features for 140 miles of streams in 70 subwatersheds.        To complete the task, teams used GPS, digital mapping and handheld collection        devices to collect spatially referenced data quickly and accurately. The        task included:                   verification of stream layer,            mapping streams by type,           Rosgen classification,            habitat assessments and cross sections and           features assessment (erosion points, buffer encroachments).                 The data collected will support water quality and flow modeling and to          prioritize areas for improvements.

As the amount of built environment around urban        areas has increased, impervious surface areas (ISA) produce a greater volume        and intensity of stream flow, as well as increased pollutant loads which        impact water quality, degrade stream health. Vegetation cover and trees        in riparian buffers can modify the impacts of ISA on water quality. We developed        high resolution maps of tree cover and impervious surfaces derived from        satellite imagery of Montgomery county Maryland and compared them to stream        health ratings across 246 small watersheds averaging 472 km2 in size. The        stream health ratings were developed by state and county experts using a        combination of physical measurements (e.g., dissolved oxygen) and biological        indicators (e.g., benthic macroinvertebrates). We used the maps of impervious        area, watershed and riparian zone stream buffer tree cover to predict, with        multivariate logistic regression, stream health rating. Impervious surface        area was found to be the primary predictor of stream health, followed by        tree cover in riparian buffers, and total tree cover within entire watersheds.        The spatial configuration of these landscape elements influences the strength        of the predictions, leading us to develop a set of landscape metrics to        assess buffer effectiveness. We report on both the capabilities and limitations        of high resolution satellite imagery for this application, and address some        of the considerations for extending these analyses to other areas.                                     Evolution        of a Rain Gauge Network for an Urban Long-Term Ecological Research Project.        Michael A. Hansen and Gary T. Fisher, U.S. Geological Survey, Baltimore,        Maryland                        ABSTRACT:      The Baltimore Ecosystem        Study began collection of hydrologic data in 1998 with the establishment        of stream-gauging stations and permanent ecology plots. Determination of        water flux also requires monitoring of inputs, and operation of a network        of rain gauges began in 1999 to support other water measurements. The network        has grown to include 11 recording rain gauges and covers more than 139 square        miles across the Baltimore metropolitan area. These include two gauges that        are part of the National Weather Service network, and nine gauges operated        by BES collaborators, including the U.S. Forest Service, Indiana University,        and the U.S. Geological Survey. At least four additional recording gauges        are planned. Operation of a network in an urban setting allows for routine        maintenance, frequent data acquisition, and timely repair of instruments--luxuries        that are usually not afforded to remote or large-scale networks. A quality-control        process has been developed to account for small-scale spatial and temporal        variability, and includes both automated and manual components. The poster        describes the network, includes flow charts for the quality-control process,        and presents several possibilities for future data analysis.                                            Stream Restoration Tracking and Assessment: Tracking Our Progress Towards        Cleaner Streams.

Until recently, however, little information existed on where these        projects fell or what benefits they may have had on the environment. Recognizing        this information gap, the Department of Natural Resources, using funding        from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), initiated        a project to collect information on stream related projects and begin assessing        their benefits on the environment. The project's scope required coordinating        collection of data among multiple local and state government agencies. Additionally,        developing the database required technical evaluation of state and local        data sources, identification of the elements currently being tracked, and        understanding of state and local stream restoration programs. Overall, there        were four main objectives in the NOAA grant:                   Identification of all tracking and assessment activities related to            the restoration of wetlands and riparian areas throughout the State.           Creating a statewide database of wetland and stream restoration projects.                     Developing a web-based interface to collect and display tracking data            for wetland, riparian buffer, and stream restoration projects.           Developing a framework for assessing the benefits of the restoration            activities.                 To meet these objectives, DNR partnered with MDE to develop a stream          restoration tracking database. In addition, a pilot effort was initiated          with Montgomery and Anne Arundel Counties to develop and implement stream          restoration tracking at a local level. Based on the statewide work, over          450 projects have entered into the database. Finally, research is being          conducted to begin estimating the effectiveness of current restoration          and best management practices to improve habitat and water quality.                                    Data          Elements for Reporting of Water Quality Results .

It is chartered under the National Water Quality Monitoring        Council, whose mission is to coordinate, and provide guidance on, implementation        of the voluntary, integrated, nationwide monitoring strategy. The Board        provides the framework and the forum for comparing, evaluating, and promoting        monitoring approaches that can be implemented in all appropriate water quality        monitoring programs.              Greater sharing of monitoring data among        different agencies, levels of governments and the private sector could reduce        the overall cost of monitoring and improve the overall efficiency of monitoring        programs. As a result, the Council developed a “core set” of        data elements for water quality monitoring reporting for chemical and microbiological        analytes, addressing the questions of “who, what, why, where, when        and how” associated with sample collection and analysis. Implementation        of these data elements would be voluntary. Council members will be reviewing        their programs for implementation opportunities and report back to the Council        on their progress in using them in their programs. The Council also encourages        other organizations - public and private - to use the set of data elements        to promote more efficient monitoring and sharing of results. Monitoring        organizations could report on more data elements than those identified,        at their discretion, but are encouraged to at least report the core set        to encourage data sharing and more efficient use of water quality monitoring        data. The NWQMC will review the WQDE at least every 2 years and has adopted        a process for its future revision, as necessary, to keep them current.                                   The        National Environmental Methods Index as a Tool to Achieve Methods Comparability.

The Board        provides the framework and the forum for comparing, evaluating, and promoting        monitoring approaches that can be implemented in all appropriate water quality        monitoring programs.        The evaluation of        analytical methods is a critical component of the planning and review processes        for any environmental monitoring program. During program planning, monitoring        objectives determine the criteria for the monitoring program. Field procedures        and analytical methods are selected based upon these criteria, often in        conjunction with sampling designs. It is critical that each part of this        process supports the others; the limitations of analytic techniques can        often determine the precision and accuracy of the entire program. The Board        has developed a web-based database of environmental monitoring methods called        the National Environmental Methods Index (NEMI). NEMI contains peer-reviewed        chemical, biological, and radiochemical method summaries for regulatory        and non-regulatory water quality analyses. Summary tables are available        which allow the user to compare critical data on the sensitivity, accuracy,        precision, techniques, and relative cost for each method. Links are provided        to full methods available online. The user can search NEMI by:                   Chemical/microbiological analyte            Method ID           Method Source           Sample type           Instrumentation/technique                      By providing a summary of the procedures          and performance data needed to assess implementation requirements for          methods, NEMI is a powerful tool in the quest to work smarter and to be          more efficient. With NEMI you can compare methods at a glance and find          the method that best meets for your program-specific needs.                                        A Survey of Chesapeake Bay Watershed Residents: Knowledge, Attitudes and        Behaviors Towards Water Quality Issues.        Julie A. McClafferty, Human Dimensions Division Coordinator, Conservation        Management Institute, College of Nat. Resources, Virginia Polytechnic Institute        and State University, 203 W. Roanoke Street, Blacksburg, VA 24061-0534,        Ph: 540-231-7348, Fax: 540-231-7019, ( jmcclaff@vt.edu )                              ABSTRACT:      The Chesapeake Bay        watershed presents an especially complex challenge to natural resource managers        because its large geographic area embraces both a wide range of natural        resources and a large and growing population of diverse people with varied        (and ever changing) interests, goals, and backgrounds. Because the residents        of the watershed are intricately involved in the processes and events that        occur in the region, working with these people to restore the natural systems        is inevitable and essential. To this end, we conducted a telephone survey        of watershed residents. The survey of 1988 residents, performed in February        and March 2002, aimed to assess the current level of knowledge among watershed        residents, their attitudes towards water quality issues, and their level        of involvement in water quality related stewardship activities. It is clear        that residents are concerned with pollution in the waterways and believe        restoration of and protection for the water resources are important ventures.        However, this concern is not matched by comparable levels of individual        stewardship activity. People generally believe that one person can make        a difference, yet they do not understand that they can (or should) be that        one person. In order to reach the restoration goals of the Chesapeake Bay        Program, public agencies must take specific actions in raising the level        of resident involvement by helping residents to personalize and internalize        the pollution problem and its solutions. Agencies need to inform the public        of how their personal activities contribute to the pollution, what they        can do, and how their actions can make a difference in improving water quality.                                      Hydrologic        Drought in Maryland.

McPherson, Hydrologist,  wsmcpher@usgs.gov ,        U.S. Geological Survey, 8987 Yellow Brick Road, Baltimore, Maryland 21237,        410-238-4255 (phone), 410-238-4200 (fax)                        ABSTRACT:      The lack of rainfall          and recharge during the last year lead to record low ground water and          streamflow levels across Maryland. The Piedmont region of central Maryland          was hardest hit area within the state. In September 2002, seven of the          17 wells used to monitor water conditions and drought by the U.S. Geological          Survey reached the lowest levels ever recorded, exceeding the records          set in the 1960s. Streamflows in Maryland also reached record lows for          an extended period. For example, average streamflow at Deer Creek in Harford          County, Maryland was below normal during the entire 2002 water year and          new daily record lows were set for 206 days at Deer Creek.                Effects of the drought were felt across          Maryland, from the mountains to the beaches. Normal to above-normal rainfall          in September and October lead to normal streamflow across the state, yet          the response of ground water levels varied between the fractured rock          and the coastal plain aquifers. In coastal plain areas, ground water responded          quickly, yet wells in fractured rock aquifers in some areas little response.               The poster includes hydrographs from selected          wells and streamflow stations across Maryland that show where record lows          water levels were reached, how these water levels compare to those in          during the drought of 1999, and how the recent rainfall has affected water          levels.                                           Mercury in Largemouth Bass.

Muscle tissue concentrations in piscivorous fish may become high enough,        through the process of biomagnification, to be hazardous for sensitive members        of the human population. In the summer of 2000, Maryland DNR began sampling        largemouth bass (LMB) in Maryland's public access fishing areas large rivers        and reservoirs. Muscle tissue in 193 LMB representing 17 water bodies was        analyzed to determine methylmercury concentrations. Water column methylmercury        concentration was determined for each water body sampled. Fish tissue methylmercury        levels ranged from 20 ng/g to 2077 ng/g and averaged 301 ng/g. Fish tissue        mercury levels were highest in fish from reservoirs in western Maryland        and reservoirs in the coastal plain. Highest average tissue concentrations        were observed in Lake Lariat and Big Piney Reservoir in Frostburg. The highest        rates of accumulation (methylmercury/g of fish) occurred in Savage Reservoir        > Lake Lariat > Loch Raven. Water concentrations varied considerably        and were lower than the EPA criterion for wildlife (<1300 pg/L). The        bioconcentration factor for Liberty Reservoir was 1.45 x 10 6 .                                   A        Revised Physical Habitat Index for Maryland.        Michael J. Paul, James B.

Degradation of the physical habitat has serious consequences for        stream communities and is among the leading cause of stream mile impairment        nation-wide. An important component of any assessment program is, therefore,        a sound habitat assessment approach. We redesigned the physical habitat        index (PHI) for Maryland using a multimetric approach and assessed its ability        to discriminate reference and disturbed sites and to predict biological        condition. We classified streams into 3 ecoregions (coastal plain, piedmont,        and highland), and developed a PHI for each region. After correcting for        methodological differences and watershed area effects, we standardized individual        metric scores and assessed their ability to discriminate between reference        and degraded sites in each stream class. Reference and degraded criteria        were modified for each stream class to yield enough sites for statistical        analysis. Each multimetric PHI used a similar but slightly different set        of metrics. PHI discrimination efficiencies were 55% for piedmont streams,        and 84 and 89% for coastal plain and highlands streams, respectively. PHI        scores were significantly positively correlated with both benthic and fish        indexes of biotic integrity (IBI). These relationships varied across river        basins in the state. In multiple regression models, the PHI was the most        common, significant predictor of IBI scores. The revised PHI calculated        from this study provides a valuable physical habitat assessment tool that        clearly discriminates reference and degraded sites and is a significant        predictor of biological condition.                                            Using Brochures To Communicate Biomonitoring Results: A Quick Yet Informative        Way To Look At Your Watershed.

When field crews sample, landowners may ask how they can obtain        a copy of the sampling results for their property. Unfortunately, the reports        on this data are often long (with hundreds of pages in appendices alone),        hard for the public to understand, and difficult to access.               Prince George's and Howard counties are solving this problem by producing        a series of brochures with the results for each sampling year by watershed.        These easy to understand, easy to access brochures provide a fast, excellent        resource to teach the public about the watershed in which they live.                                   Biological        Association to Land Use in Howard County: Middle Patuxent River Watershed.

Howard County is assessing its watersheds        in a three-year, rotating basin biological monitoring and assessment program.        This poster reports on the second year of that program, and presents biological        assessment results from 30 sites. All of the sites sampled for benthic macroinvertebrates        received scores of “poor” or higher (on a scale of “very        poor” to “good”). None of the sites were rated in the        “very poor” category.        Associations        between biological condition and existing land use data, as taken from the        1997 Maryland Office of Planning dataset, were investigated. There is a        mixture of residential, agricultural, and forested land uses in this watershed        and relatively strong associations between higher biological scores (B-IBI)        and forested land use were found (r = 0.59). Biological scores also tended        to decrease as managed land uses (agriculture, residential, industrial)        increased (r = -0.60). Specific metrics also exhibited a response to land        use/land cover. As percent forest increases, so does the dominance of mayflies        (percent Ephemeroptera; r = 0.53), as well as the number of EPT taxa (r        = 0.42). Both of these metrics are generally considered responsive to pollution,        or stressed areas. Also, certain physical habitat measures reflected land        cover conversions, specifically, as managed land increased, the habitat        scores for stream channelization tended to decrease (r = -0.37). These results        suggest that the biological and physical habitat indicators used by Howard        County are effective in documenting in-stream effects of stressor sources.                                         United        States Water Quality Methods and Data Comparability Board: Creating a framework        for collaboration and comparability.

It is chartered under the National Water Quality Monitoring        Council, whose mission is to coordinate, and provide guidance on, implementation        of the voluntary, integrated, nationwide monitoring strategy. The Board        provides the framework and the forum for comparing, evaluating, and promoting        monitoring approaches that can be implemented in all appropriate water quality        monitoring programs. Each year, government agencies, industry, academic        researchers, and a wide variety of private organizations in the United States        devote enormous time and several billion dollars to the monitoring, protection,        and restoration of water resources and watersheds. Critical differences        in project design, methods, data analysis, and data management have often        made it difficult for monitoring information to be shared by other potential        data users. In the absence of a focused effort to ensure consistent and        comparable data, and a means to determine the utility of a data set for        a particular use, there is considerable redundancy and inefficiency in water        assessments.                                    A        Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) for the Moores Run Watershed in the        City of Baltimore.

Moores Run has a drainage area of 3,033        acres with approximately 2.6 miles of free flowing stream. The remainder        of Moores Run is routed through pipes as part of the storm water management        system. Moores Run is highly urbanized with the dominant land use characteristics        being industrial and medium to high-density residential areas. The watershed        restoration plan is based on the constraints inherent in urban watersheds        that are fully developed at the time of implementing restoration activities.        The plan identifies opportunities for urban watershed best management practices        (BMPs), reforestation, habitat creation, improved maintenance programs,        infrastructure improvements and stream channel restoration potential at        various locations throughout the watershed. The USEPA’s Storm Water        Management Model (SWMM) was used to model surface runoff, constituent buildup        and washoff, and conveyance. The SWMM model was calibrated using available        USGS gauging data and event mean concentration (EMC) data collected by the        City of Baltimore’s Storm Water Monitoring Program. The SWMM model        was then used to assess the relative efficiency of the proposed BMPs. Results        of the SWMM modeling have served as the motivation for a street sweeping        study in Hamilton watershed, and a wetland that will treat storm water runoff        to Moores Run.                                    Monitoring        aquatic habitat rehabilitation using a stream mapping technique.

Mapped        features can include the channel bottom sediment environment, bar locations,        bank conditions, streamside vegetation, and water depths at base flow. Mapping        techniques can be developed for use at different spatial scales and intensities        of data collection. Spatially accurate planform illustrations can simultaneously        provide information at scales of an entire reach or individual features.        Sequential mapping using structured and consistently applied protocols can        provide a method for the evaluation of physical changes at each of these        scales, thereby allowing for the evaluation of reach average conditions        or localized features over time. Such techniques have potential application        in stream monitoring projects that attempt to characterize and quantify        the effects of watershed perturbations, large flow events, or restoration        projects.        A stream mapping procedure        has been implemented in a 180m reach of German Branch, a tributary to the        Choptank River on Maryland’s Eastern Shore that was channelized over        60 years ago by the Civilian Conservation Corps. Mapping exercises are being        implemented to monitor the effects of a channel habitat rehabilitation project        that was implemented in 1997 to improve aquatic habitat conditions for finfish        by enhancing specific habitat elements that were not well represented in        the reach due to the past channelization activities. The rehabilitation        project primarily focused on increasing the presence of woody debris, the        development of pools, and increases in the heterogeneity of channel bottom        conditions through the placement of 9 log structures. Accordingly, the monitoring        approach was designed to document the effects of the structures by mapping        channel bottom sediments and water depths during base flow. The monitoring        project created a demand for the development of a structured approach for        the collection of spatially accurate data that offered a general picture        of the reach and a means of characterizing physical changes. Products from        this effort have provided a successful demonstration of how structured stream        mapping techniques can be used to document aquatic habitat conditions and        quantify the effects of construction activities, large flows, and artificial        structures on the bottom sediment environment.                                          State        and Local Assessments in Lower Monocacy Watershed, Frederick County, Maryland.

We are employing Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) and        Frederick County data to assess the Lower Monocacy Watershed and several        of its subwatersheds, particularly to evaluate impacts of urbanization in        this rapidly developing area. MBSS employs a probability-based sampling        design to assess streams statewide and within 8-digit watersheds such as        the Lower Monocacy. Under its NPDES stormwater program, Frederick County        Division of Public Works uses targeted sampling to monitor streams in priority        watersheds, assess trends in watershed condition over time, identify particular        problems, and seek opportunities for stream restoration and other water        quality improvements. Mean fish and benthic Index of Biotic Integrity scores        from MBSS 1996 and 2000 sampling rated the Lower Monocacy as poor to fair        in overall biological condition. Both agricultural and urban impacts were        noted. High nutrient concentrations, poor riparian buffers, and bank erosion        were observed at a number of MBSS sites. Recent Frederick County assessments        in three priority areas within the Lower Monocacy system (Lower Bush Creek,        Ballenger Creek, and Lower Linganore Creek watersheds) characterized site        conditions at targeted sites with MBSS methods plus additional geomorphic        evaluations. Selected fixed stations allow examination of year-to-year changes        in biota, physical habitat, and channel morphology. Supplemental land use        data and field inspections are used to characterize watershed conditions        and anthropogenic impacts to streams. Results from both programs have contributed        to County watershed management plans and ongoing efforts to identify restoration        and stormwater retrofit opportunities.                                    Little        Gunpowder Falls Watershed Water Quality Management Plan – Watershed        Assessment and Modeling.

The          Plan, prepared by Biohabitats, Inc., in cooperation with the Center for          Watershed Protection and Michael J. Baker, Jr., Inc., provided DEPRM with          a watershed restoration framework for its Capital Improvement Program          and fulfilled a requirement of the Baltimore County NPDES Municipal Stormwater          Discharge Permit.                This watershed is located along the eastern          edge of Baltimore County. The mainstem of Little Gunpowder Falls forms          the boundary between Baltimore County and Harford County, is a fourth-order          stream, and is approximately 23 miles in length. The entire watershed          area is 57.8 mi2, with 26.9 mi2 in Baltimore County. The current zoning          of predominantly agriculture and rural residential, combined with the          lack of water and sewer service, has allowed the watershed to maintain          its rural character. Within Baltimore County, the focus of the study,          existing land use is comprised of agriculture (44% of land use), forested          land (32%), residential development (21%), and commercial and industrial          development (1.1%).                The major components of the study and plan          include:                    Hydrologic and water quality modeling (EPA-SWMM) of existing and            future land use conditions;            Field screening level assessment of 162 miles of streams and a detailed            field assessment including fluvial geomorphology and riparian conditions            of 25 miles of selected stream channels;            Integration of findings from both the modeling and field assessment            on a subwatershed basis;            Water quality problems identified and ranked on a subwatershed basis            including stream channel and riparian conditions; and             Identification and prioritization of management strategies, action            items and restoration projects.                                                 For further information,        click on a link below:                Program       Abstracts         updated     11/22/02               |  Return to      previous page  |  Go to      the 8th Annual Conference Home Page  |  Go To the      MWMC Home Page  |"

This involves cleaning up problem areas at their source-- the tributaries--before they reach the bay. Through its targeted watershed project, Maryland is directing its attention to several small watersheds that have been degraded from urbanization or agriculture. These targeted watersheds are the focus of a pilot project demonstration of how state and local cooperation can have a positive impact.      Cleaning Up the Bay at its Source      Maryland's Targeted Watershed Project is attempting to improve water quality and habitat conditions in four relatively small watersheds through pollution control, monitoring, and restoration. Much of the monitoring of best management practice controls since 1990 has been funded by section 319 grants totaling approximately $264,000 from FY 1991 through 1994. Of that total, approximately $125,000 has been spent on the German Branch. While most efforts to clean up watersheds take as many as 20 years, water quality improvements for the German Branch tributary to the Chesapeake Bay have not taken long at all. The German Branch basin, located in Queen Anne County on Maryland's Eastern Shore, is a 12,000 acre sub-basin of the Choptank River. Used heavily for agriculture, the watershed suffers from excessive nutrient and sediment loads. The aim of the German Branch project--and the major target of the Chesapeake Bay program--is to reduce sediment and nutrient flow to the tidal river and into the Chesapeake Bay.      The German Branch has a substrate of mostly sandy soil in a clay base that traps water and results in perennially wet areas. Consequently, the region is replete with drainage ditches. These ditches accelerate drainage, moving water quickly off the land and into the streams. This means that best management practices could have a much more rapid effect on the quality of the water flowing from the basin into the Chesapeake Bay. Farmers in the German Branch basin were concerned about water quality. So when approached by the Queen Anne Soil Conservation District (SCD) to implement nutrient management practices, 93 percent of the farmers agreed. Under the program, an SCD nutrient management specialist works with farmers to develop a nutrient budget based on the existing level of nutrients in the soil and on crop needs. A nitrogen soil test, for example, helps determine if a second application of nitrogen is needed. In 1991 and 1992, nutrient management on 8,150 acres reduced the amount of nitrogen applied by 225,793 pounds, or an average of 27.7 pounds per acre. Nutrient management on 7,600 acres reduced the amount of phosphorous applied by 144,194 pounds, or an average of 19 pounds per acre.      A comprehensive monitoring program established by Maryland's Environment and Natural Resources departments and funded by section 319 measures the effects of the nutrient management and other water quality efforts in the German Branch and other targeted areas. This data will establish baseline water quality and biotic conditions, estimate pollutant loads, evaluate water quality trends over time, and detect any changes in biotic conditions. The Queen Anne Soil Conservation District and County Cooperative Extension Service are also taking the lead in information and education. The agencies sponsored field days for farmers to explain the benefits of nutrient and conservation planning. During the cropping season, farmers receive a newsletter discussing the results of weekly field surveys for insects and weeds and providing recommendations for treatment. After nearly three years, Maryland is beginning to see positive changes in the German Branch basin. Best management agricultural practices should result in further changes in the water quality within the next several years.                                                                            Water  |  Wetlands, Oceans & Watersheds  |  Watershed Protection                                                                            EPA Home  |      Privacy and     Security Notice  |                  Contact Us

Maryland's Tributary Strategies: Statewide Nutrient Reduction Through a Watershed Approach     Lauren Wenzel, Roger Banting, and Danielle Lucid   Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Annapolis, MD    Origins of the Program   Maryland's Tributary Strategies are a recent addition to the historic Chesapeake Bay Agreement, signed in 1987 to address the problem of overenrichment in the nation's largest and most productive estuary. In 1987, Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Chesapeake Bay Commission (the Executive Council of the Chesapeake Bay Program) formally agreed to work together to achieve a 40% reduction in nitrogen and phosphorus reaching the Bay by the year 2000 (using 1985 as a base year).   Extensive scientific studies had identified excess nutrients as the primary pollution problem in the Bay. High levels of nutrients cause excess algal growth, depleting dissolved oxygen in the water as it decomposes, and reducing the amount of habitat for animals. In addition, algal growth blocks the sunlight needed by beneficial bay grasses, which provide food and habitat to waterfowl, fish and crabs.  The 40% level was estimated by Bay scientists as the reduction necessary to significantly improve dissolved oxygen in the deep waters of the Bay, triggering a series of beneficial responses in habitat, and benefitting living resource populations.  In 1991, the Chesapeake Bay Program conducted a scientific re-evaluation to assess progress toward the 40% goal. It concluded that, although significant progress had been made through a ban on phosphorus in laundry detergent, and upgrades at wastewater treatment plants, more needed to be done to control nonpoint sources. As a result of this finding, in 1992, the Executive Council directed all the Bay partners to develop ""tributary strategies""_watershed-based plans to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus entering the Bay's rivers.  The Approach   In Maryland, the goal of the Tributary Strategies was to introduce a new working relationship between the federal, state and local governments, business, the agricultural community and citizens to improve water quality, and enhance habitat for living resources.  Just as the Chesapeake Bay Agreement is a model for interjurisdictional cooperation, the state recognized a need to extend this partnership to those responsible for making local land use decisions.  To initiate and manage this process, State agencies involved in natural resources management formed a steering committee on the Tributary Strategies. Comprised of staff from the Departments of Environment, Natural Resources, and Agriculture, the Office of Planning, the University of Maryland. and the Governor's Office, the committee worked to ensure a coordinated approach among all the agencies responsible for planning and implementing this complex program.  Because over 95% of Maryland's land area is in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, meeting the 40% goal demanded a comprehensive, statewide approach. In order to address regional land use and water quality issues as part of its nutrient reduction strategy, Maryland divided its Chesapeake Bay watershed into ten tributary basins. The state then conducted a two-year, three stage effort incorporating technical analysis, document production, and formal and informal meetings with local governments and the public meetings at every stage. During the first stage, each of the ten tributary basins was characterized in order to describe the pollutant loads, sources, and reduction goals; land uses; and the status of fish and wildlife populations.  The second stage involved assessing all of the options for nutrient reduction, such as biological nitrogen removal at wastewater treatment plants, erosion and sediment control on construction sites, agricultural nutrient management, and streamside forested buffers. For each option, information was gathered on costs, applicability and implementation considerations. The third stage involved setting numeric targets for implementing the most promising options identified in stage two, based on past levels of implementation, cost, acceptability, and comments from the public and local governments.  Moving Toward Implementation: The Tributary Teams   To help implement these Strategies,  ""Tributary Teams"" were formed in each of the ten watersheds. These teams are made up of representatives of state and local agencies, farmers, business, environmental organizations, federal facilities, and citizens. They meet monthly, providing local knowledge essential for implementing best management practices, and helping state and local governments target their programs to improve efficiency and participation.  The Teams were charged with:     Ensuring that implementation proceeds on schedule in a fair and flexible manner;  Coordinating participation among citizens, government agencies, and other interested parties; and  Promoting an understanding of Tributary Strategy goals and the actions needed to achieve them through public education.    Most Team members were selected from individuals who nominated themselves at the public meetings. However, additional Team members were recruited to ensure balanced representation of all stakeholder groups. In order to share the heavy workload involved in working closely with the Teams, different state agencies agreed to act as the lead for one to three Teams. The Lead State agency designates a staff person as a Team member, and represents all State agencies on the Team. In addition, two Team coordinators were hired to provide organizational and staff support for all ten Teams. Team lists were drafted by an ad hoc committee of local government and state agency staff. These lists were then sent to local elected officials for their review and comment, and finally to the Governor for formal appointment. The Teams were appointed by the Governor in August 1995. They first met in September 1995, and continue to meet monthly.   Progress To-Date   Progress on the ground. Maryland's Tributary Strategies lay out ten implementation plans that will be accomplished between 1994 and the year 2000, and builds on implementation efforts that began in 1985.   Significant progress has been achieved since the Strategies were initiated in Fall 1992, including the implementation of nutrient management plans on more than 735,000 acres of cropland. Also since Fall 1992, 18 municipalities have agreed to voluntarily begin biological nutrient removal (BNR) at their wastewater treatment plants. This represents a doubling of effort for the BNR program, and will prevent an additional 1.5 million pounds of nitrogen per year from entering the Bay.  Progress in the water. Improvements in water quality and living resources from efforts begun ten years ago illustrate the types of improvements we expect to see as the Tributary Strategies are fully implemented. Actions taken since 1985 are estimated to result in a 23% decrease in loads of controllable nitrogen and a 38% decrease in phosphorus reaching the Bay. This reduction in nutrient pollution has in turn contributed to a significant increase in the coverage of aquatic grasses.   Institutional progress.  State agencies initially encountered some suspicion and resistance from local governments and landowners who were concerned that this comprehensive, watershed-based approach might lead to additional state regulations. However, affected groups were brought into the process early, and had significant input into the Strategies that were ultimately developed.  Today, local governments have made a strong commitment to the Tributary Strategies. Given their important role in implementing many of the practices called for in the Strategies, this committment is a key sign of the Strategies success to-date. In 1993, the Governor and elected officials from each of Maryland's twenty-three counties signed a ""Partnership Agreement"" formally promising to work cooperatively to restore the Bay's tributaries.   Challenges Ahead   Adopting a watershed approach to nutrient reduction statewide is a complex endeavor; even more so when all of the key stakeholders are involved in decision making. The following challenges are among those that have emerged to date, and must be gradually resolved as the process continues.  Guiding the Process: Too much or too little?  State agencies aim to act as facilitators to the Teams, rather than directing them toward specific objectives or activities. However, particularly at the beginning of the process, many Team members felt the need for more direction, and were uncomfortable with a ""self-directed team"" approach. The lead state agency for each Team has had to balance providing sufficient guidance with allowing the Team to develop ownership of the process and begin making its own decisions.  Cultivating Team leaders. Having strong Team leaders is essential for moving the Teams toward action.  In order to get the Teams started, the State appointed Interim Chairs, with the specification that they would act as Chair for six months, until the Team chose to select a permanent Chair.  In addition, some Teams have benefitted from additional leadership by forming subcommitteees and selecting subcommittee Chairs to move the Team forward on particular issues.   Team Buy-In. Many team members were selected from among those who attended public meetings to discuss the Tributary Strategies as they were being developed. However, some team members were new to the process, and lacked both the technical background and the history associated with developing the Strategy for their Tributary. As a result, there have been many questions about the technical basis for the Strategies (e.g., the computer modeling that was used to set nutrient loads and reduction goals).  Most of the Teams have both members who want to spend more time understanding the problems and the proposed solutions, and those who are impatient to move toward action. Team members are being asked to help implement the Strategy. But first, all members need to understand and accept the Strategy.   Funding. The Strategies outline a package of best management practices that, when implemented, will lead to a 40% reduction in nutrients in each Tributary. Many of these practices are funded through existing programs, but will require additional funding for increased implementation. To address this need, the Governor appointed a Blue Ribbon Panel of experts from the disciplines of  finance, business, and government to identify new ways to finance environmental projects. While the Panel's report identifies dozens of new approaches, some of which are being further explored by State agencies, funding remains a persistent question that needs to be addressed by all parties.  Growth. The 40% reduction in nutrients is not only an ambitious goal, but is a cap. Under the 1987 Agreement, once nutrients are reduced to 60% of 1985 levels, they will not be allowed to increase.  With portions of the State developing rapidly, managing growth in ways that minimize its impacts on water quality will be a continuing challenge. Maryland has growth management legislation, but most land use decisions remain at the local government level, making local planning issues a key part of the Tributary Strategies.  Working with elected officials. In the current climate of budget cutting, environmental programs need to demonstrate their importance for quality of life, health, and economic vitality. Maryland is working to inform both state legislators as well as elected officials at the county and town level of the importance of watershed planning and water quality goals. A local government liaison works closely with both elected officials and staffs to provide information and act as a sounding board for local government concerns. With elected officials constantly turning over, this effort must be coordinated and continuous.  State goals v. Local goals. The Teams were created to help implement a goal that had been set by the Chesapeake Bay Program. This goal can be met statewide through a collection of practices implemented at the local level, which will also improve local water quality and habitat. Many of the practices recommended_such as creating forest buffers, improving stormwater management, and managing animal waste_clearly have both nutrient reduction benefits, and benefits for local water quality. However, several teams have identified a potential tension between local priorities (e.g., habitat restoration, and reservoir protection) and the State's focus on nutrient pollution, the primary problem in the estuary. This is currently being addressed by focusing on the many areas where State and local priorities overlap. Some teams may also choose to expand their mission to look at a broader set of goals than the current nutrient pollution focus.  Understanding the Team's role. Before the Teams were formed, State and local government staff working on their creation drafted a mission statement and guidance document outlining the Team's role in helping to implement the Strategies. In practice, however, the Team's role has been a learning process for all parties. The different levels of knowledge of the Strategies, as well as the broadness of the Team's mission have led to frustration within some groups. This can be compounded with confusion about the many existing programs that are working on aspects of the nutrient reduction problem. The Teams wonder_where do we fit in?   Currently, this issue is being addressed by focusing both on Team forming subgroups that allow the more activist members to begin examining issues and identifying actions, and allow those who want more familiarity with the Strategies to take time to review the progress made to-date.  Maintaining private sector involvement. The Teams were formed to represent all the major stakeholders in each Tributary, and to encourage creative, realistic solutions based on dialogue between different interest groups.  The agricultural community has been active in the formation of the Strategies from the beginning, in part because agriculture is a major source of nutrients to the Bay, and farmers have an interest in demonstrating the success of a nonregulatory approach. However, because there is no intention of producing additional legislation, the business community has been less involved in this process. It is hoped that as the Teams begin to organize local initiatives they will be able to involve more local businesses in specific ""hometown"" projects.  Building a watershed perspective. The Tributary basins are quite large, ranging from 269 to 2,043 square miles. Most Tributaries encompass parts of at least three counties, which, like most jurisdictions, are unaccustomed to implementing or planning on a watershed basis. The Teams provide a framework for coordination among counties, but it remains to be seen how much the watershed perspective will be integrated into day-to-day decisions.  Conclusion   Maryland's Tributary Teams have been meeting for less than one year, and are still in the beginning stages of their work. They are a key part of an approach that has never been tried before in Maryland_a long term watershed-based implementation effort that seeks to accomplish both Chesapeake Bay Program nutrient reduction goals and local water quality objectives.  It is not yet clear where the balance between a state-directed and a locally-driven approach will be struck. What is clear is that the Tributary Teams offer an opportunity to rethink traditional approaches toward improving water quality, and could greatly expand the constituency for watershed protection.

GX017-86-8437199	"BACKGROUND INFORMATION on  9/30/98 FISH LESIONS PRESS RELEASE     For More Information Contact:   Catherine Haecker  Public Outreach Manager, Biological Resources  703-648-4283          Fish Health, Fungal Infections, and  Pfiesteria : The Role of the U.S. Geological Survey       Problem           The increasing incidence of fish-health problems, ranging from small external sores and lesions to large-scale fish kills, is of growing concern in the Chesapeake Bay and other Mid-Atlantic estuaries. Fish kills have been reported in North Carolina since the early 1990's. Reports of skin lesions on fish in the summer and fall of 1996 and 1997 in the Pocomoke River, Maryland, and other tributaries of Chesapeake Bay stimulated a great deal of public and scientific interest. These skin lesions ranged from small pinpoint hemorrhages to abrasions to deep ulcers. In addition, there were two fish kills, involving primarily Atlantic menhaden, in the Pocomoke River during August 1997. The fish kills, as well as the variety of fish lesions, have been blamed on the presence of a toxic dinoflagellate,  Pfiesteria piscicida , or  Pfiesteria -like dinoflagellates.  Pfiesteria  occurrence has been attributed to nutrient enrichment, warm temperatures, moderate to high salinity, and fish excretions.         While  Pfiesteria  has been identified as a primary cause of fish kills in the Chesapeake Bay and other estuaries, there is growing evidence that other pathogens also are causing the fish lesions in the Bay. Skin lesions in fish can be caused by a variety of infectious and noninfectious insults.  Lesions commonly are caused by opportunistic pathogens, which infect weakened or stressed hosts. These pathogens, which include bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites, may gain entry because of impaired immune or disease resistance factors or because the natural defense mechanisms of the skin are impaired or breached.         Several State and Federal agencies, including the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), are currently working to understand the relation between  Pfiesteria  and other pathogens to fish and human health, and natural and man-induced factors (such as nutrients and sediment). This information will be used to help formulate management solutions to the problem.         USGS Investigations of Fish Lesions, Related Environmental Factors, and Nutrient Sources    In 1983, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency began the Chesapeake Bay Program with other Federal Agencies and several States to restore the ecosystem of the Bay and its watershed. The USGS has been an active partner since the formation of this program, and has provided scientific information on the relation between contaminant inputs (nutrient, sediment, and toxic) and the response of water quality and living resources. In 1996, the USGS Chesapeake Bay Ecosystem Program was initiated to provide scientific information to resource managers on the response of water quality and living resources to changes in nutrient sources.    As part of the ecosystem and other USGS Programs, the USGS Leetown Science Center in Leetown, West Virginia, and the Maryland Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit began investigations to determine factors contributing to fish lesions in selected tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. The work includes characterizing the type and cause of fish lesions and evaluating overall fish health using a variety of physiological, histological, and immunological techniques.    Additionally, researchers at Leetown work with other USGS scientists to document the potential linkages between the occurrence of lesions and water quality, land use, and nutrient sources and transport to the Bay.  Some of the locations of different components of USGS studies of fish health and nutrient source and transport are shown in  figure 1 .         The Cause of Fish Lesions: Fungal Infections or  Pfiesteria ?          The USGS and State partners collected menhaden from sites affected by fish kills and river closures from August through October 1997. Menhaden with lesions were also collected in the Wicomico and Pocomoke Rivers in August 1998 ( Fig. 1 ). Ninety-five percent of the menhaden with lesions collected in 1997 and 100 percent of the menhaden collected in 1998 had chronic sores caused by an invasive fungus ( Fig 2 ).         The microscopic appearance ( Fig 3 ) of the majority of these lesions is identical to those observed in other marine environments where a cutaneous ulcerative syndrome associated with an invasive fungus called  Aphanomyces  is the cause. Some of the other occurrences include ulcerative mycosis of menhaden from North Carolina rivers, red spot disease (RSD) in Australia,  epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS) of Asian fishes, and mycotic granulomatosis (MG) in Japan. Outbreaks of EUS and RSD have been correlated with rainfall-runoff events, warm water temperatures, and low dissolved oxygen levels (less than one milligram per liter).          Recent research indicates that the fungal infections seen in menhaden and other estuarine fish in North Carolina are secondary to exposure of the fish to toxins from  Pfiesteria  (Noga and others, 1996; Burkholder and Glasgow, 1997). But scientific evidence of a relation between these lesions and exposure to toxic dinoflagellates is lacking.  Laboratory exposures to  Pfiesteria  have not resulted in similar lesions.  Respiratory distress, neurological dysfunction, and a cloudiness of the skin with acute mortalities were reported in early laboratory studies (Smith and others, 1988; Noga and others, 1993). Microscopic study of skin shows swelling of cells and the death of skin cells, resulting in deep sores extending through the skin. (Noga and others, 1996). This study also examined fish that survived an acute sublethal exposure to  Pfiesteria piscicida  and then were  placed into clean water. One of ten fish developed a fungal infection. This infection, however, appeared typical of fungal organisms growing in necrotic tissue. The fungus did not cause the typical granulomatous response ( Fig 3 ) seen in wild fish captured in Bay tributaries. Burkholder and Glasgow (1997) stated that ""the fungi are opportunists; their hyphae generally do  not penetrate to the lesion base, suggesting they do not form the lesions; rather, they colonize lesions formed by toxin(s) from  Pfiesteria piscicida ."" This was not observed in menhaden collected in the Chesapeake tributaries. In many instances, the fungal organism and surrounding chronic  inflammation extended deep into muscle, under intact, normal skin. In a number of menhaden, the fungal organism had actually penetrated to and through visceral organs such as the liver.            Preliminary Information on Nutrient Sources and Environmental Factors Affecting Fish Health          The USGS is compiling information on estuarine water quality and the human and landscape factors that may affect fish health such as road density, population density, forest fragmentation, and patterns of nutrient sources. Additionally, information on the land characteristics that influence nutrient transport such as soil type, riparian zones, extent of drainage ditching, and geology is being compiled and integrated with streamflow and water-quality data being collected in the Pocomoke River Basin. Resource managers will use the information on nutrient sources and  transport to evaluate management practices that are being implemented to reduce nutrients entering the Bay and tributaries. In Maryland, legislation has been passed requiring farmers to adopt plans to control nitrogen runoff by July 2001 and phosphorous runoff by July 2004. Excess  nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen) in the soil can either run off  into streams directly or percolate through the soil to the water table and reach streams as ground-water discharge. Phosphorus tends to bind with sediment particles and is transported primarily with surface water, whereas dissolved nitrogen travels in both surface and ground water. Ground water in shallow aquifers that discharges to streams is called ""base flow.""         The USGS has found that the total percentage of streamflow contributed by base flow in shallow aquifers of the Coastal Plain ranges from approximately 42 to 74 percent (Bachman and others, 1998). On the basis of existing data, the concentration of nitrate in shallow aquifers underlying the lower Eastern Shore of Maryland generally ranges from less than 0.1 to 35 milligrams per liter. The associated age of most of the ground water in shallow Coastal Plain aquifers ranges from 0 to 20 years (Focazio and others, in press). This infers that management practices to control nitrogen may take up to 20 years to improve water quality for the part of the nitrogen moving through the subsurface. The USGS is currently collecting additional information to better document the  nutrients and associated traveltimes in aquifers in the Pocomoke River Basin.         Future Issues and Management Implications      Pfiesteria  was detected in Maryland waters in 1997 and was believed to be the primary cause of fish kills. Maryland has established criteria to close rivers on the basis of both fish kills and fish lesions. Therefore, there is a need for resource managers to understand the causes of both fish kills and lesions. While it is indeed possible that toxic dinoflagellates may play a role in the initiation of fish lesions, other factors also need to be considered. The finding of massive cell death over the top of the chronic tissue damage in the muscle of fish from the river closure areas suggests these inflamed lesions were present prior to exposure to  Pfiesteria  toxin. It is possible that large numbers of migrating menhaden with open skin sores could stimulate the dinoflagellate blooms.         Further research is needed to study the development of this fungal disease in menhaden, to understand the underlying stressors that may initiate this and other infections either by skin damage or immunsuppression, and to understand what role toxic dinoflagellates play in these lesions. It is also important to determine the time of year when the menhaden first become  infected and to follow the development of these chronic lesions. In addition to the occurrence of  lesions, the environmental factors--nutrients, contaminants, fresh-water flow, and estuarine  conditions--contributing to their occurrence must be understood in order to formulate effective management solutions. The USGS continues to work with appropriate State and Federal agencies to address fish health issues in the Chesapeake Bay.         -Vicki Blazer, Scott Phillips, and Edward Pendleton          References    Bachman, L.J., Lindsey, B.D, Brakebill, J.B., and Powars, D.S., 1998, Ground-water discharge and base-flow nitrate loads of nontidal streams, and their relation to a hydrogeomorphic classification of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, Middle Atlantic Coast: U.S.Geological Survey Water-Resources Investigations Report 98-4059, 71p.

The Town is an incorporated municipality and is the county seat of Queen Anne's County, Maryland. In the WRAS project, the Town of Centreville is working closely with Queen Anne's County and other stakeholders to consider local priorities for protection and restoration of water quality and habitat. The WRAS project area encompasses nearly 25,300 acres including nearly 1,400 acres of open water. The Town of Centreville is located at the head of tide on the Corsica River. The lower, tidal portion of the Corsica River enters the Chester River near Town Point in the oligohaline salinity zone. Depths of the tidal portions of Corsica River range from 1-2 feet in the upper tidal waters to greater than 15 feet near its confluence with the Chester River. As part of WRAS project, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is providing technical assistance, including preparation of a watershed characterization (compilation of available water quality and natural resources information and identification of issues), a stream corridor assessment (uses field data to catalog issues and rate severity) and a synoptic survey (analyzes benthic macroinvertebrates, fish and water samples with focus on nutrients). The Town of Centreville, with Queen Anne's County and other stakeholders, will use this information to help assess the watershed and to help generate the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. Water Quality The tidal portion of the Corsica River is mostly designated Use II for shellfish harvesting and the remaining tributary streams are Use I for recreation and aquatic life. Impairments to these uses include nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), fecal coliform bacteria which led to shellfish harvesting limitations, sediment, biological limitations (poor or very poor fish or benthic organism populations/conditions) and toxics (PCBs, Dieldrin and methylmercury) which led to current fish consumption advisories issued in January 2003. A Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) approved for both nitrogen and phosphorus in the Corsica River sets load limits for both nutrients. The TMDL reports that the primary source for both nutrients in the watershed is agriculture. The point source nutrients contribution is relatively small and is anticipated to be significantly reduced when land application of treated sewage effluent from Town of Centreville's Wastewater Treatment Plant begins in 2004. The Landscape Land in the Corsica River watershed is nearly 64% agricultural, over 28% forest/scrub shrub and over 7% developed. Wetlands identified by DNR comprise less than 0.5% of the landscape. The watershed has low population density (0.15 people/acre) and has little impervious cover except in and around the Town of Centreville.  vii   Natural resource lands of statewide or regional significance, identified as Green Infrastructure Hubs, occur in four areas. Connections between these hubs are mostly forest and agricultural land. Land protected from development encompasses 8% of the the Corsica River watershed including conservation easements, agricultural easements and County Parks/open spaces. About two-thirds of the watershed is prime agricultural land and about one-fifth is hydric soil. All other soils amount to about 13% of the watershed. Of the nearly 2,600 acres of wetlands that are identified in the watershed, about 81% are palustrine forested wetlands. Living Resources and Habitat Anadromous fish spawning areas for white perch, yellow perch and herring are identified in the Corsica River mainstem and three major tributaries. Nontidal fish species identified in the watershed are mostly tolerant and moderately tolerant of poor or variable water quality and habitat conditions. However, two intolerant species, roseyside dace and least brook lamprey, found in limited stream segments indicate that good water quality and good habitat conditions coincide in these small areas. Natural oyster beds that were documented shortly after the turn of the century in the Corsica River no longer exist there. Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in the Corsica River has only been identified using aerial photography in a few limited areas near its confluence with the Chester River. Its most frequent location since 1990 has been in Middle Quarter Cove. The bald eagle is the only sensitive species tracked by Maryland that is currently identified in the Corsica River watershed. Restoration Targeting Tools Using GIS, potential opportunities for habitat protection, stream buffer restoration and wetland restoration have been identified. These computer-generated assessments supplement the field information being collected during 2003 in the two field assessments: the Stream Corridor Assessment which catalogs and rates conditions found along and in streams, and the Synoptic Survey that will contribute water quality data, including nutrients, and assessment of fish and benthic communities at selected sampling sites.  vii   CONTRIBUTORS TO THE WATERSHED CHARACTERIZATION Centreville and Queen Anne's County Centreville, Town of Mike Whitehill Chester River Association Eileen McLellan Eastern Shore Land Conservancy Amy Owsley Queen Anne's County Commissioners Loring E.

The assessment, called the Unified Watershed Assessment, was conducted by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) under the direction of the US Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Water Action Plan initiative with assistance from the Maryland Departments of Environment, Agriculture and Planning and the University of Maryland. It moved beyond consideration of water quality in the streams in the state, which had been assessed regularly since the early 1970's, to a larger consideration of living resources in the streams and the landscape conditions which could impact both water quality and living resources.1,2 In response to the findings of the Unified Watershed Assessment, DNR offers technical and financial assistance to local governments who are willing to develop and implement Watershed Restoration Action Strategies (WRAS) addressing needs for restoration and conservation in priority watersheds. One of these projects is the Corsica River Watershed in Queen Anne's County, where the Town of Centreville, the County, DNR and other local cooperators, both public and private, are engaged in developing a watershed management strategy. Location Corsica River Watershed Acreage Summary MDP 2000 Land Use/Land Cover  The Corsica River Watershed is located within the Chester River basin as shown in Map 1 Land Water Total Location. The Corsica River Watershed's geographic location entirely within Centreville and 23,903 1,395 25,298 Queen Anne's County is highlighted in Map 2 WRAS Project Area. This area is the focus of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy and this Watershed Characterization. DNR subdivides the Corsica River Watershed into three ""12-digit"" subwatersheds for analytical purposes as depicted in Map 2. The table Subwatersheds summarizes acreage statistics for these subwatershed areas. Purpose of the Characterization One of the earliest steps in devising a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy is to characterize the watershed using immediately available information. This Watershed Characterization is intended to meet several objectives:  briefly summarize the most important or relevant information and issues;  provide preliminary findings based on this information;  identify sources for more information or analysis;  suggest opportunities for additional characterization and restoration work; and 1    provide a common base of knowledge about the Corsica River Watershed for local governments, citizens, businesses and other organizations. Additional Characterization Work The Watershed Characterization is intended to be one starting point that can be updated as needed. It is part of a framework for a more thorough assessment involving an array of additional inputs:  self-investigation by Centreville and Queen Anne's County  targeted technical assistance and assessment by partner agencies or contractors  input from local citizens  completion of a Stream Corridor Assessment, in which DNR personnel physically walk the streams and catalogue important issues.  completion of a synoptic water quality survey, i.e. a program of water sample analysis, that can be used to focus on local issues like nutrient hot spots, point source discharges or other selected issues. This is also part of the technical assistance offered by DNR. Findings of the 2002 synoptic survey of the streams in the Corsica River Watershed are reported in Appendix D. Identifying Gaps in Information It is important to identify gaps in available watershed knowledge and gauge the importance of these gaps. In assessing data gaps, we have found it helpful to review information in four categories:  Habitat: physical structure, stream stability and biotic community (including the riparian zone)  Water Quantity: high waterstorm flow and flooding; low waterbaseflow problems from dams, water withdrawals, reduced infiltration  Water Quality: water chemistry; toxics, nutrients, sediment, nuisance odors/scums, etc.  Cumulative effects associated with habitat, water quantity and water quality. Because restoration is an active evolving process, the Watershed Characterization and the resulting Watershed Restoration Action Strategy should be maintained as living documents within an active evolving restoration process. These documents will need to be updated periodically as new, more relevant information becomes available and as the watershed response is monitored and reassessed.  2   Subwatersheds In The Corsica River Watershed DNR and MDP 2000 Data Number 02130507XXXX 0395 Name ""12-Digit"" Subwatershed Corsica Direct Drainage Mill Stream Branch Three Bridges Branch and Gravel Run Corsica River Watershed Area in Acres Description With Water 8,382 Land Only 7,053 All tributary areas that drain directly to the estuarine portion of the Corsica River Includes south and west portions of Centreville Includes north and east portions of Centreville Entire ""8-Digit"" watershed  0396 0397 02130507  9,384 7,533 25,299  9,560 7,491 24,104  3   WATER QUALITY Water quality is in many respects the driving condition in the health of Maryland's streams. Historically, efforts to protect water quality have focused on chemical water quality. More recently, interest has focused on the biological conditions in streams and estuaries; active consideration of the physical parameters is even more recent. This developmental path is reflected in the ways in which streams have been monitored, the types of data gathered, and the regulatory approach taken. Water Quality Standards and Designated Uses All streams and other water bodies in Maryland are assigned a ""designated use"" in the Code of Maryland Regulation (COMAR) 26.08.02.08, which is associated with a set of water quality criteria necessary to support that use. Map 3 Designated Uses and Use Restrictions depicts the distribution of surface waters in each category. (COMAR or MDE should be consulted for official regulatory information.) 3,5 The Corsica River Watershed is assigned two uses: Use I: Water Contact Recreation, and Protection of Aquatic Life - all waters not otherwise designated as Use II below. Use II: Shellfish Harvesting Waters - All estuarine portions of Corsica River except above Earl Cove Use Impairments and Restrictions 4  Some streams or other water bodies in the WRAS project area cannot be used to the full extent envisioned by their designated use in Maryland regulation due to water quality or habitat impairments. These areas, known as ""impaired waters"", are tracked by the State of Maryland under Section 303(d) requirements of the Federal Clean Water Act. Maryland's list of impaired waters for the Corsica River watershed includes waters affected by water quality or habitat problems associated with several issues: Nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) Fecal Coliform Bacteria Sediment Biological Limitations (poor or very poor fish or benthic organism populations/conditions) Toxics  PCBs, Dieldrin and Fish Consumption Advisory  These impairments affecting portions of the Corsica River watershed are addressed below. Each water body listed may require preparation of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) to address the water quality and/or habitat impairment.4  4   1. Nutrients The tidal portion of the Corsica River is listed for impairment by nutrients in the 1996 303(d) list. The origins of these nutrients were listed: as natural and two types of human sources: point sources and nonpoint sources. According to the April 2000 report Total Maximum Daily Loads of Nitrogen and Phosphorus for Corsica River, impairment by both nitrogen and phosphorus contribute to excessive algal blooms and concentrations of dissolved oxygen below the minimum State standard of 5.0 milligrams per liter (mg/l). The algae and dissolved oxygen problems impair local conditions and interfere with the designated uses of the Corsica River. (Also see section on TMDL.) Nutrients can cause problems in the Corsica River for several reasons. In Maryland, most water bodies naturally have low levels of the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus. Without these essential nutrients, most water bodies could support aquatic life. However, in the tidal waters of the Corsica River either nitrogen or phosphorus can become too readily available. When this occurs under certain conditions with warm weather, sufficient light, etc., algae populations can grow to excessive levels. These algae can then crowd out other small organisms, cloud the water limiting light penetration, and eventually die-off consuming the dissolved oxygen that other aquatic life needs to survive. Nutrient pollution or over-enrichment problems may arise from numerous sources including all types of land and from the atmosphere. Residential land can be an important contributor of nutrients depending on fertilizer use, extent of lawn and the status of septic systems. Farmers apply nutrients using different approaches, so nutrients entering waterways from crop land vary greatly depending on management techniques. Typically, streams and other surface waters receive relatively small amounts of nutrients from forest land and relatively large amounts from land uses that involve soil disturbance and application of fertilizer. 2. Fecal Coliform Bacteria and Shellfish Harvesting Restrictions The tidal portion of the Corsica River is listed for impairment by fecal coliform bacteria in the 1996 303(d) list. The origins of these bacteria were listed: as natural and two types of human sources: point sources and nonpoint sources. Fecal coliform bacteria are a class of bacteria typically found in the digestive tract of warm-blooded animals, including humans. They are always found in animal waste and human sewage (unless it is treated to kill them). In unpolluted streams and tidal waters, it is common for water samples to contain very few of these bacteria. Water samples exhibiting significantly larger fecal coliform bacteria populations are ""indicators"" of contamination by animal, including human, waste. Depending on local conditions, sources of fecal contamination may include any combination of the following: inadequately treated sewage, failing septic systems, wild or domestic animals, urban stormwater carrying pet waste and similar sources. When fecal coliform bacteria levels are too high in tidal waters containing shellfish, harvesting is restricted to prevent consumption of contaminated food. Map 3 Designated Use and Use Restrictions, shows that portions of Corsica River are affected by shellfish harvesting restrictions. Tidal waters closest to Centreville are ""restricted"" which ""means that no harvesting of oysters and clams is allowed at any time."" This restriction applies to all the waters of the Corsica River east of a line extending in a northeasterly direction from Wash Point (39E04'51.2"" 5   North Latitude, 76E06'42.2"" West Longitude) to Cedar Point (39E04'57.9"" North Latitude, 76E06'29.6"" West Longitude). These restrictions are applied by the Maryland Dept. of the Environment (MDE) to protect public health because elevated fecal coliform counts are commonly found in this area of the River estuary. The elevated counts suggest the presence of contamination by animal or human waste. Restrictions are necessary because oysters and clams are filter feeders that readily absorb pathogens in animal or human waste. 3. Sediment The tidal portion of the Corsica River is listed for impairment due to suspended sediments in the 1996 303(d) list. The origins of these suspended sediments were listed: as natural and two types of human sources: point sources and nonpoint sources. Suspended sediment can cause water quality and habitat problems in several ways. Most unpolluted streams and tidal waters naturally have limited amounts of sediment moving ""suspended"" in the water. Excessive amounts of suspended sediment in waterways are considered pollution because they can inhibit light penetration, prevent plant growth, smother fish eggs, clog fish gills, etc. Sediment in streams tends to arise from stream bed and bank erosion and from land that is poorly vegetated or disturbed. Suspended sediment pollution may arise from construction sites, crop land, bare ground and exposed soil generally. The amount of sediment contributed varies greatly site to site depending upon stream stability, hydrology, management controls and other factors. 4. Biological Impairment One segment of the nontidal stream Gravel Run in the Corsica River watershed is listed for biological impairment in the draft 2002 303(d) list based on poor ratings for fish and benthic organisms (population and/or habitat). In selected stream segments statewide, populations of benthic macroinvertebrates and fish and their associated physical habitat have been assessed by the Maryland Biological Stream Program. Based on criteria developed for each physiographic/ecological zone in Maryland, each stream segment is rated as either good, fair, poor or very poor. Ratings of poor and very poor were listed as biological impairment for the first time in Maryland in the draft 2002 303(d) list of impaired waters. In the Corsica River watershed, one stream site appears in the list because of biological impairment. Gravel Run is listed based on 1995 sampling of the stream in the Town of Centreville. See the section on Maryland Biological Stream Survey Findings for additional details. 5. Toxics  PCBs, Dieldrin, Methylmercury and Fish Consumption Advisory The tidal portion of the Corsica River is listed as an impaired water body for toxic compounds because fish tissue sampling conducted in 2000 by MDE and the University of Maryland Center for Estuarine Studies found elevated concentrations of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) and Dieldrin. PCBs are listed as the cause for listing of the Corsica River area for impairment by toxic compounds. PCBs are a category of synthetic organic compounds that were widely used for several decades but they are now banded from use in the United States. Their resistence to high 6   temperatures and generally very stable chemical characteristics made them popular for use in high voltage electrical equipment like transformers including the type previously used in local electricity distribution networks. PCBs' stability and organic characteristics in the environment allow them to accumulate in the food chain including in fish that humans eat and in humans. These compounds are associated with toxic and carcinogenic effects. Dieldrin is mentioned in the 303(d) list as a toxic compound found in Corsica River area channel catfish tissue but it was not listed as a factor in the river's listing for impairment. Dieldrin is a synthetic organic herbicide that was once widely used but is now no longer in use in the United Stated. It is known to accumulate in the food chain including in fish that humans eat and in humans. This compound is associated with toxic and carcinogenic effects. The Fish Consumption Advisory for channel catfish in the Chester River/Corsica River area arose because of the elevated levels of PCBs and/or dieldrin found in the fish that were tested. Based on these findings, there is a risk that health problems could occur in people who eat these local fish too frequently. Fish tissue sampling conducted in 2001 by MDE led to issuance of a fish consumption advisory in late 2001 and an update to the advisory was issued by MDE in January 2003. The purpose of the advisory is to recommend that human consumption of channel catfish from the Chester River/Corsica River area be limited as described in the table below.

A TMDL is the amount of pollutant that a waterbody can assimilate and still meet its designated use. A waterbody may have multiple impairments and multiple TMDLs to address them. MDE is responsible for establishing TMDLs in Maryland. In general, TMDLs include several key parts: 1- Maximum pollutant load that the water can accept while still allowing the water body to meet its intended use. 2- Allocation of the maximum pollutant load to specific pollutant sources. As of March 2003, one approved TMDL directly affects the Corsica River watershed. The report Total Maximum Daily Loads of Nitrogen and Phosphorus for Corsica River was completed by Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) in April 2000 and was approved by US EPA in May 2000. It established Corsica River TMDLs for both nutrients as listed below. Nitrogen Phosphorus low flow TMDL annual TMDL low flow TMDL annual TMDL 1,379 pounds per month, May 1 through October 31 287,670 pounds per year 202 pounds per month, May 1 through October 31 22,244 pounds per year  These TMDLs mean that water quality impairment can be eliminated in the Corsica River if the total loads of nitrogen and phosphorus reaching the river are both reduced to this level or less. Collectively, these TMDLs are intended to meet two specific goals: a) avoiding harmful algae blooms (i.e., algae population density greater than 50 milligrams per liter (mg/l) of chlorophyll-a), and; b) maintaining adequate oxygen to support aquatic life (i.e. dissolved oxygen concentrations above of 5.0 mg/l as required by State regulation). MDE's computer model results indicate that nonpoint sources of nutrients are a most significant contributor as shown on the next page. The pie charts were adapted from MDE's report. In both cases, agricultural land is the largest nutrient source in the watershed. Based on the assumption that atmospheric deposition of nutrients is evenly distributed across the watershed, these relative load estimates associate nutrients arriving from the atmosphere into the land use type where they are deposited. To meet TMDL requirements, MDE anticipates two general approaches to controlling nutrients:  Nonpoint source nutrients will be controlled through existing programs, like implementing best management practices, and  Point source nutrients will be controlled at the Centreville Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP).  8   Nitrogen Sources Corsica River Watershed Point Source (4.00%) Urban NPS (4.00%) Forest NPS (6.00%)  Phosphorus Sources Corsica River Watershed Point Source (11.00%) Urban NPS (3.00%) Forest NPS (2.00%)  Ag NPS (86.00%)  Ag NPS (84.00%)  The allocations listed will be used by MDE in drafting NPDES permits for dischargers in the Corsica River watershed. For example, that the nutrients discharged from the Centreville WWTP, plus any other point sources in the watershed, must be less than the point source load allocations for the annual and the summer low flow load allocations. Based on the computer model results, MDE anticipates that point source low flow requirements can be met by applying NPDES permit requirements on the Centreville Wastewater Treatment Plant. The annual point source load allocations were based on projected maximum design flow at the Centreville Wastewater Treatment Plant assuming biological nitrogen removal and chemical phosphorus removal. MDE intends to monitor progress toward meeting the TMDLs through routine monitoring and additional TMDL evaluations. The estimated annual nonpoint source loads for both the nitrogen and the phosphorus TMDLs were based on Year 2000 land use projections. Additional details on nonpoint sources are presented in table Average Annual Nonpoint Source Load Estimates.

In the Plan, there were two categories for priority action: highest priority for restoration, and Water Quality Indicator Summary priority for protecting valued resources. Corsica River Watershed As the basis for the prioritization, From: 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment indicators of water quality, landscape and Indicator Name Finding living resources were developed for all watersheds in Maryland. Other approaches Modeled Load: TP 0.66 lbs/acre to assessing water quality have been in use for several years and are further described Modeled Load: TN 8.63 lbs/acre below. In general they do not look comparatively at watersheds as the Unified Comparison with similar Maryland watersheds Assessment did in an effort to set priorities. Green shading: goal or benchmark was met. The Unified Assessment also considered a Orange shading: goal or benchmark not met. range of living resource and landscape indicators described a little later. The Unified Assessment looked at five water quality indicators to compare the State's 138 ""8-digit"" watersheds though not all watersheds had information to allow generation of each indicator. 1. Modeled Loads for Phosphorus and Nitrogen In comparison to the other watersheds that drain to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, it is estimated that the Corsica River watershed receives 0.66 pounds of total phosphorus (TP) per acre in the watershed and 8.63 lbs/acre total nitrogen (TN). The TN yield meets Maryland's 10   benchmarks for these nutrients used in the Unified Watershed Assessment but the TP yield does not. Two of the most important pollutants in the Chesapeake Bay system are the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus, deemed this because of their contribution to excessive growth of algae, speeding the processes of eutrophication. To estimate how much TP and TN reaches the streams and how much of each is available for transport to the Bay, computer models are used. For the computer modeling used to generate the yield estimates reported in the Unified Assessment, the following information was used for the models: 1) monitoring data of point source nutrient discharges; 2) estimated nonpoint sources loads, based on 1996 land use and estimates of selected land management practices, and 3) consideration of other factors like deposition from the air. 2002 modeling conducted by DNR using 2000 data shows that the average yields for the Corsica River watershed are 0.759 pounds per acre annually of total phosphorus and 11.71 pounds per acre annually of total nitrogen. These load estimates may differ from the estimates used in the Unified Watershed Assessment for several reasons: changes in point source discharges and land use, and differing consideration of best management practices and septic system loads. An additional gauge of nutrient loads will be available in the results of the synoptic survey conducted in 2003. Water Quality Monitoring 1. Intensive Surveys 1992 and 1993 Intensive water quality surveys were conducted in 1992 and 1993 near the Centreville Wastewater Treatment Plant discharge and downstream to the Watson Road Bridge. This data was not used in the Corsica River nutrient TMDLs because the geographic coverage was too limited to characterize the entire tidal area of the Corsica River.5 2. 1997 Monitoring for the TMDL Two water quality surveys were conducted in the Corsica River watershed in the summer of 1997 to support work on the TMDL at locations shown in Map 4 Monitoring Water Quality. The summer represents critical conditions for the Corsica River. This is because there is less water flowing in the channel, higher concentrations of nutrients, and the water temperatures are usually warmer creating good conditions for algal growth. Data from these 1997 surveys was used to develop the nutrient TMDLs for the Corsica River.5 3. Long Term Monitoring in Tidal Waters Long term monitoring of tidal waters has been conducted in the Chester River at two locations. Similar long term water quality monitoring has not been conducted in the Corsica River. Based on interpretation of 1997 Corsica River water quality data, influence of the Chester River on Corsica River water quality conditions is not clear. Status and trends information for the Chester River long term monitoring stations is available on the Internet at http://www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/tribstrat/index.html .  11   National Academy Press, Clean Coastal Waters (2000) What Are the Effects of Nutrient Over-Enrichment? 6 The productivity of many [lake, estuary and] coastal marine systems is limited by nutrient availability, and the input of additional nutrients to these systems increases primary productivity [microscopic organisms including algae]. In moderation in some systems, nutrient enrichment can have beneficial impacts such as increasing fish production; however, more generally the consequences of nutrient enrichment for [lake, estuarine and] coastal marine ecosystems are detrimental. Many of these detrimental consequences are associated with eutrophication. The increased productivity from eutrophication increases oxygen consumption in the system and can lead to low-oxygen (hypoxia) or oxygen-free (anoxic) water bodies. This can lead to fish kills as well as more subtle changes in ecological structure and functioning, such as lowered biotic diversity and lowered recruitment of fish populations. Eutrophication can also have deleterious consequences on estuaries even when low-oxygen events do not occur. These changes include loss of biotic diversity, and changes in the ecological structure of both planktonic and benthic communities, some of which may be deleterious to fisheries. Seagrass beds are particularly vulnerable to damage from eutrophication and nutrient over-enrichment. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) harm fish, shellfish, and marine mammals and pose a direct public health threat to humans. The factors that cause HABs remain poorly known, and some events are entirely natural. However, nutrient over-enrichment of coastal waters leads to blooms of some organisms that are both longer in duration and of more frequent occurrence. Although difficult to quantify, the social and economic consequences of nutrient over-enrichment include aesthetic, health, and livelihood impacts  12   Water Quality Analysis The water quality analysis presented here is based on two water quality surveys conducted in summer 1997 by the State of Maryland for the TMDL. This limited data set allows for identification of warm weather problems but does not provide a complete understanding of variability throughout the year. Locations referenced in this section are shown on Map 4 Monitoring Water Quality. 1. Dissolved Oxygen Based on the 1997 water quality monitoring, dissolved oxygen concentrations in the lower Corsica River from the mouth to Miller Creek were consistently higher than the minimum 5.0 mg/l standard which indicates good water quality. Upstream of Miller Creek dissolved oxygen concentrations were commonly near or below the 5.0 milligrams per liter (mg/l) minimum standard. As dissolved oxygen concentrations decline below 5.0 mg/l, aquatic life has increasing difficulty respiring and must leave the area or face suffocation. Violations of this standard in estuarine waters, accompanied by high algae populations, indicate that poor water quality (eutrophic conditions) are present. 2. Algae Upper reaches of the Corsica River experience persistent season algae blooms. Based on the two water quality surveys conducted in the summer of 1997, chlorophyl-a concentrations in the Corsica River upstream of Miller Creek occasionally reached between 50 micrograms per liter (Fg/l) and 146 Fg/l. These chlorophyl-a concentrations indicate significant eutrophication existed in this part of the river. Downstream of Miller Creek, chlorophyl-a concentrations were consistently less than 50 Fg/l which suggests a relatively less significant concern for eutrophication. 3. Phosphorus Inorganic phosphorus concentrations measured in the Corsica River in 1997 ranged between 0.02 mg/l and 0.10 mg/l in most areas. However, in the vicinity of the Mill Stream Branch confluence with the Corsica River inorganic phosphorus concentrations slightly higher that 0.10 mg/l were measured. Though there is no water quality standard for phosphorus, concentrations higher than 0.10 mg/l total phosphorus are commonly considered to be an indication of eutrophication in estuarine waters. In the Corsica River downstream of Miller Creek, inorganic phosphorus concentrations of 0.05 mg/l and less were typical. This finding of lower inorganic phosphorus concentrations near the Chester River compared to upstream areas of the Corsica River suggests that the sources of the elevated phosphorus concentrations within the Corscia River watershed are more important than those potentially entering from the Chester River. 4. Nitrogen Total nitrogen concentrations in the upper tidal waters of the Corsica River (upstream of Emory Creek) ranged from around 1.0 mg/l to over 3.0 mg/l based on monitoring conducted in 1997. The tidal waters around Centreville exhibited total nitrogen concentrations greater than 2.0 13   mg/l. Though there is no water quality standard for total nitrogen, concentrations of 1.0 mg/l and higher in estuarine water are commonly considered to be an indication of eutrophication. Between the mouth of the Corsica River and Emory Creek, total nitrogen concentrations for summer 1997 ranged between 0.5 mg/l and 1.0 mg/l. The concentrations of less than 1.0 mg/l suggests less concern about eutrophication in the lower tidal waters of the Corsica River. 5. Toxics In 2000, MDE collected fish across Maryland, including the Corsica River, so that their tissue could be sampled for contamination by toxic materials as described in the prior section Use Impairments and Restrictions. A 1999 report by the Chesapeake Bay Program listed the Chester River (including tributary areas like the Corsica River) as an Area of Emphasis.14 This designation means that available data indicate that there is significant potential for a chemical contaminant-related problem. The monitoring data used to support this finding was collected in the Chester River mainstem in the vicinity of the Corsica River in both water column and sediment sampling stations. However, none of these sampling sites were in the Corsica River. Sources of Pollution Since European settlement of North America there has been an explosive growth in human population, supported by more intensive agriculture and the growth of industry. The entire continent has been crisscrossed and made mutually interdependent by vast transportation systems. All of this contributes to the decline in water quality and other natural resources. Sources of water pollution, which are grouped into two broad categories point sources and nonpoint sources, and nutrient pollution loads associated with these sources are discussed below. 1. Point Sources Pollution arising from discharges through pipes or other ""discrete conveyances"" are called point sources. Point sources may contribute pollution to surface water or to groundwater. For example, wastewater treatment discharges may contribute nutrients or microbes that consume oxygen (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)) reducing oxygen available for other aquatic life. Industrial point sources may contribute various forms of pollution. Some understanding of point source discharges in a watershed can be useful in helping to identify and prioritize potential restoration measures. The Corsica River Watershed has four permitted discharges, based on information from the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) permit data base. Summary information is presented in the MDE Permits Summary Table and on Map 5 MDE Permits:  The Corsica River's upper tidal waters and the lower Mill Stream Branch may have a localized impairment associated with the Centreville Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) according on MDE's interpretation of 1997 water quality monitoring data. This interpretation arises because 1997 monitoring of these tidal waters found that dissolved oxygen concentrations fell below 5.0 mg/l under some conditions and that total nitrogen 14   concentrations ranged between 1.0 mg/l to 3.0 mg/l. No other facilities with MDE permits appear to be contributing to these water quality problems.  The Town of Centreville anticipates that land application of treated sewage effluent could begin as early as 2004. This change could significantly reduce point source nutrient contributions to the river. Characteristics of permitted discharges (volume, temperature, pollutants, etc.) are tracked by MDE through the permit system. This information is accessible to the public and can be obtained from MDE.

Diffuse or Nonpoint Sources Sources of pollution that include areas of land and other sources that do not have a specific point of origin are called nonpoint sources. Nonpoint sources are commonly significant contributors of pollutants, particularly nutrients and sediment. These diffuse sources include rain water that runs off roofs, streets and parking lots (sometimes via storm drains) into nearby surface waters, as well as run-off from farm fields and, to a much lesser extent, forests. Also included in nonpoint source pollution is deposition from the atmosphere and contributions from ground water, where septic systems are a factor. a. Nutrients According to computer modeling presented in MDE's April 2000 nutrient TMDL report for the Corsica River watershed, nutrients from nonpoint sources dominate the average nutrient load to the river based on 1997 water quality data and projected land use data for the Year 2000:  15    Nitrogen from nonpoint sources accounts for about 96% of the entire nitrogen load to the Corsica River (268,211 lb/yr total nitrogen).  Phosphorus from nonpoint sources accounts for about 89% of the entire phosphorus load to the Corsica River (19,380 lb/yr total phosphorus). These nonpoint source estimates do not distinguish between naturally occurring nonpoint nutrients and those caused by human activity. Both types are accounted for in the load estimates. (Naturally occurring nutrient loads, also called background loads, are the loads that would be generated if the entire watershed was in undisturbed forest and no other human-generated nutrients were contributed through atmospheric deposition.) Given the current understanding of nutrient loads and related problems in the Corsica River, it is reasonable for WRAS partners to identify and prioritize projects with the intention of reducing nutrient loads for several reasons:  Elevated nutrient levels in the Corsica River, which is an indicator of eutrophication, may persist after upgrades to the Centreville WWTP envisioned in MDE's TMDL computer modeling. Elimination of the Corsica River's water quality impairments will likely require reduction of nutrient loads from nonpoint sources in the watershed.  Reduction of nonpoint source nutrient loads can be accomplished, in part, through existing programs that implement best management practices and through education of land managers. b. Sediment Nonpoint source sediment loads have not been estimated for the Corsica River Watershed. However, several current sources of information identify sediment as a problem:  The Corsica River is listed for impairment by sediment / suspended solids in Maryland's 303(d) list.  Phosphorus, which tends to be transported in association with soil particles, is identified as an impairment in the Corsica River. c. Shoreline Erosion Wherever land and open water meet, change in the form of erosion or accretion of land is the inevitable result of natural processes. Human activity in these areas often either inadvertently accentuates these natural processes or purposefully attempts to control movement of water and/or loss of land. Erosion of shorelines can contribute significant amounts of nutrients (mostly phosphorus) and sediment (water column turbidity, habitat loss.) The table Queen Anne's County Shore Erosion Rate Summary provides a brief overview of local conditions. 7  16   Queen Anne's County Shore Erosion Rate Summary (Miles of Shoreline) Total Shoreline Total Eroding Shoreline 95 (29%) Erosion Rate 0 to 2 feet / year 64 2 to 4 feet / year 12  7  4 or more feet / year 2  323  Maps of historic shoreline change were produced in 1999 by the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) in a cooperative effort between DNR and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These maps included digitized shorelines for several different years in Queen Anne's County. The maps show that extensive changes have occurred adjacent to large bodies of open water. Copies of these 1:24000 scale maps are available from the MGS. Currently, DNR is working to improve the ability to predict areas of high-rate shoreline erosion. In addition to considering historic erosion rates, contributory effects of land subsidence and sea level rise are being considered. To help generate predictive tools, two pilot areas have been selected: Queen Anne's County and Dorchester County. Results from this work are not currently available but information will be shared with local jurisdictions and other interests when they become available. Groundwater and Water Supply In the Corsica River Watershed, ground-water is the source for all water supplied to community use. The Town of Centreville operates the only community water supply system in the watershed under MDE permit QA1967G002. The Town's wells are all in the immediate vicinity of the community that they serve as shown in Map 5 MDE Permits. Much of the town is close enough to the wellheads to potentially affect them so it may be anticipated that the wellhead protection areas will encompass the majority of the town.. In general, community water supply systems employ confined aquifers in order to avoid the potential of local near-surface pollution. Therefore, community wells are not likely to affected by near-surface goundwater nutrient loads.  17   LANDSCAPE Water quality, particularly in streams and rivers, is affected by the land in the riparian zone and by soils, vegetative cover and the land use throughout the watershed. In an effort to gauge the affects of land use on water quality, and to allow comparison between watersheds, DNR has developed a series of Landscape Indicators. These indicators can be used to portray landscape conditions on a watershed scale that tend to support good water quality or that tend to degrade water quality. Landscape Indicators The 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan included a unified watershed assessment that used a number of landscape indicators to assess the State's 138 watersheds.2 Most indicators are relative measures by which Maryland's watersheds can be compared. The following sections identify the findings for the Corsica River Watershed from the 1998 Plan, with the exception of the population density, which is based on Year 2000 Census data. Landscape Indicator Summary Corsica River Watershed From: 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment Indicator Name Year 2000 Population Density Historic Wetland Loss Unbuffered Streams Soil Erodibility Finding 0.15 people/acre 4,192 acres 37 % 0.32 value/acre  Comparison with similar Maryland watersheds 1. Population Density Green shading: goal or benchmark was met. Based on the Year 2000 Census, the Orange shading: goal or benchmark not met. population density in the Corsica River Watershed was 0.15 people per acre of land. This is similar to the in the Unified Watershed Assessment estimate 0.17 people/acre based on 2000 population projections. As human population increases, the effects of human activity that degrades, displaces, or eliminates natural habitat also tend to increase. Watersheds with higher populations, assuming other factors are equal, tend to exhibit greater impacts on waterways and habitat. However, growth can be directed in ways to reduce negative impacts. A comparison with other watersheds in the state has not been completed using the 2000 census data.2 2. Historic Wetland Loss DNR mapping indicates that there are nearly 2,600 acres of wetlands in the Corsica River watershed now. However, assuming that all nonwetland hydric soils in the watershed were once wetlands, the estimated loss of wetlands over the years is 4,192 acres. This interpretation is based on the assumption that the hydric soils in the watershed were all, at one time, wetlands. Thoughtful selective restoration of historic wetland areas can be an effective WRAS component. In most of Maryland's watersheds, extensive wetland areas have been converted to other uses by draining and filling. This conversion reduces or eliminates the natural functions that wetlands provide.2 18   3. Unbuffered Streams Approximately 37% of streams in the Corsica River Watershed were not buffered with trees, based on 1998 information. Corridors 100 feet wide (50 feet either side) along streams were combined with forest cover to develop this indicator. This estimate of streams lacking forested buffer was generated for the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan by using Maryland Department of State Planning GIS data for streams and for 1994 land use. The finding for the Corsica River watershed compares well with other Maryland watersheds.2 In most of Maryland, trees are key to healthy natural streams. They provide numerous essential habitat functions: shade to keep water temperatures down in warm months, leaf litter ""food"" for aquatic organisms, roots to stabilize stream banks and vegetative cover for wildlife. In general, reduction or loss of riparian trees / stream buffers degrades stream habitat while replacement of trees / natural buffers enhances stream habitat. (For this indicator, only streams that appear on USGS Topographical Maps, sometimes called ""blue line streams,"" were considered in this estimate). 4. Soil Erodibility Soil erodibility for the Corsica River Watershed is represented by what is known as the K factor, in this case estimated to be 0.32.2 The K factor normally varies from approximately zero to about 0.6. A K value of 0.17 has a very low erosion potential, a value of 0.32 has a moderate erosion potential, a value of 0.37 has a high erosion potential, and a value of 0.43 has a very high erosion potential. This watershed's erodibility is moderate, although its ranking among all watersheds in the state was fairly high. Watersheds with more highly erodible soils are naturally more susceptible to surface erosion, sedimentation, streambank erosion and other problems related to soil movement. These negative effects of soil erodibility on water quality can be minimized through careful management. The soil erodibility indicator accounts for natural soil conditions but not for management of the land. (Existing cropland management was not considered.) The naturally erodible soils in the watershed are addressed by techniques called Best Management Practices (BMPs) to prevent soil loss, practices that are typically in use on local farms. BMPs like no-till or reduced till cropping, planting cover crops, field strips, or retiring erodible soils from production can significantly reduce erosion and sediment movement. These BMPs can be seen in use in many places in the watershed. Because soils can vary significantly within very small areas, a generalized erodibility indicator must be used with caution and supplemented with site-specific evaluation prior to implementing any management action.  19   Land Use / Land Cover  2000 Land Use The following table and pie Corsica River Watershed chart summarize 2000 land use / land cover for the Corsica River Watershed. Developed (7.23%) Wetlands (0.42%) They are based on categories Other (0.09%) established by the Maryland Department of Planning. Nearly 64% of the land in the Forest (28.37%) Corsica River Watershed is agriculture. About 28% is in some form of forest Agriculture (63.89%) and about 7% is covered with some type of developed or urban use. All other types of land together amount to less than 1% of the watershed. Viewing these general land use categories as potential nonpoint sources of nutrients, agricultural lands are likely to contribute the greatest loads to local waterways. Urban lands may also contribute significant nutrient loads. Map 6 Land Use / Land Cover shows the distribution of these land use categories in the watershed. Since this land use / land cover categorization was completed in 2000, significant land use change continues to occur in the watershed. For example, acreage to the east of Rt. 213 north of the Three Bridges Branch is shown as agricultural on the map. Some of this area was annexed by the town of Centreville several years ago and a housing development called North Brook now occupies some of this land.15 Land Use / Land Cover In Corsica River Subwatersheds Acres / Percent, MDP 2000 Data Watershed Corsica Direct Drainage Mill Stream Branch Three Bridges Branch and Gravel Run Corsica River Watershed (land only) Agriculture 3,968 56% 6,495 70% 4,809 65% 15,272 Forest 2,376 34% 2,370 25% 2,036 27% 6,782 Developed 633 9% 470 5% 624 8% 1,727 Wetland 76 1% 2 -22 -100 Other 0 22 -0 22 Total 7,053 9,359 7,491 23,903  Corsica River Watershed including open water 20  25,298   Looking at land use / land cover in the three subwatersheds of the Corsica River watershed, several characteristics can be ascertained from the map and the table below:  Corsica Direct Drainage subwatershed has the greatest percentage of forest and brush cover. It also has the greatest percentage of developed land even though it does not include a town center. Additionally, it has the smallest percentage of agricultural land use. Taken together, it appears that development is the least concentrated in this subwatershed compared to the other two.  Mill Stream Branch subwatershed has the greatest percentage of agricultural land and the smallest percent developed land even though in encompasses part of Centreville. This suggests that development is relatively concentrated in this subwatershed compared to the other two subwatersheds.  Three Bridges Branch and Gravel Run exhibits a mid-range percent of each major land use / land cover category compared to the other two watersheds. It also encompasses part of Centreville. Impervious Surface Roads, parking areas, roofs and other human constructions are collectively called impervious surface. Impervious surface blocks the natural seepage of rain into the ground. Unlike many natural surfaces, impervious surface typically concentrates stormwater runoff, accelerates flow rates and directs stormwater to the nearest stream without significant opportunity for stormwater infiltration into the ground. Watersheds with small amounts of impervious surface tend to have better water quality in local streams than watersheds with greater amounts of impervious surface. Urbanization and the increase in impervious surfaces that accompanies development can significantly impact stream health. Increases in the extent of upstream impervious surface are strongly associated with a decrease in stream quality. As impervious surfaces cover more of the landscape, less water infiltrates the soil and more water enters stream systems through runoff or stormwater discharge. This increased stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces contributes to stream quality degradation by introducing more non-point source pollution, higher temperatures, reduced stream baseflow and more erosive flood flow. The table Upstream Impervious Cover Thresholds shows the relationship between upstream impervious land cover and in-stream quality. These thresholds are based on extensive biological monitoring conducted by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey:10  21   Upstream Impervious Cover Thresholds Percent Less Than 2 Above 2 Above 15 Above 25 Affects on Stream Quality Imperviousness is relatively insignificant compared to other factors affecting habitat quality. In cold-water habitats, brook trout may be found. Negative impacts to stream health begin. Brook trout are never found in streams with watershed imperviousness above this threshold. Stream health is never rated good, based on a combined fish and benthic macroinvertebrate Index of Biotic Integrity. Only hardy, pollution-tolerant reptiles and amphibians can thrive, while more pollution-sensitive species are eliminated.  Map 7 Impervious Surface Corsica River Watershed reflects data developed by the University of Maryland's Regional Earth Sciences Application Center (RESAC).11 The map is color coded to show the relative amount of impervious cover in various areas of the watershed. Overall, there is relatively little impervious surface in the Corsica River watershed. Each of the three subwatersheds have average impervious cover of less than two percent. In appears that impacts associated with impervious surfaces are limited to small localized areas. Some of the local concentrations of impervious surface are in Centreville and adjacent to major roads. These concentrations of impervious surface may be generally suited to stormwater management control. Stormwater management retrofits and other forms of restoration could be targeted to these areas. Lands With Significant Natural Resource Value and Large Area 1. Green Infrastructure DNR has mapped a network of ecologically important lands, comprised of hubs and linking corridors collectively called Green Infrastructure. Hubs contain one or more of the following: - areas containing sensitive plant or animal species; - large blocks of contiguous interior forest (at least 250 contiguous acres, plus the 300 foot transition zone); - wetland complexes with at least 250 acres of unmodified wetlands; - streams or rivers with aquatic species of concern, rare cold water or blackwater ecosystems, or important to anadromous fish, and their associated riparian forest and wetlands; and - conservation areas already protected by public (primarily DNR or the federal government) and private organizations like The Nature Conservancy or Maryland Ornithological Society. This Green Infrastructure provides the bulk of the state's natural support system and ecosystem services, such as cleaning the air, filtering and cooling water, storing and cycling nutrients, conserving and generating soils, pollinating crops and other plants, regulating climate, 22   protecting areas against storm and flood damage, and maintaining hydrologic function. Protection of Green Infrastructure lands may be addressed through various existing programs including Rural Legacy, Program Open Space, conservation easements and others. Within Program Open Space, the Green Print program helps to target funds to protect Green Infrastructure areas. Map 8 Green Infrastructure shows that there is a significant amount of Green Infrastructure in the Corsica River watershed:  Four Green Infrastructure hubs are identified in the Corsica River watershed.  Only a small portion of one hub has some form of environmental resource protection. 2. Large Forest Blocks Large blocks of forest provide habitat for species that are specialized for conditions with relatively little influence by species from open areas or humans. For example, forest interior dwelling birds require forest interior habitat for their survival and they cannot tolerate much human presence. Map 9 Forest Interior shows blocks of contiguous forest that are at least 50 acres in size with at least 10 acres of forest interior (forest edge is at least 300 feet away) that may be important locally within the Corsica River Watershed. This size threshold was chosen to help ensure that the forest interior is probably large enough to provide locally significant habitat for sensitive forest interior dwelling species. The assessment shown in Map 9 differs from the Green Infrastructure assessment which considered only large blocks of forest land cover at least 250 acres in size that are likely to have state or regional importance. Protected Lands Protected Land Summary Corsica River Watershed  Map 10 Protected Land shows the Acres % distribution of protected lands in the Corsica MET / ESLC Easements 810 3 River watershed. As used in the context of watershed restoration, ""protected land"" Agricultural Easements 909 4 includes any land with some form of long term limitation on conversion to urban / developed County Parks, 239 1 land use. This protection may be in various Open Space forms: public ownership for natural resource or Protected Land Total 1,958 8 low impact recreational intent, private ownership where another party acquired the Watershed Land Total 23,903 100 development rights or otherwise acquired the right to limit use through the purchase of an easement, and other approaches. The extent of ""protection"" varies greatly from one circumstance to the next. Therefore, for some protected land, it may be necessary to explore the details of land protection parcel by parcel through the local land records office to determine the true extent of protection. The map also shows some land in the watershed is within a Rural Legacy Area. This land encompasses 564 acres or about 2% of the watershed. The Rural Legacy Area designation has 23   the potential to target Program Open Space funds to help protect additional land from development. Some of this land is already protected by easement and/or by County ownership. The land shown on the map that is not currently under easement or County ownership is open to land use change consistent with local zoning and comprehensive plan requirements. An additional area of land identified on the map is encompassed by the Priority Funding Area. Within these areas, State funding is more likely to be available in support of local development projects. This area closes about 1,441 acres which is about 6% of the watershed. These areas are one of several ways to anticipate where new development or redevelopment is likely to occur. For purposes of watershed restoration, a knowledge of existing protected lands and likely areas for new development can provide a starting point in prioritizing potential restoration activities. In some cases, protected lands may provide opportunities for restoration projects because owners of these lands may value natural resource protection or enhancement goals. Soils of the Corsica River Watershed 1. Interpreting Local Conditions with Natural Soil Groups Soil conditions like soil type and moisture conditions greatly affect how land may be used and the potential for vegetation and habitat on the land. Soil conditions are one determining factor for water quality in streams and rivers. Local soil conditions vary greatly from site to site as published information in the Soil Survey for Centreville and Queen Anne's County shows. This information has been summarized into Natural Soil Groups to help identify useful generalizations about groups of soils. Map 11 Soils By Natural Soils Groups shows the distribution of natural soils groups in the Corsica River Watershed as described in the table below. 2. Soils and Watershed Planning Local soil conditions are a useful element for watershed planning and targeting restoration. Soils with limitations like wetness or slope naturally inhibit active use for farming or development and may then be available as restoration project sites. By comparing Map 11 Soils By Natural Soils Groups with the preceding maps Map 6 Land Use / Land Cover and Map 8 Green Infrastructure, it may be possible to discern how patterns of active or passive land use relate to soil conditions. Natural Soils Groups and other soils assessments can be used to help identify potential areas for restoration projects or habitat protection. Hydric soils, for example, are more easily restored as wetlands than soils that were never saturated with water. See the chapter Restoration Targeting Tools for additional information.  24   Natural Soil Group Area Summary for the Corsica River Watershed Soil Group Description Prime Agricultural Soils Soils With Limitations for Farming B1a - Well drained, moderate erodibility.

Wetland Categories The Coastal Plain Province likely has the highest diversity of emergent estuarine and palustrine (fresh water) wetland communities relative to other Maryland physiographic regions because both tidal and nontidal freshwater marshes occur here. Wetlands are most abundant in the Coastal Plain due to the low topographic relief and high ground water table characteristic of the region. Estuarine Wetlands are abundant throughout the Coastal Plain. These systems consist of salt and brackish tidal waters and contiguous wetlands where ocean water is occasionally diluted by freshwater runoff from the land. These wetlands may extend far upstream in tidal rivers to freshwater areas. Differences in salinity and tidal flooding within estuaries have a significant effect on the distribution of these wetland systems. Salt marshes occur on the intertidal shores of tidal waters in areas of high salinity. Brackish marshes are the predominant estuarine wetland type in Maryland. They are found along the shores of Chesapeake Bay, mostly on the Eastern Shore, and for considerable distance upstream in coastal rivers. Estuarine shrub swamps are common along the Maryland coastal zone. Aquatic beds, comprised mostly of submerged aquatic 25   vegetation (SAV), were historically abundant in shallow water zones of Maryland's estuaries, especially Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Palustrine wetlands are freshwater wetlands that are not associated with streams or lakes. In general, they are associated with freshwater, high water tables or intermittent ponding on land. Forested wetlands are the most abundant and widely distributed palustrine wetland type on the Coastal Plain. These wetlands are found on floodplains along the freshwater tidal and nontidal portions of rivers and streams, in upland depressions, and in broad flat areas between otherwise distinct watersheds. Tidal freshwater swamps occur along coastal rivers in areas subject to tidal influence. Scrub-shrub swamps are represented in the Corsica River Watershed. Emergent wetlands on the Coastal Plain are characterized by a wide range of vegetation, depending on water regime. (Adapted from Wetlands of Maryland, Tiner and Burke, 1995.) 2. Tracking Wetlands Oversight of activities affecting wetlands involves several regulatory jurisdictions. The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) is the lead agency for the State and cooperates with DNR, the Army Corps of Engineers and other Federal and local agencies. As part of its responsibility, MDE tracks State permitting and the net gain or loss of wetlands over time. As the table Tracking Nontidal Wetland Change shows, the State regulatory program has measured a small net decrease of wetland acreage in the Corsica River Watershed over the past 11 years. This slowing of wetland loss in the watershed contrasts significantly with the estimated historic 4,192 acre wetland loss in the watershed as described in the Landscape Indicators section. Tracking Nontidal Wetland Change For The Corsica River Watershed In Acres 1/1/1991 through 12/31/2002 9 Permanent Impacts -0.95 Permittee Mitigation 0.45 Programmatic Gains 0 Other Gains 0 Net -0.49  Notes: 1) Regulatory tracking for authorized nontidal wetland losses began in 1991. Comprehensive tracking of voluntary wetland gains began in 1998. Only nontidal wetland changes are shown; tidal wetland changes are excluded. Acreage presented represents changes for the entire watershed. 2) ""Permanent Impacts"" refers to acres altered (e.g., filled, drained) under permit from MDE. 3) ""Permittee Mitigation"" refers to acres restored by a permit holder as required by terms of the permit from MDE. 4) ""Programmatic Gains"" refers to acres restored by MDE using fees paid into a compensation fund by a permit holder in lieu of undertaking mitigation himself. 5) ""Other Gains"" refers to acres of wetlands restored when not required as mitigation for permitted losses  26   3. Interpreting Wetland Distribution Map 12 Wetlands and Wetland Acreage Summary Table summarize distribution and categories of wetlands in the Corsica River Watershed. Two wetland categories account for all of the wetlands in the watershed:  Estuarine wetlands of all types account for slightly over 7% of all watershed wetlands, and  Palustrine wetlands account for the remaining 93% of watershed wetlands. Forested Palustrine wetlands alone account for over 81% of all watershed wetlands. In comparing the wetlands map to Map 6 Land Use / Land Cover, it can be seen that many of the nontidal wetland areas are depicted as forest on the land use map. And most of the estuarine wetlands are not identified on the land use map These differences are simply the result of two differing views of the landscape. For example, wooded nontidal wetlands can be viewed as ""wetlands"" from a habitat / regulatory perspective and they can be viewed as ""forest"" from a land use perspective. Similarly, most of the estuarine wetlands shown on the wetlands map are considered open water on the land use map. In the Corsica River watershed, differing perspectives on Wetland Acreage Summary Table counting wetlands are significant for Corsica River Watershed watershed management. From a land Wetland Class Acres use perspective, 100 acres of Estuarine tidal emergent 159 wetlands are identified by the scrub shrub 6 Maryland Department of Planning. unconsolidated bottom 4 From a habitat / regulatory unconsolidated shore 17 perspective, there are at least 2,592 Palustrine emergent 102 acres of wetlands in the watershed. flooded semipermanently 56 In the context of the forested 2,104 Watershed Restoration Action scrub shrub 54 Strategy (WRAS), wetlands serve unconsolidated bottom 90 valuable water quality and habitat Total Wetlands (DNR mapped 2,592 functions that may not be provided wetlands) by other land uses. Therefore, protection and enhancement of existing wetlands, and restoration of past wetland areas, can be a valuable element in the WRAS. (Also see the Wetland Restoration section.) Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) None of the wetlands in the table above are subject to WSSC regulations. See the Sensitive Species Section.  27   Floodplains Flooding was identified as a local issue early in the WRAS project. Flooding of public roads crossing streams is a particular concern. Map 13 Floodplain and Sea Level Rise shows that the 100-year floodplain extends far up tributaries beyond Centreville. In recent years, stormwater management requirements have provided a means to limit impacts of new development and impervious area that would otherwise contribute to stream degradation and flooding. However, these requirements may not significantly improve water quality or quantity problems that are driven by systemic watershed factors. For existing development and impervious area, retrofitting controls to enhance water quality and limit peaks in stormwater runoff may offer an additional way to protect waterways. Low Elevation Areas Subject to Sea Level Rise The average rate of sea level rise along Maryland's coastline has been 3-4 mm/yr or approximately on foot per century. Such rates are nearly twice those of the global average (1.8 mm/yr), a result most likely influenced from land subsidence. The rate of sea level rise is expected to accelerate in response to global warming, resulting in a rise of 2-3 feet by the year 2100. The low-lying coastal plains such as those along the eastern shore are vulnerable to impacts associate with rising sea level. Sea level rise threatens to exacerbate erosion and flooding, making areas more vulnerable to land loss, permanent inundation, and storm surge. Recognizing the need for advanced planning, the Department of Natural Resources developed a response strategy in 2000 and has been aggressively acquiring high-resolution elevation data (LIDAR) in the most vulnerable areas. Partial coverage of Queen Anne's County including the Corsica River has been acquired as select areas were defined as being less than 1.5 meters (5 feet) above sea level. Accurate elevation data will significantly improve the State and County's ability to define the most vulnerable areas and determine the most appropriate management measures to mitigate the impacts.8  28   LIVING RESOURCES AND HABITAT Living resources, including all the animals, plants and other organisms in the Corsica River Watershed are being affected by human activity. The information summarized here suggests that some of the significant stresses on living resources in the watershed are associated with alteration and destruction of habitat, excessive movement of sediment and excessive availability of nutrients. In the Corsica River watershed, information is available for fish, oysters, submerged aquatic vegetation, sensitive species. However, other forms of aquatic life, woodland communities, terrestrial habitats, and others should be considered as watershed restoration decisions are being made. Therefore, it is recommended that stakeholders in the watershed identify important living resource issues or priorities so that additional effort can be focused where it is most needed. New information should be added or referenced as it becomes available. Living Resource Indicators  Aquatic organisms are sensitive, in varying degrees, to changes in water quality and aquatic habitat. They are also sensitive Indicator Name Finding to landscape changes. This association SAV Abundance 1.0 offers two perspectives that are important for watershed restoration. First, SAV Habitat Requiremts 3.0 improvements for living resources offer potential goals, objectives and opportunities Nontidal Fish Index 7.9 to gauge progress in watershed restoration. Nontidal Benthic Index 5.8 Second, the status of selected species can be used to gauge local conditions for water Nontidal Habitat Index 4.3 quality, habitat, etc. This second Comparison with similar Maryland watersheds perspective is the basis for using living Green shading: goal or benchmark was met. resources as an ""indicator."" Orange shading: goal or benchmark not met. The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan's Unified Watershed Assessment, published in 1998, included a number of living resource indicators for the Corsica River Watershed.2 Several of these indicators rely on extrapolations from a limited number of sampling sites which were then generalized to represent entire watersheds. Some are indices comprising several conditions. Considering this limitation on field data, it would be beneficial to conduct additional assessments to provide a more complete understanding of local conditions.  Living Resource Indicator Summary Corsica River Watershed From: 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment  29   1. SAV Abundance For tidal areas of the Corsica River Watershed, the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) scored ""1.0"" for the Abundance Indicator, which means that SAV covered 10% or less of the potential SAV habitat. This indicator is designed to allow comparison of watersheds based on actual SAV acreage versus potential SAV acreage. To generate the score for this indicator, two measurements of SAV area were used: 1) area covered by SAV in the year 1996 was estimated using aerial survey data, and 2) the potential SAV area based on water depth (up to two meters deep), physical characteristics and historic occurrence of SAV. The benchmark used in the Unified Watershed Assessment of the Clean Water Action Plan for the SAV Abundance indicator was 10%. If less than 10% of the potential SAV area in a watershed was covered by SAV in 1996, then the watershed was listed in the category ""needs restoration"". If more than 10% of the potential SAV area in a watershed was covered by SAV in 1996, then the watershed was listed in the category ""needs preventative action"" to protect or enhance SAV abundance. No watershed in the State scored higher than 2, reflecting a maximum observed coverage of 20%. 2. SAV Habitat Index For tidal areas of the Corsica River Watershed, the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) scored 3.0 for the Index, which means that SAV habitat requirements were not met based on 1994-1996 data. This index is designed to allow comparison of watersheds based on several measurements of habitat conditions: water clarity as measured by secchi depth, dissolved inorganic nitrogen where applicable, dissolved inorganic phosphorus, abundance of algae as measured by Chlorophyll a and total suspended solids. The benchmark used in the Unified Watershed Assessment for the SAV Habitat Index was 7. A score less than 7 means that the watershed's habitat conditions were not favorable for SAV and the watershed was listed as being in need of restoration (Category 1). A score of 7 or higher means that 1994 through 1996 data showed that habitat conditions for SAV in a watershed were sufficient and the watershed was listed in the category for ""restoration needed"". The Corsica River watershed is among the lowest scoring half of watersheds statewide on this indicator. 3. Nontidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity With an IBI score of 7.9, the Corsica River Watershed met the benchmark set for the Nontidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI). The Fish Index of Biotic Integrity (fish IBI) for fishes have been developed for small (first- to third-order) non-tidal streams. Several characteristics of the fish community are measured: numbers of native species, of benthic species and of tolerant individuals; the percent of tolerant species, of dominant species, and of generalists, omnivores and insectivores; the number of individuals per square meter; biomass in grams per square meter; percent of lithophilic spawners; and percent insectivores. These characteristics are scored and summed to calculate a fish IBI for each sampled stream. Each watersheds score is an average of stream scores within the watershed. These watershed scores were ranked 1 (most degraded) through 10 (best condition). A score of less than 6 does not meet the benchmark set for this index. A score of 6 or greater meets the benchmark.  30   4. Nontidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity With an IBI score of 5.8, the Corsica River watershed does not meet the benchmark set for the Nontidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI). The nontidal benthic IBI looks at the insects and other invertebrates, like crayfish, living on the bottoms of streams, considering the overall community composition, the number and diversity of species and the presence of sensitive species. To calculate the benthic IBI, for the Unified Watershed Assessment, reference conditions were established for minimally-impacted streams. IBI values are relative to conditions in these minimally-impacted streams. An index of 6.0 or less means that restoration is recommended and an index of 8.0 or higher means that protection is recommended. 5. Nontidal Habitat Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) The Corsica River watershed's low overall index of 4.3 for habitat biotic integrity suggests that this watershed has significant physical habitat concerns relative to similar Maryland watersheds. This rank corresponds to an Maryland Biological Stream Survey's score of 2.8 which is in the ""poor"" range. A rank less than 6 means that restoration is recommended. This physical habitat indicator is developed for small (first- to third-order) non-tidal streams. It is based on several measures of in-stream habitat quality that are scored for each site based on observations of habitat condition in streams during sampling visits. The habitat measures rate the quantity and quality of physical habitat available in the stream for fish and benthic macroinvertebrate colonization and rate the degree to which the stream channel has been altered due to changes in watershed landscape. The physical habitat characteristics are measured, scored, weighted, and summed to calculate the indicator for each sampled stream. A low score, or a decline in score over time, reflects both natural disturbances and human-induced alterations of the stream habitat relative to minimally-disturbed reference sites. The mean habitat score for watersheds is reported on a scale of 1 (most degraded) to 10 (best condition). The ranked scores were divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). Watersheds with the best conditions ranked in the highest three quartiles and, thereby, met the benchmark. The watersheds with the worst conditions ranked in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds) and ""exceeded"" the benchmark. Physical habitat conditions in non-tidal streams and rivers are influenced by land use and land cover patterns in the watershed, such as the destruction of riparian forests and increasing the area of impervious land cover. Other major influences are channelization, encroachment by livestock, and blockages to upstream/downstream movements of fish.  31   Biological Monitoring In Streams The Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) sampled stream conditions in the Corsica River watershed in 1995 and 2000. Additionally, citizen volunteers in the Stream Waders program, which is associated with MBSS, assessed the benthic macroinvertebrate community at several sites in the watershed in 2000. Results from these sampling efforts address three broad categories of stream conditions as listed below. The findings in each of these categories, which are each summarized on a separate map, allow comparison of stream conditions across the watershed:  Fish as summarized in Map 14 MBSS Fish Index  Benthic macroinvertebrates (benthos or stream bugs) Map 15 MBSS Benthic Index  Physical habitat Map 16 Physical Habitat Index  Table MBSS Findings for 2000 and 1995 Additionally, overall conditions in a stream or subwatershed may be interpreted by considering fish, benthos and physical habitat together. Several interpretations are offered below.  Conditions that underlie the indices are complex and apply primarily to a local stream segment. No streams ranked as good or very poor for all indices. Typically, a stream segment ranks as a mix of good, fair, poor and/or very poor for the three indices.  There is a tendency for good/fair conditions to be associated with watersheds with the least disturbance (natural vegetation, forest) and for poor/very poor conditions to be assoiciated with greater disturbance (impervious area, agriculture, construction sites). Prior to creation of the MBSS method of assessment and random site selection technique, DNR used a biological assessment approach in nontidal steams known as rapid bio-assessment. While results of this assessment is not directly comparable to the current day MBSS data, it does provide a way to compare stream conditions during the early 1990s. The table DNR Rapid BioAssessment Data Summary lists these results. DNR Rapid Bio-Assessment Data Summary Location Old Mill Stream at Taylors Mill Road Three Bridges Br. at Rt 213 Sample Yr 1990, 92, 94, 96 Benthic good Habitat good Water Quality fair/good 12  Comments Excellent riparian area; heavy sediment load Good riparian area, heavy sediment load  1990. 92, 94, 96  poor/fai r  poor/fai r  fair/good  32   Why Look at Benthos in Streams? Unimpaired natural streams may support a great diversity of species like bacteria, algae, invertebrates like crayfish and insects to fish,birds, reptiles and mammals. All these groups of organisms have been extensively assessed relative to water quality and habitat quality. One group, benthic invertebrates, was found to serve as a good indicator of stream condition including water quality and habitat quality. Benthic invertegrates are sometimes called ""stream bugs"" though that name overly simplifies the diverse membership of this group. This group includes mayflies, caddisflies, crayfish, etc., that inhabit the stream bottom, its sediments, organic debris and live on plant life (macrophytes) within the stream. Benthic macro-invertebrates are an important component of a stream's ecosystem. The food web in streams relies significantly on benthic organisms. Benthos are often the most abundant source of food for fish and other small animals. Many benthic macroinvertebrates live on decomposing leaves and other organic materials in the stream. By this activity, these organisms are significant processors of organic materials in the stream. Benthos often provide the primary means that nutrients from organic debris are transformed to other biologically usable forms. These nutrients become available again and are transported downstream where other organisms use them. Assessment of benthic organisms is a valuable tool for stream evaluation. This group of species has been extensively used in water quality assessment, in evaluating biological conditions of streams and in gauging influences on streams by surrounding lands. These organisms serve as good indicators of water resource integrity because they are fairly sedentary in nature and their diversity offers numerous ways to interpret conditions. They have different sensitivities to changing conditions. They have a wide range of functions in the stream.

Tidal Areas Map 17 Fish Spawning and Oysters shows that at least three anadromous fish species are known to spawn in several streams within the Corsica River watershed:  Corsica River mainstem, Emory Creek and Three Bridges Branch: yellow perch and white perch  Mill Stream Branch: yellow perch, white perch and herring Natural oyster beds were historically found in the Corsica River as also shown in Map 17 Fish Spawning and Oysters.13 Currently, there are no oyster beds or oyster leases designated by DNR in the Corsica River. The closest oyster beds currently designated by DNR are in the Chester River mainstem immediately outside of the Corsica River as shown in the map. The closest oyster lease areas are in the Chester River well downstream of the Corsica River in the vicinity of Kent Island. The reasons why the Corsica River oyster beds disappeared have not been established but sedimentation is likely to have been a factor. 2. Nontidal Areas Information on fish in nontidal streams is primarily gathered as part of the Maryland Biological Stream Survey. See Biological Monitoring In Streams for summary information. Additional information on fish populations and related recreational activities will be incorporated as it becomes available. Maryland Fisheries Service does not monitor freshwater fish populations in tributaries to the Corsica River, in part, due to an absence of public demand. Public access for freshwater fishing is unavailable on Corsica River tributaries according to the Maryland Guide to Freshwater Fishing (1992). Sampling of fish populations was conducted in selected stream segments of the Lower Monocacy River watershed in 1995 and 2000 by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS). A complete listing of fish species that were identified are listed in table MBSS Fish Species Findings For County Subwatersheds. While these findings are limited and they are aggregated by County subwatershed, they do offer some insights summarized below:  Portions of stream networks draining to Mill Stream Branch and Three Bridges Branch support Roseyside Dace and Least Brook Lamprey. These ""intolerant"" fish species require good water quality and habitat to survive in the long term.  The majority of the fish found throughout the Corsica River watershed are tolerant and ""moderately tolerant of poor or variable water quality and/or habitat conditions.  35   MBSS Fish Species Findings For Corsica River Subwatersheds Key For Color/Font Code* for fish species in the table below (white: no data) Tolerant Fish that tend to survive greater pollution and poorer habitat conditions Moderate Tolerance Fish with mid-range ability to co-exist with pollution and varied habitat conditions Intolerant Fish that require good water quality and good habitat conditions  Key for table: U means that at least one MBSS site identified the presence of this species.

May 1997.  37   Sensitive Species Sensitive species are generally recognized as being the plants or animals that are most at risk in regards to their ability to maintain healthy population levels. The most widely known are perhaps the Sate and Federally-listed Endangered or Threatened animals such as the bald eagle and Delmarva fox squirrel. In addition to well known animals such as these however, both the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Maryland DNR work through their respective Federal and State programs to protect a wide variety of declining non-game animals, rare plants, and the unique natural communities that support them. For the purposes of watershed restoration, it is valuable to account for the known locations and areas of potential habitat for sensitive species in a given area. They are often indicators, and sometimes important constituents, of the network of natural areas which form the foundation for many essential natural watershed processes. In fact, in addition to conserving biodiversity in general, protecting these species and/or promoting expansion of their habitats can be an effective component for a watershed restoration program. 1. Habitat Conservation Measures DNR's Wildlife and Heritage Service identifies important areas for sensitive species conservation in different ways. The geographic delineations most commonly used are described in the text box Marylands Sensitive Species Conservation Areas. As shown in Map 18 Sensitive Species, there are four Ecological Significant Areas (ESAs) identified by the State of Maryland in the Corsica River watershed. The purpose of utilizing these delineations is to help protect sensitive species by identifying the areas in which they are known to occur. Doing so allows DNR to work toward the conservation of these sensitive resources by evaluating potential impacts of proposed actions that may affect them. Specifically, working within an established procedural framework, the Wildlife and Heritage Service reviews projects and provides recommendations for activities falling within these overlays. The geographic areas covered by these overlays are course filters that allow for uncertainty by incorporating buffers around habitat areas. Accurate on the ground information regarding species locations and habitat delineations for a specific area can be obtained from DNR's Natural Heritage Program. It is also important to note that outside of the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area, DNR generally only places requirements on projects requiring a permit/approval or utilizing State funds. However, there are more broadly applied State and Federal laws and regulations which address ""takings"" of listed species. In addition, many counties have incorporated safeguards for areas associated with sensitive species into their project and permit review processes as well as adopting ordinances to protect them. In all instances, property owners are encouraged to seek advice on protecting the sensitive species / habitat within their ownership. 2. Rare, Threatened and Endangered Species List In the Corsica River watershed, the bald eagle Haliaeetus leucocephalus is the only species tracked in Maryland's rare, threatened and endangered species lists. Additionally, at least one colonial waterbird nesting area is found in the watershed. In general, these species are located within area on the Sensitive Species Map labeled as Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA). 38   Sensitive Species Protection Areas In the Corsica River Watershed Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA) At least four ESAs are identified in the Corsica River watershed as shown in Map 18 Sensitive Species. Each ESA contains one or more sensitive species habitats. However, the entire ESA is not considered sensitive habitat. The ESA is an envelope identified for review purposes to help ensure that applications for permit or approval in or near sensitive areas receive adequate attention and safeguards for the sensitive species / habitat they contain. Natural Heritage Area (NHA) No NHAs are located in the Corsica River Watershed. In general, NHAs have been designated as such because they represent rare ecological communities. These are areas which provide important sensitive species habitat. They are designated in State regulation (COMAR 08.03.08.10) and are afforded specific protections in the Critical Area Law criteria. For proposed projects that could potential affect a particular NHA, recommendations and/or requirements may be put in place during the permit or approval process. These would be specifically aimed at protecting the ecological integrity of the NHA itself. To help ensure that proposed projects which may affect a given NHA are adequately reviewed, an ESA is always designated to encompass each NHA and the area surrounding it. Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) No WSSCs are designated in the Corsica River Watershed. These selected wetlands, which generally represent the best examples of Maryland's nontidal wetland habitats, are afforded additional protection in sate law beyond the permitting requirements that apply to wetlands generally. The Maryland Department of the Environment may be contacted for more information regarding these regulations. To help ensure that proposed projects that may affect a WSSC are adequately reviewed, an ESA is always designated to encompass each WSSC and the area surrounding it. For a listing of designated sites see COMAR 26.23.06.01 at www.dsd.state.md.us  39   Submerged Aquatic Vegetation The well-defined link between water quality and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) distribution/abundance make SAV communities good barometers of the health of estuarine ecosystems. SAV is not only important as an indicator of water quality, but it is also a critical nursery habitat for many estuarine species. For example, blue crab ""post-larvae"" are up to 30 times more abundant in SAV beds than in adjacent unvegetated areas. Additionally, several species of waterfowl depend on SAV for food when they over-winter in the Chesapeake region. Map 19 Submerged Aquatic Vegetation and the adjacent table show SAV Presence in the Corsica River By Year that SAV has intermittently appeared in (Years not listed  No data Available) the Corsica River during the 1980s and 1980 and 1984 absent 1990s based on interpretation of aerial photography. 1985 near River Estates In 1985 and 1987, SAV appeared only on the north side of the river near 1986 absent River Estates.

In partnership with the Town of Centreville and Queen Anne's County, DNR is conducting a Stream Corridor Assessment in the Corsica River Watershed during 2003. In this effort, trained teams from the Maryland Conservation Corps walk along streams to identify and document potential problems and restoration opportunities such as the items listed below: Stream Corridor Assessment Data Collection Categories Pipe Outfalls Pond Sites Tree Blockages Inadequate Buffers Erosion Fish Blockages Exposed Pipe Unusual Conditions Trash Dumping In- or Near-Stream Construction  A stream corridor assessment report will be generated, including maps and photographs, to support targeting decisions for restoration projects. Draft data summaries are expected to be available in late 2003. The results of the stream corridor assessment will provide a valuable foundation for development of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. 2003 Synoptic Survey and Aquatic Community Assessment During 2003 DNR staff collected water quality samples in nontidal streams to supplement knowledge of local conditions. The water quality findings included in the report on this work can help identify problem areas and relative conditions among local streams based on measurements of dissolved oxygen, pH, nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen), conductivity and flow. The findings will include nutrient load estimates at each sampling site and ranking of subwatersheds based on these estimates. For some of these nontidal stream sampling sites, DNR staff has also assessed fish and benthic organism populations. These assessments provide additional perspectives to gauge local water quality and habitat conditions. 41   Agricultural Conservation Programs Many farmers in Queen Anne's County willingly implement management systems that address nutrient runoff and infiltration, erosion and sediment control, and animal waste utilization. Some of the conservation practices in plans include grassed waterways, riparian herbaceous and riparian forested buffers, conservation cover, cover crops, shallow water wildlife areas and grade stabilization structures. The Maryland Agricultural Cost-Share program (MACS), the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP and CREP) and the Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) are some of the state and federal programs promoted and administered by the Queen Anne's SCD and Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS). 28 Fish Blockage Removal The 2003 Stream Corridor Assessment will identify blockages to fish movement that exist in the Corsica River watershed. Many fish species need to move from one stream segment to the next in order to maintain healthy, resilient populations. This is particularly true for anadromous fish species because they spawn and hatch from eggs in free flowing streams but live most of their lives in estuarine or ocean waters. Blockages in streams can inhibit or prevent many fish species from moving upstream to otherwise viable habitat. Marina Programs In the Corsica River watershed, the only marina listed in DNR's Marina database is Centreville Public Landing. According the information available from the database, this marina does not offer pumpout facilities and it is not participating in Maryland's Clean Marina Program. Discharges of sewage from boats are a concern for water quality because they contribute nutrients, biochemical oxygen demand and pathogens. This type of discharge to the Corsica River probably contributes to the problems identified in the River associated with nutrients and bacteria. At this time, the relative contribution of boat discharges to these problems has not been quantified. The Clean Marinas Program is a way for marina owners to gain certification and public recognition for voluntarily undertaking a number of actions related to marina design, operation, and maintenance intended to properly manage all kinds of marine waste, by-products and activities. DNR also funds installation and maintenance of marine pumpout facilities, including those at certified Clean Marinas. Information is available at DNR's website, www.dnr.state.md.us/boating.  42   Stream Buffer Restoration 1. Benefits and General Recommendations Natural vegetation in stream riparian zones, particularly forest, provides numerous valuable environmental benefits:  Reducing surface runoff  Preventing erosion and sediment movement  Using nutrients for vegetative growth and moderating nutrient entry into the stream  Moderating temperature, particularly reducing warm season water temperature  Providing organic material (decomposing leaves) that are the foundation of natural food webs in stream systems  Providing overhead and in-stream cover and habitat  Promoting high quality aquatic habitat and diverse populations of aquatic species. To realize these environmental benefits, DNR generally recommends that forested stream buffers be at least 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream. Therefore, DNR is promoting this type of stream buffer for local jurisdictions and land owners who are willing to go beyond the minimum buffer standards. The DNR Watershed Services and other programs like Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), managed by the DNR Forest Service, are available to assist land owners who volunteer to explore these opportunities. 2. Using GIS Identifying the areas that need buffer restoration and prioritizing them for action can be a time-consuming, expensive project. That is why computerized Geographic Information System (GIS) is used here to manipulate remotely sensed data can help save limited time and funds. However, it is important to verify these scenarios using field information like that gathered by a Stream Corridor Assessment. It is also valuable to consider other potential scenarios or combinations of scenarios to support prioritization and decision making. 3. Headwater Stream Buffers For many watersheds, headwater streams (first order streams) drain the majority of the land within the entire watershed. Therefore, stream buffers restored along headwater streams (First Order) tend to have greater potential to intercept nutrients and sediments than stream buffers placed elsewhere. In targeting stream buffer restoration projects, giving higher priority to headwater streams is one approach to optimizing nutrient and sediment retention. Restoring headwater stream buffers can also provide habitat benefits that can extend downstream of the project area. Forested headwater streams provide important organic material, like decomposing leaves, that ""feed"" the stream's food web. They also introduce woody debris which enhances in-stream physical habitat. The potential for riparian forest buffers to significantly influence stream temperature is greatest in headwater regions. These factors, in addition to positive water quality effects, are key to improving aquatic habitat. Since the Corsica River Watershed has a substantial percentage of its headwater streams in interior forests, protection of these forests against impacts from development may be an important part of WRAS strategies, along with reforestation where necessary. 43   4. Land Use and Stream Buffers One factor that affects the ability of stream buffers to intercept nonpoint source pollutants is adjacent land use. Nutrient and sediment loads from different land uses can vary significantly as shown in the adjacent table. By restoring naturally vegetated stream buffers adjacent to lands Annual Nonpoint Source Pollution Load Rates producing the highest By Land Use pollutant loads, nutrient and Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model (2000) sediment loads can be Land Use Nitrogen Phosphorus Sediment reduced most efficiently. (lbs/ac) (lbs/ac) (tons/ac) Map 20 Stream Buffer Scenario focuses on the Crop land 17.11 1.21 0.74 crop and pasture lands Urban 7.5 0.7 0.09 within 50 feet of a stream and identifies stream Pasture 8.40 1.15 0.30 segments that lack naturally vegetated stream buffers. Forest 1.42 0.00 0.03 DNR encourages creating stream buffers at least 50 feet wide on each side of the stream, which is significantly greater than minimum buffer requirement, to enhance nutrient and habitat benefits beyond minimum buffer requirements. 5. Nutrient Uptake from Hydric Soils in Stream Buffers In general, the nutrient nitrogen moves from the land into streams in surface water runoff and in groundwater with a significant percentage of nitrogen entering streams in groundwater. Stream buffers can be used to capture nitrogen moving in groundwater if buffer restoration projects have several key attributes:  Plants with roots deep enough to intercept groundwater as it moves toward the stream  Plants with high nitrogen uptake capability, and  Targeting buffer restoration projects to maximize groundwater interception by buffer plants. Hydric soils in stream riparian areas can be used as one factor to help select stream buffer restoration sites. Siting buffer restoration on hydric soils would offer several benefits:  Plant roots are more likely to be in contact with groundwater for longer periods of time  Hydric soils tend to be marginal for many agricultural and urban land uses  Natural vegetation in wet areas often offers greater potential for habitat. Map 20 Stream Buffer Scenario identifies lands adjacent to streams that are composed of hydric soil, that are crop or pasture land and also lack naturally vegetated stream buffers. An important next step in using this information is verification of field conditions. Care must be 44   taken during field validation to evaluate any hydrologic modification of these soils, such as ditching or draining activities, which would serve to decrease potential benefits. 6. Optimizing Water Quality Benefits by Combining Priorities Strategic targeting of stream buffer restoration projects may provide many different benefits. To maximize multiple benefits, site selection and project design need to incorporate numerous factors. For example, finding a site with a mix of attributes like those in the following list could result in the greatest control of nonpoint source pollution and enhancement to living resources:  land owner willingness / incentives  marginal land use in the riparian zone  headwater stream  hydric soils  selecting appropriate woody/grass species  adjacent to existing wetlands / habitat  Additionally, selecting restoration projects that are likely to produce measurable success is an important consideration in prioritizing projects for implementation. In general, targeting restoration projects in selected tributaries or small watersheds will tend to offer the greatest probability of producing measurable water quality improvement in the short term. By selecting small areas like a small first order stream for restoration, there is greater likelihood that local water quality will improve with relatively limited investment. In addition, local water quality improvements will likely contribute to downstream improvements. Wetland Restoration Wetlands serve important environmental functions such as providing habitat and nursery areas for many organisms, facilitating nutrient uptake and recycling, providing erosion control. However, most watersheds in Maryland have significantly fewer wetland acres today than in the past. This loss due to draining, filling, etc., has led to habitat loss and negative water quality impacts in streams and in the Chesapeake Bay. Reversing this historic trend is an important goal of wetland restoration. One approach to identifying candidate wetland restoration sites involves identifying ""historic"" wetland areas based on the presence of hydric soils. This process can be accelerated by using GIS to manipulate soils information with other data like land use. The GIS products can then assist in initiating the candidate site search process, targeting site investigations and helping to identify land owners. Map 21 Wetland Restoration Scenario indicates that there is potential for wetland restoration based on identifying agricultural fields (crop or pasture) on hydric soil. This is one of many potential scenarios for finding opportunities for wetland restoration. The steps and priorities used to generate the map are listed below:  Data used: Hydric soils (Maryland Dept. of Planning Data), existing wetlands (DNR Wetlands), land use (Maryland Dept. of Planning, 2000).  Identify candidate hydric soil areas based on land use. Hydric soils used in agricultural fields are selected for consideration. Hydric soils used for development or underlying natural vegetation are not considered in this scenario. 45    Explore hydric soils based on land use / land cover and proximity to existing wetlands or streams. The potential wetland restoration sites suggested in the scenario can be filtered further by using more accurate wetlands and soil information and by considering land ownership or other factors like like habitat enhancement opportunities, sensitive species protection, targeting specific streams or subwatersheds for intensive restoration, and using Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) information.

The Saint Mary's River watershed is located in Saint Mary's County, Maryland, and encompasses approximately 45,200 acres. The watershed is located within the Coastal Plain physiographic province. The geologic strata in the area consist of unconsolidated sediments from the Quaternary and Tertiary periods (0-63 million years ago)(Maryland Department of Natural Resources 1968). Soils in the watershed are made up of varying proportions of sand, silt, gravel, clay, peat, greensand, and diatomaceous earth. The dominant land use in the watershed is forest (59%), followed by agriculture (23%), urban (17%), wetlands ( 0.8%) and barren land (0.2%). Saint Mary's County is currently experiencing an increase in urban land development largely due to the expansion of the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division. Typically, as land in a watershed is converted to urban uses, soil compaction and impervious surface area increases causing stormwater to be delivered to streams at accelerated rates while infiltration declines. This results in increased erosion of stream channels and other associated ecological problems. According to the Maryland Office of Planning, about 6.4% of the Saint Mary's River watershed was impervious surfaces in 1994. Scientific studies have shown that once impervious surface area exceeds a certain threshold (usually about 10% to 15% of a watershed's area) serious ecological degradation occurs (Limburg and Schmidt, 1990; Imhof et al., 1991; Weaver and Garman, 1994; Wichert, 1994,1995; Moscrip and Montgomery, 1997; Wang et al., 1997, 2000;). The overall goal of the Saint Mary's River Project is to provide information that will help Saint Mary's County plan land development in a manner that will minimize impacts to the county's aquatic resources. This goal will be achieved by identifying areas of high biological integrity where preservation efforts can be focused, along with biologically impaired areas where habitat restoration efforts can mitigate the impacts of previously developed and careful planning can minimize the impacts of new development. The Saint Mary's River Watershed Plan focuses on three objectives: mitigating the impact of stormwater flow from impervious surfaces to reduce the erosive power of stormflow events, increasing the quality of the stormwater which discharges into streams, and restoring damaged or lost instream and riparian wildlife habitat. This project will also serve as an educational tool in the county by promoting environmental awareness within the residential, business, and academic communities. The project is a multi-agency effort involving the US Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE), Saint Mary's College, Saint Mary's County, and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. The goals of the Saint Mary's River Project are (1) to sample the streams in the watershed to obtain baseline information on ecological conditions and fish distributions, and (2) to use the data to target areas for land preservation, planned development and habitat restoration efforts. This report describes results from ecological monitoring activities conducted by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources' (DNR), Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) in 1995 and 2000. 1   Methods Using data from a total of 36 sites, stream conditions in the Saint Mary's River watershed were characterized to assist in developing recommendations for planning land development (Figure 1). The ACOE chose the locations of seven of these sites that were sampled by MBSS during 2000. Data from these seven sites were used to examine the influence of urban land development on stream ecological resources in the Saint Mary's River watershed. Results of this examination are described in this report and can be used to demonstrate the importance of careful land use planning. Locations of each of the seven sites are listed in Table 1 and data collected are included in appendix A. Along with these seven sites, assessment of stream conditions at 29 additional sites provided broader spatial coverage for a more accurate characterization of stream conditions throughout the Saint Mary's River watershed. Nine of these sites were randomly selected and sampled by the MBSS (two during 1995 and seven during 2000). Benthic macroinvertebrates were collected in 2000 at the remaining 20 sites as part of the Stream Waders volunteer monitoring program (coordinated by DNR). MBSS (Kazyak 2000) and Stream Waders (MDNR 2001) monitoring and assessment methods are described below. Biological Fish assemblage data were collected using double-pass electrofishing with direct current backpack units. Each 75 m long site was blocked at each end using block nets and all available habitats were thoroughly sampled. For each pass, all captured fish were identified to species, counted, and released. Fishes were collected during summer (June - September) to avoid the effects of spring and fall spawning movements on fish assemblages and to maximize electrofishing catch efficiencies. Fish data were analyzed in terms of species richness, composition, relative abundance, and general pollution tolerance. A Fish Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) was also calculated (Roth et al, 1998; Roth et al 1999). A list of fish species predicted to occur at each site was generated and compared to the actual list of species collected. Benthic macroinvertebrates were collected by Stream Waders volunteers using D-frame sampling nets during spring (March-April). A 100 organism sub-sample was processed and identified to family taxonomic level by DNR staff. These data were used to calculate a family-level benthic macroinvertebrate index of biotic integrity for each site. In addition to fish and benthic marcroinvertebrate information, the presence of herpetofauna, aquatic vegetation, and freshwater mussels was also recorded. Any taxon identified by the DNR's, Natural Heritage Division as rare, threatened, or endangered based on the official State Threatened and Endangered Species List as part of the State of Maryland Threatened and Endangered Species regulations (COMAR 08.03.08) was recorded. Water Quality Water quality information was collected in situ just prior to summer fish sampling. Parameters measured included dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, conductivity, turbidity and temperature. All measurements were taken with a HydrolabTM multiprobe water quality meter, except for turbidity which was measured with a LaMotteTM turbidity meter. Both instruments were calibrated before sampling according to MBSS QA/QC guidelines (Kazyak 2000). Physical Habitat Physical habitat assessments were conducted to evaluate habitat effects on biota. MBSS habitat 2   assessment procedures were derived from two methods: EPA's Rapid Bioassessment Protocols (Plafkin et al. 1989), as modified by Barbour and Stribling (1991), and Ohio EPA's Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (Ohio EPA 1987). Several parameters (instream habitat, epifaunal substrate, velocity/depth diversity, pool/glide/eddy quality, riffle quality, embeddedness, and shading) were scored based on visual observations. Quantitative measurements at each site included the number of woody debris and root wads, maximum depth, wetted width, depth, and discharge. Land Use Arc View software was used to generate site-specific land use and impervious surface information for each site using U.S. EPA Multi-Resolution Land Characteristic Consortium (MRLC) data. These land use data are based on Landsat TM data acquired in 1986-1993 and, as a result, do not reflect land use changes that have occurred more recently than 1993. Quality Control/ Quality Assurance Qaulity control and quality assurance procedures for this project followed the MBSS methods as outlined in Appendix B. These procedures have been accepted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and meet all requirements as outlined in ""The Guidelines and Specifications for Preparing Project Plans"", EPA QAMS 005/80.

Protection of the catchments for these sites from development is necessary to preserve good quality, rare, or unique resources. JA1 warrants particular consideration for protection status due to the presence of iron color shiner (Notropis chalybaeus), a fish species which is designated ""Highly State Rare"" by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Natural Heritage Division. In addition to protection status, JC1, HR2, and PB1 would benefit from bank stabilization as 20, 20, and 40 square meters of stream bank were eroded at each site respectively. Three of the seven ACOE sites (HR1, JA2, and USM) were influenced by a number of stressors with USM being the most severely degraded site. Table 2. Select w ater quality, physical habitat, land use, and biological parameters measured at seven sites sampled for this study (see Table 1).

Highly variable and temporally fluctuating hydrographs are often associated with streams in urbanized watersheds (Rosgen 1996) and are likely responsible for the extensive stream bank erosion and decreased base flows at sites with greater than 10% impervious land cover. The resulting loss of instream habitat is probably attributable to the displacement of large woody debris during high flow events, silt deposition, and lowered base flows as impervious land cover increases and infiltration decreases. Any or all of these physical alterations are possible reasons for low biological integrity observed at more urbanized sites.

Watershed Characterization Data collected from sampling sites (over 30% of all stream reaches) were available to evaluate streams in need of protection and restoration in the Saint Mary's River watershed. This broad sampling density provides the opportunity for conducting an overall watershed assessment. Despite this major monitoring effort, however, over 100 other stream reaches were not sampled. The presence of good quality, rare, or unique stream resources in any of these unsampled reaches can not be ruled out. Additional monitoring in the watershed is needed for a more comprehensive watershed assessment. All MBSS, ACOE. and Stream Waders sites were color coded for ecological condition and plotted on a map of the Saint Mary's River watershed (Figure 7). Areas in need of protection were identified based on the catchments of sites with high biological integrity scores and rare taxa. Streams were identified and prioritized for restoration potential based biological condition (Table 3) at sampled sites. We used a four tiered approach to prioritize streams for restoration. Streams in catchments of sites with rare taxa were given top priority for targeting restoration activities. Streams in catchments of minimally degraded sites (Good IBI scores) received second priority. The third tier priority for restoration included catchments of sites with moderate degradation (Fair IBI scores). Finally, unless the impairment presents a human health hazard, we recommend that work on the fourth tier (severely degraded sites with Poor and Very Poor IBI scores) be deferred until habitat in reaches in higher priority catchments are protected and improved. Using this approach, thorough surveys of stream bank erosion and overall habitat quality are needed to find stream reaches in catchments of priority sites where habitat 7   improvements or storm-water control may be necessary. There are a number of financial and ecological justifications for using this tiered approach for planning stream restoration projects. Financial justification is based on the lower cost and effort needed to restore a larger number of minimally-degraded streams compared to a few severely degraded streams. Ecological justification comes from a greater potential for restoration success in minimally-degraded streams compared to severely degraded streams because degraded streams often suffer from the influence of a greater number of stressors. As there are no streams in Maryland that are completely free from anthropogenic influences, the currently high biological quality of minimally degraded streams will be most effectively maintained or even improved by controlling erosive, urban run-off and enhancing instream habitat in their catchments. The catchments of the un-named tributary to Jarboesville Run (site JA1) and the Upper Saint Mary's River (site 202) were given top priority for protection status based on the presence of rare fish species. Catchments of several other streams were also recommended for protection status based on Good IBI scores (Figure 7). Based on the results of this survey, degraded sites were found within the catchments upstream of sites 202 and PB1. Habitat restoration projects should be implemented at these degraded sites and any other impaired areas within the catchments of sites 202 and PB1, as well as other priority protection sites if their high biological quality is to be maintained. A number of streams had severely degraded physical habitat and biological quality. Although they may benefit from habitat improvement and control of urban run-off, focusing development in the catchments of these already degraded streams would render the least impairment to the overall biological quality of the Saint Mary's River watershed. However, development should be carefully planned to prevent further degradation of stream habitats in these catchments.  Summary The influence of urban development on the Saint Mary's River watershed appears to be relatively severe. The best protection for streams in the watershed would come from curtailed development. A more realistic but also more uncertain strategy would be to direct growth away from the most undisturbed portions of the watershed. Protecting areas of high biological integrity and habitat quality by concentrating development in impaired areas would help to preserve some of the watershed's biological integrity and biodiversity. Focusing habitat improvement activities on minimally degraded streams first would provide additional protection to areas with high biological integrity and biological diversity. Surveys of habitat quality and stream bank erosion from urban run-off in the upstream catchments of minimally degraded streams would provide additional information necessary to plan habitat improvements and bank stabilization projects that would ensure the most benefit to the biological integrity and diversity of the Saint Mary's River watershed. In most cases, we recommend that a long-term, lower cost approach to stream restoration such as riparian buffer plantings be evaluated first before extensive channel modifications are considered.  8   Table 3.

Fish Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) Scores. Maryland Department of Natural Resources has developed an Index of Biotic Integrity for non-tidal stream fish assemblages (FIBI) as a tool for evaluating the ecological conditions in streams (Roth et al. 1998). The FIBI evaluated various ecological attributes of fish assemblages and compared them to assemblages in minimally impacted reference sites. IBI scores were rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the poorest possible score, and 5 being the best. Sites were then assigned scores of Good, Fair, Poor or Very Poor (see Appendix Table C-1).

The appendix includes descriptions of documentation procedures, responsibility and accountability of project personnel, training requirements, data quality objectives, facilities and equipment, information management, and data quality assessment. To achieve the objectives of the MBSS, it is imperative that all project personnel follow the procedures and guidance provided in this chapter. B.1 INTRODUCTION Quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) are integral parts of data collection and management activities of the MBSS. The QA program for the MBSS was designed to: 1) ensure that data are of known and sufficient quality to meet the project objectives, and 2) provide estimates of various sources of variance associated with the individual variables being measured. To be effective, the QA program must continually monitor the accuracy, precision, completeness, comparability, and representativeness of the data during all phases of the program. Components of the MBSS QA program include:       establishment of Data Quality Objectives (DQOs); thorough investigator training; identification of project protocols and guidelines; comprehensive field and laboratory data documentation and management; verification of data reproducibility; and instrument calibration.  B.2 DATA QUALITY OBJECTIVES The establishment of Data Quality Objectives (DQOs) for the MBSS is necessary to specify how good MBSS data must be to support decision making, including the level of uncertainty that the state is willing to accept. DQOs specify:       the problem to be resolved; the decision to be made; the inputs to the decision; the boundaries of the study; the decision rule; and the limits on uncertainty.  It is important to note that DQOs are target values for data quality and are not necessarily criteria for the acceptance or rejection of data.  15   Because many aspects of the MBSS have not been rigorously tested in Maryland waters, adequate information to fully develop DQOs for the MBSS does not currently exist. Therefore, the DQOs listed below represent a preliminary analysis of the needs and gross expectations for MBSS data. Results of the first round of the MBSS will be used to refine DQOs for future rounds of the MBSS.  B.2.1 Preliminary DQOs for the MBSS  B.2.1.1 The Problem to be Resolved W ith continuing impacts of point source pollution and ever increasing pressure from non-point source pollution, there is an increasing need to manage the aquatic resources of the state effectively and in a holistic manner. To accomplish this task, information about the current status of lotic (flowing) waters in the state is necessary. Information about the relative impacts of anthropogenic stressors on aquatic resources is also necessary in order to prioritize enforcement, restoration, monitoring, and management efforts. Of special importance to the MBSS is the ability to segregate the effects of acidic deposition from other stressors.  B.2.1.2 The Decision to be Made Data from the MBSS will be used to support management decisions. Examples of such evaluations/decisions include:        a determination of the extent and magnitude of acid deposition impacts on stream biota in Maryland; an evaluation of the degree to which the flowing, non-tidal waters of Maryland have balanced, indigenous populations of biota as specified in the Clean W ater Act; a determination as to whether existing fishery management practices are adequate to protect important fish stocks; a determination as to whether specific waters of the state require further investigation of stressor sources and impacts; prioritization of watersheds for protection, restoration and/or enhancement; a determination as to which anthropogenic stressors need to receive intensified management and enforcement activities; and development of one or more validated biological indices for evaluation and monitoring of impacts from anthropogenic stresses.  B.2.1.3 Inputs to the Decision Inputs to the above management decisions require specific biological, water quality, and habitat data collected in comparable fashion. Specific inputs include indices and population estimates which accurately depict the water quality, habitat quality, biological integrity, and fishability of Maryland streams and rivers.  16   B.2.1.4 Population of Interest The current population of interest includes all non-tidal, 3rd order and smaller stream reaches of the State of Maryland, with the exception of non-wadable impoundments on 3rd order and smaller streams, and impoundments which substantially alter the riverine nature of the reach. In future years, the population of interest may be expanded to include 4th order and larger streams.  B.2.1.5 Comparability and Completeness Comparability of data between field crews will be maximized by providing standardized training in MBSS techniques prior to sampling. Training requirements are specified by the Project Officer and included in the Scope of W ork for each organization involved in field sampling. Training is mandatory for all participants of both the Spring and Summer Index Periods. To utilize data from a given sampling segment during analyses, all data included on the MBSS data sheets which pertains to the analysis being conducted must be validated, plus all appropriate site location data.  B.2.1.6 Decision Rule The following initial decision rules were established to provide a basis for management actions related to non-tidal, flowing waters in Maryland: 1) Determination of the status of streams and rivers with regard to balanced, indigenous populations will be based on species richness and abundance, presence-absence of historically present species, presence of introduced species which are perceived as nuisances or have known adverse impacts on native species. Community data at a site will be compared with community data obtained from within the watershed and physiographic region. A stream or river reach will be considered impaired if one or more historically present top predators are absent from a stream, if undesirable introduced species have displaced native species, if species richness is less than 70% of species richness at comparable locations, if abundance of native populations at a site is substantially less than the abundance observed at other comparable locations within the watershed or physiographic region, or if water quality at a site is too poor to support native fish. Characterization of fishability at a site will be based on habitat quality (ranked as supporting, partially supporting, or non-supporting), abundance of recreationally important species of catchable size, and abundance of juveniles of recreationally important species. Abundance of a species in a stream will be based on a comparison to the highest densities observed in a watershed or physiographic region. Sites having population abundances within 50% of reference locations will be classified as fishable, while sites having densities between 1 and 50% of reference densities will be classified as marginal. Sites with no recreationally important fish species will be classified as non-fishable. A decision to consider further investigations to identify particular anthropogenic impact sources will be made if biotic indices change more than 25% between stream reaches or between two segments of the same stream reach. Ranking of potential for restoration or enhancement of streams and rivers will be based on: ultimate habitat potential to support native and/or sportfish populations, any limiting factors to habitat or water quality, and degree of public access.  2)  3)  4)  17   5)  The importance of various anthropogenic stressors will be evaluated based on relationships observed between biological data and habitat, water quality, landuse analysis, or other appropriate indicators. An individual stressor should be considered to be a primary cause of impairment if it explains 25% or more of the variation in one or more biological indices within a watershed, ecoregion, or drainage. Abundance and/or species composition estimates at a given sample segment will be considered acceptable if overall capture efficiency exceeds 50%.  6)  3.2.1.7 Limits to Uncertainty Two important components of uncertainty are precision and bias. Precision and bias relate to the amount of random and systematic error, respectively, and are determined through the use of replication, performance evaluation samples of known composition, and confirmatory analyses by experts. As results from the initial round of the MBSS will provide a means of defining uncertainty, uncertainty limits are not included in this version of the sampling manual.  B.3 DOCUMENTATION To ensure scientific credibility, study repeatability and cost effectiveness, all project activities of the MBSS need to be adequately documented. These activities include itinerary development, landowner contacts, adherence to sampling protocols, equipment calibration, field sampling, review of data sheets, field notes, information management, data quality assessment, data analyses, and interpretation of data. To minimize the possibility that needed documentation or data is not recorded, standardized forms and on-site verification of form completions by supervisory personnel should be employed as part of the MBSS. Each of the activities listed above is described in other sections of this manual, including documentation procedures and requirements.  B.4 RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY The purpose of this section is to define the organizational structure and responsibilities of personnel involved in the MBSS. As multiple organizations are involved in the MBSS, adherence to the chain of authority and information outlined below is paramount to successful completion of the MBSS. A number of personnel report directly to the Project Officer-- the Training Officer, the Quality Control Officer (QC Officer), the Field Crew Supervisor for each organization involved in field sampling, and the Data Management and Analysis Officer (DM Officer). Crew Leaders report to their respective Field Crew Supervisor for day to day activities and emergencies. The responsibilities of each of these personnel are described in the following sections. B.4.1 Project Officer The MBSS Project Officer has overall responsibility for successful completion of the MBSS. Specific duties of the Project Officer include selection of subordinates, direction and approval of training activities, contractor oversight, liaison with the public and resource agencies, document review, and peer review solicitation.  B.4.2 Training Officer The Training Officer is responsible for training of all field sampling personnel. At the direction of the  18   Project Officer, the Training Officer coordinates with the QC Officer and the Field Program Leader to implement remedial or additional training deemed necessary during MBSS field sampling intervals.  B.4.3 Quality Control Officer The QC Officer is responsible for implementation of all aspects of the MBSS QA/QC program, including inspection of field crews, data validation, taxonomic verification, site confirmation, calibration and maintenance of equipment, adherence to established protocols, and prompt identification of necessary remedial or corrective actions. The QC Officer is also responsible for oversight of laboratory QA/QC managers to ensure that all MBSS laboratory activities meet MBSS QA/QC requirements.  B.4.4 Field Crew Supervisor The Field Crew Supervisor is responsible for day to day communication with Crew Leaders, coordination and approval of sampling schedules and itineraries, and other activities designated by the Project Officer.  B.4.5 Crew Leader The Crew Leader is responsible for crew safety, sample scheduling, equipment maintenance and calibration, and performance of all sample collection activities in accordance with procedures and QA/QC requirements specified in the survey manual.  B.4.6 Field Sampling Crew Members of the sampling crew are responsible for carrying out the instructions of the Crew Leader and informing the Crew Leader of any unsafe conditions, equipment, or other problems observed which could jeopardize the health and safety of the crew or the quality of sample collections.  B.5 TRAINING REQUIREMENTS An important aspect of the MBSS QA program conducted prior to sampling. Training ensures attainment by each person of a minimum level sampling must receive training as specified by crews, the QC Officer will conduct a one day vi is the training program for field personnel which will be consistent implementation of required procedures and of technical competency. All participants in MBSS field the Project Officer. To verify the competency of MBSS sit with each crew prior to the Summer Index Period.  For personnel involved in sampling during the Spring Index Period, training will include water quality and benthic macroinvertebrate sampling using MBSS procedures. In addition, at least one member of each Spring sampling crew should be experienced in stream electrofishing techniques and approved as a benthic taxonomist by the Project Officer. For personnel involved in sampling during the Summer Index Period, training will include fish and herpetofauna sampling, habitat assessment, and taxonomy tests for fish, herpetofauna, and SAV. B.6 FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT Preventive maintenance and calibration should be performed on all sampling equipment used as part  19   of the MBSS. Maintenance and calibration procedures should be implemented as per manufacturers instructions. Unless otherwise specified, calibration should be performed daily prior to equipment use and anytime equipment problems are suspected. Preventative maintenance should be performed at intervals not to exceed the frequency recommended by the manufacturer. All equipment malfunctions should be fully corrected prior to reuse. For weighing scales, weekly checks should be conducted during field sampling using NIST standards or other accepted standards to demonstrate that instrument error is within limits specified by the manufacturer. For each piece of equipment used as part of the MBSS, a bound logbook for calibration and maintenance should be maintained. Entries in the log should be made for all calibration and maintenance activities. Documentation will include detailed descriptions of all calibrations, adjustments, and replacement of parts, and each entry must be signed and dated. To insure that MBSS equipment is operated within QA/QC requirements, the QC Officer should conduct periodic site equipment audits and promptly advise the Project Officer of any recommended corrective actions.  B.7 IMPLEMENTATION OF STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES All of the standard operating procedures outlined in the MBSS sampling manual should be strictly followed. To insure that all procedures are properly implemented, the QC Officer should conduct periodic crew audits in the field. The audits should include: correctness in locating the sampling segment, field technique evaluations, verification of taxonomic identifications, completeness of data sheets and field notebooks, calibration and maintenance log review, and health and safety critique of crew activities.  B.8 INFORMATION MANAGEMENT A schematic of general information management procedures is shown in Figure 3-1.  B.8.1 Field Information Management To facilitate data recording during inclement weather, data sheets should be printed on waterproof paper. Backup copies of all field data sheets should be made at the completion of each sampling week. Rolls of film for developing should be uniquely marked and separate, uniquely labeled bags used to send film for developing. W hen developed, film slides should be uniquely marked as well and stored at room temperature under dark conditions. To ensure that all field data for the MBSS are collected and recorded in a usable manner, all data should be PRINTED in the units specified on the MBSS data sheets. No writeovers are permitted on data sheets-- the incorrect entry should be lined out and the correct entry written in an obvious spot next to the line out. Data sheets for a given site should be consecutively labeled so that the total number of data sheets generated for each site is known. Recorded data should be reviewed at the point of entry and the Crew Leader should review and initial all data sheets prior to departure from the site. Legible copies of all data sheets should be provided to the Data Management and Analysis (DM) Officer on a bi-weekly basis during sampling. Each sample collected as part of the MBSS will be assigned a sample number. The sample number will contain several unique identifiers to minimize the possibility of misidentification. In addition, chain-  20   of-custody forms should be maintained for all water sample collections.  B.8.2 Data Entry To verify that all data collected at a sampling segment is complete and acceptable, data entry of all data sheets will occur within 15 days after data sheets are received by the DM Officer. In the event that data is found to be unacceptable or incomplete, sampling can be repeated within the same index period. The DM Officer will maintain a bound logbook of all data entry information, and a back-up copy of all computerized data will be made and archived. Data entry will be accomplished using entry screens designed to emulate data sheet format. W henever possible, QA/QC checks will be embedded into data entry screens to ensure validity of data. All data will be double-entered using two different data entry operators and compared for consistency. Questionable data will be flagged and a determination of validity made by the DM Officer, the QC Officer, and the responsible Crew Leader. For all editing activities, full documentation of all changes is mandatory. Automated review procedures such as range checks, frequency distribution of coded variables, and other internal consistency checks will be designed by the DM Officer and employed for data entry verification.  B.9 DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT Assessment of data quality against the established data quality objectives will be conducted to determine the overall performance of the QA program, identify potential limitations to use and interpretation of the data, and to provide information for other data users regarding usability of the data for other purposes. The quality of MBSS data will be evaluated in several ways. Precision and bias associated with important elements of the sampling and measurement process for each variable measured will be evaluated using results from replicate sampling and performance evaluation studies. Information about precision, bias, and completeness will be used to determine the comparability of data acquired during each sampling year. After data entry, verified data will be subjected to validation procedures to identify data values which are potentially erroneous. Various univariate and multivariate statistical procedures will be used on the verified data to identify outlying observations for which additional review is necessary. At the end of each sampling year, specimens of all taxa collected must be verified by an appropriate recognized authority in fish, benthic macroinvertebrate, or amphibian taxonomy. Documentation of this verification should be included with the specimens as well as in tabular summary form. For benthic macroinvertebrates, the QC Officer will arrange for a random subset of at least 5% of the preserved benthic samples to be independently reprocessed in the laboratory. The QC Officer will prepare an annual written and tabular summary of all taxonomic-related QC activities. As an additional measure of data quality assessment, scientific peer review of activities and products of the MBSS will be conducted at the direction of the Project Officer to help verify the technical soundness and utility of the data and its interpretation.  21   Appendix C.

Trash Rating  C-8. Erosion. Greater than 50 square meters of eroded area in a 75 m long stream site was considered extensive erosion. Erosion severity was rated as 0 = no erosion, 1 = minimal erosion, 2= moderate erosion, 3= severe erosion. Both stream banks were rated for severity individually. The average for both banks is reported. An average erosion severity > 2.5 was considered severe. C-9. Land Use. Arc View software was used to generate site-specific land use and impervious surface information for each site using U.S. EPA Multi-Resolution Land Characteristic Consortium (MRLC) data. These land use data are based on Landsat TM data acquired in 1986-1993 and, as a result, do not reflect land use changes that have occurred more recently than 1993. Urban land use greater than 25% of the site catchment was considered indicative of extensive anthropogenic influence to the site. Impervious land cover greater than 10% of the site catchment has been associated with serious ecological degradation.  24"

INTRODUCTION 1.1 Project Description  During the middle decades of the twentieth century a considerable number of environmental measurements were made at a number of locations in Chesapeake Bay and its tributary rivers. Measurements included physical, chemical and limited biological variables and from these early measurements a considerable increase in understanding of estuarine physics, chemistry and biology was achieved. However, these measurements were not made in a consistent fashion and, as a result, were of limited utility in some applications. For example, dissolved nutrient measurements may have been made at a series of sites in the Patuxent River for a year or more and then efforts were relocated to a few sites in the mainstem bay. At some later time nutrient measurements were again made in the Patuxent but at different stations and at different times of the year using different sampling and analytical methodologies. A review of water quality measurements made in the Patuxent from the late 1930's until 1978 identified 44 separate studies, most of which were of too short a duration or at so limited a number of stations that detection of trends was not possible (Mihursky and Boynton, 1978). Similar problems were evident in other areas of the Bay and tributaries as well. Following completion of the first EPA Chesapeake Bay Program this serious limitation was clearly identified and a strong recommendation emerged to develop a long-term water quality monitoring program that would be capable of accurately assessing the current status of the Bay and be useful in detecting trends resulting from human activities. It was recognized that long-term measurements were needed to overcome the expected year-to-year variability due to climate variability and to ultimately assess changes due to both deleterious human activities and restoration efforts by management. This Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) describes the implementation of one component of the Maryland portion of the EPA Chesapeake Bay monitoring program described in Chesapeake Bay: A Framework for Action (EPA, 1983). This portion of the program is known as the ""Ecosystem Processes Component (EPC)."" The EPC has focused monitoring efforts in three areas including: (1) measurements of sediment influences on water column water quality; (2) description of water quality in shallow water zones of tributary rivers; and (3) monitoring epiphytic growth on seagrass leaves. Details concerning objectives and methodologies used in the EPC are contained in this report. 1.2 Objectives  The Chesapeake Bay Water Quality Monitoring Program was initiated to provide guidelines for restoration, protection and future use of the mainstem estuary and its tributaries and to provide evaluations of implemented management actions directed towards alleviating some critical pollution problems. A description of the complete monitoring program is provided in Magnien et al. (1987) and the Chesapeake Bay program web page (http://www.chesapeakebay.net and http://www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/monitoring/eco/index.html). In addition to the EPC program portion, the monitoring program also has components that measure:  May 30, 2003, Revision 8  QAPP: Ecosystem Processes Component  Page 1         Freshwater, nutrient and other pollutant input rates, chemical and physical properties of the water column, toxicant levels in sediments and organisms, phytoplankton and zooplankton community characteristics (abundances, biomass and primary production rates) and benthic community characteristics (abundances and biomass).  While early work of the EPC focused primarily on the importance of fluxes across the sedimentwater interface and the dynamics of these interactions, the program has grown and diversified since that time. It continues to diversify its research to better meet the changing goals of the monitoring program (Boynton et al., 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002). This has involved expansion of some program elements and the discontinuation of others as well as the development of tools that improve monitoring capabilities. Several years ago, EPC developed techniques to spatially evaluate sediment water fluxes in a more cost effective manner. More recently evaluation of near-shore water quality conditions relative to submerged vegetation (SAV) and SAV epiphytic growth have become an important portion of the program. Three years ago, EPC developed continuous surface water quality mapping techniques for the program. The design of this equipment has recently been updated. Additional, smaller elements, are occasionally added to the EPC program to collect small data sets for specific purposes (e.g. grain size of sediments). The current program is composed of the following complimentary study elements:  Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) habitat and restoration evaluation: SAV transplants, water quality conditions, and epiphyte accumulation rates will be measured at two locations on the Patuxent River in the latter half of 2003 and first half of 2004. Experiments will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of various SAV grazer exclusion designs.  Spatially Intensive Water Quality Monitoring (DATAFLOW): Water quality mapping using the DATAFLOW V surface water quality mapping system. This effort will provide estimates of surface water quality parameters (salinity, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, fluorescence and turbidity) and total depth at high spatial resolution (1 sample per 50-100m). Spatially intensive water quality mapping of surface waters in the Patuxent River will be conducted approximately monthly from July through October 2003 and April though June 2004. Continuous Water Quality Monitoring: High frequency measurements of various water quality parameters will be measured at 4 locations in the Patuxent River from July through October 2003 and April though June 2004. Information collected in this program is integrated with other elements of the monitoring program to gain a better understanding of the processes affecting water quality of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries and the maintenance and restoration of living resources. QAPP: Ecosystem Processes Component Page 2      May 30, 2003, Revision 8   1.3 1.3.1  Sampling Design and Data Quality Objectives Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV) Habitat Evaluation on Patuxent River  At 2 locations in the Patuxent River (Figure 1-1), a full suite of water quality parameters (Table 1-1) will be measured approximately bi-weekly from July  October 2003 and April  June 2004. Epiphyte fouling rates will be measured for 3 consecutive weeks each in the, summer and fall of 2003 and the spring of 2004 1.3.2 Spatially Intensive Water Quality Mapping: DATAFLOW V Mapping System  The sponsor (MD DNR) selected the Patuxent River for continuous surface water quality mapping operations. Each mapping cruise in the Patuxent River will follow an approximate square wave pattern frequently traversing from shallow waters (as shallow as can be navigated in safety) out to channel depths, along the channel, back into shallow waters, paralleling the shoreline, then back to the channel. Due to the likely presence of many navigational hazards and limitations due to sea conditions, the actual cruise track will be determined on the day of operation. A total of 14 mapping cruises will be completed in this tributary systems approximately biweekly from July through October 2001 and April through June 2003. The purpose of DATAFLOW is to assess the spatial variability in water quality. The spatial resolution of the data collected depends on the speed and cruise track of the vessel. However, both are constrained by time and funds available to perform a practical assessment. It has been shown (EPC Interpretive #19, Boynton et al., 2002) spatially intensive sampling can uncover patterns in water quality that are missed by single fixed station monitoring. The purpose of the calibration stations is to correlate DATAFLOW sensor output to universally measured parameters (Kd, secchi) and laboratory derived results (TSS, Chlorophyll-a) collected simultaneously. The goal of high frequency buoys is to temporally characterize water quality patterns at a particular location rather than spatial characterization. The data collected by a buoy would essentially be similar to the data collected by DATAFLOW at a single moment in time. Correlation to laboratory values or universally measured parameters would still be required.  1.3.2.1 Dataflow Calibration Stations In addition to the high-resolution data collected by DATAFLOW V, additional calibration data will be collected at 8 locations within the tributary. Two calibration stations within the tributary will also coincide with locations of DNR high-frequency data collection. The remaining sites will be selected to represent a large signal range needed for sensor calibration. At these locations, water samples will be collected for the analysis of dissolved nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll-a (active and total), phaeophytin, total suspended solids and volatile suspended solids. Measurements of PAR will be made to calculate water column light attenuation (Kd). Secchi depth measurements will be taken.

This water depth roughly corresponds to mid-water column depth at each of the near-shore stations where total water depth was approximately 1 meter mean low water. Water column physical parameters and water column nutrients were measured at this depth.  3.1.2 Physical Parameters Temperature, salinity, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen measurements were collected with a Yellow Springs International (YSI) 600R, YSI 6920 or YSI 6600 multi-parameter water quality monitor. Water column turbidity was estimated with a secchi disk, while water column light flux in the photosynthetically active frequency range (PAR) was measured with a Li-Cor LI-192SA underwater quantum sensor. Light flux measurements were collected at three discrete water depths in order to calculate water column light attenuation (Kd). Weather and sea-state conditions such as air temperature, percent cloud cover, wind speed and direction, total water depth, and wave height were also recorded.  3.1.3 Water Column Nutrients Whole water samples were collected in polyethylene jugs with a hand pump, and a portion immediately filtered with a 25 mm, 0.7 m (GF/F) glass fiber filter. Both the filtered portion and the remaining whole water samples were placed in coolers for transport back to the laboratory for further processing. The filtered portion was analyzed by the NASL for ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO2-), nitrite plus nitrate (NO2- + NO3-) and phosphate (PO4-3). Whole water portions were filtered in the laboratory using 47 mm 0.7 m (GF/F) glass fiber filters and were analyzed by NASL for the following particulate nutrients: volatile suspended solids (VSS), and total and active chlorophyll-a concentrations where total chlorophyll-a includes chlorophyll-a plus breakdown products. On each dataflow cruise water samples are collected at 8 stations and analyzed for chlorophyll-a, TSS and VSS using the same methods described in Section 4.  3.2  Epiphyte Growth Measurement Method  In order to assess the light attenuation potential of epiphytic growth on the leaves of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), artificial substrata in the form of thin strips of Mylar polyester plastic May 30, 2003, Revision 8 QAPP: Ecosystem Processes Component Page 9   were deployed at each of the six near-shore stations for periods of 6 throughout the sampling season, replicate strips exposed to natural new strips deployed. The use of transparent Mylar provided attenuation due to epiphytic growth and sediment accumulation, organic and inorganic components of the fouling.  8 days. fouling a mean as well  During each cruise were retrieved and s to estimate light as to quantify the  3.2.1 Description of Epiphyte Collector Arrays Each collector array (Figure 3-2.) consists of a square PVC frame situated horizontally with a vertical PVC shaft oriented in the center of the square. To this shaft is attached a line with a small surface float that allows for easy location of the collector. Each collector array holds six strips per deployment. Mylar  strips (2.5 cm wide x 51 cm long and 0.7 mil thick) are attached to the frame so that the top is allowed to move freely in the water column. Small foam floats (~3.5 x 3.3 cm) are attached to the top of the strip to help maintain a vertical position in the water column at all times. 3.2.2 Sampling the Epiphyte Collector Arrays To retrieve the epiphyte collector strips, each collector array is gently removed from the water and suspended from the gunwale of the vessel. A single representative Mylar strip is removed each for chlorophyll-a and VSS analysis. The pre-marked 5 inch center section of each strip is cut into smaller pieces and placed in a 60ml centrifuge tube. The tubes are placed in an ice filled cooler for transport back to the laboratory. Upon arrival at the laboratory, the tubes are immediately frozen and transferred to NASL for further processing. The variation in epiphyte accumulation on Mylar strips within a single site for a single deployment is quite small but depends on the location being monitored. Maximum % standard error (%SE) among strips is 25% total accumulation for both epiphyte chlorophyll-a or epiphyte dry mass.  3.2.3  Processing Total Epiphyte Material  Sections of Mylar strips collected for TSS/VSS analysis are scraped of all material and rinsed with distilled water and diluted to a fixed volume (400 - 500 ml). The solution is mixed as thoroughly as possible on a stir plate until homogenized. A small aliquot (10 to 50 ml) is then extracted with a glass pipette and filtered through a 47 mm 0.7 m (GF/F) glass fiber filter. Once filtered, the pads were immediately frozen and delivered to NASL for analysis.  May 30, 2003, Revision 8  QAPP: Ecosystem Processes Component  Page 10   a.

The system collects water "") deployed on the transom of the vessel, pumps it through an array of water discharges the water overboard.  DATAFLOW V is a use in a small boat through a pipe (""ram quality sensors, then  May 30, 2003, Revision 8  QAPP: Ecosystem Processes Component  Page 11   3.3.1 Water Quality Instrumentation DATAFLOW V (Figure 3-3) has a YSI 6600 Sonde equipped with a flow through chamber. The sensors include a Clark-type YSI 6562 DO probe, a YSI 6560 conductivity/temperature probe, a 6026 turbidity probe, and a 6025 chlorophyll probe. The sonde transmits data collected from the sensors to a YSI 650 data logger. On each dataflow cruise water samples are collected at 8 stations and analyzed for chlorophyll-a, TSS and VSS using the same methods described in Section 4. 3.3.2 Positioning and Depth Information  DATAFLOW V is equipped with a hand-held Garmin e-Trex global positioning system and a Garmin 168 global positioning system with a built in depth sounder. The Garmin e-Trex GPS transmits position data to the YSI 650 data logger through a NMEA 0183 version 2.0 data format. The data logger matches the position data with sensor data for each observation. Positioning errors are expected to be less than 15 m. The Garmin 168 GPS transmits NMEA data to a Procomm Plus communication program running on a Wescor RDT 3200 portable computer. The data is transmitted in a NMEA 0183 version 2.3 data format. The data is then processed through a Perl program. This removes time, position, and depth data. The depth data is then merged with the data collected from the YSI 650 data logger through a SAS program and then put into an Excel file.  3.3.3 Flow Meter DATAFLOW V is equipped with an inline flow meter. Although the flow rate does not affect any of the sensor readings, decreased flow is an indication of either a partial blockage or an interruption of water flow to the instrument. Thus, the flow data is used in the field as a diagnostic tool to ensure that the instrument is working properly and later as a quality assurance tool, to verify that water flow was uninterrupted. A boat horn is wired to the flow meter. If the flow is interrupted and the flow rate falls below 3.0 l s-1, the horn sounds and warns the operators that a problem must be corrected.

A centrifugal pump mounted on the ram (""ram pump"") pulls up the seawater. The water runs through a flow meter that is wired to a horn that sounds if the flow rate falls below 3 l s-1. If flow is interrupted during sampling, the horn sounds informing operators that a problem exists. The water exits the flow meter and enters the YSI flow-through chamber. The water runs across the sensor probes and exits the flow-through chamber before being discharged overboard. The displays for the YSI 650 data logger, Garmin 168 GPS, Garmin e-Trex GPS, flow meter display, and RDT 3200 are located on the instrument platform.

(2003) QAPP DNR: Shallow Water Quality Monitoring Program, April 1, 2003  June 30, 2004 (Draft, page 7). Each continuous monitor records seven water quality parameters every 15 minutes. The seven water quality parameters measured are water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen concentration, dissolved oxygen saturation, turbidity (NTU), fluorescence (used to estimate chlorophyll a) and pH. Meters are located at a constant depth of one meter below the surface of the water. Each monitoring station is equipped with a YSI 6600 Sonde. The Sonde transmits the data from the sensors to a YSI 650 data logger. Meters are suspended from a float inside of PVC pipes with three-inch holes drilled along their length to allow for water exchange. In addition to the parameters measured by the Sonde, Secchi depth and light attenuation are measured weekly from May to October, and grab samples are taken. See Appendix E-2 for a description of the filtering procedures. The processed samples are sent to Chesapeake Biological Laboratory for analysis. These results are used to calibrate the meters and to check the YSI data for accuracy. The samples are also analyzed for chemical parameters that cannot be observed by the YSI meters. Parameters analyzed at the laboratory are chlorophyll a (total and active), total dissolved nitrogen, particulate nitrogen, nitrite, nitrite + nitrate, ammonium, total dissolved phosphorus, particulate phosphorus, orthophosphate, dissolved organic carbon, particulate carbon, silica, total suspended solids, volatile suspended solids.  4. LABORATORY ANALYSIS Methods for the determination of dissolved and particulate nutrients are as follows: ammonium (NH4+), nitrite (NO2-), nitrite plus nitrate (NO2- + NO3-), and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP or PO4-) are measured using the automated method of EPA (1979); particulate carbon (PC) and particulate nitrogen (PN) samples are analyzed using an Elemental Analyzer; particulate phosphorus (PP) concentration is obtained by acid digestion of muffled-dry samples (Aspila et al., 1976); methods of Strickland and Parsons (1972) and Parsons et al. (1984) are followed for chlorophyll-a analysis, silicate (Si), total dissolve nitrogen (TDN), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate inorganic phosphorus (PIP). All analytical (laboratory) parameters are analyzed at the University of Maryland's Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL), Nutrient Analytical Services Laboratory.

DATA MANAGEMENT, VERIFICATION AND DOCUMENTATION The objectives of QA/QC standards are to provide accurate measurement of water quality and SAV parameters in Patuxent River. Over the years that the EPC has been making measurements consistent protocols have been developed in the field. Together with laboratory procedures already in place and used by NASL and data management procedures, the data obtained can be analyzed and interpreted so that the final report submitted will meet the objectives stated for this study. Information derived from the report will be useful to managers making decisions concerning Patuxent River. 5.1 QA/QC Field Checks  Cruises are scheduled well ahead of time with Research Fleet Operations (RFO). A schedule for activities for each day of the individual cruises is submitted to the PI and other members of staff. Cruises that are canceled due to weather or mechanical problems with the research vessel are rescheduled. Rather than take field duplicates, samples are collected at 8 stations to capture the variability throughout the study site. Due to tidal transport returning to the initial station would not produce comparable results: it would be equivalent to taking another calibration station. 5.2 QA/QC Continuous Water Quality Monitoring  From: Michael et al. (2003) QAPP DNR: Shallow Water Quality Monitoring Program, April 1, 2003  June 30, 2004 (Draft page 9). The continuous meters are retrieved, calibrated and replaced weekly from May to October and every two weeks from November to April at the year round sites. The meters are replaced with clean, recalibrated units and the stored data from the data logger are downloaded into a computer spreadsheet. These data are then subjected to quality assurance/quality control checks by field personnel ensuring that values are not out of range. For example, values below those values listed in Table 5-1 are evaluated carefully to ensure that they are real values. See Appendix E-3 for more details on the Field Staff QA/QC procedures. Table 5-1. Values below which continuous monitoring data are carefully evaluated for validity. Parameter Value Chlorophyll-a 5% of true value Conductivity, specific 5% of true value Dissolved Oxygen 0.5 mg l-1 pH 0.2 pH units Turbidity 5% of true value Water Temperature 0.2 C May 30, 2003, Revision 8 QAPP: Ecosystem Processes Component Page 15   At the end of the monitoring season, additional data QA/QC procedures are conducted by DNR office personnel at the Tawes Office. Staff plot all the data and then thoroughly research any outliers or other odd values. For example, we compare unusual values to historic values and values elsewhere in the Bay, consider weather events, and consult with field staff regarding possible legitimate causes for those values. In cases where values are not legitimate, they are deleted from the dataset with the approval of the field staff and the Quality Assurance Officer. 5.2 Preparation of Collection Gear  During the last few days prior to initiating a research cruise all the necessary equipment involved in the collection of water and sediment samples, incubation of sediment cores and collection of physical water quality data are inventoried according to ""checklists"". All equipment is checked to insure that it is fully operational and has been properly cleaned. The equipment in packed into containers that provide for easy transport and loaded aboard the research vessel. The ""checklist"" is then re-examined to verify the presence of all necessary gear. Standards and reagents involved in the calibration of instrumentation are made according to a schedule of shelf life (i.e. daily, weekly or seasonally) or if the supply is exhausted. All chemicals are handled, prepared and stored in accordance with standard laboratory practices. Lost samples are a rarity and in those instances a code is inserted into the data to record the problems encountered (See Section 5.3.1.2). Details of sample collection are found in Appendix A. 5.2.1 Potential Contamination  During the course of a research cruise different steps are taken to insure that the chances for contamination are minimized. These practices involve almost constant washing of equipment during the course of a cruise. All containers used to collect bulk raw water are rinsed with copious amounts of sample (station) water before they are filled and are thoroughly acid washed and then rinsed with deionized water at the end of the cruise. Containers from which samples will be taken for chemical analysis are rinsed additionally with deionized water. All containers into which are placed water and sediment samples for chemical analysis (after being fully processed) are single use/disposable plastic vials and centrifuge tubes that require no cleaning. All syringes and other laboratory equipment used in processing these samples are washed with deionized water between each use. All glassware associated with the preparation of standards and reagents is cleaned with copious amounts deionized water and acid washed when appropriate. 5.2.2 Calibration Procedures and Frequency  All instruments (YSI 6920/600/6600) involved in the collection of physical water quality data (temperature, conductivity, salinity and dissolved oxygen) are calibrated weekly, with the exception of dissolved oxygen calibration, which occurs prior to each cruise and incorporates a May 30, 2003, Revision 8 QAPP: Ecosystem Processes Component Page 16   standard air calibration based on air temperature and barometric pressure. Conductivity/salinity is calibrated with a 0.10 molar standard of potassium chloride. Temperature is calibrated by the manufacturer only when the instrument is returned for service. All instruments are maintained in accordance with manufacturers specifications. Standards and reagents involved in the calibration of instrumentation are made according to a schedule of shelf life (i.e. daily, weekly or seasonally) or if the supply is exhausted. All chemicals are handled, prepared and stored in accordance with standard laboratory practices. If any apparent problems arise the instrument is removed from use until the malfunction can be diagnosed and remedied. All of the sensors for the continuous surface water quality mapping system must be calibrated. The conductivity sensor, water temperature sensor, dissolved oxygen sensor and transmissometer are calibrated in the laboratory again known standards. These standards are as follows: Parameter Specific Conductance Dissolved Oxygen Tranmissometer Fluorometer Calibration Method 10 mmol KCl Air Calibration Turbidity Standards / Field Calibration Laboratory Standard / Field Calibration  Laboratory calibrations are performed daily for dissolved oxygen and conductivity also occasionally for transmittance and flourescence. Although laboratory air calibrations are performed for the dissolved oxygen sensor, several Winkler titrations are performed regularly to ensure proper calibration. For transmittance and fluorescence, the manufacturer recommends that the instrument be calibrated against in-situ properties measured in the field. A variable number of water samples are collected in a field deployment that are analyzed for total and active chlorophyll-a and total suspended solids concentrations. These field standards are related to sensor readings via regression procedures. An example of the calibration curve derived for chlorophyll-a is shown in Figure 5-1. Note that each cruise has its own calibration curve.

Valid entries from the 1989) are used and where necessary additional codes added. 5.3.1.3 Data Tables QA/QC Control Data recorded by instruments in the field are entered directly onto specially prepared data sheets. A blank data set for each data set is included in Appendix C. Data from samples analyzed by NASL are returned in written format. Data are keyed into Microsoft Excel using the specific data set layout developed during the continuing effort begun in August 1989 to standardize all EPC data files. Hard copies of the files are manually checked for errors. Data files are corrected, a second printout produced which is re-verified by a different staff member. 5.3.1.4 Spatially Intensive Water Quality Mapping - Raw Data Sets The data are electronically transferred from the datalogger to a computer at the end of each day of sampling. The data are stored as an ASCII text file. This file is retained indefinitely as the original record of the data collection.

Wherever possible the EPC abbreviations for variables are used. Additional information regarding the format of the data and details of variable labels, file structure and data and sampling anomalies are to be submitted as a metadata file to fulfill the requirements of the EPA Chesapeake Bay Liaison Office (EPA/CBLO). 5.3.2.1 Spatially Intensive Water Quality Mapping - Processing of Data Very little post-processing is required before the data can be used. However, there are two kinds of problems that occur occasionally: misread positioning information and erroneous values caused by electronic noise. Both problems can usually be detected easily by visually scanning the data, by calculating summary statistics, or by calculating the difference between successive observations. Post-calibrations of the transmissometer, fluorometer and dissolved oxygen sensors are applied to the Excel data sets.

WATER QUALITY MEASUREMENTS (Filename: WCNDyyyy, Appendix C-2.1) contains temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen data measured at 0.5 meters below the water surface. WATER COLUMN LIGHT ATTENUATION MEASUREMENTS (Filename: WCLTyyyy, Appendix C-2.2) reports photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measurements. **NOTE: This data table will be changed to accommodate the new on board measurement of Kd values for each station. WATER COLUMN NUTRIENT MEASUREMENTS (Filename: WCNTyyyy, Appendix C-2.3) contains dissolved nutrients, and chlorophyll-a (active and total) concentrations in the surface waters at each station. EPIPHYTE BIOMASS MEASUREMENTS (Filename: ECHLyyyy, Appendix C-2.4) contains epiphyte chlorophyll-a concentrations (total and active), (Filename: Raw data file - EVLRyyyy, Appendix C-2.5; Mean data file EVLMyyyy, Appendix C-2.6) contains total epiphyte dry weight and percent inorganic fraction measurements.  5.4.2 Spatially Intensive Water Quality Mapping Data Sets Two data sets that due to the sheet is found data sets using contain the continuous surface water quality measurements, however please note large quantity of data no hard copy of the data is submitted, but a single parameter in Appendix B.

Filename DFslMDmmddyy (where sl = sample designation, e.g. PX = Patuxent River), the screened data set contains: date, time, latitude, longitude for each record of water temperature, salinity (ppt), dissolved oxygen (g l-1), fluorescence (g l-1) and May 30, 2003, Revision 8 QAPP: Ecosystem Processes Component Page 20   transmissometer values (NTU). In addition, includes estimated active chlorophyll-a, total chlorophyll-a and light attenuation coefficient based on the raw instrument readings and the field calibrations.  5.5  Preparation and Checking of Data Tables  Epiphyte data from samples analyzed by NASL are returned in written format. Data are keyed into a spreadsheet format from the original data sheets developed for the program and hard copies are printed and checked against the original data by a separate staff member. Data files also contain the last revision date for each file.  5.6  Measurement of Kd  Down welling light penetrating the water column (Photosynthetically Available Radiation, or PAR) is measured underwater at several depths to calculate the light attenuation coefficient, Kd. Simultaneous deck and submersed PAR measurements are taken to account for variability in incident surface irradiance due to changing atmospheric conditions (i.e. cloud cover). The equipment employed includes an LI-192SA flat cosine Underwater Quantum Sensor, an LI190SA air (deck) reference sensor, and an LI-1400 Data Logger. 5.6.1 Kd Calculations  Light measurements are taken simultaneously of both surface (I0) and submarine PAR intensity (Iz+n). Submarine PAR is measured at the surface (0.1 meters), and successive intervals thereafter (Iz+1, Iz+2,...Iz+n). Each deck reading is normalized to an arbitrary deck reading of 2000 mmol m-2 sec-1 and the simultaneously recorded submarine reading is multiplied by this ratio to correct the individual submersed readings of each profile for any difference in solar insolation intensity during the profile. The attenuation coefficient (Kd) is then calculated as: Kz, z+n  =  ln(Iz+n/Iz+ Z  (n-1))  where: Kz,z+n Iz+n Iz+(n-1) Z = = = = attenuation normalized normalized difference i coefficient (m-1) over the depth interval z+n, z+(n-1) PAR intensity at depth z+n (mmol m-2s-1), i.e. deeper value PAR intensity z+(n-1) depth (mmol m-2s-1) n depth (m) between z+n, z+(n-1)  The natural log of each normalized PAR value is plotted on the x-axis vs. depth. The slope of the line times (-1.0) is Kd. May 30, 2003, Revision 8 QAPP: Ecosystem Processes Component Page 21   6.  PROJECT QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL  For information related to parameter accuracy and precision please refer to Table 2-2. 6.1 Audit  The NASL at the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory provides nutrient analyses to University, State and Federal agencies. As part of the laboratory's QA/QC program, NASL participates in cross calibration exercises with other institutions and agencies whenever possible. Refer to D'Elia et al. (1997) for specific details but some examples include:   Particulate carbon and nitrogen cross calibration with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Horn Point Environmental Laboratory. International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) inorganic nutrient round-robin communication. The fourth international intercomparison report was published in 1991 (Kirkwood, Aminot and Perttil, 1991). Comparisons of dissolved nutrient analyses conducted at Horn Point Environmental Laboratory, Bigelow Laboratory, the University of Delaware and the University of New Hampshire. Quarterly cross calibration exercises with Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) and Old Dominion University (ODU). The most recent inter-comparison (November 1995) confirmed all parameters routinely analyzed by these laboratories as part of the Chesapeake Bay Monitoring Program. Samples from various saltiness and nutrient regimes were analyzed under this exercise. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) unknown audits for various nutrients have been conducted. EPA audits of known nutrients were analyzed using samples in different salinity water while looking for possible matrix effects.        NASL has analyzed National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and National Research Board of Canada reference materials, primarily estuarine sediment, as a check for their particulate and sediment carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus methods. As part of the Chesapeake Bay Mainstem Monitoring Program, the laboratory analyzes approximately ten percent of the total sample load for QA/QC checks. These samples include laboratory duplicates and spike analyses. Two audits are completed each year, the most recent was completed in winter 2002 (February).  May 30, 2003, Revision 8  QAPP: Ecosystem Processes Component  Page 22   Specific EPC procedures include inorganic nitrogen (ammonium [NH4+], nitrite [NO2-], nitrite plus nitrate [NO2- + NO3-] and dissolved inorganic phosphorus [DIP or PO4-3] for which a standard curve usually comprising five concentrations encompassing the expected range for that particular sample set, are analyzed at the beginning of each new run. A standard, which is treated as a sample, is analyzed at least every 20 samples. Baseline corrections are determined either manually or automatically, depending on the instrument providing the analysis. Data needed to calculate concentrations are recorded along with the sample concentration in laboratory notebooks, a carbon copy of which is provided to the EPC group. This procedure is also carried out for other parameters performed by the laboratory in support for the EPC effort. Precision and limits of detection for the variables are included in D'Elia et al. (1997) and included as part of the sampling procedure in Appendix A.  6.2  Sample Custody  Upon arrival at NASL, samples are counted, observed for potential problems (melting, broken containers, etc.) and placed in a freezer until analysis. Sample information and date of arrival are recorded on a log sheet.  6.3  Instrument Maintenance and records are kept of hours of A critical spare parts inventory is is minimized by troubleshooting service representatives. Spare parts  Analytical instruments are maintained on a regular basis operation, scheduled maintenance, pump tube changes, etc. maintained for each instrument. Instrument down-time instrument problems telephonically with manufacturers and can be received within 24 hours via next-day air service.  7. DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORTING 7.1 Analysis of existing data  The PI has analyzed and reported water quality information of the Chesapeake Bay and related tributaries including the Potomac, Patuxent, Choptank and Susquehanna Rivers since 1985. Two data sets, the Vertical Flux Array (VFX) data set and the Sediment Oxygen and Nutrient Exchanges (SONE) data set are now complete. Yearly technical reports have been submitted continuously since 1984, published results and numerous presentations have been made at various program review and professional meetings. Various smaller studies with particular reference to distinct ecologically important aspects of the EPC program have been completed, data collected, analyzed and the results included in the final report. The PI has also suggested new areas where additional data could improve the quality of the EPC study, e.g. the inclusion of the spatially intensive resolution bottom water chlorophyll-a mapping to improve the spatial dynamics of the study.

AND FIELD METHOD NO."" in each of the descriptions of parameters in this section were originally coded following the guidelines outlined in: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 1989. The Sediment Data Management Plan, Chesapeake Bay Program. United States Environmental Protection Agency, CBP/TRS 29/89. This plan was made available to us when the first data dictionary for the EPC program was compiled in 1990. At this time we have reviewed and wherever possible we have standardized and used water quality parameter abbreviations, ""NEW_METHOD"" codes from the CBP Water Quality Database (1984 - present) Data Dictionary (http://www.chesapeakebay.net/data/index.html the online data dictionary at the Chesapeake Information Management System (CIMS) Data Hub http://www.chesapeakebay.net/cims/index.htm), incorporating them into our document. We have not changed sediment or SAV parameters.  May 31, 2002, Revision 6 QAPP: Ecosystem Processes Component: Appendix A   A-1.

The upper surface is divided into four equal quadrants and are colored so that the two quadrants opposite each other are black and the intervening ones are white. Readings with the secchi disk are made in-situ without the aid of sunglasses. The secchi disk is lowered into the water and the depth at which it is no longer visible is recorded. For use in spatially intensive water quality measurements, the secchi depth reading is taken near the stern of the vessel and the time at which the reading is taken is noted (to the second) from the Global Positioning System. This facilitates later matching of secchi depth readings with transmissometer data.

(2003) QAPP DNR: Shallow Water Quality Monitoring Program, April 1, 2003  June 30, 2004 (Appendix 1, Appendix 2, Appendix 3, Appendix 4).   E-1. Continuous Monitoring Procedures Installation:  To collect seamless continuous data, two instruments are needed for each site. Deploy the first instrument at the site for a week. At the end of the week, replace this instrument with the second instrument. During the next week, post-calibrate and clean the first instrument and prepare it to be deployed the next week.  Use a 4"" diameter PVC pipe to install a site. The length depends on the depth of the selected site.  Coat the PVC pipe with an effective anti-fouling paint to prevent biological contamination.  Drill 2"" holes down the length of the PVC pipe to allow water to pass through the tube.  Attach the tube to a wooden 2x4 using two clevis hangers. Then attach the 2x4 to a piling or pier using lag bolts.  Place a chain through the tube, and lock it with a combination or key lock to prevent theft or vandalism. Calibration:  Calibrate each instrument using laboratory quality standards directly prior to each deployment (see Michael et al. (2002) Appendix XA. YSI6600cal revised.doc).  Synchronize the internal clock in the instrument and all watches with the official time. The official time is available by calling 410-844-1212. Deployment:  Deploy the instrument at a fixed site at a regular interval, e.g., weekly.  Leave the instrument that was deployed the prior week in place, while suspending the freshly calibrated instrument at the same depth, right next to the ""old"" one. Allow both instruments to take at least one simultaneous reading in order to compare the data from the two instruments. This comparison is used during QA/QC process to ensure both instruments were taking accurate measurements  Use a Hydrolab instrument with a display unit to take an additional simultaneous reading. The real-time display makes it possible to note any sudden fluctuations or trends in the water quality parameters.  At exact time of sample reading, take a grab sample using a Kemmerer type apparatus. Sample Processing :  Grab sample is filtered immediately after it is taken. Sample is filtered according to Chesapeake Bay Program protocol (Appendix 3-2. Continuous Monitoring Filtering methods).  Processed sample is iced down, and sent to lab for analysis.  May 30, 2003, Revision 8 QAPP: Ecosystem Processes Component: Appendix E  Page E-i   Retrieval:  After both instruments have been allowed to take at least one simultaneous reading, remove the ""old"" instrument. Brushed out the instrument tube with a Webster-type brush, on the inside and outside. Deploy the fresh instrument in its place. Wrap the ""old"" instrument in a damp towel and take it back to the lab for post-calibration and cleaning. Post-calibration/cleaning:  Post-calibrate each retrieved instrument against laboratory standards to ensure that it was taking accurate measurements (see Appendix XA. YSI6600cal revised.doc)  After completion of post-calibration, thoroughly clean each instrument and prepare it for re-deployment the following week.

Continuous Monitoring Filtering Methods Filter    apparatus set up: Three port manifold for one Chlorophyll-a 47mm magnetic bell and frit Two pc/pn 25mm Polysulfone filter funnels with twist-lock coupling bell and frit Two 500mL sidearm Erlenmeyer flasks with two 47mm magnetic bell and frit for TSS/PP One 1000mL sidearm Erlenmeyer flask as a trap in between pump and filtering apparatus Steps:  Begin filtering begins within five minutes of collecting the raw water sample.  Transfer water from the Alpha bottle to a 1000ml Nalgene bottle.  Shake the bottle prior to filtering to ensure that the sample is mixed and no settling occurs.  First filter chlorophyll a.  Rinse a clean bell and frit with deionized water to ensure their cleanliness.  Place a Whatmann 47-mm diameter, GF/F 0.7 m glass fiber filter pad - on the filter frit with a clean pair of forceps.  Rinse a graduated cylinder three times with the sample water to prevent contamination, and measure out and filter the raw water.  Filter enough sample water to produce a solid color on the pad.  Do not filter chlorophyll a for more than five minutes and keep the vacuum pressure below 10 inches of mercury to prevent the cells from lysing.  When all measured sample water has been drawn through the pad, shut off the vacuum, and write the station, date, and volume of water filtered on a foil.  Fold the pad in half with the clean pair of forceps, placed in the foil, and put on ice.  At all times try to minimize the exposure of direct sunlight to the chlorophyll sample.  Next filter particulate carbon and particulate nitrogen (pc/pn).  Thoroughly clean bells and frits with deionized water and set up the filter apparatuses.  Use two pre-combusted 25mm GF/F 0.7 m filter pads to filter a measured volume through each pad (same volume for each).  Prior to filtering, agitate the 1000ml Nalgene bottle, and rinse the graduated cylinder three times.  Filter sample water until there is noticeable color left on each pad.  Again, write the station, date, and volume on a foil, fold both pads in half, place them in the foil, and store on ice.  Finally, filter for total suspended solids and particulate phosphorus (TSS/PP).  This filtering process includes saving filtrate for dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphorus, nitrate-nitrate, nitrate, ammonium, silica, and dissolved organic carbon.  Use two pre-weighed 47-mm diameter GF/F 0.7-um pads to filter the raw sample water.  Place the pads on two thoroughly deionized water-rinsed bells and frits.  Draw an initial 50-ml of sample water though the pads as a rinse.  After using the rinse to the clean the flask, discard all of the rinse.  May 30, 2003, Revision 8 QAPP: Ecosystem Processes Component: Appendix E  Page E-iii               Using a pre-rinsed graduated cylinder, filter a measured volume of sample water through each pad (same volume for both pads). Taking the filtrate, rinse four auto-analyzer(AA) vials and caps three times and fill them 7/8 full. Next, rinse a glass test tube, cap, and a weighed, self-leveling 10-ml graduated cylinder three times with filtrate, and measure 10-mL carefully into the test tube. Fill a 50-mL teflon test tube last. Rinse the test tube and cap three times with filtrate and fill them 3/4 full. Replace the bells and frits to the flasks and vacuum pressure and both pads undergo three cycles of deionized rinsing to remove as much salinity from the pads as possible. Then, write the station, date, and volume (including the first 50-mL of rinse) on a foil, and fold the pads in half and place them in the foil. Place all samples (tubes and foil) on ice. Upon returning to the field office, place the three foil pouches (Chl-a, PC/PN, and TSS/PP), three AA vials (nitrate-nitrate, nitrate, and ammonium), and the glass (dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphorus) and teflon (dissolved organic carbon) tubes for each station in the freezer at -20 C. Place the fourth AA vial from each station in a refrigerator (4 C) to preserve the silica sample.  May 30, 2003, Revision 8 QAPP: Ecosystem Processes Component: Appendix E  Page E-iv   E-3. Continuous Monitoring Field Staff QA/QC Procedures C. Trumbauer Revised: 9/5/2002 Make sure the parameters are arranged in the following order: Date, Time, Temp, Sp.Cond, Salinity, DO%, DOconc, pH, Turbidity, Chl, Fluor Export files from Ecowatch into .CDF format. Keep the same filename and save in the same location. Using Microsoft Excel, open the .CDF file, choosing ""comma"" when prompted for delimiters. Delete all data that were taken when the meter was not in the water on station. Use the logbooks to determine this time. Identify any suspicious data by inspecting the original data graph in Ecowatch. Common anomalies include abnormal spikes in chlorophyll and turbidity, abnormal dips in specific conductance, and abnormally high dissolved oxygen readings due to high dissolved oxygen charge. If you use the Ecowatch graph to identify outliers, you must locate and delete the outliers manually from the data set in MS Excel. Make sure to cut and paste the data into an outlier file. You must save any deleted data in an Excel file, e.g., ""MAG006 outliers."" Postcalibration and in-situ field checks should also be used to identify when probes are reading incorrectly. Any data removed for this reason must also be saved in the outlier file. This information will all be used to prepare a metadata file documenting all anomalous data, whether deleted or not. Do not be too quick to delete data. Deleting data is necessary to remove obvious outliers from the data set. Strange things can and do occur in Maryland waters, and we do not want to delete an anomaly just because it seems out of place. Anomalies should be identified, but must not be deleted unless there is proper justification. If you feel a period of data is questionable, but should not be excluded, keep it in the data set, but mention it in both the weekly report and the metadata file. Now save the data file as the same name, replacing the old file. It should appear as ""MAG106.cdf"" (with the quotes.) Next open the .CDF file in Ecowatch (for some reason it is better if you exit completely out of Excel). When opening a .CDF file in Ecowatch, it will convert to PC6000 (.DAT) format and prompt to save a filename. Use the same filename as the .CDF file, except add ""X"" to the end to signify the file has received QA/QC (this will distinguish it from the ""raw"" .DAT file). Once you open the new file, inspect the graphs to identify any anomalies that passed through the first QA/QC inspection. If necessary, remove any more outlying data. Once you are satisfied with the file, close Ecowatch. In addition to a .DAT file, we also need a .CSV file for the database on DNR's website.

GX019-94-7391346	"Maryland Water Monitoring Strategy               contact: William P. Stack ( Bill.Stack@baltimorecity.gov )                      INTRODUCTION     Maryland has a wealth of water resources that serve a variety of needs - as    drinking water sources, for industrial processes and cooling, for power generation,    for agriculture, for recreational uses, as a transportation medium for cargo    and passenger vessels, as a nursery and harvesting arena for important fish    and shellfish species, and as vehicle for waste products. In spite of the variety    and extent of water resources in Maryland, however, water resources of desired    quality are limited. Managing these finite water resources for competing uses    requires up-to-date information about the water quality and quantity. This report    describes the State’s plan to monitor its water resources.   ‘Water monitoring’ is the effort to obtain quantitative information about the    physical, chemical, biological, and/or aesthetic characteristics that define    the quality of water and/or the volume, rate of flow or amount or load of a    defined constituent being transported defining the quantity of water. The Intergovernmental    Task Force on Monitoring Water Quality (ITFM, 1995), defined “water monitoring”    as an integrated activity that addresses specific characteristics of water (physical,    chemical and biological) for differing reasons (human health, ecological conditions,    defined uses, management measures). These ‘characteristics’ may include not    only direct measures of water conditions, but they also may include summary    ‘indicators’ of water (EPA, 1998).   Water monitoring often is considered as the process of collecting samples or    data. In defining a monitoring plan, however, there are other aspects of monitoring    that should be addressed, including: data acquisition (network design, quality    assurance/quality control, laboratory analysis, data handling, data analysis),    data utilization (Sanders, et al. 1983), planning, communication and coordination.    Each of these is an essential issue in this monitoring strategy.   The term, “monitoring”, implies constant oversight, however, it is often not    possible or it would be prohibitively expensive to continuously measure water    conditions at a location or to measure these conditions at all points in a selected    body of water. Even “continuous” measurements of some water conditions (e.g.,    flow rate, temperature, dissolved oxygen) are really measurements recorded at    shorter time intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes, every hour) than other programs    are likely to sample. It should be noted that when efforts to continuously monitor    specific water conditions are contemplated, procedures to handle, store, review    and analyze these large datasets must be considered.   Rather than developing a method to continuously monitor water conditions, a    sampling of representative conditions is the most efficient means to effectively    monitor the environment. Monitored chemical and physical characteristics often    are affected by the physical properties of water (e.g., high specific heat,    coefficient of diffusion) and often represent a continuous distribution of data    with a high level of serial correlation. In other words, changes in physical    and chemical water conditions usually occur slowly; sudden changes are rare    events and few water monitoring variables have discontinuous distributions of    data. Consequently, for many variables, it is reasonable to extrapolate sampling    information to estimate physical and chemical conditions elsewhere in the water    body and/or at other times.   There are times, however, when identifying living resource conditions or focusing    on sudden changes in other water conditions can be a management goal. For example,    monitoring stormwater runoff, modeling waste discharges, estimating pollutant    loading, identifying toxic Pfiesteria outbreaks, sampling bacterial flora, exotic,    rare or endangered species and sediment toxicant levels, are examples where    rare, rapidly changing or discontinuous distributions of information are encountered.    These may require specific sampling strategies or analytical tools to obtain    representative data for analyses.   As a management tool, water monitoring is identified as a starting point of    the management process and as a feedback mechanism to identify how management    efforts have affected water conditions ( Figure 1 ). At    times, monitoring may serve only a single purpose - either in terms of identifying    water conditions or as feedback to a management decision.            Figure 1. Role of monitoring within a water management framework.       Rationale for an updated strategy      A monitoring strategy should be flexible and updated periodically to:        include modifications to existing programs,      accommodate new monitoring efforts and changes in overall monitoring goals      and objectives,      address new problems, and      identify links to other monitoring programs.    Maryland's basic Statewide water monitoring activities are principally conducted  by two agencies. Water monitoring programs within the Department of the Environment  (MDE) principally address regulatory issues (e.g., permit compliance and modeling,  evaluation of water quality standards, shellfish sanitation, Total Maximum Daily  Loads) while those programs within the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) principally  address ambient water quality and aquatic resource issues. Although the goals  of many basic water monitoring efforts in Maryland have remained unchanged since  their inception, water management issues today are far more complicated.   Implementation of federal Water Pollution Control Act amendments have resulted    in significantly improved wastewater treatment with measurably lower levels    of pollution being discharged to our waterways. Attention is now focused on    other water quality issues (in addition to point source pollution). Rapidly    changing land uses have notably increased nonpoint source pollution impacts    and affected available water supplies in areas that were not affected by point    source pollution in the past. New research findings about pollution impacts    on aquatic resources and human health, better analytical methods, and computerized    modeling have all provided better tools and information about water impacts.    Also, increased population increases the burden on available water supplies    and uses and increases the public perception of environmental quality and expectation    of good and adequate water supplies.   Decision-makers need to address new questions: issues affecting aquatic resources    (impacts of toxic substances, identifying migration barriers, harmful exotic    species, declining stocks, endangered species), human health impacts (waterborne    disease, harmful algal blooms, contaminated fish, drinking water quality/quantity),    nonpoint source pollution to surface and ground waters, atmospheric deposition,    cumulative impacts (total maximum daily loads, sediment toxicity, water use/withdrawals).    To address some of these new, specific water quality questions, new water monitoring    programs have been developed and implemented. For other issues, agencies have    worked to develop a more holistic, watershed-wide approach that may require    integration of traditional chemical and physical measures with biological and    habitat data and toxicological information. These programs and approaches need    to be documented.   Maryland's water monitoring strategy report      Documenting a water monitoring strategy can take several approaches. Certain    base elements need to be addressed - ensuring the collection of the right kind    and amount of data and ensuring that the data are reliable and are accessible    to decision-makers and others (US Environmental Protection Agency, 1984). A    strategy that is little more than an embellished project plan, however, has    little utility in developing future monitoring activities or encouraging integration    with other monitoring efforts.   The US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) updated strategy guidance (Jones,    et al., 1996) provides an overview approach, however, it leaves a number of    important issues unresolved, especially in terms of interpreting or integrating    other monitoring program results. For example, issues related to different temporal/spatial    scales in monitoring programs are not discussed, but they are essential issues    related to interpretation and possible integration of different monitoring results.   While nearly all water monitoring approaches provide information to address    a specific management need, an integrated, watershed approach can help to address    complex, interrelated problems, like nonpoint source pollution impacts, cumulative    impacts, measuring nature's response to human activities, and identifying ways    to work with natural processes. This approach significantly complicates management    of these programs by using existing programs and involving multiple agencies    or groups. Rather than using single measures to compare against goals (e.g.,    water quality standards or natural heritage goals), the watershed approach has    multiple goals and objectives to address a variety of environmental problems.    Water monitoring is currently applied, using this integrated watershed approach,    in several major state programs, such as the Clean Water Action Plan (Maryland    Clean Water Action Plan Technical Workgroup, 1998) and the Chesapeake Bay Program    (Magnien, 1987), but in other programs the focus is more narrow. This report    documents current agency water monitoring efforts by water body, but it also    should be considered as the foundation for a future, more comprehensive Statewide    watershed monitoring strategy.   A future approach to a Statewide water monitoring strategy      At the same time that State agencies are collecting water information to address    specific needs, water-monitoring efforts by others (academic institutions, local    and federal government agencies, community groups, consultants and private industry)    are underway. While some of these efforts are implemented to address traditional    management goals (sometime similar to State agency goals), these efforts may    have a non-management focus, including monitoring programs that addressing research,    education and supporting other programs (modified from Lovegreen, 1999). Somehow,    information from these programs should be integrated as part of a statewide    water monitoring strategy.   The watershed approach creates a more inclusive process that uses applicable    water quality and quantity information as well as relevant living resource,    geologic, geographic, and sociological information. Depending on the watershed    size, the monitoring resources of an agency may not be sufficient to effectively    develop a watershed approach to monitoring, so other sources of data are needed,    the likely source being non-State agencies. Integrating other data is a process    that requires enhanced program coordination (e.g., communication about sampling    plans and goals, planning useful/equivalent measures, modeling/assessment procedures,    QA, and data sharing) and it significantly increases the complexity of the water    management framework ( Figure 2 ).                 Figure 2. Role of water monitoring within a universe of uses/needs       In spite of its complexity, efforts to develop a comprehensive watershed approach    to monitoring is beneficial:     (1) the system is natural and not limited by political boundaries,     (2) management efforts are continuous, and     (3) the watershed framework supports partnering, using sound science, initiating    well-planned actions and achieving results.   As this plan evolves with input from other partners, especially the Maryland    Water Monitoring Council, it is envisioned that this strategy will address how    to integrate monitoring efforts from smaller watersheds and efforts addressing    biological and physical habitat impacts into a more all-encompassing Statewide    monitoring framework.                      RETURN          to Top of Page           RETURN          to Table of Contents                                    GOALS/OBJECTIVES     There are numerous reasons for collecting and utilizing water-monitoring data.    Five unique objectives include:        to characterize conditions,      to determine trends,      to guide pollution control and management actions,      to respond to emergencies, and      to protect human health and the environment    The key to developing a proper monitoring effort is to have well defined questions  that need to be addressed - specific questions pertaining to overall conditions,  management options, identifying problems and/or specific agency goals (US Environmental  Protection Agency, 2000). Identifying the question(s) that needs to be answered  is an important step in identifying the goals/objectives of each water monitoring  effort. To the extent that these goals/objectives are measurable simplifies the  evaluation of the monitoring effort.   Maryland's water monitoring agencies      Both the Department of the Environment (MDE) and Department of Natural Resources    (DNR) have mission statements and specific management goals to protect and restore    water resources of the State as embodied in its Managing Maryland for Results    program ( Table 1 ).   Table 1. Selected Maryland agency mission statements    and water-related goals                     Agency       Mission Statement       Water-related Goals                MDE - Department of the Environment       Protect and restore the quality of Maryland's air, land, and water resources,        while fostering economic development, healthy and safe communities, and        quality environmental education for the benefit of the environment, public        health, and future generations.

A vital and life-sustaining Chesapeake and Coastal Bays and their            tributaries.            Sustainable population of living resources and healthy ecosystems.            Enjoyment of diverse outdoor recreation opportunities for Maryland            citizens and visitors.            Vibrant local communities in balance with natural systems.                       Both agencies have water monitoring programs, but specific program goals are    designed to address agency responsibilities. As the State's principal environmental    regulatory agency, MDE's water monitoring interests are related to providing    the information necessary to manage the State’s pollution control programs,    including:        discharge permit development,      assessment of water quality standards      verification of permit compliance,      defining total maximum daily loads      protection of public health/safety, and      remediation of spills/historical pollution problems         As the State's principal natural resources agency, DNR's water monitoring    interests are focused on:        status and trends of ambient water quality and quantity,      evaluating living resource habitat, and      determining the status of living aquatic resources.        Most of these programs are integrated to support the Department’s watershed    management activities to protect the Chesapeake and Coastal Bays and non-tidal    streams.   Goals, sampling strategies, analytical techniques, reporting processes, and    funding sources of each agency’s monitoring programs usually are independent.    Water information collected in these programs may complement other monitoring    efforts either within or between agencies; efforts are made to use available    data and minimize unintended duplication of effort.   In addition to DNR and MDE, Maryland's Department of Agriculture (MDA), Department    of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH), local governments and the Department of    Transportation (MDOT) also conduct water monitoring to address questions concerning    research on specific agricultural impacts, evaluating sanitary quality of bathing    beaches and evaluating water quality impacts due to transportation projects.    DHMH water monitoring activities are delegated to local health department offices.    Both MDA and MDOT agencies often contract with other agencies or organizations    (university research groups, consultants) to conduct water monitoring activities    and address specific questions.   Other groups      There are many other organizations or groups that have an interest in collecting    water monitoring information, sharing this with State agencies or are interested    in obtaining State agency data. These groups include health, public works and    planning departments in local governments, certain businesses and selected non-governmental    environmental organizations (including citizen volunteers), and some university    and school programs. Other federal agencies (US Department of Agriculture, US    Department of Defense, US Department of the Interior’s Fish and Wildlife Service,    Geological Survey and National Park Service, US Department of Commerce’s National    Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Environmental Protection Agency)    have specific water monitoring needs that they may conduct directly or through    contract. Although the focus of this report is on State agency water monitoring    efforts, a planned expansion of this strategy to address the relationship between    State programs and these other water monitoring efforts would create a truly    Statewide water monitoring perspective.   Water monitoring goals      Some Statewide water monitoring goals are defined by external sources, such    as federal statute or through agreements with the US Environmental Protection    Agency (EPA). For example, the Clean Water Act requires that States report on    the extent to which its waters ""…allow recreational activities in and on the    water"" in its biennial (Section 305(b)) water quality report to EPA. The EPA's    guidance for these reports suggest that States provide summaries of water quality    impairments, causes and sources. As a more generalized measure of environmental    status (including water), Maryland and the EPA define several water quality    indicators in their Environmental Performance Partnership Agreement; these results    are reported regularly to EPA. Finally, the State's own performance based initiative,    Managing For Results, address some Statewide water resource goals. Clearly,    addressing some goals requires a Statewide assessment of water conditions.   All water monitoring programs have a number of clearly identified goals which    should be tangible, achievable, measurable, and documented. Setting monitoring    program goals help to define many aspects of a monitoring program, from establishing    sample design (setting priorities and identifying program strengths and weaknesses    - possibly leading to development of more goals) to serving as criteria for    the assessment process and for evaluating the success of the program.   Program goals may include long-term goals that may not be achieved within the    immediate program timetable (e.g., Chesapeake Bay Program goals) as well as    short-term goals (e.g., individual program goals/milestones necessary to reach    long-term goals). And, while they define the basis for a monitoring activity,    goals should not be written as permanent or inflexible statements. As water    monitoring programs change (e.g., endpoints, sampling or analytical techniques),    goals will need to change as well.   A key component of goal setting is the definition of measurable goals. While    helping to determine the most appropriate study design, program goals provide    for an objective and valuable program evaluation that can clearly help identify    program needs for continuing monitoring efforts. For each management question/agency    goal, however, one or more statements should be derived.   Examples of management questions, program goals and measurable objectives:         Question:  In terms of nutrients, what is the water quality condition    of non-tidal rivers?      Goal:  Determine nutrient levels in non-tidal rivers      Objectives: * Establish a suitable sampling design to evaluate non-tidal    rivers (## sampling sites)                             * Measure nutrient levels in non-tidal rivers within known temporal cycle (monthly/seasonally)                                * Compare nutrient levels between rivers and to other sources to determine relative    scale    Question:  What stream reaches are impaired by low pH levels due    to abandoned mine drainage?      Goal:  Assess pH levels in streams around abandoned mines      Objectives: * Identify abandoned mine sites                             * Identify historic sampling sites and review pH data in streams near these    mines                             * Establish a systematic monitoring program to identify streams with low pH    during low stream flow (## sites)    One technique to help plan data collection efforts is the use of “data    quality objectives” or a ‘DQO’ process to ensure that monitoring data collected    are of the right type, quantity and quality ( http://www.rti.org/units/ese/cemqa/erpd/dqo.cfm ).    Developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency’s Quality Assurance Management    Program, this process defines the questions that a data collection effort is    intended to address, what decision-making process will be used with these data,    and the level of uncertainty that is allowed in making these decisions (US Environmental    Protection Agency, 1994a). None of the State’s water monitoring programs have    used this formal DQO process, however, less formal goal-setting processes have    served the same purpose.                            RETURN          to Top of Page           RETURN          to Table of Contents                                           SAMPLE DESIGN     In developing new water monitoring programs, evaluating existing programs and    modifying others to meet changing needs, a critical stage is the development    of a cost-effective and efficient sampling design, especially as monitoring    resources (including cost and available capacity for manpower, laboratory and    equipment/material support) are limited. A review of the literature lists various    classifications of sampling design for water monitoring programs. Essentially,    however, there are two principal sample designs: (1) a fixed sites approach    to measure specific parameters or as a representative sample and (2) a probability-based    approach (Chesapeake Bay Program, 1999b). These basic formats may increase efficiency    or serve multiple purposes by combining approaches and sampling within selected    strata (time, space) (e.g., the Rotating Basin-Permit Monitoring Program - an    intensive, fixed sampling design within a watershed, re-sampled at a defined,    multi-year interval). The sampling approach of each agency water-monitoring    program is described in the next chapter.   Fixed site approach      Most water monitoring programs sample from fixed sites to provide information    about water conditions. In ambient programs, results from sites sampled over    a long period of time may show changes or trends in these conditions. To meet    some objectives, fixed sites may be targeted in areas subject to pollution (e.g.,    NPDES compliance) or in areas that are expected to show changes due to projected    management activities improvement/degradation (e.g., Targeted Watershed Program).    While the use of fixed sites limits confidence in assessing water quality conditions    over larger reaches, a primary strength of this approach is that data can be    used to detect changes or trends in water quality conditions. The State's CORE    program monitors water quality conditions in portions of the State's larger    waterways providing a summary of conditions in those waters, but not in other,    unmonitored portions of the watershed or even in smaller upstream reaches. These    static CORE sites do provide viable sites for detecting changes/trends in water    quality conditions.   Probability-based approach      An alternative approach is to use a probability-based sampling which estimates    water conditions in a defined area even when all waters are not directly sampled.    Although this estimate is statistically derived and not directly measured, a    level of confidence or certainty in this estimate can be determined that is    related to the natural variability of conditions and to the level of sampling    effort used. For example, the Maryland Biological Stream Survey identifies sampling    sites at random within low-order streams in a watershed and is able to estimate    water conditions for all low-order streams in that watershed within a certain    level of certainty. Where fixed sites often are used to quantify change at selected    locations (surveillance of critical levels, trends, and management actions),    the probability sampling approach emphasizes spatial quantification of water    conditions.   To meet specific monitoring goals, both approaches (and their variants/combinations)    have specific advantages and limitations - no single sampling program can address    every management need. For each sampling design, the relative number of required    samples, the relative bias in sampling and the basis for sample site selection    vary and these should be matched to specific monitoring goals of the program.    Use of these data to meet other goals (e.g., sharing data for watershed analyses)    need to clearly understand the sampling design used and specific sampling program    strengths and weaknesses which could affect data needs to meet these secondary    and other goals.   Maryland’s watershed approach      The US Environmental Protection Agency’s approach to developing a monitoring    strategy is that a plan can be developed once a comprehensive set of goals are    established. In reality, there are multiple agencies involved with multiple    goals, funding sources and priorities. No single sampling design approach can    address these different objectives and, as a result, different monitoring programs    have developed. The lowest common denominator between these efforts often is    the collection of water samples. Consequently, it is not surprising that differences    between agency water monitoring efforts may not seem obvious. A review of program    goals, sample design, details in sample collection, sample storage and transport    processes, laboratory analyses, data review and analyses and dissemination of    results would show great variety in these programs.   To comprehensively assess its waters, Maryland uses a layered-stratum approach.    Each water body type (e.g., river, estuary, and lake) is a stratum. All water    monitoring efforts within a stratum contributes to a comprehensive assessment    approach for that water body Combining these monitoring strata provides a layered    framework that defines how Maryland monitors all of its waters ( Figure    3 ).            Figure 3. Maryland's multi-layered approach to comprehensive water monitoring          Other organizational approaches to monitoring can exist; any common program    basis could be used (e.g., watershed, media, management goals). Except for special,    comprehensive studies, all State agency programs focus their monitoring efforts    within a water body type (e.g., only in nontidal rivers or estuarine waters,    etc.). As with any sampling organization, some water monitoring programs will    bridge one or more strata, but in this framework, water body sampling ensures    that the monitoring programs are complementary. The approach permits the use    of all current monitoring programs, but it also highlights areas where additional    effort is needed in terms of enhancing cooperation between programs, identifying    how to cooperate with other non-agency monitoring efforts or where new monitoring    efforts may be needed.   Maryland's water monitoring strategy is to utilize all existing programs to    the greatest extent possible, build on those programs if they are found to not    fully address identified needs, and to promote new programs to meet needs not    addressed by the existing programs. Existing monitoring activities will be continued,    reviewed, modified, enhanced, or reduced as necessary, and new monitoring programs    will be established to address developing issues and problems. Both the Departments    of the Environment and Natural Resources are committed to cooperating with all    monitoring entities (federal and local agencies, academia, consultants, non-governmental    organizations and volunteers) to optimize the value of the individual efforts    through collaboration and cooperation.    Among the efforts to build and expand monitoring, for example is that    MDE plans to rely more on biological community assessment protocols as part    of its regulatory monitoring (Eskin, et al., 2000). Biological data will help    identify impairments and will be used to track improvements associated with    the implementation of corrective management measures. In a cooperative effort    involving DNR and MDE and aided by MDE’s Biocriteria Advisory Committee, MDE    developed interim biological criteria based on DNR’s Maryland Biological Stream    Survey. DNR applied these criteria in the development of the 2000 305(b) report    (Dept. Natural Resources, 2000).   Scale      When planned watershed analyses includes the use of data from other water monitoring    efforts, an important consideration relates to the “scale” of the monitoring    program design - essentially, the distribution of samples across the watershed    of interest. A monitoring program that addresses water conditions in a large    watershed (e.g., of 840 stations in Chesapeake and Delaware Bay and Pamlico    Sound watersheds as part of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s Mid-Atlantic    Highlands Assessment) may collect fewer (if any) samples from a smaller watershed    that is the focus of other government interests (e.g., about 40 MAHA sites are    located in Maryland and are assessed at a scale that is greater than a scale    of interest by most citizen groups, county or State agencies). Conversely, assembling    watershed data might provide skewed results if some stream drainage areas have    detailed water data available because of local interests, but other stream drainage    areas within the watershed has no corresponding/equivalent effort (e.g., Upper    Patuxent River - southern watershed has available detailed county data; northern    watershed has no corresponding data).                           RETURN          to Top of Page           RETURN          to Table of Contents                                               WATER RESOURCES/MONITORING PROGRAM      SUMMARY     Non-tidal rivers and streams      There are thousands of miles of free-flowing, freshwater rivers and streams    throughout Maryland. These waterways drain lands and discharge groundwater into    four large basins, the Delaware Bay, the North Atlantic Ocean, the Chesapeake    Bay, and the Ohio River ( Figure 4 ). Nontidal rivers    and streams are found in all physiographic provinces, in all counties of the    State and in all watersheds, except in some low-lying Coastal Plain drainages,    on barrier islands and in the Chesapeake Bay.            Figure 4. Stream drainage network in Maryland (overlain on county boundaries)          Using a 1:250,000 scale USGS topographic map, we currently identify 8,769 miles    of non-tidal rivers and streams in Maryland. Future efforts to use larger (1:100,000)    scale maps will likely identify significantly more stream mileage in the State.    Stream patterns are dendritic so most stream mileage is in the smallest streams.    The widely used Strahler stream classification system identifies first-order    streams as the smallest, permanently flowing stream. The union of two streams    of order n creates a stream of order n+1 (e.g., the merger of two first order    streams creates a second order stream and so on). This classification system    provides a convenient way to compare streams of the same size (Allan, 1995).    Distribution of stream mileage by order in Maryland is shown in  Table    2 . Sizes of these waterways range from centimeters to more than 900 meters    in width with averaged measured flows ranging from 0 to 1,270 m3/sec (Carpenter,    1983).   Table 2.

Ditching is a common    practice on the Eastern Shore designed to drain low-lying lands and to control    ground water levels. Existing stream systems are modified in urban and developing    areas to carry stormwater flow away from structures and roadways. Many urban    streams are buried and now may flow in underground pipes. In agricultural areas,    streams often are shifted to increase usable land area and have been used as    natural watering facilities for livestock. Highway construction methods tend    to modify streams within the right-of-way, although impacts often occur above    and below the affected areas.   Non-tidal rivers and streams - Water monitoring programs      The following lists non-tidal water monitoring programs conducted by Maryland    agencies that are designed to address water quality, water quantity, aquatic    resources and public health issues. These summaries include contact information,    watershed/media monitored, program goals and a brief description of the monitoring    effort.      Water Quality -  CORE/Trend Program       Agency : DNR Monitoring and Non-tidal Assessment      Contact : Paul Miller (410-260-8616; pmiller@dnr.state.md.us)      Watersheds : Statewide (14 of 20 basins; 39 of 138 segments)      Media : water column      Goal : Assess status and trends for 305(b) report and Tributary Strategies    and for load estimation from selected watersheds. Determine the relationship    between water chemistry, river flow and benthic macroinvertebrate community    resources.      Program Description : Network of fixed, non-tidal ambient water quality    monitoring stations to assess Statewide water quality conditions for reporting    and program evaluation. CORE stations are funded by the EPA through the Clean    Water Act (Section 106).   One to three stations in 39 of 138 watersheds (54 stations) all on major streams    (4th order and larger) and rivers are sampled monthly for water chemistry. The    benthic macroinvertebrate community is sampled annually at a subset (48 percent)    of these stations. Thirty-two of these stations are co-located with a USGS flow    gage. While the intent is a Statewide assessment, the distribution of sampling    sites is focused on Potomac River and Central Maryland watersheds and sparse    in southern Coastal Plain on Eastern and Western Shores of Chesapeake Bay. This    is due to the focus on point source water quality at the time this network was    established in the 1970's. Physical water properties (temperature, conductivity,    pH, alkalinity, oxygen), chemical (focus on nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient    species) and biological (bacteriological, chlorophyll) samples collected from    surface and analyzed in University of Maryland or at Dept. Health and Mental    Hygiene laboratories - some parameters assessed in situ.      Recommendations : Some areas are not presently sampled. Changes in existing    sampling sites and sampling frequency are being evaluated to allow expansion    of the network. Sites near operating stream gages are preferred to increase    data value.      Aquatic resources -  Maryland Biological Stream Survey       Agency : DNR Monitoring and Non-tidal Assessment      Contact : Ron Klauda (410-260-8610; rklauda@dnr.state.md.us)      Watersheds : Statewide (17 of 20 6-digit basins) - wadeable, (1st, 2nd    and 3rd order) non-tidal streams      Media : biological community (fish, invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles,    and plants), surface water physicochemical, in- and near-stream environment    (substrate)      Goal : Assess the biological resource status of wadeable, non-tidal streams,    quantify how acid deposition is affecting biological resources, examine other    factors that may affect the current biological resources, establish a benchmark    for identification of trends, and target local-scale assessments and mitigation    actions needed to restore degraded biological resources.      Program Description : Program focus is on wadeable (1st, 2nd and 3rd order)    non-tidal streams in 17 of the State's 18 major basins (excluding Chesapeake    Bay), however, individual site data from 300 stream segments of a fixed length    sampled are being examined for local degradation issues and for targeting restoration    actions.   Statewide sampling is conducted over a three to five-year rotating basis, in    which samples are collected in a portion of the State's eligible streams annually.    This program uses a special probability-based lattice sampling design that is    stratified by year and basins (western, central and eastern) to facilitate effective    use of field crews. Sampling intensity is partitioned by reach order within    each basin. Biological abundance of fish, benthic macroinvertebrates, reptiles,    amphibians, aquatic plants and mussels and relative community health of fish    and benthic macroinvertebrate communities are examined in each selected reach    as well as select chemical attributes (pH, acid-neutralizing capacity, sulfate,    nitrate, conductivity, dissolved oxygen and dissolved organic carbon).. Physical    habitat parameters including flow, stream gradient, depth, width, embeddedness,    instream habitat, pool/riffle quality, bank stability, channel status, shading,    and buffer type are measured. Other information about drainage area, land cover,    population are defined using Geographical Information Systems.   Recommendations : The program design was reevaluated in 1999. The second    statewide round of stream monitoring began in spring 2000 and will: (1) focus    the sampling effort at the 8-digit watershed scale rather than at the 6-digit    basin scale; (2) incorporate a volunteer benthic macroinvertebrate monitoring    component (Stream Waders) to achieve more complete statewide coverage at the    12-digit sub-watershed scale, (3) potentially sample tidal fresh and brackish    streams, and (4) add chloride, total nitrogen, nitrite, total phosphorous and    orthophosphate to the list of chemical parameters that are being measured.      Water Quality -  Watershed monitoring (“Cycling Strategy”) for water quality    impairment determination and Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) development          Agency : MDE Technical and Regulatory Services Administration      Contact : Nauth Panday (410-631-3680); npanday@mde.state.md.us;     John Steinfort (410-974-3238); jsteinfort@erols.com;      Watersheds : Statewide - focus on impaired watersheds on State’s 303(d)    list      Media : water column      Goals : (1) provide detailed spatial resolution water quality chemistry    data throughout the State to augment CORE/trend and Chesapeake Bay monitoring    data for determining whether water quality standards are being met (federal    Clean Water Act Section 303(d) list development),      (2) provide the detailed spatial data needed for modeling and development    of total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) necessary to achieve water quality standards,    and      (3) provide detailed data for determining permit limits for all facilities    in a given watershed that are operating under National Pollutant Discharge Elimination    System (NPDES).   Program Description  - The Clean Water Act requires that impaired watersheds    be evaluated and monitored in a comprehensive manner so to identify all point    and nonpoint sources of pollutants, and to allocate the pollutant loads among    the various sources. This process is designed to produce the information necessary    to allow managers to estimate the pollutant loads and develop total maximum    daily load (TMDL) estimates so that impairments to the designated uses of the    water can be corrected. When impairments or potential impairments are demonstrated    by CORE/Trend water monitoring data, Maryland Biological Stream Survey data,    Chesapeake Bay Monitoring Program and/or other data, the intensive watershed    monitoring and evaluations conducted under this program will confirm the extent    of the impairment. These data are then used to calibrate the models necessary    to develop and define the TMDL and permits needed to correct the impairment.   This program has been designed to focus monitoring at a large number of sites    in a portion of the State each year to augment the CORE/Trend Program and the    Chesapeake Bay Monitoring Program, which provides long-term, monthly sampling    data for a small subset of the sites. One fifth of the state is monitored intensively    each year in order to cover the entire State in a five-year rotation. Referred    to as the “Watershed Cycling Strategy”, the effort includes integrated monitoring,    TMDL development and permit development of each of the five regions of the state    on a five year rotation (MD Dept. of the Environment, 1999c).     This monitoring program tracks the hydrologic year, sometimes termed the “water    year”, which begins on October 1st. This full-year monitoring allows for the    collection of information on representative hydrologic flow regimes. Critical    7-day, 10-year low flow conditions and those associated with flooding are obtained    from flow records maintained by the US Geological Services gauging station network.    The monitoring design is to collect water quality samples from key points located    throughout the water body of interest, during three low flow and three high    flow periods during the annual cycle. Parameter coverage is determined each    year based on the impairment being investigated. Monitoring activities include    measurements of streambed geometry and/or tidal bathymetric profiles that are    necessary mathematical model inputs.   This monitoring program has focussed on the State’s lower Eastern Shore in    1998, Upper Eastern Shore and Upper Western Shore in 1999, and is working on    the mid Western Shore during 2000. The five-year cycle will be completed with    monitoring in the lower Western Shore and Potomac, and Western Maryland. Out-of-schedule    monitoring will be conducted as necessary to meet urgent needs associated with    new or revised permits.      Water Quality -  NPDES point source permit monitoring       Agency : MDE Technical and Regulatory Services Administration      Contact : John Steinfort (410-974-3238); jsteinfort@erols.com      Watersheds : Statewide - water bodies with permitted wastewater discharges         Media : water column      Goal : The goal of this monitoring effort is to provide facility-specific    water quality data essential for determining pollutant sources and pollutant    loads in the vicinity of the discharge in order to support the development of    facility specific permits.      Program Description : MDE conducts between four and 8 localized intensive    water quality studies annually addressing specific permitting concerns. These    studies are conducted to evaluate pollutant loading for resolution of disputed    permit renewals or requests for increased constituent loads. This monitoring    program is designed to compliment the Watershed monitoring (“Cycling Strategy”)    for water quality impairment determination and TMDL development described above.         Water Quality -  NPDES Permit Compliance Monitoring       Agency : MDE Technical and Regulatory Services Administration      Contact : William Beatty (410-974-3238); billbeatty@starpower.net     Melvin Knott (410-631-3605); mknott@mde.state.md.us      Watersheds : Statewide - water bodies with permitted wastewater discharges         Media : water column      Goal : provide data to verify the accuracy of data reported by the permitted    facilities under self-reporting requirements established in the permits.      Program Description : This function is a required under the Section 106    federal grant to the State. It has been conducted since the early 1980s. It    involves monitoring at approximately 60 “major” domestic wastewater treatment    plants that discharge more than one million gallons per day. Facilities demonstrating    noncompliance with established permit limitations, regardless of flow or facility    size, are also included in the monitoring program.   The monitoring protocol involves collection of a series of discreet effluent    samples over a two-day period along with a composite sample (generally of 24    hours duration) which is routinely split with the facility. Composite duration    may be of either 8- or 12-hour duration if the facility’s permit is written    for that interval. Flow measurements are made for discrete samples, and total    flow is recorded for the compositing period. Pollutant loadings are then calculated    and compared to permit authorizations. Samples are also secured for Whole Effluent    Toxicity (WET) testing. These samples are taken to the Department’s contract    laboratory to determine whether the effluent demonstrates toxic effects on invertebrate    and fish organisms. Any positive findings trigger additional monitoring by the    State and facility with a Toxic Reduction Evaluation (TRE) conducted by the    facility upon confirmation of toxic conditions.      Water Quality -  NPDES Pretreatment Monitoring       Agency : MDE Water Management Administration      Contact : Gary Kelman (410-631-3630); gkelman@mde.state.md.us     Melvin Knott (410-631-3605); mknott@mde.state.md.us      Watersheds : Statewide      Media : water column      Goal : The goal of the Pretreatment Monitoring program is to assure that    user-provided information about pretreatment reduction of pollutants of concern    from industrial facilities will not pass through or interfere with operations    of publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) or to affect the beneficial uses of    POTW biosolids.      Program Description : Significant industrial users which discharge wastes    to municipal wastewater systems are directly regulated by MDE and are responsible    for self-monitoring wastewater at least twice per year. This ensures that representative    samples of the industrial wastewater discharges into local sanitary sewers are    analyzed for permitted pollutants of concern. This is accomplished by MDE oversight    of local industrial user pretreatment programs as well as MDE permitting of    significant industrial users in non-pretreatment areas of the State. In order    to confirm and amend these data, MDE samples their sanitary sewer effluent for    the same pollutants of concern.   Where applicable, 24-hour composite samples are collected. Grab samples are    taken for pH, oil and grease, total petroleum hydrocarbons, volatile organics,    sulfides and other parameters where this type of sampling is applicable. Flows    are measured where this is a regulated parameter. All samples are collected    at the same or a location equivalent to where the SIU takes its samples. All    data are forwarded to the Water Management Administration’s Pretreatment Section    and analytical results are compared with industry permit requirements. Appropriate    management and enforcement actions are taken when necessary.       Water Quality/Aquatic Resources -  NPDES Stormwater Monitoring ( Municipal    - Nonpoint source )       Agency : MDE Water Management Administration      Contact : Brian S. Clevenger (410-631-3543); bclevenger@mde.state.md.us         Watersheds : Selected watersheds in 10 large municipalities      Media : water column      Goal : The goals of the municipal NPDES stormwater monitoring program    include the pollutant characterization of urban runoff from specific land uses    and the assessment of receiving stream morphology and biological integrity to    guide management program implementation.   Program Description : Municipal NPDES stormwater permits are intended    to control storm drain system pollution from places with populations over 100,000.    Among the myriad of tasks required to be performed by these permits is a significant    effort to monitor the effects of stormwater runoff on urban receiving waters.    These monitoring efforts include chemical, biological, and physical assessments    within a very specific area.   Each of ten major Maryland jurisdictions and the State Highway Administration    is required to select a major storm drain system outfall to monitor storm events    throughout their respective five year permit terms. The selection of these sampling    locations is crucial because each jurisdiction is requested to monitor a specific    land use in order to determine the types of pollutants produced by that land    use. Therefore, each NPDES municipal permit requires the most populated localities    in the State to choose an outfall that discharges runoff from one homogeneous    area. In addition to this selected storm drain system outfall, a second, downstream    ambient monitoring station is required to be established. Storm events are monitored    at this instream location in the same way as the upstream outfall. Data are    submitted annually that report the results of the sampling activities that occur    during the reporting period.   At both outfall and instream monitoring locations, 12 storm event samples are    required to be collected and analyzed each year for a suite of constituents    including: biochemical oxygen demand, total cadmium, total Kjeldahl nitrogen,    nitrate+nitrite, total petroleum hydrocarbons, total phosphorus, total copper,    total phenols, total zinc, fecal coliform bacteria, total lead, oil and grease    (optional), and total suspended solids.     For biological assessment, the receiving stream system between the storm drain    outfall and the ambient station is monitored twice annually (Spring and Fall).    The United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Rapid Bioassessment    Protocol III is used to determine the health and long term changes in the benthic    community present. Data are submitted annually with chemical monitoring results.   Finally, within this same stream reach, a geomorphologic assessment is performed    annually to detect trends with regard to instream changes. A series of permanently    monumented stream channel cross sections is required to be established. These    cross sections, along with stream profiles, are surveyed annually to track geomorphologic    changes that occur.   Information collected as a result of this monitoring program is compiled by    MDE and analyses are performed to determine the types of pollutants found in    runoff from specific urban land uses (e.g., residential, industrial, highway,    etc.). Taken together with the data generated from biological and physical stream    assessments, these data will help MDE determine how best to tailor management    program implementation in the future. Additionally, this monitoring approach    will improving the  State’s stormwater management program.      Water Quantity -  Stream Gauging Network       Agency : DNR Maryland Geological Survey      Contact : Emery Cleaves (410-554-5503);      Watersheds : Selected perennial streams Statewide      Media : water column      Goal : Stream gages are operated throughout Maryland to meet numerous    water-resources management goals of federal, State, and local government agencies.    Streamflow data are crucial to water-resources management goals in three fundamental    ways - evaluation of current conditions, watershed management and planning,    and decision-support systems.      Program Description : In recent years, the stream-gaging network in Maryland    has ranged from 95 active stations in 1985 to 76 active stations by the end    of 1995. Ninety-seven stations were being operated throughout Maryland as of    November 15, 1999. Gauged locations range in drainage area from 0.03 square    miles (mi²) to 27,100 MI². Approximately one-third of the stations    have 50 or more years of continuous record. Gauging stations are located in    each of Maryland’s physiographic provinces. The network is operated and maintained    by the US Geological Survey, in cooperation with State, County, and local government    agencies.      Recommendations : Based upon recommendations of the Maryland Water Monitoring    Council (Cleaves and Doheny, 2000) it is recommended that Maryland’s stream-gaging    network be increased from 97 gages (in existence as of November 15, 1999) to    157 gages. The additional gages should be activated in stages according to six    priority management goals: Coastal Plain Harmful Algal Blooms, small watershed,    core network, Clean Water Action Plan, flood hazard, and other unmet coverage    (CORE/trend network, unmet 6- or 8-digit Hydrologic Unit Codes, unmet spatial    coverage, and unmet physical-matrix categories). Drought assessment is also    a major concern, and requires the continued operation of stream gages with long-term    records.      Water Quality/Aquatic Resources -  Fish kill investigations       Agency : MDE Technical and Regulatory Services Administration      Contact : Chris Luckett (410-974-3238); cluckett@mde.state.md.us     Charles Poukish (410-631-4434); fieldops@charm.net      Watersheds : All - wherever kill incidents are reported      Media : water column, fish, crabs      Goals : Investigation and associated monitoring of fish kill events is    designed to identify the causes of events, which would lead to information that    could be used to prevent or reduce the threat of similar events in the future.         Program Description : MDE has the responsibility to investigate all fish    kills associated with pollution. Events that are caused by disease are investigated    by DNR. Since the cause of an event cannot be determined until an investigation    is conducted, MDE takes the lead in receiving and responding to reports. Although    MDE is the designated lead agency, the resources of DNR are relied upon heavily    to assist in the investigations.   The two agencies operate with a standard monitoring plan to ensure that basic    information is obtained in a timely manner. Depending upon the nature of the    event and the condition of the fish, field investigators will collect, count,    and identify affected organisms. Appropriate water and tissue samples are collected    for laboratory analysis. Field measurements, such as temperature, pH, dissolved    oxygen, and other related water quality measures are taken and recorded. Fish    and fish tissue samples for histological and pathological examination are collected,    when required, and transported to cooperating laboratories.      Water Quality/Aquatic Resources -  Algal Bloom Response Program       Agency : MDE Technical and Regulatory Services Administration      Contact : Chris Luckett (410-974-3238); luckett@charm.net      Watersheds : All - wherever algae and aquatic odor complaints occur      Media : water column, aquatic resources      Goals : (1) Respond to public complaints of discolored water in order    to identify and document nuisance algae blooms that may be misinterpreted as    gross pollution in waters of the state and     (2) Determine algae community composition in response to algae driven low dissolved    oxygen induced fish kills in waters of the State, and     (3) Document pollution induced algae blooms and characterize for regulatory    response.      Program Description: The Department of Environment manages a program to    investigate discolored water, analyze composition, and initiate emergency containment    and recovery initiatives if a pollutant is detected. This response program responds    directly to public complaints. Because nuisance algae blooms are typically responsible    for discoloring water, this program maintains the capability to identify common    algae organisms. The program typically responds to nontoxic mahogany tide bloom    organisms including Prorocentrum minimum, Gyrodinium esturiale, Gymnodinium    uncatenum, and Katodinium rotundatum, and often initiates state wide response    if a toxic species such as Mirocystis or Pfiesteria is suspected or confirmed.    Harmful Algae Blooms (HAB) are quickly forwarded to the DNR Harmful Algal Bloom    monitoring program for follow-up monitoring. HAB’s are responsible for fish    kills by both passive and direct association. Most of the typical nontoxic mahogany    tide organisms are responsible for massive low dissolved oxygen-induced fish    kills and may be indicative of habitual nutrient or gross organic pollution    requiring immediate regulatory response and follow-up. This program enhances    the fish kill response program as part of the Clean Water Act Section 106 grant    initiative.      Water Quality/Human Health -  Drinking water protection program       Agency : MDE Water Management Administration      Contact : Bill Beatty - compliance (410-974-3238); billbeatty@starpower.net        John Grace - source water protection (410-631-3713); jgrace@mde.state.md.us         Watersheds : Surface water intakes/utilities in streams classified as    potable water supply      Media : water column      Goals : To protect the physical, chemical and biological integrity of    the ground water resource in order to protect human health and the environment,    to ensure that in the future an adequate supply of the resource is available,    and to manage that resource for the greatest beneficial use of the citizens    of the State.      Program Description :      Source Water Protection Program  - MDE’s Water Management Administration    oversees the surface water intake monitoring results from utilities, monitors    basic water quality, documents chemical quality conditions at water intakes,    and provides a basis for monitoring future trends. These sites are tested for    major dissolved ions, bacterial indicators, selected trace elements, selected    volatile organic compounds, several classes of pesticides, and selected radionuclides    - (see Ground water - Source Water Protection Program).      Finished Water Protection Program  - Maryland's public drinking water    monitoring program meets all Federal mandates of the Safe Drinking Water Act.    This program monitors 1,024 municipal drinking water supplies for maximum contaminant    levels established by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Self monitoring    is required of all public supplies as specified in federal regulations. Compliance    monitoring is conducted by the Department of the Environment’s Water Management    Administration for specific constituents including bacteriological, chemistry,    THMs (trihalomethanes), VOCs (volatile organic carbons), pesticides, radiation,    radon, metals, and nutrients (nitrates and nitrites). Monitoring efforts also    include responses to consumer complaints and emergencies where protection of    public health is a primary concern.      Water Quality/Aquatic Resources/Human Health -  Tissue monitoring program          Agency : MDE Technical and Regulatory Services Administration      Contact : Kevin Novo-Gradac (410-631-3606); knovogradac@mde.state.md.us         Watersheds : Selected commercial/recreational harvesting areas in non-tidal    and tidal tributaries and lakes - 10 sites each year       Media : water column, aquatic resources (fish, shellfish and crabs)          Goals : The goals of this program are to ensure that aquatic resources    harvested from State waters are safe for human consumption, and to provide information    on potential sources and trends in water pollution levels.       Program Description : Fish and shellfish have the potential to accumulate    heavy metals or organic chemicals in their tissues even when these materials    cannot be measured in the water column. This makes these aquatic animals good    indicators of environmental pollution in a body of water. Monitoring contaminant    levels in tissues also allow the determination of potential human health effects.        The evaluation of the data in determining potential health effects considers:      Persistence and fate of chemical contaminants in waters and sediments;      Types of aquatic animals present in the water body;      Fat content, feeding, and migration habits of those aquatic animals;      Ability of each contaminant to accumulate in tissues of aquatic animals      and humans;      Human and animal health effects information for each contaminant;      Preparation, cooking, and fish consumption behaviors of fishers/crabbers;      Likelihood that sensitive populations eat these animals.    MDE has monitored chemical contaminant levels in Maryland’s fish and shellfish  since the 1960s. Fish monitoring focuses on species that are either predators  (bass, perch, and sunfish) or bottom feeders (catfish, carp, and suckers). Within  these categories, efforts are focused on those species with a relatively high  fat content, however, game fish are preferred targets. Consistency in species  throughout the State allows for the assessment of regional trends. Sampling is  generally conducted from the end of summer through early fall to avoid biological  extremes that can be linked to spring spawning. The goal is to composite five  fish in each species sample. Where quantities and weights allow, fish fillets  and whole fish samples are collected to provide for both human health and environmental  evaluations. Standard procedures for collecting, handling, preserving and analysis  have been established to maximize data integrity.   Historical sampling strategies have included annual and biennial collections    at approximately 30 sites for general trend assessments. A triennial sampling    strategy has been utilized since 1990, with 1/3 of the State sampled each year.    Sampling is conducted in localized areas where special needs have been identified.   MDE also has been monitoring chemical contaminant levels in shellfish (oysters,    clams) and crabs from the Bay and its tributaries. Because of low levels of    contaminants and negligible yearly changes in those levels, this Bay-wide monitoring    effort occurs every three years. If necessary, small intensive surveys are performed    during off years. Sampling in the estuarine program from the beginning of summer    to late fall prior to harvesting.                           RETURN          to Top of Page           RETURN          to Table of Contents                           WATER RESOURCES/MONITORING PROGRAM      SUMMARY     Estuarine rivers and embayments      Tidally-influenced rivers and tributaries and embayments of Chesapeake Bay and    the coastal lagoons behind the Atlantic barrier islands account for an estimated    2,522.4 square miles or 20 percent of the State's total surface area ( Figure    5 ). Man’s modifications to estuarine waters include dredging for navigation    purposes (channels, canals, anchorage areas), dredging for oyster shell and    oyster bar shoreline erosion, stabilization projects (bulkheads, jetties) and    shore structures (piers, wharves).

Water Quality/Aquatic Resources -  Chesapeake Bay Monitoring Program          Agency : DNR Resource Assessment Service      Contact : Bruce Michael (410-260-8627); bmichael@dnr.state.md.us      Watersheds : Maryland’s Chesapeake Bay watersheds      Media : water column, sediment, aquatic resources      Goals : To assist in the development and implementation of management    policies to protect and restore the economic and recreational value of Chesapeake    Bay, the Department of Natural Resources has designed and implemented a long-term    monitoring program to provide State managers and policy makers with accurate,    timely and comprehensive information about the Bay's existing condition and    how it is responding to management initiatives. This information helps to formulate    new goals and policies and provides a basis to measure progress towards meeting    the ultimate goal of protecting and restoring Chesapeake Bay. This information    also is widely used by citizens, elected officials and Maryland’s Tributary    Teams.   Program Description : The monitoring program is a carefully assembled    group of monitoring components - physical measurements, chemical measurements    including a full suite of nutrients, sediment chemistry and exchanges, ecosystem    processes, assessment of phyto- and zooplankton, submerged aquatic vegetation,    benthic invertebrates, key rate processes and resident fish communities - all    integrated into a unified study. The objectives followed consistently for all    components reflect major management questions and include: characterize existing    conditions, detect trends in water and habitat quality indicators, and increase    the understanding of ecosystem processes affecting Bay water quality and the    linkage between water quality and living resources. This basic design is outlined    in Magnien, et al. (1987) (Appendix) although some modifications have been initiated    to address current management issues.   The design encompasses a comprehensive, Bay-wide approach that includes the    most important water, habitat and biological measurements from a management    and scientific perspective. These measurements take place in a coordinated fashion,    in many cases at exactly the same times and places to enhances our ability to    interpret linkages between monitored parameters.   A Bay-wide perspective has been applied to the location of sampling stations    throughout the tidal tributaries and mainstem of Chesapeake Bay based upon a    segmentation scheme that identifies major reaches of the Bay and its tributaries.    Other considerations in the site selection included important habitats, such    as striped bass spawning areas, and the availability of useful historical data.    All stations are located in tidal waters with salinity regimes ranging from    completely freshwater in the upper tributaries and mainstem to over 20 parts    per thousand in bottom waters of the mainstem near the mouth of the Potomac.    This basin-wide coverage includes similar efforts in Virginia and Pennsylvania    that are coordinated by these states, the District of Columbia and EPA in order    to evaluate where and how pollution control measures are working, to identify    regions in need of additional remedies and to better understand the fate and    effect of pollutant inputs.   A critical step that determines the usefulness of the monitoring program is    the analysis of data, interpretation of the findings and presentation of results.    Several approaches employing unique sampling design and analytical techniques    are used by the Chesapeake Bay Monitoring Program components to address specific    management questions. Status or characterization assessments are conducted using    fixed station observations. A Bay-wide scale was developed for each salinity    zone (tidal fresh, oligohaline and mesohaline) to set a baseline on which to    score water quality at each station and then compared to the most current three-year    record. Long-term trends are assessed from fixed station observations using    the Seasonal Kendall test for monotonic trends and the Van Belle and Hughes    tests for homogeneity of trends between stations, seasons, and station-season    combination.   Probability-based sampling has been implemented in the Benthic Organism component    to estimate the area of the Chesapeake Bay and tributaries that meet the Benthic    Restoration Goals as indicated by the Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity. In    Maryland, six strata were defined and each stratum is sampled by 25 randomly    allocated sites. Probability-based sampling within strata supplements data collected    at fixed trend stations to allow unbiased comparisons of conditions between    strata of the Bay/tributaries in the same collection year and within tributaries    for data collected between different years.   Monitoring data are used extensively in mathematical modeling efforts to project    water quality responses of the Bay to various management alternatives. A three-dimensional    Bay and Tributary Water Quality time-variable model is presently under review.    Results from earlier versions of the model have already been used to set nutrient    reduction goals agreed to in the 1987 Chesapeake Bay Agreement and affirmed    by the 1991 and 1997 Reevaluations. A new Bay agreement, signed in June 2000,    has a goal to de-list the Chesapeake Bay and its tidal tributaries by 2010.   Recommendations : Since 1984, the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program has funded    the State's Water Quality Monitoring efforts in the mainstem Bay with a focus    on the restoration of the mainstem Bay. Most tidal tributaries are characterized    by only one monitoring station in the center of the estuary. Efforts are underway    to increase the attention on the Bay tributaries and near-shore environments    as: (1) improvements in water quality will be detected in the tributaries long    before they are seen in the mainstem, and (2) more detailed information is required    to focus management activities on the tributaries.   EPA’s Chesapeake Bay Program has been developing a Monitoring Strategy focused    on incorporating and evaluating water and habitat quality and living resource    information. From this Strategy, draft recommendations have focused on expanding    monitoring efforts in the tributaries to better evaluate the linkage between    water and habitat quality with living resources (Chesapeake Bay Program, 1999b).    These will require a more intensive spatial coverage in near-shore environments.         Water Quality/Aquatic Resources -  Coastal Bays Monitoring Program       Agency : DNR Resource Assessment Service      Contact : Cathy Wazniak (410-260-8638); cwazniak@dnr.state.md.us      Watersheds : Atlantic Ocean coastal bays (Worcester Co.)      Media : water column, aquatic resources      Goals : The general goals of the Maryland Coastal Bays Comprehensive Monitoring    Program are:        to measure the effectiveness of implementing the management actions identified      in the Comprehensive Conservation Management Plan (CCMP),      to provide information that can be used to redirect and refocus the CCMP      over time,      to provide information that will assist in anticipating water quality responses      to implementation of proposed management actions, and      to bring the monitoring and evaluation of Coastal Bays up to par with efforts      in the Chesapeake Bay.     Program Description : Eutrophication and its impacts to living resources  was identified in the Maryland Coastal Bays Program (1998) characterization report  as the most pressing environmental issue facing these waters. As a result, the  Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee (STAC) recommended that the initial  focus of the monitoring plan be on nutrient and sediment inputs to the coastal  bays and their impacts on living resources (Maryland Coastal Bays Program, 1999).  Five general categories of monitoring activities were identified:        tracking management actions.      nutrient and sediment inputs from the watershed and airshed,      ambient water quality,      eutrophication impacts to habitat,      eutrophication impacts to living resources.     Structure : Actions in the monitoring plan have been organized into three  levels: Landscape Monitoring (Level I), Stressor Monitoring (Level II), and Response  Monitoring (Level III). The lower the level, the more directly the monitoring  is related to management actions. Inherent within all three levels is monitoring  for both baseline and long-term trends. The resulting Comprehensive Environmental  Monitoring Program was developed by DNR with extensive input from local, State,  and federal agencies operating in Maryland’s Coastal Bays, peered reviewed for  technical merit and approved by the STAC.   Baseline monitoring determines the current status of important indicators of    environmental health against which to measure change and to determine if management    actions have had an impact. While sufficient baseline data are not currently    available for all components of the monitoring plan, collection efforts should    be instituted to establish existing conditions prior to full implementation    of management actions.   Landscape monitoring (Level I) tracks activities going on in the watershed    (e.g., nutrient and chemical application rates, implementation of best management    practices and land cover). This can often be directly related to implementation    of management actions and may not need intense field monitoring. This monitoring    process may need to be reviewed, depending on the outcome of the final management    plan and its goals, to evaluate the adequacy of current programs to track important    aspects of landscape conditions and activities.   Stressor monitoring (Level II) determines the amount of pollutants (nutrient,    sediment or chemical contaminants) entering the bays or extent of habitat alteration    or loss occurring in the watershed. While it may be very difficult to do in    a comprehensive fashion, the STAC decided to initiate some of the high priority    monitoring elements in this category related to nutrient inputs.   Response monitoring (Level III) uses indicators to show how the system is responding    to management actions (changes in stressors) over time. This monitoring information    is very important to the public (e.g., - Is the water degraded? What is the    condition of the fish?).     Recommendations: Now that there is a comprehensive, peer-reviewed monitoring    strategy for the Coastal Bays, the most important recommendation is to work    on fully implementing the approved Monitoring Plan. The State has allocated    partial funding for ambient water quality monitoring; however an additional    $225,000 is needed to fully implement those activities. Additional funding is    needed to monitor habitat impacts from eutrophication including harmful algal    blooms, macroalgae, impacts to SAV and the benthic community   Harmful algal blooms pose a threat to the coastal bays. In 1998, the presence    of Pfiesteria and Aureococcus (‘brown tide’) were confirmed in the northern    bays (Turville Creek and Assawoman Bay, respectively). Although the presence    of these organisms does not yet cause problems related to health risks or impaired    uses, it further stresses the need to control nutrient inputs to these highly    susceptible bays.   The abundance of SAV should continue to be monitored using aerial photography.    The use of macroalgae as a eutrophication indicator is still unclear and additional    data is needed to document the extent in the MD coastal bays and relationship    with water quality parameters.   No system-wide benthic monitoring program is currently ongoing (MDE program    has some stations in the major tributaries of the St. Martin River and Newport    Bay). The spatial and temporal variability due to physical and biological factors    can confound attempts at detecting anthropogenic disturbances in the molluscan    community over time. Indicator development and analysis of benthic/fish data    as it relates to eutrophication needs more study.      Water Quality/Aquatic Resources -  Harmful Algal Bloom monitoring program          Agency : DNR Resource Assessment Service      Contact : Dave Goshorn (410-260-8639); dgoshorn@dnr.state.md.us      Watersheds : Selected tidal tributaries affected or potentially affected    by harmful algal blooms in Maryland’s Chesapeake Bay and Coastal Bays      Media : water column, aquatic resources      Goals :        quickly identify and evaluate HAB’s in Maryland waters in order to provide      data on which to base appropriate actions to protect public health and safety,      track HAB species and events in Maryland in order to identify trends in      occurrence, and      identify linkages between HAB’s and anthropogenic impacts (e.g., nutrient      enrichment) in order to target management actions which may reduce the likelihood      of future outbreaks.     Program Description : Maryland Department of Natural Resources has been  developing a program to address the increasing awareness of harmful algal blooms  in the State. In addition to long recognized HAB species such as Prorocentrum  and Microcystis, Maryland in recent years has documented outbreaks of other HAB  species such as Pfiesteria , Aureococcus, and, possibly, Chattonella. The lack  of an established HAB monitoring program makes it difficult to determine if   the presence and frequency of blooms of these species is increasing or a function  of increased public and State awareness. Regardless, all these species have the  demonstrated potential to result in major negative impacts to the ecosystem, and,  in some cases, pose substantial risks to the economy and public health of the  State. Maryland DNR has been working to piece together components of existing  monitoring programs in order to monitor HAB’s. Existing programs are insufficient  to adequately track and characterize these organisms. A dedicated HAB monitoring  program is necessary provide the level of information necessary to make required  decisions on public health policy and to direct management actions to reduce the  threat from these organisms.   Recommendations : Harmful algal blooms pose a significant threat to the    public health and economic vitality of the State. Existing monitoring programs    are insufficient to meet the information needs required to appropriately respond    to these threats. It is recommended that funds be made available to develop    a dedicated HAB monitoring program. This program will depend as heavily as possible    on existing programs, but will add monitoring and analysis necessary to adequately    characterize the situation. Specifically, funds would be used to:        add field monitoring resources to existing programs sufficient to respond      to HAB blooms as well as characterize background levels of the organisms and      associated habitat conditions,      contract with appropriate laboratories with expertise in analyzing collected      samples,      provide technical analysis of collected data in order to appropriately      interpret findings, and      provide outreach to public, elected officials, and managers necessary to      respond appropriately.       Water Quality/Aquatic Resources -  Pfiesteria Investigations - water quality    and fisheries       Agency : DNR Resource Assessment Service      Contact : Dave Goshorn (410-260-8639); dgoshorn@dnr.state.md.us      Watersheds : Selected tidal tributaries affected or potentially affected    by Pfiesteria in Maryland’s Chesapeake Bay and Coastal Bays      Media : water column, aquatic resources      Goals :        Provide for rapid response testing and reporting on fish health, water      quality, habitat, Pfiesteria-like organisms and associated biological communities      in cases of suspected toxic outbreaks.      Provide fish and water quality, habitat and Pfiesteria data needed to fulfill      DNR’s obligations under the State’s “Guidelines for Closing and Reopening      Rivers Potentially Affected by Pfiesteria or Pfiesteria-like Events.”      Increase understanding of critical habitat factors contributing to the      frequency of toxic outbreaks of Pfiesteria-like organisms and the relationship      to fish health.      Evaluate relationships between critical habitat factors and human activities.      Identify areas vulnerable to outbreaks of toxic Pfiesteria or Pfiesteria-like      organisms.      Track improvements in water bodies affected by Pfiesteria-like organisms      that have implemented management programs.      Provide information on the incidence and distribution of diseased fish      in Maryland’s Chesapeake and Coastal Bays; this includes sampling of closed      areas for diseased fish in assessing closure duration.      Provide samples of healthy and diseased fish for necropsy and diagnosis      by the DNR Fisheries Service’s Fish Health Unit at the Sarbanes Cooperative      Oxford Laboratory.      Provide rigorous exposure data to epidemiologists studying the relationship      between toxic Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellates and human health.      Provide samples and data to support ongoing research investigations into      fish health, harmful algal bloom ecology, and development of Pfiesteria identification      techniques.     Program Description : To meet the above goals, the general sampling approach  is categorized into four levels under the general headings of “Rapid Response”  and “Comprehensive Assessments”.   Rapid response (Level I) is classified as the immediate investigation of a    reported fish health or suspicious human health problem. The primary objectives    here are to 1) determine the nature of the fish health or human health problem,    2) ascertain if Pfiesteria-like organisms and their toxins may have been involved    and 3) determine if the river closure criteria have been met. Teams quickly    evaluate fish communities and other appropriate parameters (e.g., lesion incidence,    dissolved oxygen, salinity, etc.) to determine if a toxic outbreak can be ruled    out as the likely cause of the fish health problem and if the State ’s river    closure criteria have been met. If closure criteria are met, rivers will be    monitored intensively for all parameters until reopened. Current scientific    knowledge indicates that the behavior of Pfiesteria and Pfiesteria-like organisms    is seasonal and episodic in nature. Therefore, closure and re-openings will    be reassessed as necessary. This protocol is based on evolving scientific knowledge    and experience with Pfiesteria and Pfiesteria-like organisms and is subject    to reevaluation.  Comprehensive assessment (Levels II-IV) involve the intensive monitoring of    fish health, water quality, habitat and Pfiesteria activity in previously affected    tributaries (Level II). Additional comprehensive characterization is performed    on unaffected tributaries (Level III) that, based on historical data, have water    quality and habitat characteristics (nutrient enrichment, moderate salinity,    etc.) similar to those associated with Pfiesteria-related outbreaks. Level II    and III comprehensive assessment efforts involve the continuation of fish health,    longitudinal water quality and habitat sampling transects on these tributaries    begun in 1998. Level IV response  involves the long term fish health, water    quality monitoring programs from the Chesapeake Bay and tributaries. Examining    data from these programs provides our broadest scale view of Maryland’s waters    intended for other purposes but being utilized in these investigations to provide    a context for environmental conditions in areas outside of affected waterways.   Intensive research-oriented investigations are also currently underway on the    Pocomoke and other affected rivers. These NOAA and EPA (EMPACT) funded programs    are tightly coordinated with the Pfiesteria monitoring outlined here. Coordination    of field operations and data between those programs ensures maximum application    of resources.   Recommendations : It is critical that this effort continue in order to:        (1) collect information necessary to protect public health from the threat of    toxic Pfiesteria outbreaks,     (2) continue to refine our understanding of the relationships between human    activities on the land, estuarine habitat quality, Pfiesteria activity, fish    health, and human health, and     (3) track progress of the State’s management efforts designed to reduce the    threat of future outbreaks.           Water Quality/Aquatic Resources –  Lower Eastern Shore pollutant inputs monitoring          Agency : MDE Technical and Regulatory Services Administration      Contact : John Steinfort (410-974-3238); jsteinfort@erols.com      Watersheds : Selected tidal and non-tidal tributaries in Pocomoke, Wicomico    and Fishing Bay watersheds (areas affected by 1997 Pfiesteria incidents)      Media : water column, aquatic resources      Goals : The goal of this program is to identify sources of major nutrients    entering waters of the Lower Eastern Shore that have been identified as being    potentially impacted by the algal species Pfiesteria piscicida.      Program Description : This effort is limited to collection of water quality    samples during major storm events on the lower Delmarva Peninsula. Storm driven    runoff is captured at 10 watershed outlets ranging from the Choptank to the    Coastal Bays whenever a regional rain event makes significant nutrient loading    likely. Constituents of concern are limited to total nutrient species along    with some limited specialized forms such as urea. This is designed to compliment    the DNR Pfiesteria monitoring program by providing nutrient input estimates    for major storm events.

Program Description : Shellfish have the potential to accumulate human    pathogens, heavy metals or organic chemicals in their tissues even when these    materials cannot be measured in the water column. This makes these aquatic animals    good indicators of environmental pollution in a body of water. Monitoring contaminant    levels in tissues also allow the determination of potential human health effects.   The evaluation of the data in determining potential health effects considers:        Persistence and fate of chemical contaminants when they enter waters and      sediments;      Types of aquatic animals present in the water body;      Fat content, feeding, and migration habits of those aquatic animals;      Ability of each contaminant to accumulate in tissues of aquatic animals      and humans;      Human and animal health effects information for each contaminant;      Preparation, cooking, and fish consumption behaviors used by fishers and      crabbers;      Likelihood that sensitive populations eat these animals.    Surface waters overlying shellfish harvesting areas are sampled on a fixed frequency  to determine bacterial levels as an indication of possible pathogen contamination.  This effort is required by the US Food and Drug Administration because of the  potential for raw shellfish consumption. Sampling results are used to determine  whether closures of harvesting areas are required.   Since the 1960s, MDE has been surveying metal and pesticide levels in oysters    and clams from the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Because of low levels    of contaminants and negligible yearly changes in those levels, this baywide    monitoring effort occurs every three years, with the off years being devoted    to analyses of results and the performance of small intensive shellstock surveys.    In addition to triennial tissue monitoring for contaminants, shellstock is also    sampled to measure bacterial levels as an added check on the quality of the    harvesting waters, and as a check on the handling of the shellfish after harvesting.

Media : water column      Goals : The goals of this program are to examine the short-term and long-term    environmental impacts of dredging to waters of the Chesapeake Bay to limit or    curtail activities to minimize the pollution and to ensure that the State Water    Quality Standards are not exceeded by dredging activities in the Bay (turbidity    and nutrients).      Program Description : The Dredging Coordination and Assessment Division    in MDE’s Technical and Regulatory Services Administration is responsible for    coordinating and managing the compliance monitoring effort for dredging and    dredged material placement activities in the Chesapeake Bay. Primary emphasis    is focused on the Hart-Miller Island dredged material placement site. The compliance    monitoring effort for the baseline and post-construction or post-placement dredging    activities for any open water or upland dredged material placement site, examines    water quality impacts resulting from construction or placement of dredged material    in the Chesapeake Bay. Monitoring program elements include the assessment of    discharges from dredged material placement sites through chemical characterizations    and bioassay testing. Ambient conditions surrounding placement sites are monitoring    for chemistry, benthological community condition, contaminant bioaccumulation    in target shellfish, and sediment chemistry.   This program helps to identify what type of dredging activities are detrimental    to the water quality of the State; and in designing a comprehensive monitoring    plan that is effective and generally meets the needs of the site, and in conducting    dredging activities that produce the least water quality pollution in the Chesapeake    Bay while maximizing the dredging activity itself.                           RETURN          to Top of Page           RETURN          to Table of Contents                                    WATER RESOURCES/MONITORING PROGRAM SUMMARY      Lakes and reservoirs      All of the principal lakes in Maryland are man-made reservoirs created by impounding    water behind a dammed stream or river. There are numerous, small natural lakes    created by beaver dams, as coastal impoundments created by natural shoreline    drift, and as natural, water-filled depressions. The State identified 58 ‘significant,    publicly-owned lakes’ as water bodies having public access, a surface area of    five acres or greater, providing public benefit, and available for other public    uses (e.g., public water supply, fishing). ‘Run-of-the-river’ lakes, formed    behind relatively low dams on rivers, are not included in this profile. Based    on connecting River Reach traces (1:100,000 scale), the US Environmental Protection    Agency identified 947 lakes in Maryland, however, these include many stormwater    and waste treatment lagoons and impoundments surrounded by private lands or    on federal property - these are often inaccessible to the public and are not    considered as part of the State’s public lake listing.   Maryland’ significant, public lakes in are found in all physiographic provinces    and in all counties except Calvert, Dorchester and Talbot Counties ( Figure    6 ). These lakes range in size from 5 to 4,500 acres and account for a total    surface area of 21,010 acres. Most lakes are small (the 45 smallest lakes account    for 10 percent of the total lake area; the 4 largest lakes account for more    than half of the State's total lake acreage).

The remaining    wetland areas are non-tidal shoreline areas adjoining river and lakes (Tiner    and Burke, 1995). Wetland areas occur in all physiographic areas of the State    and in all counties ( Figure 8 ). In Maryland most wetland    areas have been lost though fill and drainage and transformation to agriculture,    urban, transportation and other commercial uses.                             Figure 8. Tidal and nontidal wetlands (shaded) in Maryland       The US Environmental Protection Agency is working to develop guidelines to    monitor tidal and non-tidal wetland condition. To date, most wetland monitoring    has been in terms of identifying the amount or quantity of wetland area existing    as an inventory updating the US Department of the Interior's National Wetlands    Inventory or as tracking changes in wetland area as a Chesapeake Bay watershed    indicator.   A number of research studies related to water monitoring in wetland areas are    underway in the several research centers, including the Smithsonian Environmental    Research Center, Patuxent National Wildlife Research Refuge and in the National    Estuarine Research Reserve sites in Jug Bay, Monie Bay and Otter Point Creek.    While not necessarily applicable to wetland areas Statewide, results from these    studies should be closely followed.                           RETURN          to Top of Page           RETURN          to Table of Contents                              WATER RESOURCES/MONITORING PROGRAM      SUMMARY     Ground water      Ground water in Maryland varies between physiographic provinces and exists in    one of two distinct types of aquifers - the unconsolidated Coastal Plain aquifers    and the consolidated sedimentary and crystalline aquifers of the non-Coastal    Plain ( Figure 9 ). Ground water contributes to baseflow    water in the State’s rivers and streams as well as subsurface flows to Maryland’s    tidal tributaries and the Chesapeake and Coastal Bays.   As a resource, ground water usage varies across the State. Outside of the Baltimore    and Washington urban areas, it is often the sole source of drinking water. About    31 percent of the State’s population uses ground water as a drinking water supply    and other major uses include livestock water supply, irrigation and industrial    uses.                             Figure 9. Coastal Plain aquifers and upland geological formations in Maryland          Ground water - Water monitoring programs       The following lists water monitoring programs in ground water that are    conducted by Maryland agencies and are designed to address water quality, water    quantity and public health issues. These summaries include contact information,    watershed/media monitored, program goals and a brief description of the monitoring    effort.      Water Quality/Human Health -  Waste monitoring programs       Agency : MDE Waste Management Administration      Contact : Karl Kalbacher (410-631-3437); kkalbacher@mde.state.md.us      Watersheds : Ground water wells      Media : Ground water      Goals : Obtain the data necessary to identify the highest priority sites    that pose a threat to human health or the environment. Investigate, oversee    remediation or perform cleanup of these high priority sites. A primary goal    of remediation activities is to protect ground water by ensuring that contaminant    sources are removed or contained in a manner which minimizes future impacts    to ground water. To the maximum extent practicable ground water resources, which    have been impacted by contamination, will be restored to their maximum beneficial    use or treated to safe levels prior to end use.      Program Description :      Federal Superfund Program  - The federal “Superfund’ program, authorized    by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act    (CERCLA), was established to identify, prioritize and cleanup hazardous waste    sites. The Environmental Restoration and Redevelopment Program within the Waste    Management Administration ensures that state requirements are met during investigation    and cleanup of sites designated for the National Priority List (NPL) and federal    facilities under the federal “Superfund” program. In Maryland, 21 sites have    been placed on the NPL; 16 of these sites are currently active. The remaining    five sites have been removed from the NPL or are in the final stages of completing    the remediation process. Additionally, the MDE has a memorandum of agreement    with the Department of Defense (DoD) covering 44 federal facilities, 37 of which    are not on the NPL. Currently, the DOD is actively working on 22 sites at which    MDE is actively overseeing the investigation or remediation of ground water    contamination.      State Superfund Program  - A similar program under State law, the State    Superfund Program, conducts investigations and oversees the remediation and    cleanup of sites listed on the State Master List that are not included on the    NPL or are not owned by the federal government. The State Master List contains    439 sites that have been identified statewide with known or potential contamination.    In Maryland, there are approximately 35 State Superfund sites at which MDE is    actively overseeing the investigation or remediation of ground water contamination.         Water Quality/Human Health -  Storage tank monitoring program       Agency : MDE Waste Management Administration      Contact : Mick Butler (410-631-3386); mbutler@mde.state.md.us      Watersheds : Ground water supply wells      Media : ground water      Goals : Monitoring activities conducted under the Oil Control Program    are designed to identify problem conditions with historic tank operations, track    the recovery of remediation efforts, and to verify that the integrity of currently    installed systems is secure. These efforts are intended to protect surface waters    and associated aquatic life from the harmful effects of petroleum and to ensure    that potable surface and ground water quality is maintained.   Program Description : The Oil Control Program, within the Department    of the Environment’s Waste Management Administration, is the unit responsible    for the implementation of the Underground Storage Tank (UST), Leaking Underground    Storage Tank, and Aboveground Storage Tank programs. These programs provide    for preventive actions to minimize ground and surface water pollution from the    storage of petroleum and hazardous substances and for remedial actions to restore    sites that have been contaminated by oil or hazardous substances. Under the    oversight of the UST program, which began in 1988, the active universe of motor    fuel underground storage tanks in the State has been reduced from over 21,000    to just fewer than 8,500. Those motor fuel underground storage tanks that remain    have been required to be replaced or upgraded to meet federal standards that    became effective on December 22, 1998. These standards include requirements    for corrosion protection, leak detection, and spill and overfill protection.    With more than 93 percent of Maryland’s underground storage tank owners meeting    the 1998 federal compliance deadline, the UST program is actively working with    the remaining underground storage tank owners to achieve full compliance with    the federal requirements. In addition to the motor fuel facilities, Maryland    regulates the storage of heating fuel in over 3,700 underground storage tanks.   One of the major causes of releases from underground storage tank systems has    been the corrosion of bare steel tanks and lines. Releases from these tanks    are required to be investigated and those with groundwater impacts are required    to define the vertical and horizontal extent of the contamination. Once defined    a Corrective Action Work plan is implemented to mitigate the impact of the contamination.    The effectiveness of remediation systems is normally evaluated through groundwater    monitoring. The Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Program has tracked    reports of over 14,500 confirmed releases throughout Maryland. Of these releases,    over 7,500 cleanups have been completed while the Oil Control Program continues    to provide oversight of over 7,500 ongoing cleanups.     The Oil Control Program administers the regulation of the transportation and    aboveground storage of oil through a series of permitting requirements. The    above ground storage facility permits include requirements for monitoring storm    water and test water discharges while petroleum contaminated soil treatment    facilities are required to also monitor groundwater. These storage tank programs    all work together to prevent the pollution of surface and ground water from    releases that can occur from the handling and storage of oil and hazardous substances.         Water Quality/Human Health -  Source water protection program       Agency : MDE Water Management Administration      Contact : Bill Beatty - compliance (410-974-3238); billbeatty@starpower.net        John Grace - source water protection (410-631-3713); jgrace@mde.state.md.us         Watersheds : Ground water supply wells      Media : ground water      Goals : The State of Maryland is committed to protect the physical, chemical    and biological integrity of the ground water resource, in order to protect human    health and the environment, to ensure that in the future an adequate supply    of the resource is available, and in all situations, to manage that resource    for the greatest beneficial use of the citizens of the State.      Program Description : Maryland Groundwater Quality Monitoring Network    - The Maryland Geological Survey (MGS), a unit of the Department of Natural    Resources, operates a Statewide network of water table wells and springs to    monitor basic water quality data to document baseline chemical quality conditions    of aquifers, and to provide a basis for monitoring future trends (Bolton, 1997).    MGS periodically samples well sites for major dissolved ions, field parameters,    selected trace elements, volatile organic compounds, classes of pesticides,    and radionuclides.   Special studies are conducted, coordinated or commissioned as needed. These    studies may be of large portions of Coastal Plain aquifers, or confined to localized    conditions around a specific water supply well. An example of a wide scale effort    would be the 1999 study of radium in the Magothy and Patapsco formations in    Anne Arundel County. Examples of localized studies would include the evaluation    of potential surface water contamination of the wells supplying Thurmont and    Westminster. See (Non-tidal rivers/streams - Drinking water protection program).         Water Quality/Human Health -  Solid waste facility ground water monitoring    program       Agency : MDE Waste Management Administration      Contact : Edward M. Dexter, P.G. (410-631-3424); edexter@mde.state.md.us         Watersheds : Ground water supply wells      Media : ground water      Goals : The Solid Waste Program is charged with the maintenance of this    monitoring program to insure that the public health, safety and comfort, and    the quality of the environment, are not compromised due to pollutants discharged    from the regulated solid waste and sewage sludge facilities. Several indicators    relate to this important function. For Managing Maryland for Results, the Program    reports the number of evaluations of groundwater quality at landfills performed    each year, and the percentage of received reports reviewed (MMR Goal #3 - Insuring    Safe Drinking Water). For the Environmental Partnership Agreement (EnPA) with    the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), SWP reports the number    of active municipal waste landfills in compliance with groundwater standards.   Program Description : The Solid Waste Program (SWP) oversees the environmental    monitoring of landfills and sewage sludge storage facilities. This activity    includes the direction and review of the groundwater and surface water monitoring    systems at these sites, to help protect the public health and the environment    from pollution, which could be caused by these facilities. Authority for the    program is provided in the Environment Article, Subtitles 9-2 and 9-3 of the    Annotated Code of Maryland. Also, federal regulations governing municipal waste    landfills (40 CFR 258 are applicable for those sanitary landfills accepting    municipal waste which operated after 1993.   Classes of facilities monitored include active municipal waste landfills; active    rubble landfills; active industrial waste landfills; closed municipal waste    landfills which are subject to the federal regulations; closed municipal waste    landfills which are not subject to the federal regulations; closed rubble and    industrial waste landfills; and sewage sludge storage lagoons. Approximately    78 facilities are monitored routinely, with over 140 separate reports submitted    to the Solid Waste Program each year. In addition, one to three special projects    are managed each year, which often involve sampling by SWP of surface water,    groundwater, waste, and suspected discharges. Some projects also involve sampling    of domestic wells, which is coordinated with the local County Health Departments.   Groundwater and surface water sampling is typically on a semiannual frequency,    although due to their geologic setting some facilities are on a quarterly frequency    for some parameters, while closed facilities which have stabilized or have not    experienced a pollutant release may be reduced to an annual sampling frequency.    Some sites only sample groundwater; others not only perform sampling for this    program but also sample surface or ground water discharges under the NPDES or    State Groundwater Discharge Permit programs.   Sampling is performed by contractors or technicians working for the applicants    and analyzed at approved laboratories, in accordance with sampling and analysis    plans approved by the Solid Waste Program. Some County governments perform sampling    using their own technicians, and some have hired the Maryland Environmental    Service or other companies to perform this work. The Maryland Department of    Health and Mental Hygiene’s laboratory performs the analytical work for some    sites, whereas most of the analysis is performed by commercial laboratories    approved by SWP. SWP requires that laboratories used be certified by DHMH for    analysis of drinking water samples, or have an equivalent certification acceptable    to SWP.   Data evaluation is performed by the staff of the Investigations and Remediation    Section, consisting of a senior geologist/section head, a staff geologist, and    a registered environmental sanitarian. Other duties assigned to this section    include review of monitoring plans, groundwater investigations, remedial plans,    landfill soil gas monitoring plans and data, and landfill closure plans.                           RETURN          to Top of Page           RETURN          to Table of Contents                                           PROGRAM COORDINATION     Communication      The national Intergovernmental Task Force on Monitoring Water Quality reported    that coordination was an essential component of an integrated monitoring strategy    (ITFM, 1995). One essential ingredient affecting coordination between water    monitoring programs has been an inconsistent communication framework.   Meetings      Water quality staff from the Department of the Environment (MDE) and the Department    of Natural Resources (DNR) often provide information about ongoing monitoring    efforts through participation in various interagency workgroups (e.g., 305(b)    Interagency Workgroup; Interagency TMDL Workgroup; Tributary Strategies Workgroup;    Biocriteria Workgroup), other Statewide and regional organizations (e.g., Maryland    Water Monitoring Council; Chesapeake Bay Program Committees/Workgroups; Susquehanna    River Basin Commission; Reservoir Protection Workgroup; Regional Biologist Conferences;    National Nutrient Criteria Workgroup), and in other formal and informal meetings    between managers and analysts. Also, in a unique arrangement, the principal    water monitoring field staff for both DNR and MDE share the same physical plant,    providing opportunities for information exchange at the field level. During    the course of normal activities, MDE and DNR field staffs consult with each    other on benthic macroinvertebrate and phytoplankton identifications and occasionally    share sampling gear and supplies. Both agencies use the same laboratories for    chemical analysis, providing for similar laboratory quality control.   These many opportunities have significantly improved communications between    Maryland’s different water monitoring agencies at all levels of participation.    However, this informal communications system is not systematic. Also, there    are other water monitoring programs operating in Maryland among local, federal,    citizen and scientific/academic organizations that generate useful data. There    are few regular forums for sharing information about all water monitoring programs.    A more formal information exchange between monitoring organizations of all types    is recommended and is being addressed through efforts of the Maryland Water    Monitoring Council (see below)   Maryland Water Monitoring Council      To address issues identified by the ITFM reports and to provide a forum for    information exchange between federal, State and local agencies and non-governmental    groups (academia, business and community groups), a Maryland Water Monitoring    Council was created in 1995 to foster cooperation among water monitoring groups.    As a stated purpose, the Council serves as a statewide collaborative body to    help achieve effective water monitoring data collection, interpretation, and    dissemination of these data. Specific goals of the Council are to:        provide a forum for effective communication, cooperation, and collaboration      among individuals and organizations involved in monitoring,      promote the development of collaborative watershed based monitoring strategies,      document monitoring activities in Maryland, and      promote the use of quality assured procedures for sample collection, analytical      methods, assessment, and data management.    The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) sponsors the Maryland Water Monitoring  Council (MWMC) and has used grant funds from the US EPA's Nonpoint Source Program  (Section 319) to provide administrative support. Council membership is voluntary  and open to all interested parties. Members of the Board of Directors are appointed  by the Secretary of DNR from among federal, State and local government agencies,  academia, business and volunteer monitoring programs. The Council has formed several  standing committees (Planning, Monitoring Methods, Assessment and Reporting, Data  Management, Indicators), as well as ad hoc committees (Stream Gauging, Small Watershed  Studies, Programmatic Coordination) to conduct the business of the Council. Staff  from both DNR and the Department of the Environment are appointed to the Board  of Directors and serve on the Council's committees and workgroups. Monitoring  staff representing field, laboratory and managerial levels attend the Council's  Annual Meeting to discuss monitoring programs with other monitoring program representatives.  This informal information exchange has resulted in increased cooperation between  monitoring groups; more frequent interagency and government-citizen contacts have  been noted. To date, the MWMC has conducted annual meetings and sponsored, through  committees, several workshops (Reference Conditions, Small Streams, Stream Gauging,  Sampling Design) and draft reports on methods and minimum data elements. For more  information, the Council's Internet site is located at  http://www.mgs.md.gov/mwmc/ .   Partly as a result of the Council’s efforts, several of the State’s regional    water monitoring programs (e.g., DNR’s Maryland Biological Stream Survey; MDE’s    Basinwide Permit and Modeling Program) work to notify local government agencies    and citizens about planned water monitoring activities. This informs local agencies    about nearby monitoring activities and provides an opportunity to coordinate    with State monitoring activities or to obtain further information about the    State agency findings.   More formal methods for monitoring coordination are also being evaluated by    the Council's Programmatic Coordination Committee. These include: a clearinghouse    containing monitoring program meta-data; a comprehensive statement of water    monitoring goals for Maryland agencies, the approaches that can be used to address    these goals, and the programs currently in place in relation to these goals;    a process for routine information exchange among monitoring groups (e.g., an    annual meeting and a web-based newsletter) to encourage collaboration when locations,    program goals, and approaches are compatible; and a collaborative effort in    the development of a statewide monitoring strategy. For example, the format    for an annual coordination meeting might be similar to the annual academic research    exchange that helped to coordinate monitoring and research efforts in the Chesapeake    Bay region prior to the establishment of the coordinating Chesapeake Bay Program.    In this case, each program would be provided time to describe proposed monitoring    plans for the year with time provided to examine cooperative sampling opportunities,    explore coordination issues and exchange contact information.   The meeting format might be similar to the annual academic research exchange    that helped to coordinate monitoring and research efforts in the Chesapeake    Bay region prior to the establishment of the coordinating Chesapeake Bay Program.    In this case, each program would be provided time to describe proposed monitoring    plans for the year with time provided to examine cooperative sampling opportunities,    explore coordination issues and exchange contact information.   Monitoring Reports      There are a variety of ways that information about water monitoring activities    in Maryland are disseminated to managers, funding agencies and other stakeholders    (agencies, businesses, scientists, and the public - individuals, students, community    groups, consultants, politicians). The reporting format and media used often    are dictated by the perceived needs of the audience.   Funding agencies have specific reporting requirements spelled out in the contract    that may include monthly or quarterly data submissions or activity reports,    summary data and/or interpretive reports. Managers often need summaries of interpretive    reports to develop/support or modify management actions. Some programs produce    annual technical reports (e.g., Coastal Bays Program) or reports that focus    on specific watersheds (TMDL reports, MD Biological Stream Survey basin reports).    For different audiences, less technical summary reports may be developed for    more diverse readership (e.g., Chesapeake Bay Program State of the Bay report,    State of the Streams report, Tributary Strategy annual reports). Some programs    have regular newsletters (e.g., MD Biological Stream Survey) that are mailed    to an open-ended mailing list. These general water quality reports and newsletters    are widely distributed to the public through mailings, meetings and exhibitions.   Maryland has a State Depository Library system which collects, documents and    distributes State agency reports among State Archives and selected library systems    across the State. DNR has an Information Resource Center which serves as a library    for the Department and serves the public as well. Long-term document storage    is available via storage at Jessup (microfiche/document).   One modern format being used extensively to provide and distribute both general    and technical information about water monitoring activities is through the Internet.    All State agencies have World Wide Web sites that are accessible 24 hours a    day, seven days a week. Local library systems across the State have public Internet    access permitting anyone access to State information.   Both DNR and MDE have posted information about water monitoring programs on    their Web sites ( http://www.dnr.state.md.us     and  http://www.mde.state.md.us , respectively).    Depending on the program, this information may include descriptive information    about monitoring programs, contact information (telephone, e-mail), opportunities    to access data in water monitoring databases or to access close to real-time    data. Some Web pages provide summaries of water monitoring results (shellfish    harvesting closures, Tributary Team water quality status and trends). Technical    or educational reports may be posted and read on-line or downloaded. In the    near future, more water monitoring information will be accessible on the Internet    as Governor Glendening has mandated that State agencies post 80 percent of their    reports on agency Web sites by 2004.      Planning      Within the federal Water Pollution Control Act amendments, Section 303(e) requires    that each State develop a planning process document that describes the State's    water quality management program. The US Environmental Protection Agency identifies    two planning documents that help develop a planning framework (see below).   Continuing Planning Process (CPP)      This document, required by Section 303 of the federal Clean Water Act and produced    by the Department of the Environment (MDE), describes the State’s water quality    management and planning processes. This report is periodically reviewed and    updated.   Water Monitoring Strategy      This interagency document describes the State’s water monitoring goals and objectives    and provides a summary of State programs that exist or are needed to meet the    State's resource management goals.   Each agency has an independent water monitoring planning process, where, among    other aspects, the previous year's efforts are reviewed as are available financial    resources, proposed costs for equipment, transportation, sampling, laboratory,    and data management are evaluated. Evaluation of ambient, long-term monitoring    programs have been quite detailed (e.g., Maryland Biological Stream Survey;    Chesapeake Bay monitoring programs).      Quality assurance/quality control      All groups involved with water monitoring should have a quality assurance plan    that addresses how they implement QA/QC activities. Overlapping layers of quality    assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedures within State agency monitoring    programs help to ensure that water data collected in these programs is of the    highest quality.   Reinforcing the importance of quality data, EPA requires that recipients of    funds for work involving environmental data collection comply with the American    National Standard ANSI/ASQC E4-1994, ""Specifications and Guidelines for Quality    Systems for Environmental Data Collection and Environmental Technology Programs"".    As part of the monitoring planning process, EPA requires:     1. documentation of the State agency's quality management system, and     2. documentation of the application of quality assurance and quality control    activities to a specific monitoring activity (Quality Assurance Project Plan).   Using guidance provided by the US Environmental Protection Agency (1999b),    both the Department of the Environment and the Department of Natural Resources    have developed and implemented agency-wide plans for water monitoring QA/QC    processes (MD Dept. of the Environment, 1999b and MD Dept. Natural Resources,    1999, respectively). These documents describe each agency's Quality Management    System that is designed to support the quality objectives of the organization.    For the multi-jurisdictional Chesapeake Bay Program, a Quality Assurance Management    Plan (Chesapeake Bay Program, 1999a) has been developed following guidelines    for EPA programs.    Each water monitoring program funded by the US Environmental Protection    Agency (EPA) is required to have an approved Quality Assurance (QA) Project    Plan which defines the layout, problem description, data quality objectives,    staff training needs, documentation, sample design and methods, sample handling    and analytical methods, quality control, instrument calibration, data management,    assessment and reporting, and data validation.   For each water monitoring program, an approved Quality Assurance Project Plan    (QA Project Plan) to document the application of quality assurance and quality    control activities must be in place before field sampling occurs. EPA provides    guidance (1999a) for the content of these Plans which should define the layout,    problem description, data quality objectives, staff training needs, documentation,    sample design and methods, sample handling and analytical methods, quality control,    instrument calibration, data management, assessment and reporting, and data    validation for each program. Approval is required by the assigned agency QA    Officer. For monitoring programs supported by EPA funds (including programs    contracted outside of State agencies as well as monitoring efforts used to match    EPA-funded projects), EPA's Regional QA Officer also must approve the monitoring    plan. Water monitoring programs not funded through EPA still are encouraged    to develop and use the QA Project Plan process to ensure that data generated    are of the highest quality.   Each field operation or laboratory has QA/QC procedures which address aspects    of training, vehicle operation, sample handling, custody processes, safety,    data entry, and instrument operation. These issues are addressed in Standard    Operating Procedure documents that are readily available to field/laboratory    staff. Updates to these basic procedures usually are focused on modifications    to sampling gear, handling and instrumentation, but new programs require development    of new procedures or modifications to existing procedures and training and evaluation    programs.      Resource management      Severe resource restrictions due to funding limitations affects personnel, transportation,    equipment, laboratory, and/or data management which directly affects the ability    of an agency to collect and process desired water monitoring samples and properly    manage the information. The present solution is to examine monitoring priorities.    If the priority is sufficiently high, resources may be temporarily shifted to    accommodate another program, otherwise, the planned monitoring effort may be    halted.   Identifying and scheduling water monitoring resources necessary to conduct    each water monitoring program (manpower, equipment, transportation, laboratory    and other contractors) is initiated by each agency's field monitoring units    (DNR - principally the Monitoring and Non-Tidal Assessment Division and the    MD Geological Survey; MDE - principally the Technical and Regulatory Services    Administration). Resources for other water monitoring activities conducted by    or on behalf of other State agency efforts (DNR - Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed    Programs; MDE - Air, Water and Waste Management Administrations, Mining Program)    are scheduled by the groups responsible for those efforts.   Resource sharing      Opportunities to ""piggyback"" sampling efforts onto another agency monitoring    program sometimes can reduce apparent duplication and costs, but the effort    needed to coordinate monitoring activities is considerable and requires each    program to have built-in flexibility (excess time, space) - something that limited    program funding does not allow. There are differences in program goals and framework    (e.g., regulatory v. long-term ambient, event-based v. random or systematic,    small-stream v large river scale) that reduce the applicability of one program’s    data to another’s needs. Intense, event-related monitoring programs, such as    the initial Pfiesteria monitoring program or Bay-wide or river sampling after    flood events, often provide sufficient pressure to coordinate sampling and laboratory    activities, but such events are difficult to plan. Because financial resources    to support monitoring efforts are limited, there are few monitoring resources    available for use by other monitoring agencies.   Volunteer monitoring      The role of volunteers or the use of data collected by volunteers in State water    monitoring programs has been a subject of considerable debate. Some agency staff    have actively worked to improve community and citizen volunteer water monitoring    programs while results of these efforts have not been included or recognized    in agency reports. Specific reasons vary, but inconsistent quality, differing    conclusions, and lack of complete information have been chief issues. Continued    discussions between agency staff and volunteer groups, demonstrations of successful    relationships between local government agencies and community and citizen volunteers,    volunteer participation in the Maryland Water Monitoring Council and on Tributary    Strategy teams, and continued improvements in quality of volunteer-collected    water information have made these issues less problematic. As a result, there    are increasing opportunities for community groups and citizen volunteers to    participate in State water monitoring issues.   In 1998, DNR received funds from federal nonpoint source management grant (Section    319) to hire a Volunteer Water Monitoring Coordinator. The purpose of the Coordinator    is to:     1) improve efficiency and economy of gathering water monitoring data by incorporating    volunteers into governmental programs,     2) assist citizen organizations in documenting the quality of their data for    use by resource and regulatory managers,     3) facilitate the exchange of information among government programs and citizen    monitoring organizations,     4) assist citizen organizations in establishing or improving their water monitoring    programs, and     5) assess the needs of citizen monitoring organizations and address those needs.   Since that position was filled, these objectives have been met in a number    of ways. A Stream Waders volunteer program was established within DNR in February    2000 and has trained over 200 volunteers in stream ecology and stream sampling    methods. A document describing the criteria for the acceptance of external data    for use by State programs and for minimum elements for the quality assurance    plan is being developed. Information exchange and assistance have been given    through a listserver of citizen monitoring organizations, presentations and    workshops for watershed organizations and Tributary Strategy Teams, and web    pages for citizen monitoring information and for the Stream Waders program.    The needs assessment has been accomplished through meetings with citizen monitoring    organizations and through individual contact. The program will strive to improving    the guidance document for data acceptance, provide more workshops for citizen    monitors on assessment and program development through technical assistance    given to individual organizations and through periodic meetings with representatives    from citizen organizations.      Data management      Principal local, State and federal water monitoring agencies have developed    individual data management processes and customized data systems to store and    assess collected data. All of the data management processes include a suite    of field and laboratory QA processes and controls (training, process audits,    sample blanks, sample duplicates, sample spikes, laboratory splits). Although    the individual tests may vary, details of these practices are provided in individual    QA Project Plans and field and laboratory Standard Operating Procedures guidance.        Data storage systems vary as much as water monitoring programs and these data    often are not directly accessible to outside users. For example, most Maryland    water data are maintained in an ACCESS database format in network-isolated Departmental    servers. A number of DNR and MDE water quality data files are maintained as    SAS or EXCEL datasets on these servers, as well.   The US Environmental Protection Agency maintains extensive water quality datasets    on their own systems; EPA’s Chesapeake Bay Program uses the Chesapeake Information    System and, on a national basis, water quality data are stored in EPA’s (STORET)    system. Many water quality datasets developed by the US Geological Survey are    housed in their proprietary WATSTORE system.   Each data system has a quality control system developed to check for accuracy,    outliers, and data entry errors. These systems permit limited access to make    changes to the original datasets, usually record changes as they are made and    ensure that periodic duplicate datasets are created and stored safely. These    precautions ensure a modest level of security.      Data access/sharing      Although computers can rapidly manipulate large datasets, the use of unique    software formats on various, isolated data systems makes it difficult to access    or share available information. Often, security practices reduce direct access    to government agency data. The increased use of the Internet to transfer data    and the ability to mirror secure agency datasets to publicly-accessible servers    to maintain security are helping to improve access to these data. A brief description    of two principal water quality data systems follows.   Chesapeake Information System      Using a watershed approach to disperses available monitoring resources across    the watershed - the larger the watershed, the more dispersed the resources.    Even in smaller watersheds, the amount of water monitoring information that    may be needed can overwhelm an agency’s resources. In these cases, sharing monitoring    data that is collected by different agencies can reduce costs, although efforts    must be expended to address differences in program goals, sample designs, sampling    protocols, quality assurance, data storage formats. Sharing information can    be useful when management decisions are multidisciplinary, they require up-to-date    information, require buy-in by others, when these decisions affect other organizations    and the public and reduce resource needs (save money).   A large watershed, like the 64,000 square mile Chesapeake Bay watershed, includes    areas in a number of States and across several federal regions and offices.    No single agency could adequately address water monitoring needs in this watershed    and, unless data from other programs are used, information from a basinwide    monitoring effort would be diluted or only a limited portion of the watershed    could be addressed. The US Environmental Protection Agency’s Chesapeake Bay    Program developed the Chesapeake Information Management System (CIMS) ( http://www.chesapeakebay.net/cims/ )    to provide an organized, distributed library of information and tools designed    to increase basin-wide public access to Chesapeake Bay information which serves    as a model of data sharing.   CIMS addresses all types of Bay information ranging from press releases to    documents to raw environmental monitoring data. CIMS also provides software    and Internet-based ‘tools’ to help users find, retrieve and analyze these data    including library tools for registering and searching for information, communication    tools (e.g., Watershed Profiles and Bay Atlas), data access tools for retrieving    selected sets of numerical data, and data analysis tools (e.g., Chesapeake Bay    Interpolator and BayStats).   The principal audience for CIMS information includes anyone with an interest    in current information about the health of the Chesapeake Bay, its rivers, and    its plants and animals This audience includes citizens, students, local, state    and federal agencies, and non-governmental groups. The benefits of CIMS include    use of the Internet to provide instant desktop access, organization of information    to help speed searches, eliminates duplicative data and information handling,    improved data quality (the responsibility of the data provider), technical tools    and support to users, and evolves quickly to be responsive to users' needs.   Internet sites in CIMS are maintained by CIMS Partners which include states,    federal agencies, academic institutions, and participating advisory groups and    commissions who signed a Memorandum of Agreement providing public access to    their Chesapeake Bay watershed information. Information assembled by these partners    use established policies, guidelines, and data dictionaries. Metadata about    the data or documents are developed registered with CIMS using COMET ( http://www.chesapeakebay.net/COMET )    and the information is kept current through scheduled updates. CIMS’ online    databases include: water quality, modeling, GIS coverage, living resources (fisheries,    benthic, plankton, Bay grasses), point sources, river flow, and citizen monitoring    ( http://www.chesapeakebay.net/data ).   In Maryland, the Department of the Environment is a CIMS partner and provides    links to data about the quality of the State's air, water, and land resources.    The Department of Natural Resources also is a CIMS partner and provides numerous    links to tidal and non-tidal water quality data sets, sediment monitoring programs    data, Maryland Biological Stream Survey data, commercial fisheries data and    juvenile striped bass data, as well as the integrated watershed analysis and    management system.     Other CIMS partners who may provide some water monitoring data in Maryland include:        the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay - will provide access to water quality      data obtained from its citizen monitors from sites across the Chesapeake Bay      region,      the US Geological Survey - provides information on water resources, mapping,      geology, biology, and ecology and other ongoing Chesapeake Bay watershed studies,      the Susquehanna River Basin Commission - provides water quality data from      the Susquehanna River Basin watershed, and      Versar, Inc., - provides CIMS with current benthic monitoring data, summary      reports, and background information collected as part of the State’s Bay Benthic      Monitoring Program.    The quality of data affects the conclusions developed from monitoring programs  and may ultimately affect water quality decisions based on these data. Ensuring  the reliability of water monitoring data requires use of quality assurance (QA)  and quality control (QC) processes. These include: development of a programmatic  QA program, implementation of appropriate QA/QC procedures in all aspects of field  sampling/data collection, laboratory analysis of samples and data management.   STORET      Water monitoring data collected by State and local agencies under EPA-funded    programs are submitted for inclusion into EPA’s STORET (STOrage and RETrieval)    system. Physicochemical data collected as part of the State’s Chesapeake Bay    Mainstem Bay Monitoring Program and the State’s Basic Water Monitoring Program    (CORE network) are routinely uploaded to STORET via the Chesapeake Bay Program.    STORET has been undergoing a multi-year modernization process and is nearly    complete. This upgrade will provide a more flexible system, including a more    accessible interface, a microcomputer version, public access and ability for    a wider to store data STORET data has been limited   Data requests/transfers      Public requests for water quality data collected by DNR or MDE are often routed    to designated staff who determine the needed parameters (location, date range,    . If the data are readily accessible from CIMS, staff usually refer the request    to the interactive CIMS data retrieval page ( http://www.chesapeakebay.net/cims/ ).    If the request is more unusual or difficult or if there is no ready access to    the Internet, the designated staff may need to create a retrieval program to    extract needed data and/or deliver the data in an requested format. If the data    request addresses information in another office or agency, the client is referred    to the appropriate office or agency.   Both DNR and MDE handle hundreds of requests for water quality data or information    from citizens, students, consultants and other government agencies. The central    data retrieval process developed by CIMS has significantly reduced staff time    needed to address these requests.                           RETURN          to Top of Page           RETURN          to Table of Contents                                           PROGRAM EVALUATION     Although monitoring provides the evaluation information for management, research    or education activities, the monitoring process requires evaluation in terms    of its success (or lack thereof) and needs. It is the evaluation phase where    having defined specific monitoring program goals and objectives early in planning    process comes into play. If goals are easily measurable, the ""success"" of the    program (i.e., goals are met) and the ""needs"" of the program (i.e., goals are    not met) are clearly identified. Evaluating programs with goals that are not    easily measured requires complex and subjective, rather than objective input.    Improvements to monitoring programs which have no goals or objective measures    may be shortchanged and the value of information from these efforts may be diminished.   From a management perspective, a ""successful"" monitoring/assessment program    depends on the active incorporation of goal setting, having adequate resources    to collect necessary data/information and the use of the collected information    in the management (decision-making) process. Programs that do not have a management    focus, however, also should be identified as ""successful"" providing that adequate    monitoring data/information are collected and used within the framework provided    by the programs' goals (US Environmental Protection Agency, 1998).   Monitoring Program Evaluation      Each water monitoring program is engaged in several levels of evaluation. On    a continuing basis, the effort is evaluated by the program or contract manager,    senior field and laboratory staff for issues that directly affect the monitoring    process. Field and laboratory audits (including the use of duplicate, split,    blank and spiked samples, inter-laboratory comparisons) are used in an effort    to measure precision, reduce error and maintain the highest quality data. Changes    in sampling site locations, field methods, laboratory procedures, and data recording/management    may be necessary for a variety of reasons. Identified resource needs or modifications    in effort are communicated to field and laboratory staff to evaluate potential    changes in terms of safety and supporting resources, to update Standard Operating    Procedures and QA Project Plans and to implement modifications, as needed. In    some programs involving other agencies, modifications may need to be approved    by a coordinating workgroup.   On an annual basis, each water monitoring program is evaluated by the program    or contract manager in terms of how well it has met its principal goals. Program    successes/failures and disposition of results need to be documented. This evaluation    needs to be provided to agencies providing financial support and to higher management    levels for evaluations related to agency priorities and budgeting.   Comparing results to program goals is not the only type of monitoring evaluation    that occurs. Changes in sampling locations, field methods, laboratory procedures,    and data recording/management may be made during the monitoring period or prior    to the initial monitoring activity. More extensive changes may require meetings    with or additional training for field, laboratory or data management personnel.    Updating a monitoring program's QA Project Plans provides another level of evaluation.    From a project perspective, this evaluation of monitoring process helps to define    future resource needs.   To provide a consistent basis for measurement, some monitoring programs have    identified subject areas or questions as evaluation criteria. These measures    can supplement goal evaluation, help evaluate specific portions of monitoring    programs and may be used for programs that may not have defined goals or specific    project plans. Example lists of program criteria measures include bioassessment    evaluation (US Environmental Protection Agency, 1998), Tributary Strategy programs    (Chesapeake Bay Commission, date), areawide monitoring reviews (US Geological    Survey, 1997). Development of a goals process or an applicable Project Plan    can reduce the need to develop evaluation criteria after the project is underway    or completed.   Agency Program Evaluation      On an annual or biennial basis, staff from the US Environmental Protection Agency    (EPA) Region III office provide a formal review of the principal State water    monitoring programs. This review ensures that needed water information is being    collected and utilized. Although this focus is on EPA-funded monitoring programs    (e.g., Basic Water Monitoring Program, Chesapeake Bay Program, nonpoint source    monitoring, ground water monitoring, discharge permit monitoring), all water    monitoring activities are reviewed. Recommendations may be implemented or considered    for future implementation depending on the complexity of proposed changes and    availability of resources needed to implement suggested changes.                           RETURN          to Top of Page           RETURN          to Table of Contents                                           REFERENCES CITED     Allan, J.

The WRAS project area encompasses about 38,500, acres including about 3,260 acres of open water. As part of WRAS project, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is providing technical assistance, including preparation of a Watershed Characterizationa compilation of available water quality and natural reources information and identification of issuesand two surveys of on-theground conditions, which may be used as the County generates its Watershed Restoration Action Strategy.  Water Quality The Breton Bay watershed does not support the uses designated for it in state regulation (water contact recreation and shellfish harvesting) due to problems with fecal coliform bacteria, nutrients and sediment. High bacteria counts have required closure of northern Breton Bay to shellfish harvesting. A large portion of central Breton Bay has conditional approval for shellfish harvesting, which limits harvesting activity. No other human health issues relating to water quality are identified in the watershed. Excess nutrient loads have contributed to algae blooms and low dissolved oxygen. High algae populations and areas that occasionally fail to meet the 5.0 mg/l dissolved oxygen standard tend to appear in upper Breton Bay in late summer. High sediment deposition has led to reports of expanding sand bars near the mouth of Town Creek. In colonial times, Leonardtown was a sea port, but it has been many years since upper Breton Bay was navigable by large vessels. Steps to improve water quality are underway. The Leonardtown Wastewater Treatment Plant, the only significant point source contributing nutrients to Breton Bay, is undergoing an upgrade which will lead to a nutrient load reduction. Collection of water quality data began in 2002 to support calculation of Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) that will determine the pollutant load reductions for all sources that are considered necessary in order for Breton Bay to meet its designated uses.  The Landscape Land in St. Mary's County / Breton watershed is nearly 60% forested, slightly more than 25% agriculture and nearly 14% developed land. Large blocks of forest that meet Maryland's criteria for high quality forest interior habitat cover about 42% of the land in the watershed. The most significant of these forest blocks from a habitat perspective, the McIntosh Run Forest Block, covers about 80% of the McIntosh Run subwatershed (as delineated by The Nature Conservancy.) This extensive forest  viii  October 2002   cover suggests that nonpoint sources of nutrients in the watershed probably arise from a relatively small land area. Only about 1% of the Breton Bay watershed has some form of protection from development. About 14% of the watershed is categorized as a Priority Funding Area where State funding may be available to improve infrastructure associated with new development. Slightly over 6200 acres (18%) of the watershed is wetlands, most of which are forested. About 16% of the watershed has hydric soil and about 18% has highly erodible soil.  Living Resources and Habitat In tidal waters of Breton Bay, available data show that problems exist for some important species. Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) acreage has been very sparse in recent years compared to historic acreage. US Fish & Wildlife Service findings suggest that water quality is limiting SAV but some opportunities for restoration may be identified. DNR data on oysters indicate that small populations are surviving in Breton Bay but a very high incidence of disease will likely inhibit restoration efforts in the foreseeable future. Relatively little information is available on fisheries, however, no fish consumption advisories apply to fish caught in Breton Bay. In nontidal waters, a Federally endangered fresh water mussel is an important local living resource needing protection. Assessment of available benthic macroinvertebrate information shows a few areas with communities rated as good while most communities are rated as fair or poor. As described above, much of the Breton Bay watershed is covered with intact forest, providing habitat for many forest interior dwelling species. Fourteen of the 19 forest interior dwelling bird species found in Maryland are found in the Tall Timbers breeding Bird survey, which includes a portion of the Breton Bay watershed.  Restoration Targeting Tools Consultants working for St. Mary's County in 1998 identified several potential sites for stream buffer restoration and wetland restoration. Additionally, a stream corridor assessment completed in 2002 will identify the status of stream buffers, stream bank erosion, etc. This information will augment information in the watershed characterization to help target potential restoration areas or projects. Computerized mapping was also used to demonstrate concepts for restoration targeting and to help identify areas for additional site investigation for restoration of stream buffers and wetlands. Based on this GIS analysis, numerous restoration opportunities may be available for site assessment subject to identifying land owner/cooperators.  ix  October 2002   CONTRIBUTORS TO THE WATERSHED CHARACTERIZATION St. Mary's County Colleen Bonnel Christi Daley Kenneth Hastings Bob Lewis Susan Veith Clare Whitbeck Bruce Young Town of Leonardtown Dr. Forrest Career and Technology Center Coastal Conservation Association, Southern Md Chapter Potomac River Association, Inc.

The assessment was conducted by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) under the direction of the US Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Water Action Plan initiative with assistance from the Maryland Departments of Environment, Agriculture and Planning and the University of Maryland. It moved beyond consideration of water quality in the streams in the state, which had been assessed regularly since the early 1970's, to a larger consideration of living resources in the streams and the landscape conditions which could impact both water quality and living resources.1,2 As part of the State's response to the findings of the Unified Watershed Assessment, DNR is offering technical and financial assistance to local governments who are willing to work cooperatively to develop and implement Watershed Restoration Action Strategies (WRAS) addressing needs for restoration and conservation in priority watersheds. One of these is the Breton Bay watershed in St. Mary's County, in which the County, the Town of Leonardtown, DNR and other local cooperators, both public and private, are engaged in the second round of the strategy development program. Location The Breton Bay watershed is located within the Potomac River basin as shown in Map 1 Regional Context. The Breton Bay watershed's geographic location entirely within St. Mary's County is highlighted in Map 2 WRAS Project Area. This area is the focus of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy and this Watershed Characterization. As Breton Bay Watershed shown in Map 3 Streams and Subwatersheds, DNR Acreage Summary subdivides the Breton Bay watershed into five MDP 2000 Land Use/Land Cover ""12-digit"" subwatersheds for analytical purposes. To Land Water Total assist in restoration planning, St. Mary's County has further divided the watershed into additional 35,193 3,256 38,449 subwatersheds as shown in Map 4 County Subwatersheds and described in the County Subwatersheds Table . Purpose of the Characterization One of the earliest steps in devising a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy is to characterize the watershed using immediately available information. This Watershed Characterization is intended to meet several objectives: 1 October 2002         briefly summarize the most important or relevant information and issues provide preliminary findings based on this information identify sources for more information or analysis suggest opportunities for additional characterization and restoration work. provide a common base of knowledge about the Breton Bay watershed for local governments, citizens, businesses and other organizations  Additional Characterization Work The Watershed Characterization is intended to be one starting point that can be updated as needed. It is part of a framework for a more thorough assessment involving an array of additional inputs:  self-investigation by St. Mary's County  targeted technical assistance and assessment by partner agencies or contractors  input from local citizens  completion of a Stream Corridor Assessment, in which DNR personnel physically walk the streams and catalogue important issues.  completion of a synoptic water quality survey, i.e. a program of water sample analysis, that can be used to focus on local issues like nutrient hot spots, point source discharges or other selected issues. This is also part of the technical assistance offered by DNR. Findings of the 2002 synoptic survey of the streams in the Breton Bay watershed are reported in Appendix D.  Identifying Gaps in Information It is important to identify gaps in available watershed knowledge and gauge the importance of these gaps. In assessing data gaps, we have found it helpful to review information in four categories:  Habitat: physical structure, stream stability and biotic community (including the riparian zone)  Water Quantity: high waterstorm flow and flooding; low waterbaseflow problems from dams, water withdrawals, reduced infiltration  Water Quality: water chemistry; toxics, nutrients, sediment, nuisance odors/scums, etc.  Cumulative effects associated with habitat, water quantity and water quality. Because restoration is an active evolving process, the Watershed Characterization and the resulting Watershed Restoration Action Strategy should be maintained as living documents within an active evolving restoration process. These documents will need to be updated periodically as new, more relevant information becomes available and as the watershed response is monitored and reassessed.  2  October 2002   Subwatersheds Selected By St. Mary's County For The Breton Bay Watershed WRAS Project 12-Digit Subwatersheds Number Name Letter County Subwatersheds Area in Acres With Water 6,801 2,268 1,507 2,907 2,258 2,030 596 2,080 3,769 610 1,677 5,560 380 3,440 2,565 38,449 Land Only 4,044 1,806 1,507 2,907 2,257 2,030 596 2,080 3,769 610 1,677 5,539 380 3,440 2,551 35,193 Description  02140104 -7020  Direct Drainage Breton Bay  A B C D  Shoreline Drainage Area Combs Cr and Cherry Cove Cr Town Run Moll Dyers Run Bottom Land Drainage Nelson Run Greenhill Run Milski Run Glebe Run and Gravely Run Bottomland Drainage McIntosh Run Headwaters Brooks Run Bottomland Drainage Headwaters Burnt Mill Creek Tom Swamp Run & Rich Neck Cr.  02140104 -7021  Lower McIntosh Run  A B C D  02140104 -7022 02140104 -7023  Glebe Run Headwaters McIntosh & Brooks Run Burnt Mill Creek  -A B C  02140104 -7024  A B C  02140104  Breton Bay Watershed  3  October 2002   WATER QUALITY Water quality is in many respects the driving condition in the health of Maryland's streams. Historically, the emphasis has been on chemical water quality. More recently, interest has focused on the biological conditions in streams and estuaries; active consideration of the physical parameters is even more recent. This developmental path is reflected in the ways in which streams have been monitored, the types of data gathered, and the regulatory approach taken.  Water Quality Standards and Designated Uses All streams and other water bodies in Maryland are assigned a ""designated use"" in regulation, COMAR 26.08.02.08, which is associated with a set of water quality criteria necessary to support that use. The Breton Bay watershed is assigned two uses: - Use I, Water Contact Recreation and Protection of Aquatic Life: All surface waters not designated as Use II. - Use II, Shellfish Harvesting Waters: All estuarine areas. Map 5 Designated Uses and Use Restrictions depicts the distribution of surface waters in each category. (COMAR or MDE should be consulted for official regulatory information.) 3,5  Shellfish Harvesting Restrictions As shown in Map 5 Designated Uses and Use Restrictions , portions of Breton Bay are affected by shellfish harvesting restrictions. Tidal waters closest to Leonardtown are ""restricted"" which ""means that no harvesting of oysters and clams is allowed at any time."" The central area of Breton Bay contains ""conditionally approved waters"" which ""means that oysters and clams can normally be harvested except for the three days following a rainfall of an inch or greater in 24-hours."" These restrictions are applied by the Maryland Dept. of the Environment (MDE) to protect public health because elevated fecal coliform counts are commonly found in the upper Breton Bay. The elevated counts suggest the presence of contamination by animal or human waste. Restrictions are necessary because oysters and clams are filter feeders that readily absorb pathogens in animal or human waste.  Water Quality IndicatorsSetting Priority for Restoration and Protection The Clean Water Action Plan's 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment established priorities for watersheds in the State for restoration and protection. In the Plan, the Breton Bay watershed was included in two categories for priority action: highest priority for restoration, and priority for protecting valued resources. 4 October 2002   As the basis for the prioritization, indicators of water quality, landscape and living resources were developed for all watersheds in Maryland. Other approaches to assessing water quality have been in use for several years and are further described below. In general they do not look comparatively at watersheds as the Unified Assessment did in an effort to set priorities. The Unified Assessment also considered a range of living resource and landscape indicators described a little later. The Unified Assessment looked at five water quality indicators in comparing the State's 134 watersheds; for two of these (a water quality habitat index and a eutrophication index) there were insufficient data to characterize Breton Bay. The remaining three were used to place Breton Bay in the rankings of the 134 watersheds. 1. Nutrients Two of the most important pollutants in the Chesapeake Bay system are the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus, deemed this because of their contribution to excessive growth of algae, speeding the processes of eutrophication. Computer models are used to calculate how much of each of these nutrients reaches the streams and how much of each is ultimately delivered to the Bay. To arrive at the indicators for Modeled Total Nitrogen (TN) and Modeled Total Phosphorus (TP) reported in the Unified Assessment, the models calculate the amounts of these nutrients contributed by 1) nonpoint sources, based on land use and estimates of certain land management practices, 2) estimates of such factors as deposition from the air, plus 3) actual discharges from point sources. The modeling results placed Breton Bay in the better 50% of watersheds statewide for both TN and TP; although nutrients are a concern in Breton Bay, they are not the reason for the watershed's being given priority for restoration. The most recent data from the models (2002) show Breton Bay annual loadings of 5.71 pounds per acre of nitrogen and 0.35 pounds per acre of phosphorus, even lower than the calculations used in the Unified Watershed Assessment . And the results of the Spring, 2002 synoptic survey (described later) bear out the low (better) ranking of Breton Bay in comparison with other watersheds in the state. The third water quality indicator, which is responsible for the watershed's being a priority for restoration, is its being included on the list of impaired waters (the ""303(d) list"") waters not supporting their designated uses. 2. State 303(d) ImpairmentNot Supporting Designated Use. A periodic of assessment of water quality statewide is required under Section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act. As part of the assessment, Maryland tracks waterways that do not support their designated use in a list of ""impaired waters"" and in a prioritized list of ""Water Quality Limited Basin Segments"" also known as the 303(d) priority list. Information considered in setting the 303(d) list priorities includes the severity of the problem, threat to human health and high value resources, extent of understanding of problem causes and remedies.5  5  October 2002   The Breton Bay watershed is identified as ""impaired"" in the Draft Maryland's 2002 303(d) List. (Satisfactory completion of a public comment period and approval by US EPA is required before the list can be finalized later in 2002.) There were, at the time the Unified Assessment was compiled, seven factors considered in determining that waters were impaired: nutrients, sediment, bacteria, pH (an indicator of acidity), temperature, metals and organics. New listings will also include biological impairments. Reasons for Breton Bay's being considered impaired are fecal coliform bacteria, nutrients and sediments, all estimated to come from a combination of nonpoint, or diffuse, sources, including natural sources. Each impairment identified in the 303(d) List is assigned a priority which is intended to help communicate the need for correcting the impairment relative to all impairments listed Statewide. Waterways with impairments having the greatest potential impacts to human health, high value resources, etc. are ranked numerically 1 through 25. All other impairments that are not ranked in the top 25 are ranked high, medium or low.  Total Maximum Daily Loads The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) uses the 303(d) priority list as the basis for determining Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) of stressors or impairments to listed water bodies. In general, TMDLs include several key parts: 1- Existing conditions for pollutant loads and pollutant sources. 2- Maximum pollutant load that the water can accept while still allowing the water body to meet its intended use. 3- Allocation of the maximum pollutant load to specific pollutant sources. Based on a voluntary schedule submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1999, MDE has set several target years for establishing Breton Bay TMDLs. (Note: work load scheduling is subject to change): - 2004, nutrients TMDL - 2007, fecal coliforms TMDL - 2008, suspended sediment TMDL To collect the data necessary for TMDL work, MDE began water quality monitoring in Breton Bay in 2001.8 MDE staff have offered to share findings from the monitoring data when its analysis is complete.  6  October 2002   Why Are Local Waters Impaired? Nutrients . In Maryland, most water bodies naturally have low levels of the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus. These nutrients enter waterways from all types of land and from the atmosphere. Nutrient pollution or over-enrichment problems may arise from numerous sources. Residential land can be an important contributor of nutrients depending on fertilizer use, extent of lawn and the status of septic systems. Farmers apply nutrients using different approaches, so nutrients entering waterways from crop land vary greatly depending on management techniques. Typically, smaller amounts of nutrients reach surface waters from an acre of forest land than from an acre of other types of land. The atmosphere can contribute various forms of nitrogen produced by burning fossil fuels in power plants and other industries, and from automobiles. Some of what the atmosphere deposits originates far from the Breton Bay watershed. And a good deal of the excess of nutrients in Breton Bay itself likely originate from the Potomac River rather than the watershed. Suspended Sediment . Most unpolluted streams and tidal waters naturally have limited amounts of sediment moving ""suspended"" in the water. Excessive amounts of suspended sediment in waterways are considered pollution because they can inhibit light penetration, prevent plant growth, smother fish eggs, clog fish gills, etc. Sediment in streams tends to arise from stream bed and bank erosion and from land that is poorly vegetated or disturbed. Suspended sediment pollution may arise from construction sites, crop land, bare ground and exposed soil generally. The amount of sediment contributed varies greatly site to site depending upon stream stability, hydrology, management controls and other factors. Fecal Coliforms . One class of bacteria typically found in the digestive tract of warmblooded animals, including humans, is known as fecal coliforms. Fecal coliform bacteria are always found in animal waste and human sewage (unless it is treated to kill them). In unpolluted streams and tidal waters, it is common for water samples to contain very few of these bacteria. Water samples exhibiting significantly larger fecal coliform bacteria populations are ""indicators"" of contamination by animal, including human, waste. Depending on local conditions, sources of fecal contamination may include any combination of the following: inadequately treated sewage, failing septic systems, wild or domestic animals, urban stormwater carrying pet waste and similar sources.  7  October 2002   National Academy Press, Clean Coastal Waters (2000) What Are the Effects of Nutrient Over-Enrichment? 6 The productivity of many [lake, estuary and] coastal marine systems is limited by nutrient availability, and the input of additional nutrients to these systems increases primary productivity [microscopic organisms including algae]. In moderation in some systems, nutrient enrichment can have beneficial impacts such as increasing fish production; however, more generally the consequences of nutrient enrichment for [lake, estuarine and] coastal marine ecosystems are detrimental. Many of these detrimental consequences are associated with eutrophication. The increased productivity from eutrophication increases oxygen consumption in the system and can lead to low-oxygen (hypoxia) or oxygen-free (anoxic) water bodies. This can lead to fish kills as well as more subtle changes in ecological structure and functioning, such as lowered biotic diversity and lowered recruitment of fish populations. Eutrophication can also have deleterious consequences on estuaries even when low-oxygen events do not occur. These changes include loss of biotic diversity, and changes in the ecological structure of both planktonic and benthic communities, some of which may be deleterious to fisheries. Seagrass beds are particularly vulnerable to damage from eutrophication and nutrient over-enrichment. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) harm fish, shellfish, and marine mammals and pose a direct public health threat to humans. The factors that cause HABs remain poorly known, and some events are entirely natural. However, nutrient over-enrichment of coastal waters leads to blooms of some organisms that are both longer in duration and of more frequent occurrence. Although difficult to quantify, the social and economic consequences of nutrient over-enrichment include aesthetic, health, and livelihood impacts  Tributary Team Characterization To assist work of the Lower Potomac Tributary Team, DNR analyzed data from long term water quality monitoring stations to characterize water quality status and trends. However, Breton Bay could not be assessed because no long term monitoring stations are located here. However, monitoring stations in the Potomac River mainstem, upstream and downstream of Breton Bay, may suggest water quality influences arising from the Potomac River. In the summary table below, the status for each parameter in the table is a relative ranking at three levels: good, fair and poor. For example, poor 8 October 2002   means this area's ranking is poor relative to comparable Chesapeake Bay tributaries with comparable salinity. This information is from DNR's Internet site http://www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/tribstrat/locator.html which includes maps of the Lower Potomac River showing the status and trends. These maps allow qualitative comparison of regional conditions. 1, 9 Potomac River Parameter Nitrogen: total Phosphorus: total Algae: Abundance Dissolved Oxygen (summer, bottom waters) Water Clarity: secchi depth Suspended Solids: total Status 1997 -99 data Upstream Poor Poor Fair Fair Poor Fair Downstream Fair Good Fair Poor Fair Good Trend 1985 through 1999 Upstream Improving Improving Degrading Improving Degrading Degrading Downstream No Trend Improving No Trend No Trend No Trend No Trend  Water Quality Monitoring Only one multi-year monitoring program is active in Breton Bay. It is the fecal coliform monitoring conducted to support MDE's Shellfish Certification Program. Its findings of elevated fecal coliform counts have led to the long-standing shellfish harvesting restrictions in Breton Bay. Several short term or special purpose monitoring efforts recently began collecting water quality data. Available information on station locations is shown on Map 6 Monitoring By Programs.. 1. US Fish and Wildlife Service 2001 Water Quality Monitoring US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) sampling by Dr. Peter Bergstrom during 2001 was conducted in tidal waters near the shoreline. Initial water quality findings are summarized here. Additional data will be collected in 2002. See Map 6 Monitoring By Programs, for locations where samples were taken. The purpose of the USFWS monitoring was to gauge the likelihood that submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) would survive local conditions. Therefore, water quality findings were measured in relation to benchmarks for SAV survival. The 2001 USFWS data suggest that water quality in the upper Breton Bay may be too poor to support SAV while the quality in lower Breton Bay may be good enough. Additional sampling is needed to increase confidence in these initial conclusions.  9  October 2002    Water clarity as measured by secchi disk depth was frequently poor (less than one meter) at stations BB1 and BB2. However, stations BB3 and BB4 tended to have secchi depths around one meter or a slightly better.  High algae populations as measured by chlorophyll a where identified in late spring. Station BB1 tended to have the highest chlorophyll a concentrations.  Dissolved oxygen bottom concentrations close to Leonardtown (station BB1) failed to meet the State standard of 5.0 mg/l in spring and late summer 2001. All other stations consistently surpassed the standard but dipped close to 5.0 mg/l in late summer.  High total suspended solids concentrations were greater than 15 mg/l at all stations in spring 2001 but dropped below that level in summer except for station BB1.  Dissolved inorganic phosphorus was frequently greater than 0.01 mg/l at station BB1. 2. Other 2001 Water Quality Monitoring MDE initiated monitoring in 2001 to support work on TMDLs for Breton Bay. Stations are located to gauge water quality conditions in Breton Bay and pollutant inputs into the Bay. MDE will make its findings available when analysis of the 2001 monitoring data is complete. St. Mary's County Technical Center (Dr. Forrest Career and Technology Center) students under the direction of Instructor Christi Daley, assessed nontidal stream sites for biological and physical habitat parameters in 2000 and 2001. Their findings are summarized in the Benthic Macroinvertebrates section. Additional monitoring may be anticipated. 3. 2002 Water Quality Monitoring Three different groups collected water quality information during 2002 as summarized here. At the time this characterization was compiled, results of this work were not yet available. DNR's Watershed Restoration Division conducted a Synoptic Survey of water quality in selected nontidal streams in 2002 (see Restoration Targeting Tools and Appendix D). DNR's Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) targeted Breton Bay's nontidal tributaries for monitoring in 2002. Water quality and biological data are typically collected concurrently. Stream Waders, a project of MBSS initiated in 2000, in which citizen volunteers are trained and conduct benthic macroinvertebrate sampling, expanded monitoring to selected streams in the Breton Bay watershed in Spring 2002. Map 7 Monitoring By Volunteers shows the locations of their monitoring. Results of their work are unavailable for the Watershed Characterization but they may be available to assist in preparation of the St. Mary's County Watershed Strategy. The initiative behind this effort is part of the Potomac River Association's Breton Bay project. The Association hired consultant Richard Klein of Community and Environmental Defense Services who identified and organized the volunteers to receive training and to conduct the monitoring. Summing Up. Based on the available water quality information, Upper Breton Bay tends to have the greatest populations of algae and fecal coliforms. These conditions probably relate to the hydrology of the Bay and its watershed. Compared to other parts of Breton Bay, the upper estuary appears to be where circulation and flushing rates are likely to be slowest. The upper estuary is also likely to be   where nutrients from much of the land in the watershed initially become available for primary production, i.e. algae growth.  Sources of Pollution Since European settlement of North America there has been an explosive growth in human population, supported by more intensive agriculture and the growth of industry. The entire continent has been cris-crossed and made mutually interdependent by vast transportation systems. All of this contributes to the decline in quality of our water and other natural resources. 1. Point Sources Discharges from pipes or other ""discrete conveyances"" are called ""point sources."" Point sources may contribute pollution to surface water or to groundwater. For example, wastewater treatment discharges may contribute nutrients or microbes that consume oxygen (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)) reducing oxygen available for other aquatic life. Industrial point sources may contribute various forms of pollution. Some understanding of point source discharges in a watershed can be useful in helping to identify and prioritize potential restoration measures. The Breton Bay watershed has few permitted point source discharges, based on information from the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) permit data base. Summary information is presented in the MDE Permits Summary Table and on Map 8 MDE Permits:  The Leonardtown Wastewater Treatment Plant is the only permitted surface water discharge contributing nutrients to Breton Bay. The average daily discharge from the facility is 450,000 gallons. The facility is being upgraded by the Town of Leonardtown to include Biological Nutrient Removal (BNR) which will reduce both nitrogen and phosphorus entering Breton Bay.7  The two groundwater discharges for treated sewage effluent are not known to affect Breton Bay water quality. However, no assessment of groundwater entering the Bay from these areas has been conducted.  Discharges from the other permitted facilities will not significantly affect water quality if permit requirements and good operational practices are followed. If accidents or operational problems occur, sediment and/or petroleum wastes could cause localized water quality problems. Characteristics of the these permitted discharges (volume, temperature, pollutants, etc.) are tracked by MDE through the permit system.

The MDE permits listed under this heading address the mining activity. The surface mine information was compiled by two independent sources Richard Klein of Community & Environmental Defense Services and Bruce Young of the St. Mary's Soil Conservation District. 2. Diffuse or Nonpoint Sources Nonpoint sources are also significant contributors of pollutants, particularly nutrients and sediment. These diffuse sources include rain water that runs off roofs, streets and parking lots (sometimes via storm drains) into nearby surface waters, as well as run-off from farm fields and, to a much lesser extent, forests. Also included in nonpoint source pollution is deposition from the atmosphere and contributions from ground water, where septic systems are a factor. A. Nutrients The role of nonpoint source nutrients relative to point source nutrients in Breton Bay's 303(d) listing for nutrients is not spelled out. Problems with depressed dissolved oxygen concentrations in 13 October 2002   some areas, local conditions supporting algae blooms and USFWS 2001 data point to a nutrient problem without identifying its source. The modeled nutrient loads used to estimate Breton Bay's nonpoint source contributions for the watershed indicators reported earlier in this chapter were intended to support a statewide comparison of watersheds. These estimates cannot be confidently used to gauge nonpoint sources within the watershed. However, in the near future nonpoint source nutrient loads will be assessed in greater detail. During 2002, synoptic water quality monitoring will be used to generate estimates of base flow nutrient loads in various Breton Bay tributaries. Also during 2002, work by the Center for Watershed Protection may also include estimates for nonpoint source nutrient loads within the Breton Bay watershed. Then, MDE modeling for the TMDL will partition nutrient load between nonpoint sources and point sources. Given the current understanding of nutrient loads and related problems in Breton Bay, it is reasonable for WRAS partners to prioritize projects with the intention of reducing nutrient loads for several reasons:  Anticipated TMDL nutrient load limits may require reduction of nonpoint source nutrients if the upgrade of the Leonardtown Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) does not eliminate nutrient-related water quality problems in Breton Bay.  Even if the Leonardtown WWTP upgrade would be sufficient to single-handedly meet TMDL nutrient load limits in the near term, growth in the Leonardtown sewer service area will tend to increase point source nutrient loads. It is reasonable to project that WRAS projects in the Breton Bay watershed could provide relatively cost-effective nonpoint source nutrient load reductions compared to additional costly treatment plant upgrades. B. Sediment Nonpoint source sediment loads have not been estimated for the Breton Bay watershed. However, several current sources of information identify sediment as a problem:  In recent years, local residents report that sedimentation in upper Breton Bay near Leonardtown is a visible problem. They observe that the sand bar near the mouth of Town Run has grown significantly larger based on their recollection. Sediment transport from Town Run and perhaps other tributary streams is believed to be the cause.  Stream assessments conducted in 2001 by the Potomac River Association, Inc. and its consultant, Community and Environmental Defense Services, identified stream segments that appeared to have abnormal amounts of sediment movement. Additional investigation and findings by the 2002 Stream Corridor Assessment will help identify areas of stream bank erosion that could be targeted for restoration projects.  The Soil Erodibility Indicator discussed in the Land Use section suggests that erosion and sediment transport will be a continuing management issue in the Breton Bay watershed. Erodible soils are a natural physical condition. Therefore, promoting action by local land owners and 14 October 2002   managers to reduce erosion and sedimentation can be an effective WRAS program. Various practices could be promoted, such as maximizing vegetative ground cover, minimizing exposure of bare soil and soil disturbance, and using best management practices where soil disturbance is unavoidable. Work by the Center for Watershed Protection will help identify local areas in the watershed that could be prioritized for restoration and retrofit projects aimed at reducing erosion and sediment movement. C. Shoreline Erosion Wherever land and open water meet, change in the form of erosion or accretion of land is the inevitable result of natural processes. Human activity in these areas often either inadvertently accentuates these natural processes or purposefully attempts to control movement of water and/or loss of land. Erosion of shorelines can contribute significant amounts of nutrients (mostly phosphorus) and sediment (water column turbidity, habitat loss.) Countywide shoreline erosion is summarized in the following table. 9 St. Mary's County Shore Erosion Rate Summary (Miles of Shoreline) Total Shoreline Total Eroding Shoreline Erosion Rate 0 to 2 feet / year 61 2 to 4 feet / year 9 4 or more feet / year 17  297  87 (29%)  Maps of historic shoreline change were produced in 1999 by the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) in a cooperative effort between DNR and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These maps included digitized shorelines for several different years in St. Mary's County. The maps show that extensive changes have occurred adjacent to large bodies of open water. Copies of these 1:24000 scale maps are available from the MGS. Currently, DNR is working to improve our ability to predict areas of high-rate shoreline erosion. In addition to considering historic erosion rates, contributory effects of land subsidence and sea level rise are being considered. To help generate predictive tools, two pilot areas have been selected: St. Mary's County and Dorchester County. Results from this work are not currently available but information will be shared with St. Mary's County and other interests when they become available.  15  October 2002   Groundwater and Water Supply Groundwater in the Breton Bay watershed is the source of nearly all water used for agriculture and business, and all potable water. In general, these water uses do not employ near-surface groundwater, which is subject to potential local pollution sources. Additionally, near surface groundwater is credited with carrying nutrients, particularly nitrogen, from land source to surface waters where nutrient over-enrichment is occurring. All public water supply systems in the Breton Bay watershed are served by groundwater, as listed in the table below and on Map 9 Water Supply. The Aquia Aquifer, which is an important groundwater source, is relatively protected from local contamination because it is a confined aquifer. The outcrop of the Aquia Aquifer shown in Map 10 Aquia Aquifer intercepts the surface in a broad strip of land, sometimes several miles wide, that is on the southeast side of the fall line to the south and east of Washington DC.20 MDE's wellhead protection strategy for public well systems using confined aquifers (like the Aquia Aquifer) does not address the recharge zones due to the extremely great travel times between the recharge areas and the public water supplies. The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) has an ongoing project with the St. Mary's County Metropolitan Commission (METCOM) and the MGS to identify 10-year time of travel capture zones around METCOM's well heads. Within the 10-year zones, MDE recommends that the water supplier seek the assistance of the County Health Department to require that unused wells be abandoned and sealed.15 Community Water Supply Permits in the Breton Bay Watershed Map Key 1 2 3 Permittee Name Breton Bay Leonardtown St. Mary's Industrial Park Permit Number(s) SM690337, SM920537 SM670053, SM811397 SM813372 SM732385, SM732379 SM232067, SM812431 SM732066 SM730699, SM920571 [number unavailable] SM813493, SM813494 SM920701, SM920699 SM690238 15  Source Formation Aquia Aquia Aquia  4 5 6 7 8  King-Kennedy Wilderness Run Mulberry South Holland Forest Christmas Tree Farm  Aquia Aquia Aquia Aquia Nanjemoy  16  October 2002   LANDSCAPE Water quality, particularly in streams and rivers, is affected by the land in the riparian zone and by soils, vegetative cover and the land use throughout the watershed. In an effort to gauge the affects of land use on water quality, and to allow comparison between watersheds, DNR has developed a series of Landscape Indicators. These indicators can be used to portray landscape conditions on a watershed scale that tend to support good water quality or that tend to degrade water quality. Landscape Indicators The 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan included a unified watershed assessment that used a number of landscape indicators to assess the State's 138 watersheds.2 Most indicators are relative measures by which a watershed like Breton Bay can be compared with the other 137 watersheds of similar size that together cover the entire State of Maryland. The following sections identify the findings for the Breton Bay watershed, with the exception of the population density indicator, which is based on 2000 Census data not available when the Unified Assessment was done. Landscape Indicator Summary Indicator Impervious Surface Finding 4.3% Interpretation Breton Bay is ranked in the best (lowest percentage) half of watersheds statewide. It should be noted that this indicator varies significantly between subwatersheds. A comparison with other watersheds in the state has not been completed using the 2000 census data. Breton Bay is in the top quarter of watersheds for this indicatorthose with the greatest loss. Breton Bay is among the lowest-percentagebestquarter of the state's watersheds on this indicator. Breton Bay is among the 34 watersheds (25% of the total) with the highest erodibility.  Population Density  0.31 people/land acre 17,931 acres 9% 0.33 value/acre  Historic Wetland Loss Unbuffered Streams Soil Erodibility  1. Impervious Surface On average across the entire Breton Bay watershed, 4.3% of surface cover is impervious. This average imperviousness compares well with similar watersheds in Maryland.2  17  October 2002   Roads, parking areas, roofs and other human constructions are collectively called impervious surface. Impervious surface blocks the natural seepage of rain into the ground. Unlike many natural surfaces, impervious surface typically concentrates stormwater runoff, accelerates flow rates and directs stormwater to the nearest stream. Watersheds with small amounts of impervious surface tend to have better water quality in local streams than watersheds with greater amounts of impervious surface. The Maryland Biological Stream Survey has related the percent of impervious surface in a watershed to the health of aquatic resources. For areas with less than 4% impervious cover, streams generally rate ""Fair"" to ""Good"" for both fish and instream invertebrates. Beyond about 12% impervious surface, streams generally rate ""Poor"" to ""Fair"" for both. Side-effects of impervious surfaces become increasingly significant and negative as the percentage of impervious area increases. Examples of related problems include reduction of groundwater infiltration, increased soil and stream bank erosion, sedimentation, destabilization or loss of aquatic habitat, and ""flashy"" stream flows (reduced flow between storms and excessive flows associated with storms.) The impervious surface estimate used for this indicator was generated for the 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment . Each land use type in the 1994 Maryland State Planning land use data was assigned an estimated imperviousness taken from the TR-55 manual used by the former Soil Conservation Service. 2. Population Density The population density in the Breton Bay watershed was 0.31 people per acre of land, using 2000 Census data, which differ from what is shown in the Unified Watershed Assessment . A comparison with other watersheds in the state has not been completed using the 2000 census data.2 While population density may be beyond the scope of a WRAS, directing growth is a potential WRAS component. As human population increases, the effects of human activity that degrades, displaces, or eliminates natural habitat also tend to increase. Watersheds with higher populations, assuming other factors are equal, tend to exhibit greater impacts on waterways and habitat. However, growth can be directed in ways to reduce negative impacts. 3. Historic Wetland Loss The Breton Bay watershed is estimated to have lost nearly 18,000 acres of wetlands over the years. This is a relatively large loss of wetlands compared with other similar Maryland watersheds.2 This interpretation is based on the assumption that the hydric soils in the watershed were all, at one time, wetlands. Thoughtful selective restoration of historic wetland areas can be an effective WRAS component. In most of Maryland's watersheds, extensive wetland areas have been converted to other uses by draining and filling. This conversion unavoidably reduces or eliminates the natural functions that wetlands provide. 4. Unbuffered Streams Approximately 9% of streams in the Breton Bay watershed were not buffered with trees, based on 1998 information. Corridors 100 feet wide (50 feet either side) along streams were combined with forest cover to develop this indicator. This estimate of streams lacking forested buffer was generated 18 October 2002   for the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan by using Maryland Department of State Planning GIS data for streams and for 1994 land use. The finding for Breton Bay compares well with other Maryland watersheds; this relatively low percentage of unforested riparian area limits the utility of one potential WRAS strategy, buffer reforestation, to address problems in Breton Bay. 2 In most of Maryland, trees are key to healthy natural streams. They provide numerous essential habitat functions: shade to keep water temperatures down in warm months, leaf litter ""food"" for aquatic organisms, roots to stabilize stream banks, vegetative cover for wildlife, etc. In general, reduction or loss of riparian trees / stream buffers degrades stream habitat while replacement of trees / natural buffers enhances stream habitat. (For this indicator only ""blue line streams"" were included. Intermittent streams were not considered.) 5. Soil Erodibility Soil erodibility for the Breton Bay watershed is represented by what is known as the K factor, in this case estimated to be 0.33.2 The K factor normally varies from approximately zero to about 0.6. A K value of 0.17 has a very low erosion potential, a value of 0.32 has a moderate erosion potential, a value of 0.37 has a high erosion potential, and a value of 0.43 has a very high erosion potential. Breton Bay's erodibility is moderate, although its ranking among all watersheds in the state was fairly high. Watersheds with more highly erodible soils are naturally more susceptible to surface erosion, sedimentation, streambank erosion and other problems related to soil movement. These negative effects of soil erodibility on water quality can be minimized through careful management. The soil erodibility indicator accounts for natural soil conditions but not for management of the land. (Existing cropland management was not considered.) The naturally erodible soils in the watershed are addressed by techniques called Best Management Practices (BMPs) to prevent soil loss, practices that are typically in use on local farms. BMPs like no-till or reduced till cropping, planting cover crops, field strips, or retiring erodible soils from production can significantly reduce erosion and sediment movement. These BMPs can be seen in use in many places in the watershed. Because soils can vary significantly within very small areas, a generalized erodibility indicator must be used with caution and supplemented with site-specific evaluation prior to implementing any management action.  19  October 2002   Land Use  2000 Land Use  Breton Bay Watershed The following table and pie chart summarize 2000 land use / land cover for the Breton Bay Watershed as categorized Urban (13.90%) Wetlands (0.69%) Agriculture (25.06%) by the Maryland Department of Planning. Other (1.09%) Nearly 60% of the Breton Bay watershed is forest or brush. About one quarter of the land is in some form of agriculture and about 14% is covered with some type of developed or urban Forest (59.26%) use. All other types of land together amount to less than 2% of the watershed. Viewing these general land use categories as potential nonpoint sources of nutrients, agricultural lands are likely to contribute the greatest loads to local waterways. Urban lands may also contribute significant nutrient loads. Map 11 Generalized 2000 Land Use shows the distribution of these land use categories in the watershed.  2000 Land Use Summary Breton Bay Watershed in St. Mary's County Category Agriculture Forest Urban Wetlands Other Description Field, Pasture, farm buildings All woodlands and brush All developed areas Tidal marsh, Emergent wetlands Extractive industry, bare ground (sand and gravel pits, etc.) Acres 8,800 20,900 4,900 200 400 35,200 38,449  Watershed Total  excluding open water Watershed Total  including open water  Lands With Significant Natural Resource Value and Large Area Forest lands in the McIntosh Run watershed have been identified as important natural resource and habitat area by two different programs: DNR's Green Infrastructure model and The Nature 20 October 2002   Conservancy's ecoregion-based planning process. These independent programs agree on emphasizing the ecological value of the watershed and the importance of maintaining its extensive, contiguous forest. In general, actions taken to assure that forest cover will be maintained, to avoid fragmentation of forest, and to restore forest in areas that have been cleared will contribute significantly to improving the water quality in this watershed and to conserving the biodiversity of the State. 1. Green Infrastructure DNR has mapped a network of ecologically important lands, comprised of hubs and linking corridors, using several of the GIS data layers used to develop other indicators. Hubs contain one or more of the following: - areas containing sensitive plant or animal species; - large blocks of contiguous interior forest (at least 250 contiguous acres, plus the 300 foot transition zone); - wetland complexes with at least 250 acres of unmodified wetlands; - streams or rivers with aquatic species of concern, rare coldwater or blackwater ecosystems, or important to anadromous fish, and their associated riparian forest and wetlands; and - conservation areas already protected by public (primarily DNR or the federal government) and private organizations like The Nature Conservancy or Maryland Ornithological Society. This ""Green Infrastructure"" provides the bulk of the state's natural support system. Ecosystem services, such as cleaning the air, filtering and cooling water, storing and cycling nutrients, conserving and generating soils, pollinating crops and other plants, regulating climate, protecting areas against storm and flood damage, and maintaining hydrologic function. Protection of Green Infrastructure lands may be addressed through various existing programs including Rural Legacy, Program Open Space, conservation easements and others. The 2001 Maryland General Assembly approved $35 million for the GreenPrint program which is targeted primarily to protecting Green Infrastructure areas. GreenPrint is administered by Program Open Space. Map 12 Green Infrastructure shows that, even from the statewide perspective that guided the analysis, there is a significant amount of Green Infrastructure in the Breton Bay watershed:  The largest Green Infrastructure hub in the watershed encompasses significant portions of the McIntosh Run area. This hub ranks, ecologically, in the top 5% of Green Infrastructure hubs in the western Coastal Plain of Maryland. The Maryland Department of Planning projected that this hub may lose as much as 30% of its 1997 natural vegetative cover by 2020;  Other watershed hubs include areas around the lower reaches and headwaters of Glebe Run; both Moll Dyers Run and Nelson Run have areas of hub and corridors, and a small portion of another hub covers part of the lower western shore of Breton Bay near the Potomac River. 2. McIntosh Run Forest Block Assessment By The Nature Conservancy Nationwide, the private non-profit organization, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) has embarked on an ecoregion-based planning process in consultation with State Natural Heritage Programs to identify the most important sites for future conservation activities. The resulting 21 October 2002   ecoregional plans identify rare species habitat, as well as larger sites that by virtue of their size, condition and lack of fragmenting features, represent high-quality examples of common, widespread natural communities, and serve as coarse filters to identify areas important for the conservation of common native species. The Maryland/DC Chapter of The Nature Conservancy worked with staff of the Maryland, Delaware and Virginia Natural Heritage Programs to develop TNC's Chesapeake Bay Lowlands Ecoregional Plan which covers lands within the 16 Maryland Counties that border the Bay as well as portions of coastal Delaware and Virginia. In this plan, the large expanse of relatively undeveloped, intact forest along McIntosh Run was identified as a conservation target. In comparison with the 13 blocks in this ecoregion in Maryland, the McIntosh Run block has several significant attributes based on statistics provided by the Maryland/DC Chapter of The Nature Conservancy:  It is relatively small compared to the other blocks  Forest cover exceeds 80%; only three blocks in Maryland have forest cover percentage this high.  It possesses the lowest road density of all of the forest blocks in the ecoregion.  It has a low percentage of developed land compared to other Maryland blocks. Additional information and a map showing TNC's interpretation of the McIntosh Run forest area are presented in Appendix A. 3. Large Forest Blocks Within large blocks of forest, habitat is available for species that are specialized for conditions with relatively little influence by species from open areas or humans. For example, forest interior dwelling birds require forest interior habitat for their survival and they cannot tolerate much human presence. Map 13 Forest Interior shows blocks of contiguous forest that are at least 50 acres in size with at least 10 acres of forest interior (forest edge is at least 300 feet away) that may be important locally within the Breton Bay watershed. This size threshold was chosen to help ensure that the forest interior is large enough to likely provide locally significant habitat for sensitive forest interior dwelling species. The assessment shown in Map 13 differs from the Green Infrastructure assessment which considered only large blocks of forest land cover at least 250 acres in size that are likely to have state or regional importance.  Protected Lands As used in the context of watershed restoration, ""protected land"" includes any land with some form of long term limitation on conversion to urban / developed land use. This protection may be in various forms: public ownership for natural resource or low impact recreational intent, private ownership where a third party acquired the development rights or otherwise acquired the right to limit use through the purchase of an easement, etc. The extent of ""protection"" varies greatly from one circumstance to the next. Therefore, for some protected land, it may be necessary to explore the  22  October 2002   details of land protection parcel by parcel through the local land records office to determine the true extent of protection. For purposes of watershed restoration, a knowledge of existing protected lands can provide a starting point in prioritizing potential restoration activities. In some cases, protected lands may provide opportunities for restoration projects because owners of these lands may value natural resource protection or enhancement goals. The following listing and Map 14 Protected Land and Smart Growth summarize the status of protected lands in the Breton Bay watershed.  Overall, about one percent of Breton Bay watershed has some form of protection.  One County Park, Judge PH Dorsey Memorial Park, encompasses about 67 acres.  Agricultural easements and agricultural districts together account for a few hundred acres of land in the Breton Bay watershed.  No DNR land or Federal land is in Breton Bay watershed  No easements by Maryland Environmental Trust or private conservation organizations have been identified in the watershed.  The Town of Leonardtown owns a former SHA property located in the McIntosh Run floodplain. The Town has demolished abandoned buildings and removed debris from the site.7 This land is not depicted on the map because its status regarding protection is not specified. Existing protected lands could be assessed as potential contributors to WRAS implementation. Various types of opportunities could be explored:  Potential sites for implementation projects and/or demonstration projects  Opportunities for management enhancement or additional protection  Opportunities for expanding protection from currently protected land to adjacent parcels.  23  October 2002   Soils of the Breton Bay Watershed  Natural Soil Groups  1. Interpreting Local Conditions with Breton Bay Watershed Natural Soil Groups Soil conditions like soil type and (0.61%) (14.70%) moisture conditions greatly affect how land may be used and the potential for vegetation and (4.07%) habitat on the land. Soil conditions are one determining factor for water quality in streams (52.06%) and rivers. Local soil conditions vary greatly (28.56%) from site to site as published information in the Soil Survey for St. Mary's County shows. This information has been summarized into Natural Soil Groups to help identify useful generalizations about groups of soils. Map 15 Soils By Natural Soils Groups shows the distribution of natural soils groups in the Breton Bay watershed. The pie chart creates even broader categories from the natural soils groups (clockwise from 12 o'clock):  Prime farmland soils cover slightly less than 15% of the watershed, mostly to the north.  Sandy, excessively well drained soils cover slightly more than 4% of the watershed. Sandy soils tend to be in headwater areas of Breton Bay's tributary streams.  Well drained soils cover over 28% of the watershed mostly in the north central and central areas of the watershed.  Soils with wetness limitations (E2a, F2, F3, G2, G3) cover about 52% of the watershed, particularly along streams and in extensive areas in the middle and lower watershed.  All other soil types (borrow pits, etc.) cover less than 1% of the watershed. 2. Soils and Watershed Planning Local soil conditions can be a useful element in watershed planning and for targeting restoration projects. Soils with limitations like wetness or slope naturally inhibit active use for farming or development and may then be available as restoration project sites. By comparing Map 15 Soils By Natural Soils Groups with the three preceding maps listed below, it may be possible to discern how patterns of active or passive land use relate to soil conditions:  Map 11 Generalized 2000 Land Use  Map 12 Green Infrastructure Natural Soils Groups and other soils assessments can be used to help identify potential areas for restoration projects or habitat protection. Hydric soils, for example, are more easily restored as wetlands than soils that were never saturated with water. St. Mary's County already has identified highly erodible or hydric soils as shown in Map 16 Hydric Soils And Highly Erodible Soils and the table Soils With Highly Erodible and Hydric Conditions. Once areas of interest are targeted and landowner 24 October 2002   interest is verified, additional detailed soil assessment is an essential step in identifying viable restoration project sites.

Wetland Categories The Coastal Plain Province likely has the highest diversity of emergent estuarine and palustrine (fresh water) wetland communities relative to other Maryland physiographic regions because both tidal and nontidal freshwater marshes occur here. Wetlands are most abundant in the Coastal Plain due to the low topographic relief and high ground water table characteristic of the region. Estuarine Wetlands. Estuarine wetlands are abundant throughout the Coastal Plain. These systems consist of salt and brackish tidal waters and contiguous wetlands where ocean water is at least occasionally diluted by freshwater runoff from the land. These wetlands may extend far upstream in tidal rivers to freshwater areas. Differences in salinity and tidal flooding within estuaries have a significant effect on the distribution of these wetland systems. Salt marshes occur on the intertidal shores of tidal waters in areas of high salinity. Brackish marshes are the predominant estuarine wetland type in Maryland. They are found along the shores of Chesapeake Bay, mostly on the Eastern Shore, and for considerable distance upstream in coastal rivers. Estuarine shrub swamps are common along the Maryland coastal zone. Aquatic beds, comprised mostly of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), were historically abundant in shallow water zones of Maryland's estuaries, especially Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Palustrine wetlands. These are freshwater wetlands that are not associated with streams or lakes. In general, palustrine wetlands are associated with freshwater, high water tables or intermittent ponding on land. Forested wetlands are the most abundant and widely distributed palustrine wetland type on the Coastal Plain. These wetlands are found on floodplains along the freshwater tidal and nontidal portions of rivers and streams, in upland depressions, and in broad flat areas between otherwise distinct watersheds. Tidal freshwater swamps occur along coastal rivers in areas subject to tidal influence. Scrub-shrub swamps are represented in the Breton Bay watershed. Emergent wetlands on the Coastal Plain are characterized by a wide range of vegetation, depending on water regime. (Adapted from Wetlands of Maryland, Tiner and Burke, 1995.) 2. Tracking Wetlands Oversight of activities affecting wetlands involves several regulatory jurisdictions. The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) is the lead agency for the State and cooperates with DNR, the Army Corps of Engineers and other Federal and local agencies. As part of its responsibility, MDE tracks State permitting and the net gain or loss of wetlands over time. As the table on the next page shows, the State regulatory program has measured a small net increase of wetland acreage in the Breton Bay watershed over the past 10 years. This slowing of wetland loss in the watershed contrasts significantly with the estimated historic18,000 acre wetland loss in the watershed as described in the Landscape Indicators section.  26  October 2002   Tracking Nontidal Wetland Change By Watershed For The St. Mary's County Area In Acres 1/1/1991 through 12/31/2001 14 Watershed Breton Bay St. Mary's River St. Clement Bay Wicomico River Gilbert Swamp Potomac River Patuxent River Basin Code 02140104 02140103 02140105 02140106 02140107 02140101 02131101 Permanent Impacts -1.28 -3.09 -0.33 -0.65 -0.58 -0.52 -7.89 Permittee Mitigation 2.59 3.68 0 0 0.78 0 4.55 Programmatic Gains 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Other Gains 0 0 0 0 0.21 0 0.39 Net 1.31 0.59 -0.33 -0.65 0.41 -0.52 -2.95  Notes: 1) Regulatory tracking for authorized nontidal wetland losses began in 1991.

Interpreting Wetland Distribution Map 17 Wetlands and Wetland Acreage Summary Table summarize distribution and categories of wetlands in the Breton Bay watershed. Overall, two wetland categories account for 88% of the wetlands in the watershed:  Estuarine wetlands on unconsolidated bottom are slightly over 52% of all watershed wetlands, and  Palustrine wetlands account for nearly 36% of total watershed wetlands (fresh water not associated with lakes). Wetland Acreage Summary Table Breton Bay Watershed Wetland Class Estuarine emergent scrub shrub unconsolidated bottom unconsolidated shore Palustrine emergent flooded semipermanently forested scrub shrub unconsolidated bottom unconsolidated shore Total Wetlands (DNR mapped wetlands)  In comparing the wetlands map to Map 11 Generalized 2000 Land Use, it can be seen that many of the nontidal wetland areas are Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) depicted as forest on the land use 127 acres of the wetlands in the table are subject to map. And most of the estuarine WSSC regulations. See the Sensitive Species Section. wetlands are not identified on the land use map These differences are simply the result of two differing views of the landscape. For example, wooded nontidal wetlands can be viewed as ""wetlands"" from a habitat / regulatory perspective and they can be viewed as ""forest"" from a land use perspective. Similarly, most of the estuarine wetlands shown on the wetlands map are considered open water on the land use map. In the Breton Bay watershed, differing perspectives on counting wetlands are significant for watershed management. From a land use perspective, 180 acres of wetlands are identified by the Maryland Department of Planning. From a habitat / regulatory perspective, there are at least 6,220 acres of wetlands in the watershed. In the context of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS), wetlands serve valuable water quality and habitat functions that may not be provided by other land uses. Therefore, protection and enhancement of existing wetlands, and restoration of past wetland areas, can be a valuable element in the WRAS. (Also see the Wetland Restoration section.)  Acres 247 6 3,263 1 120 12 2,213 103 254 1 6,220  28  October 2002   Floodplains Flooding was identified as a local issue early in the WRAS project. Flooding of public roads crossing streams is a particular concern. Map 18 Floodplain and Sea Level Rise shows that the 100year floodplain extends far up tributaries to Breton Bay. The most extensive of these tributary floodplains is along McIntosh Run. In recent years, stormwater management requirements have provided a means to limit impacts of new development and impervious area that would otherwise contribute to stream degradation and flooding. However, these new projects may not significantly improve water quality or quantity problems that are driven by systemic watershed factors. For existing development and impervious area, retrofitting controls to enhance water quality and limit peaks in stormwater runoff may offer an additional way to protect waterways. However, consideration of retrofits must address at least two local issues: - Potential negative effects on sensitive aquatic species, particularly the globally rare fresh water mussel, need to be avoided. - Experience in the adjacent St. Mary's River watershed demonstrates that large regional waterway projects have been very controversial among local residents even though they successfully prevent flooding. (An example is a project that was initiated in the 1960s to protect Great Mills.)  Low Elevation Areas Subject to Sea Level Rise Most areas of the Breton Bay watershed have sufficient elevation to be unaffected by any potential for sea level rise in the next 50 to 100 years. However, marshes and other low-lying wetlands are at risk for inundation. As a gauge of the risk posed by potential sea level rise, a Maryland-wide assessment of land at an elevation of 1.5 meters or less was first published in 1998 and then repackaged in a 2000 State report.10 One area of Breton Bay that was identified at this statewide scale is at the mouth of McIntosh Run as shown in Map 18 Floodplain and Sea Level Rise. Currently, DNR is considering sea level rise as it works to improve prediction of shoreline erosion. St. Mary's is one of two counties for which erosion rate maps have been developed; unfortunately, erosion rate data for Breton Bay were missing when these maps were made. New information that may be generated by this effort will be shared with local jurisdictions as it becomes available.  29  October 2002   LIVING RESOURCES AND HABITAT  Living resources, including all the animals, plants and other organisms that call the land and waters of the Breton Bay watershed home, are being affected by human activity. The information summarized here suggests that some of the significant stresses on living resources in the watershed are alteration and destruction of habitat, excessive movement of sediment and excessive availability of nutrients. The living resource information summarized here should be considered a partial representation, because numerous areas of potential interest or concern could not be included due to lack of information, time, etc. For example, information on many forms of aquatic life, woodland communities, terrestrial habitats, etc. should be considered as watershed restoration decisions are being made. Therefore, it is recommended that stakeholders in the watershed identify important living resource issues or priorities so that additional effort can be focused where it is most needed. New information should be added or referenced as it becomes available.  Living Resource Indicators Aquatic organisms are sensitive, in varying degrees, to changes in water quality and aquatic habitat. They are also sensitive to landscape changes. This association offers two perspectives that are important for watershed restoration. First, improvements for living resources offer potential goals, objectives and opportunities to gauge progress in watershed restoration. Second, the status of selected species can be used to gauge local conditions for water quality, habitat, etc. This second perspective is the basis for using living resources as an ""indicator."" The Maryland Clean Water Action Plan's Unified Watershed Assessment, published in 1998, included a number of living resource indicators for the Breton Bay Watershed.2 Several of these indicators rely on extrapolations from a limited number of sampling sites which were then generalized to represent entire watersheds. Some are indices comprising several conditions. Considering this limitation on field data, it would be beneficial to conduct additional assessments to provide a more complete understanding of local conditions. 1. SAV Abundance For tidal areas of the Breton Bay watershed, the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) scored ""1.0"" for the Abundance Indicator, which means that SAV covered 10% or less of the potential SAV habitat. This indicator is designed to allow comparison of watersheds based on actual SAV acreage versus potential SAV acreage. To generate the score for this indicator, two measurements of SAV area were used: 1) area covered by SAV in the year 1996 was measured using aerial survey data, and 2) the potential SAV area was measured based on water depth (up to two meters deep), physical characteristics and historic occurrence of SAV.  30  October 2002   The benchmark used in the Unified Watershed Assessment of the Clean Water Action Plan for the SAV Abundance indicator was 10%. If less than 10% of the potential SAV area in a watershed was covered by SAV in 1996, then the watershed was listed in the category ""needs restoration"". If more than 10% of the potential SAV area in a watershed was covered by SAV in 1996, then the watershed was listed in the category ""needs preventative action"" to protect or enhance SAV abundance. No watershed in the State scored higher than 2, reflecting a maximum observed coverage of 20%. 2. SAV Habitat Index For tidal areas of the Breton Bay watershed, the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) scored ""3.3"" for the Habitat Index, which means that SAV habitat requirements were not met based on 1994-1996 data. This index is designed to allow comparison of watersheds based on several measurements of habitat conditions: water clarity as measured by secchi depth, dissolved inorganic nitrogen where applicable, dissolved inorganic phosphorus, abundance of algae as measured by Chlorophyll a and total suspended solids. The benchmark used in the Unified Watershed Assessment for the SAV Habitat Index was 7. A score less than 7 means that the watershed's habitat conditions were not favorable for SAV and the watershed was listed as being in need of restoration (Category 1). A score of 7 or higher means that 1994 through 1996 data showed that habitat conditions for SAV in a watershed were sufficient and the watershed was listed in the category for ""restoration needed"". Breton Bay is among the lowest scoring half of watersheds statewide on this indicator. 3. Migratory Fish 21 A number of the most valuable fish species found in the Chesapeake Bay must migrate up tributary streams to spawn. The migratory fish indicator rates watersheds based on the diversity of spawning habitat for seven species: American Shad, Hickory Shad, Alewife, Blueback Herring, White Perch, Striped Bass, and Yellow Perch. It deals with a highly valued function of non-tidal streams and for this reason can be considered an indicator of vulnerability to human-induced damage. It also reflects the condition of the resource. This indicator scores watersheds based on the number of migratory fish species from 0 - 7 that spawn within the watershed Breton Bay, with a score of 2, ranked relatively low on this indicator, suggesting interventions that address fish passage may be appropriate. 4. Nontidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) 21 The Coastal Plain stream benthic IBI looks at the insects and other invertebrates, like crayfish, living on the bottoms of streams, considering the overall community composition, the number and diversity of species and the presence of sensitive species. To calculate the benthic IBI, for the Unified Watershed Assessment , reference conditions were established for minimally-impacted streams. IBI values are relative to conditions in these minimally-impacted streams. Breton Bay ranked in the top quartile in the state on this indicator in the 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment. 31 October 2002   5. Nontidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) 21 As interest in whole ecosystems, and ecosystem health, has grown, Indexes of Biotic Integrity (IBIs) for fishes have been developed for small (first- to third-order) non-tidal streams. Several characteristics of the fish community are measurednumbers of native species, of benthic species and of tolerant individuals; the percent of tolerant species, of dominant species, and of generalists, omnivores and insectivores; the number of individuals per square meter; biomass in grams per square meter; percent of lithophilic spawners; and percent insectivores. These characteristics are scored and summed to calculate a fish IBI for each sampled stream. Scores for watersheds are reported as means for the sites within each watershed (one most degraded, 10 best condition). With an IBI score of 8, the Breton Bay watershed ranked in the top quartile of watersheds statewide in the 1998 Assessment. 6. Headwater Streams in Interior Forest 21 Small headwater streams are among the most likely areas for finding native riparian vegetation. Further, these areas provide important aquatic habitat, and retaining riparian vegetation improves water quality. Often these streams and their surrounding forest are lost during the process of developing land into urban uses. The lack of forest along first order streams leads to a marked decrease in the quality of downstream resources as a result of erosion, nutrient inputs, temperature, and other influences. The Breton Bay watershed ranks in the top quartile, statewide, for this indicator. 7. High Quality Habitat for Forest Interior Dwelling Species (FIDS) 21 Recent work by DNR for the Strategic Forest Lands Assessment has developed an indicator to compare watersheds on the basis of habitat for FIDs. High quality FIDS habitat is defined as a predominantly mature hardwood or mixed hardwood-pine forest tract, at least 100 acres in size, of which forest interior habitat comprises at least 25% of the total forest area. Intact forest, as suggested elsewhere, is a relatively scarce landscape feature and is vulnerable to destruction as land is converted to agricultural or, more common in recent decades, urban uses. Breton Bay watershed ranks in the top quartile of watersheds, statewide, for this indicator. Birds Limited information is available on birds in the Breton Bay watershed based on data collected in the Tall Timbers breeding bird survey route. The Tall Timbers route meanders through south central St. Mary's County near the Potomac River including portions of the Breton Bay watershed. The survey results on breeding bird abundance averaged for the period 1966 through 2000 show that 14 of the 19 forest interior dwelling (FID) birds found in Maryland were also identified along the Tall Timbers route. This finding indicates that forest interior habitat supporting these species has been available in the Breton Bay watershed vicinity. (Also see Map 13 Forest Interior.) However, the available data has not been assessed to determine if loss of forest interior habitat from development, forestry and other causes is impacting FIDs abundance in the area. Additional details are available in Appendix B Breeding Bird Survey for Tall Timbers 1966-2000. 32 October 2002   Additionally, DNR tracks eagle nest locations and colonial waterbird nesting areas. Available information indicates that eagle nests are uncommon in the Breton Bay watershed as shown in Map 20 Sensitive Species. There are several Least Tern colonies in St. Mary's County along the Potomac River but none are located in the Breton Bay watershed.  Fish and Crabs 1. Tidal Areas Commercial fisheries harvest information is tracked by Maryland DNR Fisheries Service. In general, Breton Bay's data for several important commercial species is aggregated with several other tidal Potomac tributaries for reporting purposes, as listed below. Reporting for other commercially harvested species is for significantly larger geographic areas. In general, fisheries information is available on DNR's Internet site.  Blue Crabs: In the reporting area for all Maryland Potomac tidal tributaries in St. Mary's and Charles County, the annual commercial harvest ranged from 995,000 to 1,950,000 pounds for 1995 to 1999. Breton Bay probably represents a small percentage of the reported harvest.  Striped Bass: In the reporting area for all Maryland Potomac tidal tributaries in St. Mary's and Charles County except the St. Mary's River, the annual commercial harvest ranged from 67,000 to 110,000 pounds during the period 1996 to 1999. Breton Bay probably represents a small percentage of the reported harvest. 2. Nontidal Areas Information on fish in nontidal streams is primarily gathered as part of the Maryland Biological Stream Survey. See MBSS Findings for summary information. Additional information on fish populations and related recreational activities will be incorporated as it becomes available. 3. Fish Consumption Advisory In late 2001, MDE issued revised fish consumption advisories. While the advisory addressed fish caught in the Potomac River mainstem between Washington, DC and the Route 301 Bridge vicinity, no advisories were issued for Breton Bay or the Potomac River mainstem near Breton Bay. Also see the section on shellfish closure in the Water Quality chapter.  33  October 2002   Benthic Macroinvertebrates  17, 18  1. Benthos in Nontidal Streams Several different benthic population and habitat sampling efforts have been conducted in the Breton Bay watershed at sites as shown in Map 6 Monitoring Stations. The most recent data available on ""bugs"" living in streams (benthic macroinvertebrates or benthos) in Breton Bay streams was conducted in 2000 and 2001 by students at the Dr. Forrest Career and Technology Center. Their efforts focused on the lower portion of the watershed. As shown in the 2000-2001 Findings table, most benthic populations and habitat conditions tended to be poor. Notable exceptions were the good rating for the benthic population at station MD-01 in Moll Dyers Run, and the fair ratings at stations in McIntosh Run and Gravely Run.  Why Look at Benthos in Streams? Benthos are sometimes called ""stream bugs"" though that name overly simplifies the diverse membership of this group. Unimpaired natural streams may support a great diversity of species ranging from bacteria and algae to invertebrates like crayfish and insects to fish, reptiles and mammals. Benthic macro-invertebrates, collectively called benthos, are an important component of a stream's ecosystem. This group includes mayflies, caddisflies, crayfish, etc., that inhabit the stream bottom, its sediments, organic debris and live on plant life (macrophytes) within the stream. The food web in streams relies significantly on benthos. Benthos are often the most abundant source of food for fish and other small animals. Many benthic macroinvertebrates live on decomposing leaves and other organic materials in the stream. By this activity, these organisms are significant processors of organic materials in the stream. Benthos often provide the primary means that nutrients from organic debris are transformed to other biologically usable forms. These nutrients become available again and are transported downstream where other organisms use them. Benthos are a valuable tool for stream evaluation. This group of species has been extensively used in water quality assessment, in evaluating biological conditions of streams and in gauging influences on streams by surrounding lands. Benthos serve as good indicators of water resource integrity because they are fairly sedentary in nature and their diversity offers numerous ways to interpret conditions. They have different sensitivities to changing conditions. They have a wide range of functions in the stream. They use different life cycle strategies for survival.  34  October 2002   Earlier assessments in 1995 were conducted by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) as summarized in the 1995 MBSS Findings Table . The results from two Burnt Mill Creek sites demonstrate that two segments of the same stream that are not very far apart can vary significantly in character  varying from good upstream to fair/poor further downstream. 2000-2001 Findings By Dr. Forrest Career and Technology Center Students Breton Bay Watershed In St. Mary's County Station # Stream Location Nelson Run McIntosh Run Unnamed Trib to Glebe Run Gravely Run Year Score 2001 2001 2001 2000 2001 MD-01 UTMD-01 Moll Dyers Run Moll Dyers Run Unnamed Trib 2001 2000 2001 2001 2.4 3.0 2.14 2.7 3.28 4.14 2.4 1.6 Benthos Condition Poor Fair Poor Poor Fair Good Poor Poor Physical Habitat Score 96 136 70 120 124 91 120 85 107 Condition Very Poor Fair Very Poor Poor Fair Very Poor Poor Very Poor Poor  NR-01 MR-01 UTGR-01 GR-01  UTMD-02  35  October 2002   1995 MBSS Findings * Breton Bay Watershed In St. Mary's County Station # SM-...-95 S-040-128 S-006-212 Stream Location Burnt Mill Creek Burnt Mill Creek Fish Score 3.75 4.0 Description Ranges from 1.0 (worst) to 5.0 (best) Ranges from 1.0 (worst) to 5.0 (best) Range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) Condition Fair Good Benthos Score 3.86 4.43 Condition Fair Good Physical Habitat Score 20.45 94.59 Condition Poor Good  Index Used In 1995 MBSS Fish Index of Biotic Integrity Benthic Index Biotic Integrity Physical Habitat Index *       Additional details are available at www.dnr.state.md.us .

Based on that information, it appears that oysters inhabiting Breton Bay are few in number and they are significantly impacted by disease. In recent years there appears to be a trend toward increasing observed mortality. In 2001, the observed mortality rates for the two oyster bars surveyed were 74% and 76%. Spat seeding projects in Breton Bay in the 1990s did produce measurable improvements, but it appears that disease overcame most of the seed oysters by 2000. Additional information is in Appendix C Fall Oyster Bar Survey Results for Breton Bay 1990-2001.19 Oyster bars are areas defined by law to protect and control oyster habitat and populations of oysters. Legally-defined oyster bars are depicted on charts maintained by DNR. In Breton Bay, charted oyster bars cover about 900 acres, which is nearly one third of the Bay as shown in Map 19 Oysters . The boundaries of the oyster bars shown in the map were delineated in 1983. They are larger than any oyster habitat or populations that they may contain. Regulations control activities in and around the oyster bars. For example, regulations prohibit digging for clams in areas labeled on the chart as oyster bars or within 150 feet of an oyster bar. Protection of oyster bars is considered in the 36 October 2002   review of proposed projects like dredging and marina construction or expansion before permits are issued.19 The current-day oyster lease areas in Breton Bay cover slightly over 52 acres of bay bottom. Lease areas do not include any natural oyster habitat or populations. The map shows that current day Breton Bay legal oyster bars are located approximately where they were 90 years ago according to a survey of oyster beds by C.C. Yates conducted between 1906 and 1912. Reporting of commercial oyster harvest for Lower Potomac River tributaries aggregates information for Breton Bay with St. Clements Bay and Wicomico River. For this aggregate area, the annual commercial oyster harvest ranged from 60,000 to 87,000 pounds during the period 1990 to 1996 but it declined to 7,000 pounds in 2000. Within this reporting area, a small percentage of the commercial oyster harvest is from Breton Bay. In recent years, activities of the Wicomico River Commission have served to help focus State attention on restoring or constructing oyster beds in the Wicomico River, but similar interests have not arisen for Breton Bay.  Sensitive Species Sensitive species are most widely known in the form of Federally-listed Endangered or Threatened animals such as the bald eagle. In addition to these charismatic rare animals, both US EPA and Maryland DNR work through their respective Federal and State programs to protect numerous endangered, threatened, or rare species of plants and animals and the habitats that support those species. For the purposes of watershed restoration, it is valuable to account for known locations of habitat for these species, which are often indicators, and sometimes important constituents, of the network of natural areas or ""green infrastructure"" that are the foundation for many essential natural watershed processes. Protecting these species and/or promoting expansion of their habitats can be an effective component for a watershed restoration program. 1. Habitat Protection Categories DNR's Wildlife and Heritage Division uses three designations for areas providing habitat for sensitive species. These designations are described in the text box Maryland's Sensitive Species Protection Areas. As shown in Map 20 Sensitive Species, two of the three sensitive species designations are found in the Breton Bay watershed. The purpose of these designations is to help protect sensitive species and their habitat through the review of applications for State permits or approvals, and review of projects that involve State funds. For the types of potential projects described above, DNR makes recommendations and/or sets requirements to protect sensitive species and their habitat. These categories do not place requirements on any activities that do not require a permit/approval or do not involve State funds. However, there are State and Federal restrictions that address ""takings"" of protected species, which apply more broadly. In addition, many counties have 37 October 2002   incorporated safeguards for these areas into their project and permit review processes. In all instances, property owners are encouraged to seek advice on protecting the sensitive species / habitat within their ownership. More details and guidance can be requested from DNR Natural Heritage staff. 2. Rare, Threatened and Endangered Species List The following table lists the rare, threatened and endangered species found in the McIntosh Run watershed In general, these species are located within the SSPRA area on the Sensitive Species Map. A recent Statewide assessment of rare fish and mussels suggested that the Breton Bay watershed contains species and habitat of Statewide importance. Additional work on the assessment is being conducted and results are anticipated to be available next year. Rare, Threatened and Endangered Species of the McIntosh Run Watershed Common Name Dwarf wedge mussel Purple cress Cat-tail sedge Red turtlehead Deciduous holly Large-seeded forget-me-not Climbing dogbane Scientific Name Alasmidonta heterodon Cardamine douglassii Carex typhina Chelone obliqua Ilex Decidua Myosotis macrosperma Trachelospermum difforme 11  Status (Maryland unless noted) Federal endangered watch list highly rare threatened threatened threatened endangered  38  October 2002   Sensitive Species Protection Areas In the Breton Bay Watershed  Sensitive Species Project Review Area (SSPRA) At least four SSPRAs are identified in the Breton Bay watershed. Each SSPRA contains one or more sensitive species habitats. However, the entire SSPRA is not considered sensitive habitat. The SSPRA is an envelope identified for review purposes to help ensure that applications for permit or approval in or near sensitive areas receive adequate attention and safeguards for the sensitive species / habitat they contain. Also see Map 20 Sensitive Species.  Natural Heritage Area (NHA) No NHAs are located in the Breton Bay watershed. NHAs are rare ecological communities that encompass sensitive species habitat. They are designated in State regulation (COMAR 08.03.08.10). For any proposed project that requires a State permit or approval that may affect an NHA, recommendations and/or requirements are placed in the permit or approval that are specifically aimed at protecting the NHA.. To help ensure that proposed projects that may affect an NHA are adequately reviewed, an SSPRA is always designated to encompass each NHA and the area surrounding it.  Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) Two WSSCs, totaling about 125 acres, are designated in the Breton Bay watershed as shown on Map 20 Sensitive Species: One is located along Miski Run and one along lower McIntosh Run. Both were designated to protect habitat for rare wetland plant species. For any proposed project that requires a wetland permit, these selected wetlands have additional regulatory requirements beyond the permitting requirements that apply to wetlands generally. To help ensure that proposed projects that may affect a WSSC are adequately reviewed, an SSPRA is always designated to encompass each WSSC and the area surrounding it. For a listing of designated sites see COMAR 26.23.06.01 at www.dsd.state.md.us  Submerged Aquatic Vegetation The well-defined link between water quality and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) distribution/abundance make SAV communities good barometers of the health of estuarine ecosystems. 39 October 2002   SAV many SAV SAV  is not only important as an indicator of water quality, but it is also a critical nursery habitat for estuarine species. For example, blue crab ""post-larvae"" are up to 30 times more abundant in beds than in adjacent unvegetated areas. Additionally, several species of waterfowl depend on for food when they over-winter in the Chesapeake region.  1. SAV Status In 2000 and 2001, SAV was found in Breton Bay in only five small areas as shown in Map 21 SAV. As also shown on the map, limited areas of SAV have intermittently appeared in Breton Bay adjacent to the shoreline over the past several decades. These SAV areas have consistently been downstream of Lovers Point / Pawpaw Point.12 Also see Additional Water Quality Data Collection During 2002 and SAV Abundance and SAV Habitat Index. The reasons for the very limited presence of SAV in Breton Bay are not understood. Similar habitat conditions appear to be present in nearby St. Clements Bay where significantly greater SAV acreage is typically present.13 2. SAV Restoration Potential 13 Breton Bay is included in a study currently underway by the US Fish and Wildlife Service to help improve understanding of the factors that are inhibiting SAV growth. Water quality data collected during 2001 is too limited to confidently project the potential for SAV restoration but several preliminary findings are available:  Water quality in upper Breton Bay may be too poor to support SAV.  Conditions in lower Breton Bay might support SAV restoration but more data is necessary to better quantify that at least minimum conditions necessary for SAV habitat are present. The Potomac River Association, Inc. is sponsoring a submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) project that involves volunteers from the region. The first step was to partner with Dr. Peter Bergstrom of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, who conducted an SAV identification and hunting technique workshop which was held in nearby St. Clement's Bay on June 15, 2002. Continuing on into the summer and fall of 2002, twelve participants are tasked with ground-truthing and hunting/identifying SAV throughout the Breton Bay tidal watershed. Data collected will be incorporated into regional databases and assessments of water quality, overall health, and suitability for additional growth will facilitate plantings of SAV shoots in fall 2002, spring 2003, and fall of 2004. SAV planting projects are already funded through the Chesapeake Bay Trust. Additional funding could expand this project.  40  October 2002   RESTORATION AND CONSERVATION TARGETING There are a number of programs and tools available to assist in implementing goals for protection of valued watershed resources and for targeting restoration of those that have become degraded or otherwise function less than optimally. 2002 Stream Corridor Assessment Using the Stream Corridor Assessment Methodology (SCAM) developed and applied by the DNR Watershed Restoration Division, valuable information can be compiled to assist in targeting restoration activities. In partnership with St. Mary's County, DNR is conducting a Stream Corridor Assessment in the Breton Bay watershed during 2002. In this effort, trained teams from the Maryland Conservation Corps walk along streams to identify and document potential problems and restoration opportunities such as the items listed below: Stream Corridor Assessment Data Collection Categories Pipe Outfalls Pond Sites Tree Blockages Inadequate Buffers Erosion Fish Blockages Exposed Pipe Unusual Conditions Trash Dumping In- or Near-Stream Construction  A stream corridor assessment report will be generated, including maps and photographs, to support targeting decisions for restoration projects. Draft data summaries are expected to be available in late 2002. The results of the stream corridor assessment will provide a valuable foundation for development of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy.  2002 Synoptic Survey and Aquatic Community Assessment During 2002 DNR staff collected water quality samples in nontidal streams to supplement knowledge of local conditions. The water quality findings included in the report on this work can help identify problem areas and relative conditions among local streams based on measurements of dissolved oxygen, pH, nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen), conductivity and flow. The findings (see Appendix D) include nutrient loads at each sampling site and allow the ranking of subwatersheds based on the nutrient load estimates. For some of these nontidal stream sampling sites, DNR staff has also assessed fish and benthic organism populations. These assessments provide additional perspectives to gauge local water quality 41 October 2002   and habitat conditions. DNR's Watershed Restoration Division completed this work in September, 2002.  Agricultural Conservation Programs Many farmers in St. Mary's County willingly implement management systems that address nutrient runoff and infiltration, erosion and sediment control, and animal waste utilization. St. Mary's Soil Conservation District (SCD) records for the Breton Bay watershed indicate that there are 178 agricultural units totaling 18,326 acres. Of that number, 55 have current soil conservation and water quality plans covering 4346 acres. The remaining agricultural units either have never had a plan, or their plans are over ten years old and have expired. Some of the conservation practices in plans include grassed waterways, riparian herbaceous and riparian forested buffers, conservation cover, cover crops, shallow water wildlife areas and grade stabilization structures. The Maryland Agricultural Cost-Share program (MACS), the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP and CREP) and the Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) are some of the state and federal programs promoted and administered by the St. Mary's SCD and Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS). 28 As part of the WRAS project, farmers in the watershed who are already using good management practices that benefit water quality could provide examples to promote adoption of similar practices by other farmers.  Smart Growth In Maryland's Smart Growth program, there are two targeting programs that should be considered when potential watershed restoration projects are considered. In Rural Legacy Areas, protection of land from future development through purchase of easements (or in fee simple) is promoted. In Priority Funding Areas (PFAs), State funding for infrastructure may be available to support development and redevelopment. Both are shown in Map 14 Protected Land and Smart Growth: - Rural Legacy Areas in the St. Mary's County are located outside of the Breton Bay watershed, mostly in the Patuxent River drainage area. - Priority Funding Areas cover about 12% of the Breton Bay watershed. These PFAs are concentrated in two areas: Leonardtown and Rt 235. Two very small parts of other PFAs are also in the Breton Bay watershed.  42  October 2002   Marina Programs Discharges of sewage from boats are a concern for water quality because they contribute nutrients, biochemical oxygen demand, pathogens, etc. These discharges are preventable if a sufficient number of pumpout facilities are locally available and boat operators take advantage of these services. Boat maintenance and operation also can contribute petroleum and other noxious materials to the aquatic environment. There are few marinas in Breton Bay identified in DNR's Marina database. The sites are shown in Map 22 Clean Marinas. Two of these marinas offer pumpout facilities. None of the marinas is currently participating in Maryland's Clean Marina Program. The Clean Marinas Program is a way for marina owners to gain certification and public recognition for voluntarily undertaking a number of actions related to marina design, operation, and maintenance intended to properly manage all kinds of marine products and activities, and to reduce and properly manage waste. Information is available at DNR's website, www.dnr.state.md.us/boating. DNR also funds installation and maintenance of marine pumpout facilities, including those at certified Clean Marinas. Information may be obtained from the Waterway and Greenways Division at DNR. One potential element of a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) is to encourage and/or support adding marina pumpout facilities serving the local area and increasing participation in the Clean Marina Program.  Fish Blockage Removal Many fish species need to move from one stream segment to the next in order to maintain healthy, resilient populations. This is particularly true for anadromous fish species because they spawn and hatch from eggs in free flowing streams but live most of their lives in estuarine or ocean waters. Blockages in streams can inhibit or prevent many fish species from moving upstream to otherwise viable habitat. To help prioritize stream blockages for mitigation or removal, the DNR Fish Passage Program maintains a database of significant blockages to fish movement. However, the database has no information listed for the Breton Bay watershed. The 2002 Stream Corridor Assessment will confirm if any blockages to fish movement exist in the watershed.  43  October 2002   Stream Buffer Restoration 1. Benefits and General Recommendations Natural vegetation in stream riparian zones, particularly forest, provides numerous valuable environmental benefits:  Reducing surface runoff  Preventing erosion and sediment movement  Using nutrients for vegetative growth and moderating nutrient entry into the stream  Moderating temperature, particularly reducing warm season water temperature  Providing organic material (decomposing leaves) that are the foundation of natural food webs in stream systems  Providing overhead and in-stream cover and habitat  Promoting high quality aquatic habitat and diverse populations of aquatic species. To realize these environmental benefits, DNR generally recommends that forested stream buffers be at least 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream. Therefore, DNR is promoting this type of stream buffer for local jurisdictions and land owners who are willing to go beyond the minimum buffer standards. The DNR Watershed Restoration Division and other programs like Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), managed by the DNR Forest Service, are available to assist land owners who volunteer to explore these opportunities. 2. Using GIS Identifying the areas that need buffer restoration and prioritizing them for action can be a timeconsuming, expensive project. Fortunately, use of a computerized Geographic Information System (GIS) to manipulate remotely sensed data can help save limited time and funds. To assist in this technical endeavor, DNR Watershed Management and Analysis Division is offering assistance, including GIS work, to help target restoration of naturally vegetated stream buffers, wetlands and other watershed management projects that may be identified locally. With these tools, information generated by a Stream Corridor Assessment and additional on-the-ground verification or ""ground-truthing,"" local government may more efficiently and confidently consider stream buffer restoration as part of a local Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. Several scenarios are presented here to help consider potential areas for stream buffer and wetland restoration. These scenarios can be used alone or in combination as models for targeting potential restoration sites for field verification. These maps are intended to demonstrate a methodology that can be used to locate sites having a high probability of optimizing certain ecological benefits of stream buffers. The resolution of the data used to generate these maps is not sufficient for an accurate site assessment, but can be used to identify candidate sites for more detailed investigation. The streams presented in the maps are perennial (blue line) streams as generally shown on US Geological Survey Quadrangle Maps. Intermittent streams were not considered in the stream buffer scenario maps.  44  October 2002   3. Headwater Stream Buffers Headwater streams are also called first order streams. For many watersheds, first order streams drain the majority of the land within the entire watershed. Therefore, stream buffers restored along headwater streams (First Order) tend to have greater potential to intercept nutrients and sediments than stream buffers placed elsewhere. In targeting stream buffer restoration projects, giving higher priority to headwater streams is one approach to optimizing nutrient and sediment retention. Restoring headwater stream buffers can also provide habitat benefits that can extend downstream of the project area. Forested headwater streams provide important organic material, like decomposing leaves, that ""feed"" the stream's food web. They also introduce woody debris which enhances in-stream physical habitat. The potential for riparian forest buffers to significantly influence stream temperature is greatest in headwater regions. These factors, in addition to positive water quality effects, are key to improving aquatic habitat. Since the Breton Bay watershed has a substantial percentage of its headwater streams in interior forests, protection of these forests against impacts from development may be an important part of WRAS strategies, along with reforestation where necessary. 4. Land Use and Stream Buffers One factor that affects the ability of stream buffers to intercept nonpoint source pollutants is adjacent land use. Nutrient and sediment loads from different land uses can vary significantly. The loading rates shown in the table here were calculated for the Lower Potomac River Tributary Basin from the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model. In general, restoration of stream buffers has been an agricultural Best Management Annual Nonpoint Source Pollution Load Rates Practice (BMP), with less By Land Use applicability in urban areas. Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model (2000) By identifying land uses in Land Use Nitrogen Phosphorus Sediment riparian areas with inadequate (lbs/ac) (lbs/ac) (tons/ac) stream buffers, like crop land adjacent to streams, the Crop land 17.11 1.21 0.74 potential to reduce nutrient Urban 7.5 0.7 0.09 and sediment loads can be improved. To assist in finding Pasture 8.40 1.15 0.30 areas with crop land adjacent to streams, the same land use Forest 1.42 0.00 0.03 data shown in Map 11 Generalized 2000 Land Use can be filtered using GIS. The new scenario shown in Map 23 Stream Buffer Land Use Scenario focuses on the land use within 50 feet of a stream. The map shows that naturally vegetated stream buffers are extensive but significant stream segments are unbuffered. This scenario, supplemented with the land use pollution loading rates, 45 October 2002   suggests potential buffer restoration opportunities that could minimize nutrient and sediment loads. (Note: DNR is encouraging stream buffers at least 50 feet wide on each side of the stream, which is significantly greater than minimum buffer requirement, to enhance nutrient and habitat benefits beyond minimum buffer requirements. Also, the enlargement shows that more detailed GIS data, like the County's stream data, has greater capability to identify potential restoration opportunities along a selected stream segment) 5. Nutrient Uptake from Hydric Soils in Stream Buffers In general, the nutrient nitrogen moves from the land into streams in surface water runoff and in groundwater. In watersheds like the Breton Bay drainage, a significant percentage of nitrogen enters streams in groundwater. Stream buffers can be used to capture nitrogen moving in groundwater if buffer restoration projects have several key attributes:  Plants with roots deep enough to intercept groundwater as it moves toward the stream  Plants with high nitrogen uptake capability, and  Targeting buffer restoration projects to maximize groundwater interception by buffer plants. Hydric soils in stream riparian areas can be used as one factor to help select stream buffer restoration sites. Siting buffer restoration on hydric soils would offer several benefits:  Plant roots are more likely to be in contact with groundwater for longer periods of time  Hydric soils tend to be marginal for many agricultural and urban land uses  Natural vegetation in wet areas often offers greater potential for habitat. Map 24 Stream Buffer Hydric Soil On Open Land Scenario identifies lands that are adjacent to streams, that are composed of hydric soil, that are cropland or barren land and also lack naturally vegetated stream buffers. To generate the watershed-wide map, hydric soils (Natural Soils Group of Maryland, MDP) were grouped into two classes and rated in terms of their potential to maximize groundwater/root zone interaction: poorly drained hydric soils (high nutrient retention efficiency), and moderately well drained hydric soils (moderately high nutrient retention efficiency). To generate the enlarged map of Brooks Run, detailed stream and hydric soil data supplied by St. Mary's County was used to identify potential opportunities. An important next step in using this information is verification of field conditions. Care must be taken during field validation to evaluate any hydrologic modification of these soils, such as ditching or draining activities, which would serve to decrease potential benefits. 6. Optimizing Water Quality Benefits by Combining Priorities Strategic targeting of stream buffer restoration projects may provide many different benefits. To maximize multiple benefits, site selection and project design need to incorporate numerous factors. For example, finding a site with a mix of attributes like those in the following list could result in the greatest control of nonpoint source pollution and enhancement to living resources:  land owner willingness / incentives  marginal land use in the riparian zone  headwater stream 46  hydric soils  selecting appropriate woody/grass species  adjacent to existing wetlands / habitat October 2002   Additionally, selecting restoration projects that are likely to produce measurable success is an important consideration in prioritizing projects for implementation. In the early stages of a watershed restoration program, measurable water quality improvement can be one of the strongest ways to demonstrate project success. In general, targeting restoration projects to one or a few selected tributaries or small watersheds will tend to offer the greatest probability of producing measurable water quality improvement in the short term. By selecting small areas like a small first order stream for restoration, there is greater likelihood that water quality problems arise locally and that they can be corrected by limited investment in carefully selected local restoration projects. In addition, water quality improvements achieved in the tributary will also inevitably contribute to improving Breton Bay even if improvements in the Bay are not immediately measurable.  Wetland Restoration Wetlands serve important environmental functions such as providing habitat and nursery areas for many organisms, facilitating nutrient uptake and recycling, providing erosion control. However, most watersheds in Maryland have significantly fewer wetland acres today than in the past. This loss due to draining, filling, etc., has led to habitat loss and negative water quality impacts in streams and in the Chesapeake Bay. Reversing this historic trend is an important goal of wetland restoration. One approach to identifying candidate wetland restoration sites involves identifying ""historic"" wetland areas based on the presence of hydric soils. This process can be accelerated by using GIS to manipulate soils information with other data like land use. The GIS products can then assist in initiating the candidate site search process, targeting site investigations and helping to identify land owners. To promote wetland restoration, DNR Watershed Management and Analysis Division has developed GIS capability for these purposes. For the Breton Bay watershed, GIS was used to map and prioritize areas of hydric soil for potential wetland restoration. The steps and priorities used to generate the map are listed below:  Data used: Hydric soils (St. Mary's County Data), existing wetlands (DNR Wetlands), land use (Maryland Dept. of Planning, 1997).  Identify candidate hydric soil areas based on land use. Hydric soils on open land (agricultural fields, bare ground, etc.) are retained while those underlying natural vegetation and developed lands are excluded.  Explore hydric soils based on land use / land cover and proximity to existing wetlands or streams. Two of many possible scenarios for finding potential wetland restoration sites are presented on the accompanying maps:  47  October 2002    Map 25 Wetland Restoration Opportunities and the table Wetland Acreage and Wetland Restoration Potential show that the potential for wetland restoration based on identifying open land on hydric soil varies significantly among the subwatersheds in the Breton Bay watershed.  Map 24 Stream Buffer Hydric Soil On Open Land Scenario indicates that opportunities to restore or create new wetlands may vary in their ability to intercept nutrients. Additionally, the number of potential opportunities increases significantly by using St. Mary's County's better soils data. The potential wetland restoration sites suggested in these scenarios can be filtered further by using more accurate wetlands and soil information, considering land ownership, etc. Additional steps would be beneficial in applying this information such as considering additional criteria like habitat enhancement opportunities, sensitive species protection, targeting specific streams or subwatersheds for intensive restoration, and using Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) information.  48  October 2002   Wetland Acreage and Wetland Restoration Potential Breton Bay Watershed Subwatersheds 12-Digit Letter / Name Existing Wetlands Wetland Restoration Potential On Open Land w/ Hydric Soil Within 300 ft of Wetlands 630 139 44 137 357 Nelson Run Greenhill Run Miski Run Glebe and Gravely Runs 105 34 120 230 112 96 Brooks Run 409 129 247 166 2955 216 80 5 1 101 35 4 14 8 4 4 29 12 42 22 577 More Than 300 ft From Wetlands 414 59 39 136 256 70 30 106 222 108 92 380 117 205 144 2378  Direct Drainage Breton Bay 02140104-7020  A B C D  6800 total acres Combes/Cherry Cove Creeks Town Run Moll Dyers Run  Lower McIntosh Run 02140104-7021  A B C D  Glebe Run 02140104-7022 Headwaters McIntosh & Brooks Run 02140104-7023 Burnt Mill Creek 02140104-7024  -A B C A B C  Total For Breton Bay Watershed  49  October 2002   PROJECTS RELATED TO THE WRAS PROCESS  There are numerous projects and programs that have the potential to contribute to successful development and implementation of a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). The listing included here suggests opportunities for cooperation and coordination that can improve the likelihood of success for the WRAS. This listing is not all-inclusive. It is recommended that this list be augmented as new information becomes available and that follow-up should continue to promote the WRAS process with these and other projects and programs.  319(h)-Funded Projects The Federal funding source generally known as ""319"" has not been awarded to projects in the Breton Bay watershed during the 1999 through 2002 time frame.  Other Projects/Programs This section summarizes projects and programs that have the potential to contribute to development and implementation of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy that have not been addressed elsewhere in the watershed characterization. 1. Center As Watershed watershed for Watershed Protection part of WRAS project, St. Mary's County has enlisted the assistance of the Center for Protection to perform several planning and project targeting functions for the Breton Bay at the subwatershed scale:  - estimate existing impervious cover based on land use data - verify imperviousness estimates based on Stream Corridor Assessment results and additional field investigation. - project future impervious cover based on zoning - conduct a stakeholder involvement process to address findings and goal setting - perform a subwatershed retrofit inventory and priority for the Town Run subwatershed St. Mary's County will employ the experience and information from this process to support production of the County's watershed strategy. 2. Watershed Evaluation for St. Mary's River and McIntosh Run Watersheds In 1998, St. Mary's County Department of Planning and Zoning received a report from its consultants that in part assessed the McIntosh Run watershed. It identified areas that were unsuitable 50 October 2002   for development and areas showing potential as forest and wetland mitigation sites. Map 26 Potential Mitigation Sites shows the areas identified in the assessment. The study was funded by DNR's Coastal Zone Management Program pursuant to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Award No. NA67OZ0302. 3. Potomac River Association Breton Bay Campaign The Potomac River Association, Inc. (PRA) is a non-profit environmental group working throughout Southern Maryland. Since its formation in 1967, PRA has been working to preserve and enhance the county's waterways including Breton Bay and its tributaries. PRA's latest efforts on behalf of Breton Bay began in May 2001 with a $10,000 Small Watershed Grant from the National Fish & Wildlife Foundation and matching $5,000 from PRA's membership dues. With assistance from the consulting firm Community and Environmental Defense Services (CEDS), a survey of the watershed, including water quality sampling, was conducted. In July 2001, the PRA released a 28-page report titled Opportunities to Enhance the Quality of Breton Bay which is available online in pdf format at http://www.p-r-a.org/pub/bretonbay.pdf This report contains a review of available information regarding the unique importance of Breton Bay and presents a number of methods for improving the quality of the Breton Bay system. PRA then began pursuing corrective action for the most serious threats to Breton Bay that it had identified: excessive erosion in the Town Run watershed, inadequate stormwater management serving some commercial areas on Route 5, and the possibility of a massive development project along McIntosh Run - the principal tributary to Breton Bay. In October 2001 the Saint Mary's County Commissioners initiated the Breton Bay Watershed Restoration Action Strategy project. PRA has been an active participant since the project started. On November 15, 2001, PRA held a public meeting at the Olde Breton Inn to release the results of it's July 2001 report and to offer watershed residents an opportunity to take a more active role in the restoration effort. More than 70 people attended the meeting and many of the meeting attendees volunteered to help the Association identify and pursue opportunities to enhance Breton Bay. In February 2002, a dozen of the volunteers identified in November 2001 attended a DNR training session for the Stream Waders program. The volunteers learned how to collect samples of aquatic insects, crustaceans, and other stream-dwelling creatures. In March and April 2002 the volunteers sampled Breton Bay tributaries at 25 points. The samples were delivered to DNR biologists who will identify the organisms and develop an assessment of stream conditions at each sampling point. PRA will then ask the volunteers to return to those points that show signs of degradation in order to conduct further sampling pin-pointing the cause(s). In May 2002, the Association offered recommendations to the St. Mary's County Commissioners on how the draft sediment control and stormwater ordinances could be modified to gain more of the benefits of development with fewer adverse water quality impacts. The Association will be monitoring projects approved through the new ordinances to ensure that these benefits are achieved. Also in May, PRA received a $5,916 grant from the Chesapeake Bay Trust to plant 4000 submerged aquatic vegetation plants (SAV). (PRA is providing a $5,916 in-kind match) A similar matching grant has been requested from the Mirant Corporation. 51 October 2002   On June 15, PRA held the first SAV identification and searching technique workshop in preparation for the fall 2002 and spring 2003 plantings. Dr. Peter Bergstrom from the US Fish and Wildlife Service led a field training session providing valuable information on recognition of appropriate planting sites and fostering stewardship of our waterway resources. PRA's Breton Bay project is expected to extend well into the summer of 2004 with continuing SAV plantings, stream monitoring and sampling, riparian buffer restoration, and lobbying local and State government for adequate protective regulations for future development. 4. Yellow Perch Restoration In McIntosh Run16 On May 11, 2002, members of the Southern Maryland chapter of the Coastal Conservation Association (CCA) and other volunteers restocked 15,000 yellow perch into McIntosh Run in a project to re-establish native breeding populations in this Breton Bay tributary. This project is a cooperative effort between the CCA, the Maryland DNR Fisheries Service and Mirant Mid-Atlantic LLC. During the annual spring spawning run, eggs are collected at Allens Fresh at the headwaters of the Wicomico River and taken to DNR's Manning Hatchery in Cedarville for incubation. The fry are marked with oxitetracycline for future identification and then raised for several weeks before being released. In McIntosh Run, the fry were released next to the Rt. 5 bridge over McIntosh Run in the Port of Leonardtown Park. During the summer, the stream will be monitored for surviving yellow perch fingerlings and to collect environmental data. Any perch collected will be analyzed at the hatchery to detect the tell-tale oxitetracycline identifying them as part of the restocking project. Native fish caught in the survey will not have the unique chemical mark. If the project is successful, the surviving perch should return to spawn in this stream in three to five years. Currently, yellow perch are relatively rare in many streams around the Chesapeake Bay where they were once plentiful. Spawning takes place in fresh water where the long gelatinous strips of eggs get caught on submerged structures in the free-flowing stream. Two to three weeks later, the perch larvae hatch. The young perch mature in salt water and return after three to five years to spawn where they hatched. Their predictable spawning habits make them vulnerable to fishing exploitation as they congregate in narrow streams each spring. Sedimentation of their spawning sites probably reduces the hatching success rate, and low dissolved oxygen has been blamed for poor survival of juveniles and adults during the warm summer weather. Stream blockages sometimes force the perch to spawn where the salinity is too high for the larvae to survive, and extreme tides or storm events can strand the eggs high and dry where they die after the water level drops. No single factor seems solely responsible for their reduced population levels. CCA has been involved in restocking selected streams for the past two years. For example, several thousand fry are also being raised at the Academy of Natural Sciences Estuarine Research Center in St. Leonard for restocking into St. Leonard Creek in Calvert County.  52  October 2002   POTENTIAL BENCHMARKS FOR WRAS GOAL SETTING Several programs designed to manage water quality and/or living resources have existing or proposed goals that are relevant to setting goals for the Breton Bay Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). The goals from these other programs tend to overlap and run parallel to potential interests for developing WRAS goals. Therefore, to assist in WRAS development, selected goals from other programs are included here as points of reference. Coastal Zone Management  The Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) Initiative is a component of the Cumulative and Secondary Impacts section of the Maryland Coastal Zone Management Program Section 309 Strategy (2000-2005). Watershed strategies are defined as comprehensive plans that will identify areas of concern, monitoring strategies, gaps in information, mitigation options, and restoration and protection opportunities.  WRAS projects funded under Coastal Zone Management must be in Maryland's Coastal Zone and must include a local program change as part of the effort. This could include incorporation into the County Comprehensive Plan, adoption of local implementing tools like zoning ordinances and environmental codes, modification of sensitive areas elements or alterations to Smart Growth Priority Funding Areas. Chesapeake 2000 Agreement The Chesapeake 2000 Agreement (C2K) includes several significant commitments pertaining to local watershed management planning and implementation. The goal in the C2K Agreement that is directly related to the development of watershed management plans and action strategies is ""By 2010, work with local governments, community watershed groups and watershed organizations to develop and implement locally supported watershed management plans in two-thirds of the Bay watershed covered by this Agreement. These plans would address the protection, conservation and restoration of stream corridors, riparian buffers and wetlands for the purposes of improving habitat and water quality, with the collateral benefits for optimizing flow and water supply."" Four common elements of watershed management planning were adopted by the Chesapeake Bay Program member jurisdictions to be applied Bay-wide. Those elements support the WRAS components which were also identified as common Bay-wide criteria for watershed management planning. The four approved C2K watershed planning elements are as follows: 1. Does the plan ""address the protection, conservation and restoration of stream corridors, riparian forest buffers and wetlands?"" Each watershed management plan needs to be based on an assessment of natural resources within the watershed. At a minimum, the assessment will evaluate the condition of stream corridors, riparian buffers and wetlands within the watershed.  53  October 2002   2. Does the plan reflect the goals and objectives of ""improving habitat and water quality?"" The plan should reflect the issues that the stakeholders feel are important, and, at a minimum, exhibit a benefit to habitat and water quality within the watershed. The goals should be based on priority issues identified by the watershed assessment. 3. Chesapeake 2000 Watershed Commitments Criterion #3-- Does the plan identify implementation mechanisms? Capacity to implement the plan will be demonstrated by identifying: - What are the specific management actions? - What are the resources necessary for implementation? - Who will implement the plan? - And when will the actions will be implemented? The implementation mechanisms should also incorporate a periodic re-evaluation to ensure the plan is ""living"" and flexible to the changes in the watershed. 4. Does the plan have demonstrated local support? Every effort should be made to demonstrate a diversity of local support. At a minimum, local governments, community groups and watershed organizations should be encouraged to participate in developing and implementing the watershed management plan. Goals from the Clean Water Action Plan 2  Clean Water Goals - Maryland watersheds should meet water quality standards, including numerical criteria as well as narrative standards and designated uses.  Watersheds should achieve healthy conditions as indicated by natural resource indicators related to the condition of the water itself (e.g. water chemistry), aquatic living resources, and physical habitat, as well as landscape factors (e.g. buffered streams and wetland restoration). Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998 - The most significant feature is requiring nutrient management plans for virtually all Maryland farms. The requirement is being phased in over a several year period. - Nitrogen-based plan implementation will be required on all farms beginning December 31, 2001. - Phosphorus-based plan implementation will be required on farms using chemical fertilizer beginning December 31,2002 and on farms using manure or biosolids by July 1, 2005. - Up to 87.5% cost share is available for development of nutrient management plans and up to $20 per ton contribution toward the costs of manure transportation is available. Implementation of projects assisted by this funding has the potential to move nutrients to sites where they are needed.  54  October 2002   REFERENCES 1. DNR. Internet Site: www.dnr.state.md.us/ .

Riparian areas are transitional between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and are distinguished by gradients in biophysical conditions, ecological processes, and biota. They are areas through which surface and subsurface hydrology connect waterbodies with their adjacent uplands. They include those portions of terrestrial ecosystems that significantly influence exchanges of energy and matter with aquatic ecosystems (i.e. a zone of influence). Riparian areas are adjacent to perennial, intermittent, and ephemeral streams, lakes, and estuarine-marine shorelines. (National Research Council, Riparian Areas: Functions and Strategies for Management . Executive Summary page 3. 2002) Submerged Aquatic Vegetation, important shallow-water sea grasses that serve as a source of food and shelter for many species of fin- and shell-fish. Stream Corridor Assessment is an activity carried out by CCWS in support of WRAS development and other management needs, in which trained personnel walk up stream channels noting important physical features and possible sources of problems. Soil Conservation District is a county-based, self-governing body whose purpose is to provide technical assistance and advice to farmers and landowners on the installation of soil conservation practices and the management of farmland to prevent erosion.

The WRAS project area encompasses over 152 square miles (97,647 acres) of land in Calvert County. This is nearly 47% of the land area in the Lower Patuxent River watershed. As part of WRAS project, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is providing technical assistance, including preparation of a watershed characterization (compilation of available water quality and natural resources information and identification of issues), a stream corridor assessment (uses field data to catalog issues and rate severity) and a synoptic survey (analyzes benthic macroinvertebrates, fish and water samples with focus on nutrients). The County may use information generated in these efforts as it drafts the County Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. Water Quality In the Lower Patuxent River, impairments to tidal water quality in the mainstem arise from inputs originating from both inside and outside of the WRAS project area. Total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations in the mainstem have tended to improve (lower concentrations) from 1985 through 2001. However, algae blooms in the tidal mainstem (over 100 micrograms per liter of chlorophyll a) continue to be supported by excess nutrient availability. Suspended solids contribute to water quality impairment from below Route 231 to the upstream boundary of the WRAS project area. In the WRAS project area, nutrient loads are dominated by nonpoint sources including septic systems, fertilizer use and atmospheric deposition. Nonpoint source nitrogen from septic systems appears to be a significant contributor to local tidal water quality impairment, particularly in tidal inlets like the Solomons Harbor area. Several tidal inlets along the Patuxent River in Calvert County are impaired by fecal coliform bacteria, including: Battle Creek, Buzzard Island Creek, Island Creek, Mill Creek and Solomons Island Harbor. Methylmercury contamination found in fish caught in Lake Lariat caused this freshwater impoundment to be listed on the State's list of impaired water bodies. Mercury reaching the lake is mostly associated with atmospheric deposition. To help address this impairment, a draft TMDL is in review by US EPA. Some nontidal streams exhibit biological limitations that are the result of local conditions. Several parts of the Patuxent River mainstem are identified as an Area of Emphasis due to levels of toxic compounds found there. In the upper tidal Patuxent River, upstream of Chaulk Point, pesticides found in the water (chlorpyrifos and malathion) and in sediment (DDT) were at levels indicating probable adverse effects on living resources. In the middle tidal Patuxent River, between Chaulk Point and Sheridan Point (midway between Battle Creek and Rt. 231), levels of the pesticide chlorpyrifos in the water and in the sediment were high enough to indicate v   probable adverse effects on living resources. In the lower portion of this segment, metals and the pesticide DDT levels were high enough to potentially cause adverse effects to living resources. Both water and sediment from this area caused adverse effects on Bay organisms under laboratory conditions. The Landscape Forest accounts for nearly 49% of the land use / land cover in the Calvert County portion of the Lower Patuxent River watershed based on Year 2000 data. Both agriculture and developed land used each cover nearly almost one quarter of this area. Impervious area averages for subwatersheds across the project area typically less than two percent. Greater impervious cover is found in only one area  the Solomons Harbor subwatershed has 2.9% impervious cover on average. Green Infrastructure hubs, large natural habitat areas of statewide significance, are concentrated in subwatersheds of several creeks (Hall, Hunting, St. Leonards, Battle, Helen and St. John and at Kings Landing. Only four of these hubs have any protection from land use conversion. Blocks of forest interior are found in all subwatersheds and are generally not protected. Agricultural easements account for 43% of all protected land in the WRAS area and cover about as much land as County parks and DNR land together. Living Resources and Habitat Significant spawning areas for anadromous fish are documented in three creeks: Hall, Hunting and Lyons. Additional spawning areas are St. Leonards, Helen and Mill Creeks. Hunting Creek has the most diverse fish population of nontidal streams segments that have been surveyed. Algae blooms of green and bluegreen algae that are associated with excessive nutrients loads are common in the mainstem of the Patuxent River. Both mahogany tides and black tides occurred in the mainstem and both St. Leonards Creek and Battle Creek experienced black tides. The causes of these blooms are not well understood. Maryland Biological Stream Survey has assessed six stream segments in the WRAS area. Ratings for these sites were mostly poor or fair but several ratings of very poor were found. Oyster harvests from the Patuxent River are currently a tiny fraction of historic harvests. Legally delineated oyster bed areas in the Patuxent River mainstem encompass over 10,000 acres. Ninety years ago, natural oyster beds were reported to cover 5,661 acres. Ecological sensitive areas that contain species tracked by Maryland as endangered or threatened are identified in about 20 separate parts of the WRAS area. The two largest are at Battle Creek and the vicinity of Kings Landing and Lower Marlboro around Chew Creek, Tyverne Creek and Graham Creek. Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) covers relatively little area of the Lower Patuxent River in recent years compared to the earlier part of this century. In the mid 1980s and late 1990s, SAV beds have covered up to about 100 areas. However, no SAV could be identified in aerial photographs in the early 1990s. In research slated to be published in late 2003, the vi   relationship between Patuxent nutrient loads and the extent of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) is to be explored. The research is anticipated to qualitatively show that decreasing SAV area coincides with increasing nutrient loads. However, as nutrient loads decreased, Patuxent SAV have not shown a similar rebound. Restoration Targeting Tools Using GIS, potential opportunities for stream buffer restoration and wetland restoration have been identified. Based on this GIS assessment, most subwatersheds in the WRAS area have areas that could be investigated as potential restoration opportunities. These GIS scenarios are intended to supplement the field information being collected during 2003 in the Stream Corridor Assessment which catalogs and rates conditions found along and in streams. Additionally, the Synoptic Survey being conducted in 2003 will contribute water quality data, including nutrients, and assessment of fish and benthic communities at selected sampling sites.  vii   CONTRIBUTORS TO THE WATERSHED CHARACTERIZATION Calvert County David Brownlee Pete Bratic William Clark Jimmy Herriman Ronald Clark Calvert Citizen, Calvert Calvert Calvert County Planning and Zoning Island Creek Soil Conservation District County Environmental Health County Public Works  Maryland Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) Others  Watershed Services Mary Conley, Danielle Lucid, Robin Pelicano, Niles Primrose, Ted Weber, John Wolf, Ken Yetman Resource Assessment Service (RAS) Elizabeth Ebersole, Sherm Garrison, Ron Klauda, Paul Miller, William Romano Wildlife & Heritage Division Lynn Davidson, Tim Larney Center for Watershed Protection, Ken Brown Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) John Grace, Kelly Neff, John Smith, Robert Daniel University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, Dr. William Dennison University of Maryland Horn Point Laboratory, Dr. Tom Fisher  Editor and Primary Author: Ken Shanks, Maryland Department of the Natural Resources, Watershed Services, Landscape and Watershed Analysis Division  viii   INTRODUCTION Background In 1998, Maryland completed an assessment of all 134 of the state's watersheds in order to identify high priorities for restoration action based on impaired waters and high priorities for conservation action based on high or unique natural resource value. The assessment, called the Unified Watershed Assessment, was conducted by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) under the direction of the US Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Water Action Plan initiative with assistance from the Maryland Departments of Environment, Agriculture and Planning and the University of Maryland. It moved beyond consideration of water quality in the streams in the state, which had been assessed regularly since the early 1970's, to a larger consideration of living resources in the streams and the landscape conditions which could impact both water quality and living resources.1,2 In response to the findings of the Unified Watershed Assessment, DNR offers technical and financial assistance to local governments who are willing to develop and implement Watershed Restoration Action Strategies (WRAS) addressing needs for restoration and conservation in priority watersheds. One of these projects is the Lower Patuxent River Watershed in Calvert County, where the County, DNR and other local cooperators, both public and private, are engaged in developing a watershed management strategy.

Also shown in Map 2 and the table Subwatersheds, the State of Maryland subdivides the Lower Patuxent Watershed into twelve subwatersheds for analytical purposes.  1   Purpose of the Characterization One of the earliest steps in devising a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy is to characterize the watershed using immediately available information. This Watershed Characterization is intended to meet several objectives:  briefly summarize the most important or relevant information and issues  provide preliminary findings based on this information  identify sources for more information or analysis  suggest opportunities for additional characterization and restoration work.  provide a common base of knowledge about the Lower Patuxent Watershed for local governments, citizens, businesses and other organizations Additional Characterization Work The Watershed Characterization is intended to be one starting point that can be updated as needed. It is part of a framework for a more thorough assessment with additional inputs:  self-investigation by Calvert County  targeted technical assistance and assessment by partner agencies or contractors  input from local citizens  completion of a Stream Corridor Assessment, in which DNR personnel physically walk the streams and catalogue important issues.  completion of a synoptic water quality survey, i.e. a program of water sample analysis, that can be used to focus on local issues like nutrient hot spots, point source discharges or other selected issues. Identifying Gaps in Information It is important to identify gaps in available watershed knowledge and gauge the importance of these gaps. In assessing data gaps, we have found it helpful to review information in four categories:  Habitat: physical structure, stream stability and biotic community (incl. riparian zone)  Water Quantity: high waterstorm flow and flooding; low waterbaseflow problems from dams, water withdrawals, reduced infiltration  Water Quality: water chemistry; toxics, nutrients, sediment, nuisance odors/scums, etc.  Cumulative effects associated with habitat, water quantity and water quality. Because restoration is an active evolving process, the Watershed Characterization and the resulting Watershed Restoration Action Strategy should be maintained as living documents within an active evolving restoration process. These documents will need to be updated periodically as new, more relevant information becomes available and as the watershed response is monitored and reassessed.  2   Subwatersheds Lower Patuxent Watershed / WRAS Project Area Number Draft Name Hall Creek Graham & Fridays Creeks Chew Creek Cocktown Creek Deep Landing Hunting Creek Ramsey & Caney Creeks Buzzard Island Creek Battle Creek Headwaters Battle Creek Lower Drainage Island Creek St. Leonard Creek Back & Mill Creeks 02131101XXXX 0902 0900 0899 0896 0895 0889 0888 0882 0881 0879 0878 0876 0873 Area in Acres including Water 10,488 3,947 4,960 4,934 3,339 20,382 3,869 6,239 6,521 5,971 8,341 22,792 9,413 111,196 3,289 114,485 includes Nan Cove, Rock Creek, Ben Creek and Jack Bay includes Hellen Creek, Mears Creek includes Hungerford Creek Calvert County Anne Arundel County (Hall Creek) Calvert and Anne Arundel Counties streams are unnamed includes Little Lyons Creek includes Tyverne Creek Selected Stream Information Within The Watershed Calvert County portion only  Lower Patuxent Watershed Totals 02131101  3   WATER QUALITY Water quality is in many respects the driving condition in the health of Maryland's streams. Historically, efforts to protect water quality have focused on chemical water quality. More recently, interest has focused on the biological conditions in streams and estuaries; active consideration of the physical parameters is even more recent. This developmental path is reflected in the ways in which streams have been monitored, the types of data gathered, and the regulatory approach taken. Water Quality Standards and Designated Uses All streams and other water bodies in Maryland are assigned a ""designated use"" in the Code of Maryland Regulation (COMAR) 26.08.02.08, which is associated with a set of water quality criteria necessary to support that use. The Lower Patuxent Watershed is assigned two uses: - Use I, Water Contact Recreation and Protection of Aquatic Life: All surface waters not designated as Use II. - Use II, Shellfish Harvesting Waters: All estuarine areas of tributaries except Patuxent River and tributaries above Ferry Landing Map 3 Designated Uses and Use Restrictions depicts the distribution of surface waters in each category. (COMAR or MDE should be consulted for official regulatory information.) 3,5 Use Impairments and Restrictions 4  Some streams or other water bodies in the WRAS project area can not be used to the full extent envisioned by their designated use in Maryland regulation due to water quality or habitat impairments. These areas, known as ""impaired waters"", are tracked by the State of Maryland under Section 303(d) requirements of the Federal Clean Water Act. Maryland's list of impaired waters for the Calvert County portion of the Lower Patuxent River watershed includes waters affected by water quality or habitat problems associated with several issues: Biological Limitations (poor or very poor fish or benthic organism populations/conditions) Fecal Coliform Bacteria Methylmercury and Fish Consumption Advisory Nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) Sediment Toxic Compounds (chlorpyrifos)  These listings affecting portions of the WRAS project area are addressed below in alphabetical order. Each water body listed may require preparation of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) to address the water quality and/or habitat impairment.4 4   1. Biological Impairment In selected stream segments statewide, populations of benthic macroinvertebrates and fish and their associated physical habitat have been assessed by the Maryland Biological Stream Program. Based on criteria developed for each physiographic/ecological zone in Maryland, each stream segment is rated as either good, fair, poor or very poor. Ratings of poor and very poor were listed as biological impairment for the first time in Maryland in the draft 2002 303(d) list of impaired waters. In the WRAS project area, nine stream nontidal stream sites appear in the list because of biological impairment. See the section on Maryland Biological Stream Survey Findings for additional details. 2. Fecal Coliform Bacteria and Shellfish Harvesting Restrictions In the Lower Patuxent River watershed in Calvert County, excessive levels of fecal coliform bacteria are listed for the portions of several tidal water bodies: Battle Creek, Buzzard Island Creek, Island Creek, Mill Creek and Solomons Island Harbor. Fecal coliform bacteria are a class of bacteria typically found in the digestive tract of warm-blooded animals, including humans. They are always found in animal waste and human sewage (unless it is treated to kill them). In unpolluted streams and tidal waters, it is common for water samples to contain very few of these bacteria. Water samples exhibiting significantly larger fecal coliform bacteria populations are ""indicators"" of contamination by animal, including human, waste. Depending on local conditions, sources of fecal contamination may include any combination of the following: inadequately treated sewage, failing septic systems, wild or domestic animals, urban stormwater carrying pet waste and similar sources. When fecal coliform bacteria levels are too high in tidal waters containing shellfish, harvesting is restricted to prevent consumption of contaminated food. As shown in Map 3 Designated Uses and Use Restrictions, portions of Patuxent River and its tributaries are affected by regulatory limitations on shellfish harvesting. The following shellfish harvesting waters are ""restricted"" which ""means that no harvesting of oysters and clams is allowed at any time"": - Four Patuxent River tributaries: Battle Creek, Buzzard Island Creek, Island Creek and Solomons Island Harbor - One large area of the Patuxent River mainstem upstream of Gods Grace Point Also shown on Map 3, a large area of the Patuxent River is designated as ""conditionally approved waters"" which ""means that oysters and clams can normally be harvested except for the three days following a rainfall of an inch or greater in 24-hours."" This area is approximately between Gods Grace Point and the area near Buzzard Island Creek. These restrictions are applied by the Maryland Dept. of the Environment (MDE) to protect public health because elevated fecal coliform counts are commonly found in this area of the Patuxent River estuary. The elevated counts suggest the presence of contamination by animal or human waste. Restrictions are necessary because oysters and clams are filter feeders that readily absorb pathogens in animal or human waste. 3. Methylmercury and Fish Consumption Advisory Lake Lariat is listed as an impaired water body for methymercury. This metal compound is a concern because largemouth/smallmouth bass in the lake were found to contain levels of 5   methylmercury that could cause human health problems if these fish are eaten too frequently. Fish tissue sampling conducted in 2001 by MDE led to issuance of a fish consumption advisory in late 2001. The purpose of the advisory is to recommend very limited human consumption of largemouth/smallmouth bass from Lake Lariat: 1) only one 8 oz. meal per mouth for the general population and 2) children should not consume these fish. For more information on the fish consumption advisory see www.mde.state.md.us/CitizensInfoCenter/FishandShellfish Methylmercury accounts for the majority of mercury found in these fish. It is also the form most readily absorbed and retained in the human body. Mercury may enter the lake in various chemical forms but biological activity tends to generate methylmercury from other forms of mercury. The amount of methylmercury in individual fish varies in any given water body. In general, larger older fish contain more compounds that bioaccumulate like methylmercury than smaller younger fish. Therefore, it is safer to eat smaller younger fish. However, the average concentration of methylmercury in fish tested from Lake Lariat was among the highest compared to fish tested from other impoundments in Maryland.12 In general, it is believed that the mercury entering the Lake Lariat aquatic food chain and accumulating in largemouth and smallmouth bass reaches the lake in rainfall and dust (atmospheric deposition). The primary source of atmospheric mercury is burning coal. Other sources include incineration of trash (including dry cell batteries and mercury switches that are thrown away). Also see the section on the Lake Lariat TMDL for mercury. Based on information accumulated to date, there appear to be several approaches to reducing accumulation of mercury compounds in water bodies:12  Reduce incoming mercury by minimizing deposition (frequently beyond local control);  Reduce movement of mercury from the land to water bodies in local watersheds by minimizing soil disturbance, maximizing forest cover and maintaining/restoring riparian buffers;  In constructed wetlands, wetland design appears have an effect on the creation of the methylmercury from other mercury compounds. This suggests that some types of wetlands could be constructed would have less methylmercury production compared other types of constructed wetlands. 4. Nutrients The mainstem of the Patuxent River from its mouth to Ferry Landing is listed for impairment caused by nutrients. Nutrients can cause problems in the Patuxent River for several reasons. In Maryland, most water bodies naturally have low levels of the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus. Without these essential nutrients, most water bodies could support aquatic life. However, in the tidal waters of the Patuxent either nitrogen or phosphorus can become too readily available. When this occurs under certain conditions with warm weather, sufficient light, etc., algae populations can grow to excessive levels. These algae can then crowd out other small organisms, cloud the water limiting light penetration, and eventually die-off consuming the dissolved oxygen that other aquatic life needs to survive. Nutrient pollution or over-enrichment problems may arise from numerous sources including all types of land and from the atmosphere. Residential land can be an important contributor of nutrients depending on fertilizer use, extent of lawn and the status of septic 6   systems. Farmers apply nutrients using different approaches, so nutrients entering waterways from crop land vary greatly depending on management techniques. Typically, streams and other surface waters receive relatively small amounts of nutrients from forest land and relatively large amounts from land uses that involve soil disturbance and application of fertilizer. Most of the nutrients in the Lower Patuxent River watershed are generated within the Patuxent watershed. However, the atmosphere can contribute various forms of nitrogen produced by burning fossil fuels in power plants and other industries, and from automobiles. 5. Sediment The mainstem of the Patuxent River from its mouth to Ferry Landing is listed for impairment caused by suspended sediment. Suspended sediment can cause water quality and habitat problems in several ways. Most unpolluted streams and tidal waters naturally have limited amounts of sediment moving ""suspended"" in the water. Excessive amounts of suspended sediment in waterways are considered pollution because they can inhibit light penetration, prevent plant growth, smother fish eggs, clog fish gills, etc. Sediment in streams tends to arise from stream bed and bank erosion and from land that is poorly vegetated or disturbed. Suspended sediment pollution may arise from construction sites, crop land, bare ground and exposed soil generally. The amount of sediment contributed varies greatly site to site depending upon stream stability, hydrology, management controls and other factors. 6. Toxic Compounds The tidal portion of the lower Patuxent River is listed for impairment by toxics because a 1999 study found levels of the pesticide chlorpyrifos that are believed to be too high relative to other comparable water bodies. Chlorpyrifos is a synthetic compound manufactured and used for human purposes. However, the source of this impairment in the Lower Patuxent River is not known. In general, a wide array of materials may be considered toxic substances because they exhibit poisonous, or lethal, or otherwise harmful affects to aquatic life. These materials are very diverse in their sources and effects. Sometimes toxic substances can occur naturally. However, toxic substances of concern for water quality restoration are those types that are the product of human activity. For regulatory purposes, the US Environmental Protection Agency maintains a list of substances that are considered to be toxic. A few examples are heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), asbestos and many other materials.  7   National Academy Press, Clean Coastal Waters (2000) What Are the Effects of Nutrient Over-Enrichment? 6 The productivity of many [lake, estuary and] coastal marine systems is limited by nutrient availability, and the input of additional nutrients to these systems increases primary productivity [microscopic organisms including algae]. In moderation in some systems, nutrient enrichment can have beneficial impacts such as increasing fish production; however, more generally the consequences of nutrient enrichment for [lake, estuarine and] coastal marine ecosystems are detrimental. Many of these detrimental consequences are associated with eutrophication. The system and lead to fish as lowered increased productivity from eutrophication increases oxygen consumption in the can lead to low-oxygen (hypoxia) or oxygen-free (anoxic) water bodies. This can kills as well as more subtle changes in ecological structure and functioning, such biotic diversity and lowered recruitment of fish populations.  Eutrophication can also have deleterious consequences on estuaries even when low-oxygen events do not occur. These changes include loss of biotic diversity, and changes in the ecological structure of both planktonic and benthic communities, some of which may be deleterious to fisheries. Seagrass beds are particularly vulnerable to damage from eutrophication and nutrient over-enrichment. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) harm fish, shellfish, and marine mammals and pose a direct public health threat to humans. The factors that cause HABs remain poorly known, and some events are entirely natural. However, nutrient over-enrichment of coastal waters leads to blooms of some organisms that are both longer in duration and of more frequent occurrence. Although difficult to quantify, the social and economic consequences of nutrient over-enrichment include aesthetic, health, and livelihood impacts  8   Total Maximum Daily Loads The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) uses the 303(d) list to determine the need for establishing Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). A TMDL is the amount of pollutant that a waterbody can assimilate and still meet its designated use. A waterbody may have multiple impairments and multiple TMDLs to address them. MDE is responsible for establishing TMDLs in Maryland. In general, TMDLs include several key parts: 1- Maximum pollutant load that the water can accept while still allowing the water body to meet its intended use. 2- Allocation of the maximum pollutant load to specific pollutant sources. As of October 2003, only one TMDL has been prepared that directly affects the WRAS project area -- the TMDL for Mercury in Lake Lariat. It can be anticipated that additional TMDLs will be prepared to address other water quality impairments in the Lower Patuxent River watershed. 1. Lake Lariat TMDL for Mercury Currently, the draft Total Maximum Daily Load of Marcury for Lake Lariat, Calvert County, Maryland is under review by EPA for approval. A TMDL for mercury in Lake Lariat was prepared because the current fish consumption advisory for largemouth/smallmouth bass. In order to protect human health, the advisory recommends limiting how frequently these fish from the lake are eaten because of methylmercury contamination. This advisory also means that the lake is not meeting its designated use under Maryland regulation. Therefore, a TMDL is necessary. The TMDL is designed to allow the lake to meet its designated use for protection of aquatic life and recreational use which includes safe consumption of fish taken from the lake. MDE calculates that TMDL necessary to achieve this goal for Lake Lariat is 0.00331 grams per day (1.20815 grams per year). To reach this level would require about an 80% reduction from the current mercury load to the lake. MDE's calculations also indicate that nearly 84% of the mercury load to the lake is from atmospheric deposition and the remainder comes from nonpoint sources in the lake's watershed. There are no known point sources of mercury in the lake watershed. The TMDL for Lake Lariat and addition TMDL information is available on MDE's Internet site.5  9   Water Quality IndicatorsSetting Priority for Restoration and Protection This comparison using indicators was first created to support the Clean Water Action Plan's 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment which established priorities for watersheds in the State for restoration and protection. In the Plan, there were two categories for priority action: highest priority for restoration, and priority for protecting valued resources. Water Quality Indicator Summary As the basis for the prioritization, Lower Patuxent River Watershed indicators of water quality, landscape and From: 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment living resources were developed for all watersheds in Maryland. Other Indicator Name Finding approaches to assessing water quality have been in use for several years and are Tidal Habitat Index 8.3 further described below. In general they Tidal Eutrophication Index 7.5 do not look comparatively at watersheds as the Unified Assessment did in an effort Modeled Load: TP 0.52 lbs/acre to set priorities. The Unified Assessment also considered a range of living resource Modeled Load: TN 7.25 lbs/acre and landscape indicators described a little later. Comparison with similar Maryland watersheds The Unified Assessment looked at Green shading: goal or benchmark was met. five water quality indicators to compare Orange shading: goal or benchmark not met. the State's 134 ""8-digit"" watersheds though not all watersheds had information to allow generation of each indicator. 1. Tidal Habitat Index In comparison to the other watersheds that drain to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland using 1994-1996 data, the Lower Patuxent River watershed ranked ""8.3"" for tidal habitat index on a scale of 1(worst) to 10(best). This rank meets Maryland's benchmark for this index. The tidal habitat index combins three measurements of water quality: algae populations as measured by surface chlorophyll a, water clarity as measured by secchi depth and summer bottom dissolved oxygen (July-Sept.). To create the benchmark for this indicator, the index scores for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds with the worst conditions, which ranked in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds), ""exceeded"" the benchmark. 2. Tidal Eutrophication Index In comparison to the other watersheds that drain to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland using 1994-1996 data, the Lower Patuxent River watershed ranked ""7.5"" for tidal habitat index on a scale of 1(worst) to 10(best). This rank meets Maryland's benchmark for this index. The tidal eutrophication index combines three measurements of water quality (in surface mixed-layer water): total nitrogen, total phosphorus and total suspended solids. To create a 10   benchmark for this indicator, the index scores for the 8-digit watersheds draining to the Chesapeake Bay were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). Watersheds with the best conditions ranked in the highest three quartiles and, thereby, met the benchmark. The watersheds with the worst conditions ranked in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds) and ""exceeded"" the benchmark. 3. Modeled Loads for Phosphorus and Nitrogen In comparison to the other watersheds that drain to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, it is estimated that the Lower Patuxent River watershed receives 0.52 pounds of total phosphorus (TP) per acre in the watershed and 7.25 lbs/acre total nitrogen (TN). Both of these nutrient yields meet Maryland's benchmarks for these nutrients used in the Unified Watershed Assessment. Computer models are used to estimate how much TP and TN reaches the streams and how much of each is available for transport to the Bay. To generate the yield estimates reported in the Unified Assessment, the following information was used for the models: 1) monitoring data of point source nutrient discharges; 2) estimated nonpoint sources loads, based on 1996 land use and estimates of selected land management practices, and 3) consideration of other factors like deposition from the air. 2002 modeling conducted by DNR using 2000 data shows that the average yields for the Lower Patuxent watershed are 0.303 pounds per acre annually of total phosphorus and 5.57 pounds per acre annually of total nitrogen. These load estimates may differ from the estimates used in the Unified Watershed Assessment for several reasons: changes in point source discharges and land use, and differing consideration of best management practices and septic system loads. An additional gauge of nutrient loads will be available in the results of the synoptic survey conducted in 2003.  11   Water Quality Monitoring Water quality data for Patuxent River collected by numerous projects and programs extends back to the 1940s. Listed below are a few of the current or ongoing monitoring efforts that are potentially useful in Calvert County's WRAS project. 1. Long Term Monitoring Patuxent Mainstem The mainstem of the Patuxent River has been the focus of long term monitoring since at least the 1980s. Long term stations used to conduct this ongoing are shown in Map 4 Monitoring Water Quality. An example of the monitoring information available via the Internet is presented in the figure Map Query Results Patuxent River 6/17/2003. Status and trends for the mainstem are presented under Water Quality Assessment. 2. Solomons Harbor Water quality data for Solomons Harbor has collected since 1987 by the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science for Calvert County. Parameters monitored included water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a and water clarity. Sites used for sample collection are shown on Map 4 Monitoring Water Quality. 3. Island Creek Water Quality Relationship to Boating Activity As part of the WRAS project, the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science collected water quality data in Island Creek during summer 2003. The primary purpose of this effort is to assist in determining the extent of local water quality affects associated with boating. Two one-day sampling periods will be conducted to capture conditions associated with both high and low levels of boating activity. Results from this work will be available in late 2003. 4. Nitrogen Source Assessment in Patuxent Mainstem and Island Creek18 During 2003, the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science analyzed samples of cultured macroalgae, clams and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) placed in the Patuxent River / Island Creek area. Tissue from these cultures were analyzed to measure relative amounts of the two atomic forms of nitrogen (14N and 15N). With this information, maps of nitrogen relative to source, either from human activity like sewage effluent & septic tank discharge or from natural processes will be produced. In the Patuxent River, 67 sites were used to culture samples for testing. Sampling sites ranged throughout the Patuxent mainstem in the WRAS area and included seven in Island Creek. As of June 30, 2003, the analysis showed that the cultured algae was more responsive to the differing ratio of nitrogen species than the cultured clams and SAV. Therefore, work to map nitrogen relative to sources drew from the algae data. In order to obtain sufficient water quality data density to compliment and support analysis of the algae culturing network, water quality parameters were also monitored in the project, including: total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a, secchi depth, salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH.  12   DNR's Internet site includes large amounts of information relevant to the Lower Patuxent River watershed and Calvert County. The sample below maps water quality conditions for the Lower Patuxent River mainstem on June 17, 2003. This information is updated periodically.

Patuxent River Mainstem Status and Trends To assist work of the Patuxent Tributary Team, DNR analyzed data from long term water quality monitoring stations in the mainstem of the Patuxent River shown on Map 4 Monitoring Water Quality to characterize water quality status and trends. In the summary table below, the status for each parameter in the table is a relative ranking at three levels: good, fair and poor. For example, good means the area's ranking is good relative to comparable Chesapeake Bay tributaries with comparable salinity.

Nontidal Streams Water quality sampling is conducted by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey as part of their assessment protocol at stations shown on Map 4 Monitoring Stations. Several overall findings can be drawn from their assessment which includes biological and water quality components:16  Based on biology, Lyons Creek (outside of the WRAS area) rated the highest among Calvert County Streams. Fishing Creek and Hunting Creek rated the lowest.  Nitrate concentrations in Calvert County streams are typically in the 0.10 to 0.99 mg/l range as shown in the figure below. The highest nitrate concentration, 1.2 mg/l, was found in Lyons Creek. The other site with nitrate concentration of 1.0 mg/l or greater was in Schoolhouse Branch.  Figure is extracted from the May 29, 2003 presentation by Ron Klauda, DNR Resource Assessment Service at Calvert County's Comprehensive Plan Liaison Meeting on Environmental Issues.  15   3. Solomons Harbor Based on monitoring data collected beginning in 1987:  Average dissolved oxygen in bottom water for each sampling year in less than 5.0mg/l. This finding appears to be related to stratification of the water column during warm weather.17 Dissolved oxygen less than 2.0 mg/l has been observed at about 20% of the sampling sites during several sampling years.19  Average chlorophyll a concentration is higher in wet years than dry years. In dry years (1992, 1995, 1999, 2002), the trend is toward increasing chlorophyll a concentrations. The highest chlorophyll a concentrations tend to be found in upstream tidal waters.17 In 2000, chlorophyll a concentrations were as high as 90 micrograms per liter (Fg/l).19  Water clarity as measured by secchi depth varied from 0.2 to 1.6 meters in 2000.19  Salinity varies from 10 to 15 parts per thousand.19 Nitrogen loads potentially affecting Solomons Harbor are shown in the adjacent pie chart:17  67.89% associated with septic systems. The percentage of nitrogen load that is activity delivered to Solomons Harbor has not been determined but it could be between 30% and 50% of the total load reaching the harbor.  19.39% associated with nonpoint sources from types of land in the Solomons Harbor watershed.  10.26% is atmospheric deposition  2.46% is from boat discharge  Potential Nitrogen Load Solomons Harbor Watershed (2.46%) (10.26%)  (19.39%) (67.89%)  16   4. Toxics In Tidal Waters In 1999, the Chesapeake Bay Program released a report on toxic compounds found in tidal rivers in the Chesapeake Bay drainage. In the report, the tidal portion of the Patuxtent River mainstem was divided into three segments and each was classified based on the toxics assessment. In the summary below, ""Area of Emphasis"" means that available data for that tidal area indicates that there is a significant potential for a chemical contaminant-related problem:21 a. Upper Tidal Patuxent This area of the Patuxent River mainstem upstream of Chaulk Point was labeled an Area of Emphasis. In general, pesticides found in the water (chlorpyrifos and malathion) and in sediment (DDT) were at levels indicating probable adverse effects on living resources. In the lower portion of the segment water was slightly toxic to Chesapeake organisms in laboratory tests. Sediment in this area did not exhibit toxicity but polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons were found at levels that indicate probable adverse effects on living resources. In the middle portion of this segment, several sampling sites found degraded benthic communities. Dissolved oxygen was adequate so chemical contamination may be a cause. b. Middle Tidal Patuxent Between Chaulk Point and Sheridan Point, the Patuxent River mainstem was labeled as an Area of Emphasis. Sheridan Point is midway between Battle Creek and Rt. 231. In the upper portion of this segment, levels of the pesticide chlorpyrifos in the water and sediment were high enough to indicate probable adverse effects on living resources. In the lower portion of this segment, metals and the pesticide DDT levels were high enough to potentially cause adverse effects to living resources. Both water and sediment from this area caused adverse effects on Bay organisms under laboratory conditions. c. Between Sheridan Point and the mouth of the Patuxent River This portion of the Patuxent River mainstem was labeled ""Area with insufficient or inconclusive data."" In general, the available data did not provide sufficient evidence of a widespread chemical contamination problem in this segment. However, local areas were found to exhibit chemical contamination issues. Water samples from near Broomes Island caused adverse effects on Bay organisms under laboratory conditions. In this test, the samples were found to be more toxic to animals that live in the water than most other waters tested (ranking third out of 46 stations representing 16 tidal rivers around the Chesapeake Bay.) In this area, sediment toxicity was not identified but benthic communities were degraded. The pesticide Endosulfan II was found at levels high enough to indicate probable adverse effects on living resources.  17   Sources of Pollution Since European settlement of North America there has been an explosive growth in human population, supported by more intensive agriculture and the growth of industry. The entire continent has been cris-crossed and made mutually interdependent by vast transportation systems. All of this contributes to the decline in quality of our water and other natural resources. 1. MDE Permits and Point Sources Discharges from pipes or other ""discrete conveyances"" are called ""point sources."" Point sources may contribute pollution to surface water or to groundwater. For example, wastewater treatment discharges may contribute nutrients or microbes that consume oxygen (measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)) reducing oxygen available for other aquatic life. Industrial point sources may contribute various forms of pollution. Some understanding of point source discharges in a watershed can be useful in helping to identify and prioritize potential restoration measures. For the Lower Patuxent Watershed, 30 permits from the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) permit data base are summarized in the MDE Permits Summary Table and on Map 5 MDE Permits. Based on this information, several findings may be significant for the WRAS project:  None of the permitted discharges area appear to be significant contributors to the use impairments listed for the WRAS project area.  Discharge of treated sewage effluent is permitted for four groundwater discharges (spray irrigation, etc.) and one small point source discharge  Marinas with permitted discharges are concentrated in the vicinity of Solomons. Characteristics of the these permitted discharges (volume, temperature, pollutants, etc.) are tracked by MDE through the permit system. Most of this information is accessible to the public and can be obtained from MDE.  18   MDE Permits Summary Table  Sanitary, Industrial and Stormwater Permits Lower Patuxent Watershed (2/2003 data) Page 1 of 3 Type / MDE Category Sewage Effluent Name Northern High School Academy of Science Surface Water U of Maryland Chesapeake Biological Lab Cove Corp.

Diffuse or Nonpoint Sources Sources of pollution that include areas of land and other sources that do not have a specific point of origin are called nonpoint sources. Nonpoint sources are commonly significant contributors of pollutants, particularly nutrients and sediment. These diffuse sources include rain water that runs off roofs, streets and parking lots (sometimes via storm drains) into nearby surface waters, as well as run-off from farm fields and, to a much lesser extent, forests. Also included in nonpoint source pollution is deposition from the atmosphere and contributions from ground water, where septic systems are a factor. Nonpoint sources account for the majority of nutrient loads generated in the WRAS project area. In the Solomons Harbor watershed, which is the most density developed subwatershed in the WRAS project area, septic systems probably account for between 35% and 50% of the nitrogen delivered to surface waters, other nonpoint sources account most of the remaining nitrogen and atmospheric deposition may account for 10%.17 In the Hunting Creek watershed, which is a relatively undeveloped rural subwatershed, NPS Nitrogen Load atmospheric deposition is estimated to be the largest single source of nitrogen (45%, about Hunting Creek Watershed 19 kg/ha). However, locally controllable nonpoint sources, including fertilizer use (36%, 15 kg/ha) and septic systems (19%, (19.05%) about 8 kg/ha), together contribute a larger percentage of nitrogen to local surface waters. (45.24%) Landscape modeling of build-out scenarios predict that locally controllable nonpoint nitrogen loads will increase: over 14% under (35.71%) current zoning. The model also predicts that under two growth management scenarios, between increases in nitrogen between 7.5% and more than 11% are likely.20 In the WRAS project area, septic systems appear to be a significant contributor of nitrogen to surface waters:17  25% of Calvert County's nonpoint source nitrogen is from septic systems according to a Maryland Department of Planning estimate.  Septic systems serve more than 90% of Calvert County's residents.  22   3. Shoreline Erosion Wherever land and open water meet, change in the form of erosion or accretion of land is the inevitable result of natural processes. Human activity in these areas often either inadvertently accentuates these natural processes or purposefully attempts to control movement of water and/or loss of land. Erosion of shorelines can contribute significant amounts of nutrients (mostly phosphorus) and sediment (water column turbidity, habitat loss.) Countywide shoreline erosion is summarized in the following table. These figures group together both Patuxent River and Chesapeake Bay shorelines. 7 Calvert County Shore Erosion Rate Summary (Miles of Shoreline) Total Shoreline Total Eroding Shoreline 58 (41%) Erosion Rate 0 to 2 feet / year 45 2 to 4 feet / year 9 4 or more feet / year 4  143  Maps of historic shoreline change were produced in 1999 by the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) in a cooperative effort between DNR and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These maps included digitized shorelines for several different years in Calvert County. The maps show that extensive changes have occurred adjacent to large bodies of open water. Copies of these 1:24000 scale maps are available from the MGS. Currently, DNR is working to improve our ability to predict areas of high-rate shoreline erosion. In addition to considering historic erosion rates, contributory effects of land subsidence and sea level rise are being considered. To help generate predictive tools, two pilot areas have been selected: Calvert County and Dorchester County. Results from this work are not currently available but information will be shared with Calvert County and other interests when they become available.  23   Groundwater and Water Supply In Calvert County's portion of the Lower Patuxent Watershed, ground-water is the source for all community water supply systems. Map 6 Community Water Systems shows the distribution of these systems. In general, these systems employ confined aquifers in order to avoid the potential of local near-surface pollution. Additionally, near-surface groundwater is credited with carrying nutrients, particularly nitrogen, from land sources to surface waters where nutrient over-enrichment is occurring.

In an effort to gauge the affects of land use on water quality, and to allow comparison between watersheds, DNR has developed a series of Landscape Indicators. These indicators can be used to portray landscape conditions on a watershed scale that tend to support good water quality or that tend to degrade water quality. Landscape Indicators The 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan included a unified watershed assessment that used a number of landscape indicators to assess the State's 138 watersheds.2 Most indicators are relative measures by which Maryland's watersheds can be compared. The following sections identify the findings for the Lower Patuxent River Watershed from the 1998 Plan, with the exception of the population density, which is based on more recent Year 2000 Census data. These indicators relate to the entire Lower Patuxent River watershed, which is significantly larger than WRAS project area. Landscape Indicator Summary Lower Patuxent River Watershed From: 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment Indicator Name Year 2000 Population Density Historic Wetland Loss Unbuffered Streams Soil Erodibility Finding 0.37 people/acre 42,599 acres 10 % 0.26 value/acre  Comparison with similar Maryland watersheds Green shading: goal or benchmark was met. Orange shading: goal or benchmark not met.  1. Population Density Based on the Year 2000 Census, the population density in the Lower Patuxent River Watershed was 0.37 people per acre of land. This differs from the 0.72 people/acre shown in the Unified Watershed Assessment which used 2000 population projections. A comparison with other watersheds in the state has not been completed using the 2000 census data.2 While population density may be beyond the scope of a WRAS, directing growth is a potential WRAS component. As human population increases, the effects of human activity that degrades, displaces, or eliminates natural habitat also tend to increase. Watersheds with higher populations, assuming other factors are equal, tend to exhibit greater impacts on waterways and habitat. However, growth can be directed in ways to reduce negative impacts. 2. Historic Wetland Loss The Lower Patuxent River Watershed is estimated to have lost nearly 42,599 acres of wetlands over the years. This is a relatively large loss of wetlands compared with other similar Maryland watersheds.2 This interpretation is based on the assumption that the hydric soils in the watershed were 25   all, at one time, wetlands. Thoughtful selective restoration of historic wetland areas can be an effective WRAS component. In most of Maryland's watersheds, extensive wetland areas have been converted to other uses by draining and filling. This conversion unavoidably reduces or eliminates the natural functions that wetlands provide. 3. Unbuffered Streams Approximately 10% of streams in the Lower Patuxent River Watershed were not buffered with trees, based on 1998 information. This finding indicates that other comparable Maryland watersheds tend to have more streams with buffers. Corridors 100 feet wide (50 feet either side) along streams were combined with forest cover to develop this indicator. This estimate of streams lacking forested buffer was generated for the 1998 Maryland Clean Water Action Plan by using Maryland Department of State Planning GIS data for streams and for 1994 land use..2 In most of Maryland, trees are key to healthy natural streams. They provide numerous essential habitat functions: shade to keep water temperatures down in warm months, leaf litter ""food"" for aquatic organisms, roots to stabilize stream banks, vegetative cover for wildlife, etc. In general, reduction or loss of riparian trees / stream buffers degrades stream habitat while replacement of trees / natural buffers enhances stream habitat. (For this indicator only ""blue line streams"" were included. Intermittent streams were not considered.) 4. Soil Erodibility Soil erodibility for the Lower Patuxent River Watershed is represented by what is known as the K factor, in this case estimated to be 0.26.2 The K factor normally varies from approximately zero to about 0.6. In general, K value of 0.17 has a very low erosion potential, a value of 0.32 has a moderate erosion potential, a value of 0.37 has a high erosion potential, and a value of 0.43 has a very high erosion potential. The Lower Patuxent River watershed's overall erodiblility is moderate, although its ranking among all watersheds in the state was fairly high. Watersheds with more highly erodible soils are naturally more susceptible to surface erosion, sedimentation, streambank erosion and other problems related to soil movement. These negative effects of soil erodibility on water quality can be minimized through careful management. The soil erodibility indicator accounts for natural soil conditions but not for management of the land. (Existing cropland management was not considered.) The naturally erodible soils in the watershed are addressed by techniques called Best Management Practices (BMPs) to prevent soil loss, practices that are typically in use on local farms. BMPs like no-till or reduced till cropping, planting cover crops, field strips, or retiring erodible soils from production can significantly reduce erosion and sediment movement. These BMPs can be seen in use in many places in the watershed. Because soils can vary significantly within very small areas, a generalized erodibility indicator must be used with caution and supplemented with site-specific evaluation prior to implementing any management action.  26   Land Use  2000 Land Use  The following table and pie Lower Patuxent In Calvert County chart summarize 2000 land use / land cover for the Lower Patuxent Watershed as categorized by the Developed (24.60%) Agriculture (24.62%) Maryland Department of Planning. Nearly half of the land in WRAS project area, Cavlert County's Wetlands (1.99%) Bare Grnd (0.24%) portion of the Lower Patuxent Watershed, is forest or brush. Both agricultural land and developed land Forest (48.56%) occupy nearly one quarter of the WRAS project area. All other types of land together amount a little over 2% of land here. Viewing these general land use categories as potential nonpoint sources of nutrients, agricultural lands are likely to contribute the greatest loads to local waterways. Urban lands may also contribute significant nutrient loads. Map 7 Land Use / Land Cover shows the distribution of these land use categories in the watershed. 2000 Land Use Summary Lower Patuxent Watershed in Calvert County Category Agriculture Forest Developed Land Wetlands Bare Ground Description Field, Pasture, farm buildings All woodlands and brush All developed areas Tidal marsh, Emergent wetlands Beach, soil/rock, sand/gravel pits Acres 23,441 46,243 23,423 1,891 229 95,227 111,196  Watershed Total  excluding open water Watershed Total  including open water  27   Impervious Surface Roads, parking areas, roofs and other human constructions are collectively called impervious surface. Impervious surface blocks the natural seepage of rain into the ground. Unlike many natural surfaces, impervious surface typically concentrates stormwater runoff, accelerates flow rates and directs stormwater to the nearest stream. Watersheds with small amounts of impervious surface tend to have better water quality in local streams than watersheds with greater amounts of impervious surface. Urbanization and the increase in impervious surfaces that accompanies development can significantly impact stream health. Increases in the extent of upstream impervious surface are strongly associated with a decrease in stream quality. As impervious surfaces cover more of the landscape, less water infiltrates the soil and more water enters stream systems through runoff or stormwater discharge. This increased stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces contributes to stream quality degradation by introducing more non-point source pollution, higher temperatures, reduced stream baseflow and more erosive flood flow. The table below shows the relationship between upstream impervious land cover and instream quality. These thresholds are based on extensive biological monitoring conducted by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey:13 Upstream Impervious Cover Thresholds Percent Less Than 2 Above 2 Above 15 Above 25 Affects on Stream Quality Imperviousness is relatively insignificant compared to other factors affecting habitat quality. In cold-water habitats, brook trout may be found. Negative impacts to stream health begin. Brook trout are never found in streams with watershed imperviousness above this threshold. Stream health is never rated good, based on a combined fish and benthic macroinvertebrate Index of Biotic Integrity. Only hardy, pollution-tolerant reptiles and amphibians can thrive, while more pollution-sensitive species are eliminated.  Map 8 Impervious Surface Lower Patuxent River Watershed in Calvert County and the table Average Subwatershed Impervious Area, reflects data developed by the University of Maryland's Regional Earth Sciences Application Center (RESAC).14 The map and table are color coded to show the relative average amount of impervious cover for each subwatershed. The map also shows higher concentrations of local impervious coverage as darker areas. The Solomans Harbor subwatershed is the only subwatershed in the WRAS project area exhibiting more than 2% average impervious area. In general, the subwatersheds having between 1 and 2% average impervious area tend to be located in the northern end of the Calvert County. The distrbitution of the average impervious area is consistent with the well known patterns of growth in Calvert County over the past 20 years. 28   Map 9 Impervious Surface Solomons Harbor Subwatershed shows the distribution of impervious surface around the most urbanized portion of the WRAS project area. At this scale, it is readily apparent that impervious surface is concentrated near Solomons Island and the highway. The map also indicates that impervious surface is distributed throughout much of the subwatershed but the resolution of the data limits the accuracy of the rendering. These findings from the two maps and table indicate that impervious surface is not significant at the watershedwide scale but it may generate locally significant impacts on water quality and habitat.

These independent programs agree on emphasizing the ecological value of the watershed and the importance of maintaining its extensive, contiguous forest. In general, actions taken to assure that forest cover will be maintained, to avoid fragmentation of forest, and to restore forest in areas that have been cleared will contribute significantly to improving the water quality in this watershed and to conserving the biodiversity of the State. 1. Green Infrastructure DNR has mapped a network of ecologically important lands, comprised of hubs and linking corridors, using several of the GIS data layers used to develop other indicators. Hubs contain one or more of the following: - areas containing sensitive plant or animal species; - large blocks of contiguous interior forest (at least 250 contiguous acres, plus the 300 foot transition zone); - wetland complexes with at least 250 acres of unmodified wetlands; - streams or rivers with aquatic species of concern, rare coldwater or blackwater ecosystems, or important to anadromous fish, and their associated riparian forest and wetlands; and - conservation areas already protected by public (primarily DNR or the federal government) and private organizations like The Nature Conservancy or Maryland Ornithological Society. This ""Green Infrastructure"" provides the bulk of the state's natural support system. Ecosystem services, such as cleaning the air, filtering and cooling water, storing and cycling nutrients, conserving and generating soils, pollinating crops and other plants, regulating climate, protecting areas against storm and flood damage, and maintaining hydrologic function. Protection of Green Infrastructure lands may be addressed through various existing programs including Rural Legacy, Program Open Space, conservation easements and others. Within Program Open Space, the Green Print program helps to target funds to protect Green Infrastructure areas. Map 10 Green Infrastructure shows that there is a significant amount of Green Infrastructure in the Lower Patuxent Watershed:  Numerous Green Infrastructure hubs are identified in the WRAS area. In several subwatersheds, they are concentrated upstream of tidal waters (Hunting, St. Leonards, Battle, Helen and St. John Creeks). Further north, the hubs are concentrated near the Patuxent River mainstem in the vicinity of Kings Landing and Hall Creek.  Several areas of the watershed have partial protection of Green Infrastructure hubs: Hall Creek, Kings Landing, Battle Creek and Hellen Creek (around the County Landfill). The natural resource values in most Green Infrastructure hubs are not protected.  30   2. Large Forest Blocks Large blocks of forest provide habitat for species that are specialized for conditions with relatively little influence by species from open areas or humans. For example, forest interior dwelling birds require forest interior habitat for their survival and they cannot tolerate much human presence. Map 11 Forest Interior shows blocks of contiguous forest that are at least 50 acres in size with at least 10 acres of forest interior (forest edge is at least 300 feet away) that may be important locally within the Lower Patuxent Watershed. This size threshold was chosen to help ensure that the forest interior is large enough to likely provide locally significant habitat for sensitive forest interior dwelling species. The assessment shown in Map 11 differs from the Green Infrastructure assessment which considered only large blocks of forest land cover at least 250 acres in size that are likely to have state or regional importance.  31   Protected Lands As used in the context of watershed restoration, ""protected land"" includes any land with some form of long term limitation on conversion to urban / developed land use. This protection may be in various forms: public ownership for natural resource or low impact recreational intent, private ownership where a third party acquired the development rights or otherwise acquired the right to limit use through the purchase of an easement, etc. The extent of ""protection"" varies greatly from one circumstance to the next. Therefore, for some protected land, it may be necessary to explore the details of land protection parcel by parcel through the local land records office to determine the true extent of protection. In Maryland, the designated Priority Funding Areas identify areas in which State funding is more likely to be available in support of local development projects. These areas are one of several ways to anticipate where new development or redevelopment is likely to occur. The table below shows that about 10% of the Lower Patuxent River watershed in Calvert County has this designation. For purposes of watershed restoration, a knowledge of existing protected lands and likely areas for new development can provide a starting point in prioritizing potential restoration activities. In some cases, protected lands may provide opportunities for restoration projects because owners of these lands may Protected Land / Priority Funding value natural resource protection or Area enhancement goals.

Interpreting Local Conditions with Calvert Co.-Lower Patuxent Watershed Natural Soil Groups Soil conditions like soil type and moisture conditions greatly affect how land (12.19%) may be used and the potential for vegetation (2.93%) (3.62%) and habitat on the land. Soil conditions are (37.63%) one determining factor for water quality in (8.09%) streams and rivers. Local soil conditions vary greatly from site to site as published information in the Soil Survey for Calvert County shows. This information has been (35.53%) summarized into Natural Soil Groups to help identify useful generalizations about groups of soils. Map 13 Soils shows the distribution of natural soils groups in Calvert County's portions of the Lower Patuxent Watershed. The pie chart and table Natural Soil Group Summary gives details about the mapped soils. (clockwise from 12 o'clock):  Yellow: Prime farmland soils covers nearly 38% % of the watershed.  Orange: Well drained soils with slope limitations cover, almost 36%  Grey: Sandy, excessively well drained soils cover, about 8%  Light Green: Other general limitations, close to 4%  Red: Various hydric soils, nearly 3%  Green: Wet floodplains, marsh and swamp, over 12% 2. Soils and Watershed Planning Local soil conditions can be a useful element in watershed planning and for targeting restoration projects. Soils with limitations like wetness or slope naturally inhibit active use for farming or development and may then be available as restoration project sites. By comparing Map 13 Soils with the three preceding maps listed below, it may be possible to discern how patterns of active or passive land use relate to soil conditions:  Map 7 Land Use / Land Cover  Map 10 Green Infrastructure Natural Soils Groups and other soils assessments can be used to help identify potential areas for restoration projects or habitat protection. Hydric soils, for example, are more easily restored as wetlands than soils that were never saturated with water.

Wetland Categories The Coastal Plain Province likely has the highest diversity of emergent estuarine and palustrine (fresh water) wetland communities relative to other Maryland physiographic regions because both tidal and nontidal freshwater marshes occur here. Wetlands are most abundant in the Coastal Plain due to the low topographic relief and high ground water table characteristic of the region. Estuarine Wetlands. Estuarine wetlands are abundant throughout the Coastal Plain. These systems consist of salt and brackish tidal waters and contiguous wetlands where ocean water is at least occasionally diluted by freshwater runoff from the land. These wetlands may extend far upstream in tidal rivers to freshwater areas. Differences in salinity and tidal flooding within estuaries have a significant effect on the distribution of these wetland systems. Salt marshes occur on the intertidal shores of tidal waters in areas of high salinity. Brackish marshes are the predominant estuarine wetland type in Maryland. They are found along the shores of Chesapeake Bay, mostly on the Eastern Shore, and for considerable distance upstream in coastal rivers. Estuarine shrub swamps are common along the Maryland coastal zone. Aquatic beds, comprised mostly of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), were historically abundant in shallow water zones of Maryland's estuaries, especially Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Lacustrine wetlands. These wetlands are associated with lakes and are relatively uncommon in Maryland. Palustrine wetlands. These are freshwater wetlands that are not associated with streams or lakes. In general, palustrine wetlands are associated with freshwater, high water tables or intermittent ponding on land. Forested wetlands are the most abundant and widely distributed palustrine wetland type on the Coastal Plain. These wetlands are found on floodplains along the freshwater tidal and nontidal portions of rivers and streams, in upland depressions, and in broad flat areas between otherwise distinct watersheds. Tidal freshwater swamps occur along coastal rivers in areas subject to tidal influence. Scrub-shrub swamps are represented in the Lower Patuxent Watershed. Emergent wetlands on the Coastal Plain are characterized by a wide range of vegetation, depending on water regime. (Adapted from Wetlands of Maryland, Tiner and Burke, 1995.) Riverine wetlands. These wetlands are associated with streams or rivers. 2. Tracking Wetlands Oversight of activities affecting wetlands involves several regulatory jurisdictions. The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) is the lead agency for the State and cooperates with DNR, the Army Corps of Engineers and other Federal and local agencies. As part of its responsibility, MDE tracks State permitting and the net gain or loss of wetlands over time. As the table Tracking Nontidal Wetland Change shows, the State regulatory program has measured a small net decrease of wetland acreage in the Lower Patuxent Watershed over the past 11 years. This slowing of wetland loss in the watershed contrasts significantly with the estimated historic 42,599 acre wetland loss in the watershed as described in the Landscape Indicators section.  35   Tracking Nontidal Wetland Change For The Lower Patuxent River Watershed In Acres 1/1/1991 through 12/31/2002 10 Permanent Impacts -10.65 Permittee Mitigation 10.02 Programmatic Gains 0 Other Gains 0.39 Net -0.25  Notes: 1) Regulatory tracking for authorized nontidal wetland losses began in 1991. Comprehensive tracking of voluntary wetland gains began in 1998. Only nontidal wetland changes are shown; tidal wetland changes are excluded. Acreage presented covers the entire watershed; it does not identify County and it is not normalized. For example, the listing for the Lower Patuxent River includes five Counties: Anne Arundel, Calvert, Charles, Prince George's and St. Mary's. 2) ""Permanent Impacts"" refers to acres altered (e.g., filled, drained) under permit from MDE. 3) ""Permittee Mitigation"" refers to acres restored by a permit holder as required by terms of the permit from MDE. 4) ""Programmatic Gains"" refers to acres restored by MDE using fees paid into a compensation fund by a permit holder in lieu of undertaking mitigation himself. 5) ""Other Gains"" refers to acres of wetlands restored when not required as mitigation for permitted losses. 3. Interpreting Wetland Distribution Wetland Acreage Summary Table summarizes distribution and categories of wetlands in the Lower Patuxent Watershed for Calvert and Anne Arundel County. Overall, two wetland categories account for nearly 100% of the wetlands in the watershed:  In Calvert County's portion of the Lower Patuxent River watershed, 6.5% of the watershed (not counting open water) is wetlands. Here, about 32% of the wetlands are estuarine and about 67% are palustrine (fresh water). The lacustrine (lake) wetlands noted in the summary table refer primarily to Lake Lariat.  Anne Arundel County's portion of the watershed is entirely headwaters. The condition and extent of wetlands here affects conditions downstream in Calvert County. Three percent of the watershed is wetlands and they are entirely palustrine. Map 14 Wetlands: Island Creek Area presents the wetlands types in a selected portion of the WRAS project area. It shows that wetlands are generally associated with streams or estuarine waters. In the context of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS), wetlands serve valuable water quality and habitat functions that may not be provided by other land uses. Therefore, protection and enhancement of existing wetlands, and restoration of past wetland areas, can be a valuable element in the WRAS. (Also see the Wetland Restoration section.)  36   Wetland Acreage Summary Table Lower Patuxent Watershed in Calvert and Anne Arundel Counties Area In Acres Wetland Class Calvert Anne Arundel Estuarine emergent 1,939 -forested 9 -scrub shrub 32 -unconsolidated bottom 6 -unconsolidated shore 35 -Lacustrine unconsolidated bottom 81 -Palustrine aquatic bed 60 4 emergent 195 13 forested 3,394 68 scrub shrub 284 7 unconsolidated bottom 328 6 unconsolidated shore 7 -Riverine unconsolidated bottom 1 -Total Wetlands 6,371 98 Floodplains and Low Elevation Areas Subject to Sea Level Rise  Total 1,939 9 32 6 35 81 64 208 3,462 291 334 7 1 6,469  Map 15 Floodplains: Island Creek Area shows that the 100-year floodplain is primarily adjacent to estuarine waters in this part of the WRAS area. The scale and general location of floodplains across the WRAS Project Area are similar to that shown in this map. Most areas of the Lower Patuxent Watershed have sufficient elevation to be unaffected by any potential for sea level rise in the next 50 to 100 years. However, marshes and other lowlying wetlands are at risk for inundation. As a gauge of the risk posed by potential sea level rise, a Maryland-wide assessment of land at an elevation of 1.5 meters or less was first published in 1998 and then repackaged in a 2000 State report.8 At the scale that the assessment was conducted, no part of the WRAS Project Area was singled-out as an area of concern from a statewide perspective. Currently, DNR is considering sea level rise as it works to improve prediction of shoreline erosion. New information that may be generated by this effort will be shared with local jurisdictions as it becomes available.  37   LIVING RESOURCES AND HABITAT Living resources, including all the animals, plants and other organisms that call the land and waters of the Lower Patuxent Watershed home, are being affected by human activity. The information summarized here suggests that some of the significant stresses on living resources in the watershed are alteration and destruction of habitat, excessive movement of sediment and excessive availability of nutrients. The living resource information summarized here should be considered a partial representation, because numerous areas of potential interest or concern could not be included due to lack of information, time, etc. For example, information on many forms of aquatic life, woodland communities, terrestrial habitats, etc. should be considered as watershed restoration decisions are being made. Therefore, it is recommended that stakeholders in the watershed identify important living resource issues or priorities so that additional effort can be focused where it is most needed. New information should be added as it becomes available. Living Resource Indicators  Aquatic organisms are sensitive, in varying degrees, to changes in water Indicator Name Finding quality and aquatic habitat. They are also sensitive to landscape changes. This SAV Abundance 1.0 association offers two perspectives that are important for watershed restoration. SAV Habitat Requiremts 3.3 First, improvements for living resources Tidal Benthic 4.67 offer potential goals, objectives and opportunities to gauge progress in Tidal Fish 5.0 watershed restoration. Second, the status of selected species can be used to gauge Anadromous Fish Index 7.59 local conditions for water quality, habitat, Nontidal Fish Index 7.7 etc. This second perspective is the basis for using living resources as an Nontidal Benthic Index 5.8 ""indicator."" The Maryland Clean Water Action Nontidal Habitat Index 4.4 Plan's Unified Watershed Assessment, Comparison with similar Maryland watersheds published in 1998, included a number of Green shading: goal or benchmark was met. living resource indicators for the Western Orange shading: goal or benchmark not met. Branch Watershed.2 Several of these indicators rely on extrapolations from a limited number of sampling sites which were then generalized to represent entire watersheds. Some are indices comprising several conditions. Considering this limitation on field data, it would be beneficial to conduct additional assessments to provide a more complete understanding of local conditions. 38  Living Resource Indicator Summary Lower Patuxent River Watershed From: 1998 Unified Watershed Assessment   1. SAV Abundance For tidal areas of the Lower Patuxent Watershed, the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) scored ""1.0"" for the Abundance Indicator, which means that SAV covered 10% or less of the potential SAV habitat. This indicator is designed to allow comparison of watersheds based on actual SAV acreage versus potential SAV acreage. To generate the score for this indicator, two measurements of SAV area were used: 1) area covered by SAV in the year 1996 was measured using aerial survey data, and 2) the potential SAV area was measured based on water depth (up to two meters deep), physical characteristics and historic occurrence of SAV. The benchmark used in the Unified Watershed Assessment of the Clean Water Action Plan for the SAV Abundance indicator was 10%. If less than 10% of the potential SAV area in a watershed was covered by SAV in 1996, then the watershed was listed in the category ""needs restoration"". If more than 10% of the potential SAV area in a watershed was covered by SAV in 1996, then the watershed was listed in the category ""needs preventative action"" to protect or enhance SAV abundance. No watershed in the State scored higher than 2, reflecting a maximum observed coverage of 20%. 2. SAV Habitat Index For tidal areas of the Lower Patuxent Watershed, the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) scored ""3.3"" for the Habitat Index, which means that SAV habitat requirements were not met based on 1994-1996 data. This index is designed to allow comparison of watersheds based on several measurements of habitat conditions: water clarity as measured by secchi depth, dissolved inorganic nitrogen where applicable, dissolved inorganic phosphorus, abundance of algae as measured by Chlorophyll a and total suspended solids. The benchmark used in the Unified Watershed Assessment for the SAV Habitat Index was 7. A score less than 7 means that the watershed's habitat conditions were not favorable for SAV and the watershed was listed as being in need of restoration (Category 1). A score of 7 or higher means that 1994 through 1996 data showed that habitat conditions for SAV in a watershed were sufficient and the watershed was listed in the category for ""restoration needed"". Lower Patuxent watershed is among the lowest scoring half of watersheds statewide on this indicator. 3. Tidal Benthic The Lower Patuxent River score of 4.67 for Tidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity does not meet the benchmark established for benthic community restoration. This index was created by using samples from 18 fixed sites in Maryland's tidal tributaries to determine of the benthic community at each site meets restoration goals considering species diversity, species composition, productivity, and trophic composition. If more than one sample site where in the same river system, index scores were averaged to generate a watershed score. These scores were ranked 1 (worst) to 10 (best). Scores less than 6 do not meet the restoration goal and scores of 6 or greater met the goal. 4. Tidal Fish The Lower Patuxent River score of 5.0 for Tidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity means that moderate disturbance to the fish community was observed. 39   The Index was created by using monthly data (July - September) collected at multiple sites sampled in each river system. Observations considered included total number of species, number of species comprising 90% of the catch, number of species in the bottom trawl, anadromous fish abundance, estuarine fish abundance, total fish abundances not considering menhaden and proportions of fish that eat plankton, fish or benthos. These data were normalized and ranked. A rank of 2 means severe disturbance to the fish community, a 5 rank means moderate disturbance and an 8 rank means minimal disturbance. 5. Anadromous Fish Index To develop this index, anadromous fish and semi-anadromous fish were examined based on average catch per unit effort (CPUE). The CPUE was calculated for each sampling area on a yearly basis. The average rank for each river was calculated and used to create a 1 (worst) to 10 (best) scale. To create the benchmark for this indicator, the index scores for the watersheds were ranked highest to lowest and then divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). The watersheds with the worst conditions, which ranked in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds), ""exceeded"" the benchmark. All the remaining watersheds in the higher three quartiles (75% of the watersheds) met the benchmark. 6. Nontidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity With an IBI score of 7.7, the Lower Patuxent Watershed met the benchmark set for the Nontidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI). The Index of Biotic Integrity (IBIs) for fishes have been developed for small (first- to third-order) non-tidal streams. Several characteristics of the fish community are measured: numbers of native species, of benthic species and of tolerant individuals; the percent of tolerant species, of dominant species, and of generalists, omnivores and insectivores; the number of individuals per square meter; biomass in grams per square meter; percent of lithophilic spawners; and percent insectivores. These characteristics are scored and summed to calculate a fish IBI for each sampled stream. Each watersheds score is an average of stream scores within the watershed. These watershed scores were ranked 1 (most degraded) through 10 (best condition). A score of less than 6 does not meet the benchmark set for this index. A score of 6 or greater meets the benchmark. 7. Nontidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity With an IBI score of 5.8, the Lower Patuxent Watershed does not meet the benchmark set for the Nontidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI). The nontidal benthic IBI looks at the insects and other invertebrates, like crayfish, living on the bottoms of streams, considering the overall community composition, the number and diversity of species and the presence of sensitive species. To calculate the benthic IBI, for the Unified Watershed Assessment, reference conditions were established for minimally-impacted streams. IBI values are relative to conditions in these minimally-impacted streams. An index of 6.0 or less means that restoration is recommended and an index of 8.0 or higher means that protection is recommended.  40   8. Nontidal Habitat Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) The Lower Patuxent River watershed's low overall index of 4.2 for habitat biotic integrity suggests that this watershed has significant physical habitat concerns relative to similar Maryland watersheds. This rank corresponds to an MBSS score of 2.8 which is in the ""poor"" range for MBSS reporting. A rank less than 6 means that restoration is recommended. This physical habitat indicator is developed for small (first- to third-order) non-tidal streams. It is based on several measures of in-stream habitat quality that are scored for each site based on observations of habitat condition in streams during sampling visits. The habitat measures rate the quantity and quality of physical habitat available in the stream for fish and benthic macroinvertebrate colonization and rate the degree to which the stream channel has been altered due to changes in watershed landscape. The physical habitat characteristics are measured, scored, weighted, and summed to calculate the indicator for each sampled stream. A low score, or a decline in score over time, reflects both natural disturbances and human-induced alterations of the stream habitat relative to minimally-disturbed reference sites. The mean habitat score for watersheds is reported on a scale of 1 (most degraded) to 10 (best condition). The ranked scores were divided into four groups each containing 25% of the watersheds (quartiles). Watersheds with the best conditions ranked in the highest three quartiles and, thereby, met the benchmark. The watersheds with the worst conditions ranked in the lowest quartile (25% of the watersheds) and ""exceeded"" the benchmark. Physical habitat conditions in non-tidal streams and rivers are influenced by land use and land cover patterns in the watershed, such as the destruction of riparian forests and increasing the area of impervious land cover. Other major influences are channelization, encroachment by livestock, and blockages to upstream/downstream movements of fish. Fish 1. Anadromous and Estuarine Species Map 16 Fish Status shows current knowledge on herring, white perch and yellow perch spawning areas in the Lower Patuxent watershed accumulated by DNR Fisheries Service. Available information indicates that most spawning for these species occurs upstream of Calvert County's midpoint. Key spawning areas include Lyons Creek, Hall Creek and Hunting Creek. Yellow Perch fishing/spawning surveys were conducted in March 2002 by the Coastal Conservation Association Southern Maryland (CCASM) on about 20 streams in Southern Maryland. Of three Patuxent River tributaries surveyed in Calvert County, only Lyons Creek (outside the WRAS project area) exhibited a significant evidence of yellow perch spawning:15  Lyons Creek (outside WRAS): fishing survey not conducted, 150 egg masses found  Hunting Creek: no fish caught during three hours, one egg mass found  Battle Creek: fishing survey not conducted, no egg masses found St. Leonard Creek was stocked with about 2,300 yellow perch fry at the Parran Road bridge in May 2002. Sein net surveys in St. Leonard Creek documented the presence of ""year zero"" yellow perch but the origin of these young fish (stocked or natural) was not determined.15 41   2. Fish In Nontidal Areas Map 16 Fish Status shows stream segments surveyed by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) in Calvert County's portion of the Lower Patuxent in 1994 and 1997. A detailed listing of fish species identified in each area appears in APPENDIX A Findings from MBSS Fish Surveys. The overall interpretation based on this information suggests that stream areas in the WRAS project area could be prioritized based on the potential to protect or augment existing fish populations and/or spawning areas.  Hall Creek and Hunting Creek (and Lyons Creek outside of the WRAS project area) have significant spawning by herring, white perch and yellow perch based on available information. Spawning by these species is also documented in Battle Creek, St. Leonards Creek, Hellen Creek and Mill Creek.  Only fish that are tolerant or moderately tolerant to variable water quality and habitat conditions were found in the nontidal stream segments that where surveyed. The fish species found in the greatest number of stream segments tended to be tolerant species.  Hunting Creek had the greatest diversity of fish species among the streams survey in the WRAS area.  The most common fish in Calvert County's nontidal streams is the eastern mudminnow.16 Algae During the summer of 2003 harmful algae blooms were reported in several locations around the WRAS project area. Dense blooms such as these have resulted in areas of hypoxia, or low oxygen, a condition which is stressful to Bay life:  Mahogany Tide (Prorocentrum minimum): blooms in the Lower Patuxent River mainstem  Black Tide (Karlodinium micrum). Sufficient toxin to kill fish is produced with concentrations of at least 10,000 to 30,000 cells/ml. - Lower Patuxent River mainstem during May and June 2003. - St. Leonard's Creek experienced concentrations as high as 58,000 cells/ml. Chlorophyll a measurements in the surface layer were measured as high as 6,645 Fg/l 678 Fg/L at about 1 foot below the surface and 10 Fg/l or less below a depth of one meter. Commonly, 30 to 50 ug/l chlorophyll a may be considered elevated. - Battle Creek experience blooms of lesser severity than St. Leonard's Creek.  Other Algae Blooms. Ubiquitous occurrence of blooms on the lower Patuxent, with May and June 2003 sampling cruises showing system-wide high chlorophyll concentrations.  42   Biological Monitoring of Streams The earliest biological monitoring by DNR of streams in Calvert County's portion of the Lower Patuxent River watershed was conducted in the early 1990s. As reported in the table below, two nontidal steams were assessed using the rapid bio-assessment technique which was widely used in Maryland at the time. Sampling site locations are shown on Map 4 Monitoring Stations. An important component of biological monitoring in nontidal stream is assessment of benthic macroinvertebrates. The value of this assessment is explained in the text box Why Look at Benthos in Streams? DNR Rapid Bio-Assessment Data Summary Map Location Key 1 2 Hunting Cr. at Plum Point Rd.

Results are presented in the table 1997 MBSS Findings and the sampling site locations referenced in the table are also shown on Map 4 Monitoring Stations. While results of this assessment is not directly comparable to the current day MBSS data, the sampling results from both approaches provide an indication of biological conditions in local nontidal streams. The next scheduled sampling of local streams by MBSS is scheduled for 2004. Considering all biological monitoring data available for Calvert County several overall findings can be stated:16  The average rating for fish is poor (fish indicator score of 2.24)  The average rating for stream bugs is poor (benthic macroinvertebrate indicator score of 2.50)  43   1997 MBSS Findings * Lower Patuxent River Watershed In Calvert County Map Key 1 Score Watershed/Stream Fowlers Mill Branch, tributary to Hall Creek, south of Tuckers Trail Chew Creek upstream of Rt. 262 near Neptune Lane Unnamed tributary to Cocktown Creek, west of Carriage Lane Unnamed Tributary to Patuxent R.

Benthos are sometimes called ""stream bugs"" though that name overly simplifies the diverse membership of this group. Unimpaired natural streams may support a great diversity of species ranging from bacteria and algae to invertebrates like crayfish and insects to fish, reptiles and mammals. Benthic macro-invertebrates, collectively called benthos, are an important component of a stream's ecosystem. This group includes mayflies, caddisflies, crayfish, etc., that inhabit the stream bottom, its sediments, organic debris and live on plant life (macrophytes) within the stream. The food web in streams relies significantly on benthos. Benthos are often the most abundant source of food for fish and other small animals. Many benthic macroinvertebrates live on decomposing leaves and other organic materials in the stream. By this activity, these organisms are significant processors of organic materials in the stream. Benthos often provide the primary means that nutrients from organic debris are transformed to other biologically usable forms. These nutrients become available again and are transported downstream where other organisms use them. Benthos are a valuable tool for stream evaluation. This group of species has been extensively used in water quality assessment, in evaluating biological conditions of streams and in gauging influences on streams by surrounding lands. Benthos serve as good indicators of water resource integrity because they are fairly sedentary in nature and their diversity offers numerous ways to interpret conditions. They have different sensitivities to changing conditions. They have a wide range of functions in the stream. They use different life cycle strategies for survival.  45   Oysters One of the commitments made in the 2000 Chesapeake Bay Agreement states that ""by 2010, achieve a tenfold increase in native oysters in the Chesapeake Bay."" To help gauge the opportunities for oyster management and restoration within the WRAS project area, it is valuable to gauge the local status oysters. Oyster bars are areas defined by law to protect and control oyster habitat and populations of oysters. Legally-defined oyster bars are depicted on charts maintained by DNR. In the Patuxent River, charted oyster bars cover about 10,045 acres as shown in Map 17 Oysters. The large legal oyster bar shown on the map immediately east of Drum Point just outside of the Patuxent River mouth covers approximately an additional 5,121 acres. The boundaries of the legal oyster bars shown in the map were delineated in 1983. They are larger than any oyster habitat or populations that they may contain. Regulations control activities in and around the oyster bars. For example, regulations prohibit digging for clams in areas labeled on the chart as oyster bars or within 150 feet of an oyster bar. Protection of oyster bars is considered in the review of proposed projects like dredging and marina construction or expansion before permits are issued. The current-day oyster lease areas in the Patuxent River cover about 10,046 acres of river bottom. The large lease area immediately east of Drum Point just outside of the Patuxent River mouth covers 5,121 about acres. The map indicates that the legal oyster bars in the Patuxent River are essentially all leased. The map also shows that current day Patuxent River legal oyster bars are located approximately where they were 90 years ago according to a survey of oyster beds by C.C. Yates conducted between 1906 and 1912. The area covered by the historical natural oyster bars in the Patuxent River cover about 5,661 acres as shown in the map. The historical natural oyster bars shown on the east of Drum Point cover approximately an additional 3,959 acres. Because the historic oyster bars are an estimate of actual oyster beds and the current legal oyster bars are actually larger than the physical oyster bed that they contain, the information presented here does portray the change in oyster bar size over time. However, Maryland's oyster recover program, conducted by the Department of Natural Resources, invested many years replenishing existing oyster beds and creating new oyster bed areas. Oyster populations in the Patuxent River are a small fraction of historic populations. The decline in oyster populations during the 20th Century can be traced to several causes including disease that kills a significant percentage of oysters in the Patuxent, sedimentation that covers oyster beds and water quality problems like low dissolved oxygen in parts of the river.  46   Sensitive Species Sensitive species are generally recognized as being the plants or animals that are most at risk in regards to their ability to maintain healthy population levels. The most widely known are perhaps the Sate and Federally-listed Endangered or Threatened animals such as the bald eagle and Delmarva fox squirrel. In addition to charismatic animals such as these however, both the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Maryland DNR work through their respective Federal and State programs to protect a wide variety of declining non-game animals, rare plants, and the unique natural communities that support them. For the purposes of watershed restoration, it is valuable to account for the known locations and areas of potential habitat for sensitive species in a given area. They are often indicators, and sometimes important constituents, of the network of natural areas which form the foundation for many essential natural watershed processes. In fact, in addition to conserving biodiversity in general, protecting these species and/or promoting expansion of their habitats can be an effective component for a watershed restoration program. 1. Habitat Conservation Measures DNR's Wildlife and Heritage Service identifies important areas for sensitive species conservation in different ways. The geographic delineations most commonly used are described in the text box Marylands Sensitive Species Conservation Areas. As shown in Map 18 Sensitive Species, two of the three sensitive species overlays used by the State of Maryland are found in Calvert County's portion of the Lower Patuxent River Watershed. The purpose of utilizing these delineations is to help protect sensitive species by identifying the areas in which they are known to occur. Doing so allows DNR to work toward the conservation of these sensitive resources by evaluating potential impacts of proposed actions that may affect them. Specifically, working within an established procedural framework, the Wildlife and Heritage Service reviews projects and provides recommendations for activities falling within these overlays. The geographic areas covered by these overlays serve as course filters. To allow for uncertainty in interpretation, the polygons on the map to depict these locations include buffer areas. Accurate on the ground information regarding species locations and habitat delineations for a specific area can be obtained from DNR's Natural Heritage Program. It is also important to note that outside of the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area, DNR generally only places requirements on projects requiring a permit/approval or those which are utilizing State funds. However, there are more broadly applied State and Federal laws and regulations which address ""takings"" of listed species. In addition, many counties have incorporated safeguards for areas associated with sensitive species into their project and permit review processes as well as adopting specific ordinances in some cases to protect them. In all instances, property owners are encouraged to seek advice on protecting the sensitive species / habitat within their ownership. 2. Rare, Threatened and Endangered Species List The table Sensitive Species lists rare, threatened and endangered species found in the watershed. In general, these species are located within the areas shown on the map as Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA).  47   Sensitive Species Protection Areas In the Lower Patuxent Watershed Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA) Nearly 20 ESAs are identified in the Newport and Sinepuxent Bays Watershed as shown in Map 18 Sensitive Species. Each ESA contains one or more sensitive species habitats. However, the entire ESA is not considered sensitive habitat. The ESA is an envelope identified for review purposes to help ensure that applications for permit or approval in or near sensitive areas receive adequate attention and safeguards for the sensitive species / habitat they contain. Natural Heritage Area (NHA) No NHAs are located in the Lower Patuxent Watershed. In general, NHAs have been designated as such because they represent rare ecological communities. These are areas which provide important sensitive species habitat. They are designated in State regulation (COMAR 08.03.08.10) and are afforded specific protections in the Critical Area Law criteria. For proposed projects that could potential affect a particular NHA, recommendations and/or requirements may be put in place during the permit or approval process. These would be specifically aimed at protecting the ecological integrity of the NHA itself. To help ensure that proposed projects which may affect a given NHA are adequately reviewed, an ESA is always designated to encompass each NHA and the area surrounding it. Wetlands of Special State Concern (WSSC) At least three areas of WSSCs, totaling about 218 acres, are designated in the Lower Patuxent Watershed as shown on Map 18 Sensitive Species: One large area encompassing about 192 acres is located along Battle Creek including the Battle Creek Cyprus Swamp. These selected wetlands, which generally represent the best examples of Maryland's nontidal wetland habitats, are afforded additional protection in sate law beyond the permitting requirements that apply to wetlands generally. The Maryland Department of the Environment may be contacted for more information regarding these regulations. To help ensure that proposed projects that may affect a WSSC are adequately reviewed, an ESA is always designated to encompass each WSSC and the area surrounding it. For a listing of designated sites see COMAR 26.23.06.01 at www.dsd.state.md.us  48   Sensitive Species Tracked by Maryland in the Lower Patuxent River Watershed Scientific Name Animals Cicindela dorsalis dorsal Falco peregrinus anatum Haliaeetus leucocephalus Plants Aeschynomene virginica Antennaria solitaria Aristida lanosa Aster concolor Carex mesochorea Centrosema virginianum Gymnopogon brevifolius Hermeuptychia sosybius Matelea carolinensis Myosotis macrosperma Parnassia asarifolia Potamogeton foliosus Potamogeton perfoliatus Potamogeton spirillus Rhynchosia tomentosa Sagittaria engelmanniana Sagittaria longirostra Solidago speciosa Sporobolus clandestinus Common Name Northeastern beach tiger beetle American peregrine falcon Bald eagle Sensitive joint-vetch Single-headed pussytoes Woolly three-awn Silvery aster Midland sedge Spurred butterfly-pea Broad-leaved beardgrass Carolina satyr Anglepod Large-seeded forget-me-not Kidneyleaf grass-of-parnassus Leafy pondweed Clasping-leaved pondweed Spiral pondweed Hairy snoutbean Engelmann's arrowhead Long-beaked arrowhead Showy goldenrod Rough rushgrass Status* E E T E T E E O O E O E O E E O O T T O T E  * Key for Maryland Status.

SAV is not only important as an indicator of water quality, but it is also a critical nursery habitat for many estuarine species. For example, blue crab ""post-larvae"" are up to 30 times more abundant in SAV beds than in adjacent unvegetated areas. Additionally, several species of waterfowl depend on SAV for food when they over-winter in the Chesapeake region. 1. Area of SAV Beds Between 1984 and 1999, SAV location and extent in the Lower Patuxent River has varied significantly as the table SAV Distribution And Acreage and Map 19 SAV indicate. Several summary findings can be drawn from this information:  Total SAV bed acreage in the Lower Patuxent River was sometimes over 100 acres in the mid 1980s and the late 1990s based on interpretation of aerial photography. However, no SAV could be identified in aerial photographs in the early 1990s.  Typical locations of SAV beds in the mid 1980s tended to be in areas downstream of Brooms Island. Following the disappearance of SAV in the early 1990s, SAV beds that reappeared tended to be in areas upstream of Cocktown Creek.  The reasons for the variations listed above are not well understood. Part of the variation may be associated with rainfall (wet/dry years) and the differences in nutrient loads entering the Lower Patuxent River from nonpoint sources and point sources over time. 2. SAV Area Relative Change in Nutrient Loads17 Drawing on many years of water quality monitoring data from the Patuxent River, concentrations of nutrients in the open water of the mainstem are documented for several decades. Nutrient load increases were documented from the 1960s through the 1980s and nutrient load reductions were documented thereafter In research slated to be published in late 2003, the relationship between Patuxent nutrient loads and the extent of SAV is to be explored. The research is anticipated to qualitatively show that decreasing SAV area coincides with increasing nutrient loads. However, as nutrient loads decreased, Patuxent SAV have not shown a similar rebound.  50   SAV Distribution And Acreage  Lower Patuxent River Year 1999 1998 1997 1996 1995 1994 1993 1992 1991 1990 1989 7 1 2 3 5 General Location* Of SAV Beds And Their Acreage In That Location  Patuxent Mainstem Downstream | Patuxent Mainstem Upstream  1 16 8 1 34 30 26 34 33 79 84 70 51 31 2 2a 3 3a 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 16 122 117 101 85 64 2 0 0 0 8 Total  1988 - no data 1987 1986 1985 1984 21 21 1 28 9 70 10 25 36 9 11 16 7 22 89 32 130 35  * KEY for Locations along Patuxent River Mainstem 1- Solomons Harbor vicinity 2- Hellen Creek vicinity 2a- In Hellen Creek 3- St. Leonards Creek vicinity 3a- In St. Leonards Creek 4- Island Creek vicinity 5- Battle Creek vicinity 6- Buzzard Island Creek vicinity 7- Cocktown Creek vicinity 8- Chew Creek vicinity 9- Graham & Friday Creek vicinity 10- Hall Creek vicinity  51   RESTORATION AND CONSERVATION TARGETING There are a number of programs and tools available to assist in implementing goals for protection of valued watershed resources and for targeting restoration of those that have become degraded or otherwise function less than optimally. 2003 Stream Corridor Assessment Using the Stream Corridor Assessment Methodology (SCAM) developed and applied by the DNR Watershed Restoration Division, valuable information can be compiled to assist in targeting restoration activities. In partnership with Calvert County, DNR is conducting a Stream Corridor Assessment in the Lower Patuxent Watershed during 2003. In this effort, trained teams from the Maryland Conservation Corps walk along streams to identify and document potential problems and restoration opportunities such as the items listed below: Stream Corridor Assessment Data Collection Categories Pipe Outfalls Pond Sites Tree Blockages Inadequate Buffers Erosion Fish Blockages Exposed Pipe Unusual Conditions Trash Dumping In- or Near-Stream Construction  A stream corridor assessment report will be generated, including maps and photographs, to support targeting decisions for restoration projects. Draft data summaries are expected to be available in late 2003. The results of the stream corridor assessment will provide a valuable foundation for development of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. 2003 Synoptic Survey and Aquatic Community Assessment During 2003 DNR staff collected water quality samples in nontidal streams to supplement knowledge of local conditions. The water quality findings included in the report on this work can help identify problem areas and relative conditions among local streams based on measurements of dissolved oxygen, pH, nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen), conductivity and flow. The findings include nutrient loads at each sampling site and allow the ranking of subwatersheds based on estimated nutrient load. For some of these nontidal stream sampling sites, DNR staff has also assessed fish and benthic organism populations. These assessments provide additional perspectives to gauge local water quality and habitat conditions.  52   Agricultural Conservation Programs Many farmers in Calvert County willingly implement management systems that address nutrient runoff and infiltration, erosion and sediment control, and animal waste utilization. Some of these conservation practices include grassed waterways, riparian herbaceous and riparian forested buffers, conservation cover, cover crops, shallow water wildlife areas and grade stabilization structures. The Maryland Agricultural Cost-Share program (MACS), the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP and CREP) and the Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) are some of the state and federal programs promoted and administered by the Calvert SCD and Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS). 28 As part of the WRAS project, farmers in the watershed who are already using good management practices that benefit water quality could provide examples to promote adoption of similar practices by other farmers. Marina Programs Discharges of sewage from boats are a concern for water quality because they contribute nutrients, biochemical Clean Marina Participant 1 -oxygen demand, pathogens, etc. These (has pumpout available) discharges are preventable if a sufficient number of pumpout facilities are locally Marina Offering 13 4 available and boat operators take Pumpout advantage of these services. Boat Other Marinas 15 11 maintenance and operation also can contribute petroleum and other noxious materials to the aquatic environment. The status of marinas in the Lower Patuxent River is summarized in the adjacent table and their approximate location is shown in Map 20 Marinas. The Clean Marinas Program is a way for marina owners to gain certification and public recognition for voluntarily undertaking a number of actions related to marina design, operation, and maintenance intended to properly manage all kinds of marine products and activities, and to reduce and properly manage waste. Information is available at DNR's website, www.dnr.state.md.us/boating. DNR also funds installation and maintenance of marine pumpout facilities, including those at certified Clean Marinas. Information may be obtained from the Waterway and Greenways Division at DNR. One potential element of a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) is to encourage and/or support adding marina pumpout facilities serving the local area and increasing participation in the Clean Marina Program. Marina Status Lower Patuxent River Calvert County Other Countie s  53   Fish Blockage Removal Many fish species need to move from one stream segment to the next in order to maintain healthy, resilient populations. This is particularly true for anadromous fish species because they spawn and hatch from eggs in free flowing streams but live most of their lives in estuarine or ocean waters. Blockages in streams can inhibit or prevent many fish species from moving upstream to otherwise viable habitat. To help prioritize stream blockages for mitigation or removal, the DNR Fish Passage Program maintains a database of significant blockages to fish movement. However, the database has no information listed for the Lower Patuxent Watershed. The 2003 Stream Corridor Assessment will confirm if any blockages to fish movement exist in the watershed. Stream Buffer Restoration 1. Benefits and General Recommendations Natural vegetation in stream riparian zones, particularly forest, provides numerous valuable environmental benefits:  Reducing surface runoff  Preventing erosion and sediment movement  Using nutrients for vegetative growth and moderating nutrient entry into the stream  Moderating temperature, particularly reducing warm season water temperature  Providing organic material (decomposing leaves) that are the foundation of natural food webs in stream systems  Providing overhead and in-stream cover and habitat  Promoting high quality aquatic habitat and diverse populations of aquatic species. To realize these environmental benefits, DNR generally recommends that forested stream buffers be at least 100 feet wide , i.e. natural vegetation 50 feet wide on either side of the stream. Therefore, DNR is promoting this type of stream buffer for local jurisdictions and land owners who are willing to go beyond the minimum buffer standards. The DNR Watershed Restoration Division and other programs like Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), managed by the DNR Forest Service, are available to assist land owners who volunteer to explore these opportunities. 2. Using GIS Identifying the areas that need buffer restoration and prioritizing them for action can be a time-consuming, expensive project. Computerized Geographic Information System (GIS) can be used to manipulate remotely sensed data to facilitate consideration of priorities and to help save limited time and funds. GIS can be used to supplement information generated by a Stream Corridor Assessment. The resolution of the data used to generate these maps is not sufficient for an accurate site assessment but it can be used to identify candidate sites for more detailed investigation. For example, local agencies may have more accurate information that the US Geological Survey Quadrangle Maps ""blue line"" streams used in the GIS scenarios. Intermittent 54   streams were not considered in the stream buffer scenario maps. With additional on-the-ground verification or ""ground-truthing,"" local government can efficiently consider stream buffer restoration as part of a local Watershed Restoration Action Strategy. 3. Headwater Stream Buffers Headwater streams are also called first order streams. For many watersheds, first order streams drain the majority of the land within the entire watershed. Therefore, stream buffers restored along headwater streams (First Order) tend to have greater potential to intercept nutrients and sediments than stream buffers placed elsewhere. In targeting stream buffer restoration projects, giving higher priority to headwater streams is one approach to optimizing nutrient and sediment retention. Restoring headwater stream buffers can also provide habitat benefits that can extend downstream of the project area. Forested headwater streams provide important organic material, like decomposing leaves, that ""feed"" the stream's food web. They also introduce woody debris which enhances in-stream physical habitat. The potential for riparian forest buffers to significantly influence stream temperature is greatest in headwater regions. These factors, in addition to positive water quality effects, are key to improving aquatic habitat. Since the Lower Patuxent Watershed has a substantial percentage of its headwater streams in interior forests, protection of these forests against impacts from development may be an important part of WRAS strategies, along with reforestation where necessary. 4. Land Use and Stream Buffers One factor that affects the ability of stream buffers to intercept Annual Nonpoint Source Pollution Load Rates nonpoint source pollutants By Land Use is adjacent land use. Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model (2000) Nutrient and sediment loads Land Use Nitrogen Phosphorus Sediment from different land uses can (lbs/ac) (lbs/ac) (tons/ac) vary significantly as shown in the adjacent table. By Crop land 17.11 1.21 0.74 restoring naturally vegetated stream buffers Urban 7.5 0.7 0.09 adjacent to lands producing Pasture 8.40 1.15 0.30 the highest pollutant loads, nutrient and sediment loads Forest 1.42 0.00 0.03 can be reduced most efficiently. Map 21 Stream Buffer Scenario focuses on the crop and pasture lands within 50 feet of a stream and identifies stream segments that lack naturally vegetated stream buffers. DNR encourages creating stream buffers at least 50 feet wide on each side of the stream, which is significantly greater than minimum buffer requirement, to enhance nutrient and habitat benefits beyond minimum buffer requirements. 55   5. Nutrient Uptake from Hydric Soils in Stream Buffers In general, the nutrient nitrogen moves from the land into streams in surface water runoff and in groundwater with a significant percentage of nitrogen entering streams in groundwater. Stream buffers can be used to capture nitrogen moving in groundwater if buffer restoration projects have several key attributes:  Plants with roots deep enough to intercept groundwater as it moves toward the stream  Plants with high nitrogen uptake capability, and  Targeting buffer restoration projects to maximize groundwater interception by buffer plants. Hydric soils in stream riparian areas can be used as one factor to help select stream buffer restoration sites. Siting buffer restoration on hydric soils would offer several benefits:  Plant roots are more likely to be in contact with groundwater for longer periods of time  Hydric soils tend to be marginal for many agricultural and urban land uses  Natural vegetation in wet areas often offers greater potential for habitat. Map 21 Stream Buffer Scenario identifies lands adjacent to streams that are composed of hydric soil, that are crop or pasture land and also lack naturally vegetated stream buffers. An important next step in using this information is verification of field conditions. Care must be taken during field validation to evaluate any hydrologic modification of these soils, such as ditching or draining activities, which would serve to decrease potential benefits. 6. Optimizing Water Quality Benefits by Combining Priorities Strategic targeting of stream buffer restoration projects may provide many different benefits. To maximize multiple benefits, site selection and project design need to incorporate numerous factors. For example, finding a site with a mix of attributes like those in the following list could result in the greatest control of nonpoint source pollution and enhancement to living resources:  land owner willingness / incentives  marginal land use in the riparian zone  headwater stream  hydric soils  selecting appropriate woody/grass species  adjacent to existing wetlands / habitat  Additionally, selecting restoration projects that are likely to produce measurable success is an important consideration in prioritizing projects for implementation. In general, targeting restoration projects in selected tributaries or small watersheds will tend to offer the greatest probability of producing measurable water quality improvement in the short term. By selecting small areas like a small first order stream for restoration, there is greater likelihood that local water quality will improve with relatively limited investment. In addition, local water quality improvements will likely contribute to downstream improvements.  56   Wetland Restoration Wetlands serve important environmental functions such as providing habitat and nursery areas for many organisms, facilitating nutrient uptake and recycling, providing erosion control. However, most watersheds in Maryland have significantly fewer wetland acres today than in the past. This loss due to draining, filling, etc., has led to habitat loss and negative water quality impacts in streams and in the Chesapeake Bay. Reversing this historic trend is an important goal of wetland restoration. One approach to identifying candidate wetland restoration sites involves identifying ""historic"" wetland areas based on the presence of hydric soils. This process can be accelerated by using GIS to manipulate soils information with other data like land use. The GIS products can then assist in initiating the candidate site search process, targeting site investigations and helping to identify land owners. Map 22 Wetland Restoration Scenario indicates that there appears to be potential for wetland restoration based on identifying crop land and/or pasture on hydric soil. This is one of many potential scenarios for finding opportunities for wetland restoration. The steps and priorities used to generate the map are listed below:  Data used: Hydric soils (Maryland Dept. of Planning Data), existing wetlands (DNR Wetlands), land use (Maryland Dept. of Planning, 2000).  Identify candidate hydric soil areas based on land use. Hydric soils on open land (agricultural fields, bare ground, etc.) are retained while those underlying natural vegetation and developed lands are excluded.  Explore hydric soils based on land use / land cover and proximity to existing wetlands or streams. The potential wetland restoration sites suggested in the scenario can be filtered further by using more accurate wetlands and soil information, considering land ownership, etc. Additional steps would be beneficial in applying this information such as considering additional criteria like habitat enhancement opportunities, sensitive species protection, targeting specific streams or subwatersheds for intensive restoration, and using Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) information.  57   PROJECTS RELATED TO THE WRAS PROCESS There are numerous projects and programs that have the potential to contribute to successful development and implementation of a Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). The listing included here suggests opportunities for cooperation and coordination that can improve the likelihood of success for the WRAS. This listing is not all-inclusive. It is recommended that this list be augmented as new information becomes available and that followup should continue to promote the WRAS process with these and other projects and programs. 319(h)-Funded Projects The Federal funding source generally known as ""319"" has not been awarded to projects in the Lower Patuxent Watershed during the 1999 through 2002 time frame. Other Projects/Programs This section summarizes projects and programs that have the potential to contribute to development and implementation of the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy that have not been addressed elsewhere in the watershed characterization. 1. Hall Creek Watershed Water Quality Management Plan The focus of this 1994 plan is to an approach to reducing nutrients delivered to Hall Creek. The nutrient loads in the watershed are essential all nonpoint source. Approaches considered include agricultural BMPs retirement of highly erodible lands, urban nutrient management and stormwater management for developed lands, septic system alternatives and growth management approaches. 2. Land Use and Water Quality In Hunting Creek: Research, Education & Outreach This 2002 report presented results of a Calvert County project, funded by US EPA, in cooperation with the Calverton School and the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science Institute for Ecological Economics (UOM).20  Monitoring of three tributaries to Hunting Creek was conducted by Calverton students. Water quality and benthic macroinvertebrate data was collected. Water quality parameters assessed included temperature, salinity, total suspended solids, chlorophyll a, nitrate/nitrite, ammonia and phosphate.  A landscape model for the Hunting Creek watershed was created by UOM to assess water quality impacts of current land use and projected build-out land use based on current zoning. For more information see http://iee.umces.edu/PLM/HUNT  Outreach and education was achieved through a combination of hands-on experience, local cable television reporting, newspaper reporting and an Internet page. 58   Conclusions and recommendations developed in this work appear to be relevant for consideration in the WRAS project:  Avoiding development in stream buffer areas most of the increase in nitrogen load increase can be reduced compared to maximum build-out scenario.  Redesign of septic fields to deliver effluent to the root zone, rather than groundwater, can increase nitrogen retention and improve water quality in estuaries.  Selected land use practices on developed areas trees [or natural vegetation] versus lawns.  Additional research is recommended to better quantify local contribution of nitrogen relative to atmospheric deposition arising from distant sources.  59   POTENTIAL BENCHMARKS FOR WRAS GOAL SETTING Several programs designed to manage water quality and/or living resources have existing or proposed goals that are relevant to setting goals for the Lower Patuxent Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS). The goals from these other programs tend to overlap and run parallel to potential interests for developing WRAS goals. Therefore, to assist in WRAS development, selected goals from other programs are included here as points of reference. Coastal Zone Management  The Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) Initiative is a component of the Cumulative and Secondary Impacts section of the Maryland Coastal Zone Management Program Section 309 Strategy (2000-2005). Watershed strategies are defined as comprehensive plans that will identify areas of concern, monitoring strategies, gaps in information, mitigation options, and restoration and protection opportunities.  WRAS projects funded under Coastal Zone Management must be in Maryland's Coastal Zone and must include a local program change as part of the effort. This could include incorporation into the County Comprehensive Plan, adoption of local implementing tools like zoning ordinances and environmental codes, modification of sensitive areas elements or alterations to Priority Funding Areas. Chesapeake 2000 Agreement The Chesapeake 2000 Agreement (C2K) includes several significant commitments pertaining to local watershed management planning and implementation. The goal in the C2K Agreement that is directly related to the development of watershed management plans and action strategies is ""By 2010, work with local governments, community watershed groups and watershed organizations to develop and implement locally supported watershed management plans in two-thirds of the Bay watershed covered by this Agreement. These plans would address the protection, conservation and restoration of stream corridors, riparian buffers and wetlands for the purposes of improving habitat and water quality, with the collateral benefits for optimizing flow and water supply."" Four common elements of watershed management planning were adopted by the Chesapeake Bay Program member jurisdictions to be applied Bay-wide. Those elements support the WRAS components which were also identified as common Bay-wide criteria for watershed management planning. The four approved C2K watershed planning elements are as follows: 1. Does the plan ""address the protection, conservation and restoration of stream corridors, riparian forest buffers and wetlands?"" Each watershed management plan needs to be based on an assessment of natural resources within the watershed. At a minimum, the assessment will evaluate the condition of stream corridors, riparian buffers and wetlands within the watershed. 2. Does the plan reflect the goals and objectives of ""improving habitat and water quality?"" The plan should reflect the issues that the stakeholders feel are important, and, at a minimum, exhibit a benefit to habitat and water quality within the watershed. 60   The goals should be based on priority issues identified by the watershed assessment. 3. Chesapeake 2000 Watershed Commitments Criterion #3-- Does the plan identify implementation mechanisms? Capacity to implement the plan will be demonstrated by identifying: - What are the specific management actions? - What are the resources necessary for implementation? - Who will implement the plan? - And when will the actions will be implemented? The implementation mechanisms should also incorporate a periodic re-evaluation to ensure the plan is ""living"" and flexible to the changes in the watershed. 4. Does the plan have demonstrated local support? Every effort should be made to demonstrate a diversity of local support. At a minimum, local governments, community groups and watershed organizations should be encouraged to participate in developing and implementing the watershed management plan. Goals from the Clean Water Action Plan 2  Clean Water Goals - Maryland watersheds should meet water quality standards, including numerical criteria as well as narrative standards and designated uses.  Watersheds should achieve healthy conditions as indicated by natural resource indicators related to the condition of the water itself (e.g. water chemistry), aquatic living resources, and physical habitat, as well as landscape factors (e.g. buffered streams and wetland restoration). Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998 - The most significant feature is requiring nutrient management plans for virtually all Maryland farms. The requirement is being phased in over a several year period. - Nitrogen-based plan implementation will be required on all farms beginning December 31, 2001. - Phosphorus-based plan implementation will be required on farms using chemical fertilizer beginning December 31,2002 and on farms using manure or biosolids by July 1, 2005. - Up to 87.5% cost share is available for development of nutrient management plans and up to $20 per ton contribution toward the costs of manure transportation is available. Implementation of projects assisted by this funding has the potential to move nutrients to sites where they are needed.  61   REFERENCES 1. DNR. Internet Site: www.dnr.state.md.us/ .

GX264-73-9515386	"Appendix A  Total Maximum Daily Loads of Nitrogen for Three Tidal Tributaries and Total Maximum Daily Load of Biochemical Oxygen Demand for One Tributary in the Newport Bay System Worcester County, Maryland  DRAFT  November 2002  Document version: November 7, 2002  A1   DRAFT MODELING FRAMEWORK The computational framework chosen for the modeling of water quality in Newport Bay was the Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program version 5.1 (WASP5.1). WASP5.1 is supported and distributed by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Center for Exposure Assessment Modeling (CEAM) in Athens, GA (Ambrose et al, 1993). This program provides a generalized framework for modeling contaminant fate and transport in surface waters (Di Toro et al, 1993) and is based on the finite-segment approach. It is a very versatile program, capable of being applied in a time-variable or steady-state mode, spatial simulation in one, two or three dimensions, and using linear or non-linear estimations of water quality kinetics. To date, WASP5.1 has been employed in many modeling applications that have included river, lake, estuarine and ocean environments. The model has been used to investigate water quality concerns regarding dissolved oxygen (DO), eutrophication, and toxic substances. WASP5.1 has been used in a wide range of applications by regulatory agencies, consulting firms, academic researches, and others. EUTRO5.1 is the component of WASP5.1 that is applicable for modeling eutrophication, incorporating eight water quality constituents in the water column (Figure A1) and sediment bed. The Newport Bay Eutrophication Model (NBEM) based on a EUTRO5.1 model was implemented in a steady-state mode. This mode of using WASP5.1 simulates constant flow and average waterbody volume over the tidal cycle. The tidal mixing is accounted for using dispersion coefficients, which quantify the exchange of water quality constituents between EUTRO5.1 model segments. The model simulates an equilibrium state of the waterbody, which was applied to summer flow, spring flow and the winter flow conditions. These cases are described in more detail below. WATER QUALITY MONITORING All readily available information was considered in this TMDL analysis. Several sources of recent water quality data were particularly useful in supporting the model calibration: Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) (1998), Department of Natural Resources (DNR) (19981999), Maryland Coastal Bays Program (MCBP) (1997-2000), and National Park Service (NPKS) (1991-1999). MDE's Field Operations Program staff collected physical and chemical samples in the spring and the summer of 1998. The physical parameters, DO, salinity, conductivity, and water temperature were measured in situ at each water quality monitoring station. Grab samples were also collected for laboratory analysis. The samples were collected at a depth of 0.5 m from the surface. Samples were placed in plastic bottles and preserved on ice until they were delivered to the University of Maryland Laboratory in Solomons, MD, or the Department of Health & Mental Hygiene in Baltimore, MD for analysis. The field and laboratory protocols used to collect and process the samples are summarized in Table A1 (MDE, April 2001). The DNR data was collected as part of their Pfisteria monitoring program. The laboratory protocols are similar to those used by MDE. The MCBP maintains a volunteer monitoring program. The sampling and laboratory protocols used by the MCBP are explained in ""Coastal  Document version: November 7, 2002  A2   DRAFT Bays Volunteer Monitoring Program, Water Quality Monitoring Manual Maryland Coastal Bays Program, 1997."" The NPKS maintains a monitoring program in coordination with DNR's Pfisteria network, shellfish program and the brown tide program, and its protocol is similar to those used by MDE. Table A2 shows the sampling dates for the data sets from the four programs. Figure A2 shows the locations of the sampling stations. Figures A3  A7 show the high flow and low flow data for chlorophyll a, DO, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, dissolved inorganic phosphorus, and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) (low flow only, no BOD data was collected during high flow). The eutrophication model is calibrated for both high flow and low flow periods. Temporal and spatial data availability as well as temperature and flow measurements were examined to determine the appropriate data to include as part of each calibration. Comprehensive data, that covered both tidal and non-tidal waters, was limited to 1998. Due to this limited data availability, the time period chosen for each of the calibrations focused on this time period. MDE and DNR both collected data in the tributaries that drain to Newport Bay. The MCBP and NPKS both collected near-shore samples for the bay. The model used for Newport Bay is a steady-state depth averaged model, with relatively large segments. The high flow calibration of the model was performed with data from April of 1998 (MDE 4/15, 4/22, 4/29; DNR 4/29; NPKS 1/20, 2/9, 3/13, 4/13, 12/16). The low flow calibration of the model was performed with data from July, August, September and October1998 (MDE 8/12, 9/2; DNR 7/1, 7/28, 8/26, 9/30, 10/21; MCBP 6/17  9/24; NPS 5/22  9/14). INPUT REQUIREMENTS 1  Model Segmentation and Geometry The spatial domain of the NBEM includes Newport Bay, Kitts Branch, Trappe Creek, Ayer Creek, and Newport Creek. The domain extends from the confluence of Sinupuxent Bay to the upper reaches of Kitts Branch, covering all the point sources in the Newport Bay System. Following a review of the bathymetry for Newport Bay, the system was divided into 27 segments. Figure A8 shows the model segmentation (modeling domain) of the NBEM. Figure A8 also shows the subwatershed segmentation for the Newport Bay watershed. Table A3 lists the segment volumes and depths of the 27 segments. Table A4 lists the characteristic lengths and interfacial areas between segment pairs. Dispersion Coefficients The dispersion coefficients were calibrated using the EUTRO5.1 model and in-stream salinity data from 1998. The WASP5.1 model was set up to simulate salinity. As a conservative substance, there are no changes in concentration due to chemical or biological reactions in the water. Thus, concentration is solely determined by mixing. The only sources in the system are 1 The WASP model requires all input data to be in metric units, and to be consistent with the model, all data in the Appendix will appear in metric units except the river length. Following are several conversion factors to aid in the comparison of numbers in the main document: mgd x (0.0438) = m3/s | cfs x (0.0283) = m3/s | lb / (2.2) = kg | mg/l x mgd x (8.34) / (2.2) = kg/d  Document version: November 7, 2002  A3   DRAFT at the tidal boundaries. For the model execution, salinity values at all boundaries except the tidal boundaries were set to zero. As discussed above, the NBEM was calibrated for two sets of flow conditions, high flow and low flow. Estimated point and nonpoint source flows for the appropriate flow conditions were included as part of the calibration of the dispersion coefficients. The method used to calibrate the dispersion coefficients is described in more detail below. Figure A9 shows the results of the calibration of the dispersion coefficients for high flow and low flow. The same sets of dispersion coefficients were used for both the high flow and low flow calibrations of the model. The final values of the dispersion coefficients are listed in Table A4. Freshwater Flows In 1998, the model calibration period, there were no active U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gages in the Newport Bay watershed. It was necessary to estimate flows for the ""high"" flow sampling period (spring), and the ""low"" flow period (late summer-early fall). These were estimated using an area to flow ratio approach described below. It should be noted that the term ""high flow"" in this context corresponds to the relatively higher flows observed in spring, and not to rare flood conditions. The drainage basin was subdivided into 10 subwatersheds (Figure A8). A ratio of flow to area was determined for each subwatershed to estimate the flow from each. The flow to area ratio was calculated based on flow data from the nearby USGS gaging station 01485000 on the Pocomoke River near Willards, Maryland. The flow ratio, corresponding to ""high"" (spring-time) flows, was calculated by averaging daily mean stream flow data from April 1 to April 30, 1998, and dividing by the gaged watershed area. The low flow ratio was calculated by averaging daily mean discharge data from July 1 to September 30, 1998, and dividing by the gaged watershed area. Additional sets of flow for 7Q10 conditions, spring flow conditions and winter flow conditions were calculated for use in the model scenarios. An average flow ratio was calculated using the same method as for high and low flow, using discharge data from December 1950 to December 1998. Table A5 presents the flows from each subwatershed for high, low, 7Q10, spring and winter flow conditions. Again, the term ""high flow"" corresponds to the relatively higher flows that occurred in spring 1998, rather than to high flows from a long-term flow record. In fact, as seen in Table A5, the 1998 ""high"" flow is estimated to correspond closely to the long-term average flow or spring flow. Table A6 presents the contributing subwatersheds and flows to various water quality segments of the Newport bay model. Point Source Loadings Sources Considered Six point sources were considered in the TMDL analyses. These are the Berlin Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) (MD0022632), Newark WWTP (MD0020630), Kelly Foods Corporation (MD0001309), Tyson Foods Inc. (MD0002071), Ocean City Ice and Seafood  Document version: November 7, 2002  A4   DRAFT (MD0055107), and Berlin Shopping Center (MD0024911). Berlin Shopping Center is now closed; however, it was considered for the calibration of the model, as it existed during the calibration period. Ocean City Ice and Seafood does not discharge any nutrient loads to the system, but its flow effect has been considered for the modeling purposes. Kelly Foods Corp. is a year-round source, but contributes very little nutrient load to the system. Newark WWTP discharges to the open bay section of the model through a small tributary called Marshall Creek, its effect on the bay itself is minimal, and there is no data collected by MDE to investigate any significant impact of this source to Marshall Creek itself. Recent DNR samplings have revealed DO and algal problems in Marshall Creek. The issue related with this point source will be dealt with at a later date when adequate samplings are available. Only the Berlin WWTP and Tyson Foods, Inc. are major point sources to be considered in the model for significant impact in the development of the model. Summary of Point Sources Considered Point Source Name Berlin Shopping Center WWTP Berlin WWTP Kelly Foods Corp. Ocean City Ice and Seafood Newark WWTP Tyson Foods, Inc. Modeling Disposition Considered only for the calibration purposes Major source Minor source Only flow effect considered Minor source Major source Discharge/Capacity (mgd) 0.003 0.6  0.75, current flow 0.006 0.0015 0.07 0.6 - 0.8, current flow  Model Calibration Consideration of Point Sources The Berlin WWTP discharges to Trappe Creek through a small tributary called Bottle Branch (model segment 12). Kelly Foods Corp. and Tyson Foods, Inc. both discharge directly to Kitts Branch (model segments 16 and 18 respectively). The flow from Ocean City Ice and Seafood is considered for the modeling purposes as an input to Trappe Creek through Bottle Branch (model segment 12). The Newark WWTP discharges to the open portion of Newport Bay through a small branch called the Marshall Creek (model segment 2). In 1998, the calibration period, these point sources were jointly contributing about 54,818 lbs/yr of nitrogen and 2,251 lbs/yr of phosphorus to the Newport Bay System. The point source flows and nutrient loadings from all the contributing sources used for the model calibration were calculated from 1998 discharge monitoring reports (DMR) data stored in MDE's Point Source Database (MDE, 2002). The DMR data was supplemented with the comprehensive data provided by John Lister of Tyson Foods Inc. and Randy Danny from the MDE Eastern Shore Field Office. Specifically, the data from April 1998 was used for the high flow calibration of the model. An average of discharge data from July, August, and September of 1998 was used for the low flow calibration of the model. These data are summarized in Table A7.  Document version: November 7, 2002  A5   DRAFT Model Scenario Consideration of Point Sources Due to the nature of Newport Bay and changes in the point source operations during different seasons, scenarios are grouped in three categories according to the flow regimes: winter flow (November - March); spring flow (April-May); and summer flow (June  October). For all these flow condition categories, the TMDL analyses consider two primary scenarios: baseline scenarios and TMDL scenarios. Briefly, the baseline scenario for low and average flow conditions simulates a type of no-action situation. Point source flows and loads are increased to planned values with current or anticipated point source treatment technologies. Relatively current land use and nonpoint source loads are simulated, and associated bottom sediment properties are used (e.g., sediment nutrient flux). The TMDL scenarios simulate conditions that correspond to the maximum allowable loads. Municipal Discharges: For municipal WWTPs, the baseline scenarios typically assume approved maximum sewer plan flows, and loads that are consistent with planned treatment, and the season simulated by the particular scenario. Berlin Shopping Center is a discontinued source so it is not considered in any of the scenario runs. For the Newark WWTP, the maximum flow and loads were used in both the baseline and the TMDL scenarios for all the flow conditions except summer flow month, when it does not discharge to the bay. Berlin WWTP only discharges during the winter flow month (discharge permitted from November through March only). For the Berlin WWTP, discharge flow of 1.0 mgd was used for both the winter baseline and the winter TMDL scenarios. Table A14 shows the values of other parameters used in all the baseline scenarios for all Municipal Sources. These loads are further summarized in a technical memorandum, which accompanies this TMDL, entitled ""Significant Nutrient and Biochemical Oxygen Demand Point and Nonpoint Sources in the Newport Bay System."" Industrial Discharges: The maximum flow volumes for discharges of industrial effluents directly to waters of the State are not established in local water and sewer plans. Rather, they are established on the basis of need and other considerations. Kelly Foods Corp. (a small point source) has very little effect on the model outputs; therefore, for all the baseline and TMDL scenario runs, this source has been considered at its maximum flow and concentrations. As mentioned earlier, a flow output for Ocean City Ice and Seafood has been considered for all the baseline and the TMDL scenarios. Tyson Foods, Inc. is one significant source that controls almost all of the summer flow and the spring flow output results and the major proportion of the winter flow output result. For both the baseline and TMDL scenarios in the analyses, the Tyson Foods Inc.flow has been considered to be 0.8 mgd. In the baseline scenario the maximum permitted loads for controlled parameters and performing concentrations, loads for non-permitted parameters were used. Table A14 shows the values of other parameters used in all the baseline scenarios for all industrial sources. The TMDL scenario loads were based on the goals set up for the TMDL. Since the Berlin WWTP (a major source of the TMDL analysis) does not discharge during the summer and spring months, a consideration was given to the carryover effect of the Berlin discharge during winter to  Document version: November 7, 2002  A6   DRAFT the summer and spring months scenario runs. Nutrient fluxes and sediment oxygen demand were adjusted to reflect the changes. These parameters were also adjusted for the reduction of loads for the TMDL. Thus, a key difference between the baseline scenarios and TMDL scenarios, were reductions in sediment nutrient fluxes, and SOD that reflect reduced loads from both the carryover effect, if any, and reductions proposed for point and nonpoint sources. The point source discharges simulated in the TMDL scenarios are summarized in a technical memorandum, which accompanies this TMDL, entitled ""Significant Nutrient and Biochemical Oxygen Demand Point and Nonpoint Sources in the Newport Bay System."" Nonpoint Source Loadings Nonpoint source loads were estimated for observed 1998 ""high flow"", observed 1998 ""low flow"", and spring and winter loading conditions. The surface water nonpoint source loads for high flow and low flow conditions were estimated as the product of observed water quality concentrations and the nonpoint source flows estimated as described above. Data from station XCM1562 was used as a boundary condition for segment 1 of the NBEM. The boundary conditions for the remaining non-tidal boundaries (except segments 12 through 19 during high flow) were based on data from station BMC0011. This is the only free-flowing station in the watershed and it was assumed to be a reasonable representation of background water quality in the watershed. Since the station BMC0011 represents mostly a mix of the agriculture and the forest landuses, the average annual load for segments 12 through 19 was used for high flow calibration to represent the predominantly urban watershed segments draining to these water quality segments. BOD data was not available for high flow, and was assumed to be 2.0 mg/l at all boundaries. The observed concentrations account for surface nonpoint source loads from all land uses, loads from septic tanks, atmospheric deposition to the land's surface, and base-flow groundwater loads. An additional nonpoint source load due to direct atmospheric deposition to the water surface was added to both the high flow and low flow nonpoint source loads used in the calibration of the model. Direct groundwater discharge was included in both the high flow and the low flow calibration of the model. The nonpoint source loads used in the high flow and the low flow calibrations of the model for nitrogen and phosphorus can be seen in Table A8 and Table A9, respectively. The average annual NPS load estimate was used in both the spring and winter baseline scenarios, and serves as a starting point in determining an estimate of the reduction needed to meet the winter and the spring flow TMDL goals. The average annual loading rates used for the NBEM was derived from the UMCES study ""Maryland's Coastal Bays: An Assessment of Aquatic Ecosystems, Pollutant Loadings, and Management Options."" A detail of the selection of UMCES study as the best option for calculating loading rates in the State's Coastal Bay Region (including Newport Bay) is described in Appendix A of ""Total Maximum Daily Loads of Nitrogen and Phosphorus for Five Tidal Tributaries in the Northern Coastal Bays System Worcester County, Maryland."" Land use loading rates were derived from the UMCES study described above and applied to the land uses in Newport Bay using a area unit loading rate approach. The land use in Newport Bay  Document version: November 7, 2002  A7   DRAFT was calculated based on 1997 Maryland Department of Planning data, and included an adjustment to cropland acres using 1997 Farm Service Agency (FSA) data. The average annual nonpoint source load was calculated for each of the different loading rate options by summing all of the individual land use areas and multiplying by the corresponding land use loading coefficients. The average annual loading rates used in the final analysis reflect loads coming from urban development, agriculture, and forestland. An additional nonpoint source load due to direct atmospheric deposition to the water surface was included, as well as a load due to direct groundwater discharge. The atmospheric deposition load was calculated by multiplying the surface area of each water quality segment by a loading coefficient. The atmospheric loading coefficient was based on the atmospheric deposition monitoring station MD18, Assateague Island National Seashore  Woodcock established by National Atmospheric Deposition Program. The direct groundwater loads included in both the high flow and average annual loads were estimated based on methods described in the USGS report ""Ground-Water Discharge and Nitrate Loadings to the Coastal Bays of Maryland"" (Dillow and Greene, 1999). The direct discharge to Newport Bay was separated out from the total by Jonathan Dillow (USGS). The total annual direct discharge load was then distributed to the water quality segments based on the watershed contribution to the individual segments. The direct groundwater load is assumed to account for loads from septic tanks among other sources. The average spring and winter total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads are presented in Table A10 and Table A11, respectively. For all nonpoint source inputs, the concentrations of the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus are modeled in their speciated forms. The WASP5.1 model simulates nitrogen as ammonia (NH3), nitrate and nitrite (NO23), and organic nitrogen (ON); and phosphorus as ortho-phosphate (PO4) and organic phosphorus (OP). Ammonia, nitrate and nitrite, and ortho-phosphate represent the dissolved forms of nitrogen and phosphorus. The dissolved forms of nutrients are more readily available for biological processes such as algae growth, which can affect chlorophyll a levels and DO concentrations. The ratios of total nutrients to dissolved nutrients used in the model scenarios represent values that have been measured in the field. Environmental Conditions Eight environmental parameters were used for developing the model of Newport Bay. They are solar radiation, photoperiod, temperature (T), extinction coefficient (Ke), salinity, sediment oxygen demand (SOD), sediment ammonium flux (FNH4), and sediment phosphate flux (FPO4) (Table A12). The light extinction coefficient, Ke in the water column was derived from Secchi depth measurements using the following equation: Ke = where: 1.95 Ds  Document version: November 7, 2002  A8   DRAFT Ke = light extinction coefficient (m-1) Ds = Secchi depth (m) Varying SOD, FNH4, and FPO4 values were used for different sections of the NBEM segmentation, where ""F"" indicates these are due to sediment fluxes. Initial values were taken from the Northern Coastal Bay TMDL model and adjusted through the calibration process. Several studies, data sets, and literature sources were reviewed to determine appropriate ranges of values for use with the model: Cerco et al., 1994; Seitzinger and DeKorsey, 1994; Sampou, 1994; Mirsajadi, 2000; UMCES, 1999; Institute of Natural Resources, 1986; and Thomann and Mueller, 1987. All values used in the model are within reasonable ranges predicted to occur in the Newport Bay. In general, lower nutrient flux and SOD values occurred in the open bays, while higher values were assumed in the upper reaches of the tributaries. During the high flow period, cooler temperatures and reduced biological activity reduce the expected nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes from the sediment. Thus, during the high flow period, the simulated ammonium flux and the ortho-phosphate flux were reduced by 75%. Nonliving organic nutrient components and phytoplankton settle from the water column into the sediment at various rates throughout the system. In general, it is reasonable to assume that 50% of the nonliving organics are in the particulate form. Such assignments were borne out through model sensitivity analyses and were within the range of literature value. Kinetic Coefficients The water column kinetic coefficients are universal constants used in the NBEM model. They are formulated to characterize the kinetic interactions among the water quality constituents. The initial values were taken from the eutrophication model developed in the State's Northern Coastal Bay System. Kinetic coefficients from past modeling studies of Potomac River (Clark and Roesh, 1978; Thomann and Fitzpatrick, 1982; Cerco, 1985), and of Mattawoman Creek (Haire and Panday, 1985; Panday and Haire, 1986; Domotor et al., 1987), and the Patuxent River (Lung, 1993) were also reviewed. The final kinetic coefficients are listed in Table A13. Initial Conditions The initial conditions used in the model were chosen to reflect the observed values as closely as possible. However, because the model simulation was run for a long period of time before it reached equilibrium, it was found that the final results are independent of initial conditions. CALIBRATION & SENSITIVITY ANALYSES The NBEM model for low flow was calibrated with July, August and September 1998 data. The NBEM was also calibrated for a high flow period with April 1998 data. Tables A6, A7, and A8 show the point source and nonpoint source flows and loads associated with the input files used for the calibrations of the model (See Point Source Loadings and Nonpoint Source Loadings above). Figure A10 shows the results of the low flow calibration of the model for the mainstem and the minor tributaries of Newport Bay. The model has captured the trend of almost all of the  Document version: November 7, 2002  A9   DRAFT state variables with the emphasis on DO to capture the lower range. Ammonia near the middle section near segment 12 seems to be lower, but overall the trend is represented. Figure A11 shows the model results for the high flow calibration of the mainstem and the minor tributaries of Newport Bay. All the major variables are captured well. Along with the calibration of the high flow and low flow conditions, a series of sensitivity analyses were conducted to analyze the model response to various nutrient loading conditions. The model was found to be responsive to the loads as expected. A comprehensive set of model runs showed that for all seasonal flow and loading conditions the model was limited for change in nitrogen loading. The low flow condition, dominated by the flow from Tyson Foods, Inc., showed that the model was sensitive to change in phosphorus loading at a very low level of phosphorus input. SYSTEM RESPONSE The EUTRO5.1 model of Newport Bay was applied to several different nonpoint source loading conditions under various stream flow conditions as described earlier to project the impacts of nutrients on algal production (chlorophyll a), and DO. By simulating various stream flows, the analysis accounts for seasonality. Model Run Descriptions The first scenario represents baseline conditions of the stream during summer (low flow). The baseline scenario simulates a type of no-action situation, thus providing a stable point of comparison with the TMDL scenario. Point source flows and loads are increased to maximum planned values under current or anticipated point source treatment technologies. Relatively current land use and nonpoint source loads are simulated, and associated bottom sediment properties are simulated. In this case, the 7Q10 flows were used to present critical conditions during the summer. The flows were estimated using a regression analysis as described above (Table A6). The total nonpoint source loads were computed as the product of observed 1998 base-flow concentrations and the estimated critical low flow with additional loads included to account for direct atmospheric deposition to the water's surface, and the direct groundwater discharge. Because the loads are based on observed concentrations, they account for all natural and human-induced sources. The point source loads were increased to reflect maximum possible loading conditions under existing or draft permits. The maximum load at Tyson Foods, Inc. was calculated based on the highest loading pattern throughout the year (0.8 mgd), as there is currently no flow limit on the plant. The maximum load at Kelly Foods Corp. was calculated by multiplying the plant's maximum capacity flow by its current National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitted concentrations and the reported concentrations for those parameters, which do not have permit values. Flow inputs from Ocean City Ice and Seafood were used as described earlier. All the municipal sources in the basin do not discharge during the summer flow months. The point source loads for Scenario 1 are presented in Table A14. All the environmental parameters and kinetic coefficients established by the low flow calibration of the model remained the same for Scenario 1.  Document version: November 7, 2002  A10   DRAFT  The second scenario represents the baseline conditions of the stream during the spring flow months. The baseline scenario simulates a type of no-action situation, thus providing a stable point of comparison with the TMDL scenario. Point source flows and loads are increased to maximum planned values under current or anticipated point source treatment technologies. Relatively current land use and nonpoint source loads are simulated, and associated bottom sediment properties are assumed. The average annual flows and nonpoint source loads were calculated as described above. The nonpoint source loads included direct groundwater discharge and direct atmospheric deposition to the water's surface. The nonpoint source loads are presented in Table A10. The point source flows for Tyson Foods, Inc. and Kelly Foods Corp. remained the same as in the Scenario 1. The loads were changed to reflect the annual plant load discharge and permitted load discharge. Berlin WWTP loads were not considered, as it does not discharge during the spring months. Flow from the Newark WWTP was considered. Loads were calculated based on the current flows and loads reflecting permitted conditions. The point source loads used in Scenario 2 can be seen in Table A14. The method used to estimate average annual nitrogen and phosphorus loads did not include estimations of DO, chlorophyll a, and BOD boundary loads. The missing values for loadings (BOD, CHLa, DO) were assumed to be the same as for the low flow condition. The kinetic coefficients remained the same as for Scenario 1. The environmental parameters, except the temperature, remained the same as Scenario 1. Temperature was changed to reflect average temperature during the spring months (Table A15). The higher solar radiation and temperature during this period represent conservative assumptions as a margin of safety. The third scenario represents the baseline conditions of the stream during the winter flow months. As explained earlier, the baseline scenario simulates a type of no-action situation, thus providing a stable point of comparison with the TMDL scenario. Point source flows and loads were increased to maximum planned values under current or anticipated point source treatment technologies. Relatively current land use and nonpoint source loads are simulated, and associated bottom sediment properties are assumed. The average annual flows and nonpoint source loads were calculated as described above. The nonpoint source loads included direct groundwater discharge and direct atmospheric deposition to the water surface. The nonpoint source loads are presented in Table A11. The point source flows and the loads for Tyson Foods, Inc., Kelly Foods Corp. and Newark WWTP remained the same as in the Scenario 2. The Berlin WWTP loads were considered at its requested expansion of the plant (1.0 mgd). Loads were calculated based on the current flow and loads reflecting permitted conditions. The point source loads used in Scenario 3 can be seen in Table A14. The method used to estimate average annual nitrogen and phosphorus loads did not include estimations of DO, chlorophyll a, and BOD boundary loads. The missing values for loadings (BOD, CHLa, DO) were assumed to be the same as for the high flow condition. The kinetic coefficients remained the same as for Scenario 1. The environmental parameters temperature, fraction of daylight, and solar radiation represent a critical condition in the month of March (Table A15). The higher solar radiation and temperature during this period represent conservative assumptions as a margin of safety.  Document version: November 7, 2002  A11   DRAFT  The TMDL scenarios (Scenario 4, Scenario 5, and Scenario 6) were the result of a number of iterative model scenarios involving nutrient reductions that were explored to determine the maximum allowable loads. The fourth, fifth and sixth scenarios yield the water quality response for the maximum allowable loads for summer flow, spring flow, and winter flow, respectively. Model sensitivity analyses were performed to ascertain whether the model predicted nitrogen or phosphorus to limit algal growth during the different flow regimes. Under low flow conditions, the model was found to be sensitive to either reduction in phosphorus or nitrogen, indicating a phosphorus-limited/nitrogen-limited system depending on the situation of the loadings. The flow from Tyson Foods, Inc. controls the nutrient limiting situation as the contribution from the nonpoint source is not that significant to switch the limitation. Under spring and winter flow conditions, the model was not sensitive to reductions in phosphorus, indicating a nitrogen-limited system. These model findings are consistent with nutrient limitation analyses based on the water quality data. The Berlin WWTP does not discharge during warmer months (i.e., summer and spring flow months). An adjustment was made on the bottom sediment fluxes to account for the no flow effect from this plant. Kelly Foods Corp., a very small source, was not reduced for the TMDL scenario. The Newark WWTP was also set to its current level of discharge as there were not much sampling points to do a detailed analysis for localized problem. Sediment fluxes were also decreased proportionally in relation to nonpoint and point source load reductions for each scenario. A method was developed to estimate the reductions in nutrient fluxes and SOD from the sediment layer. First, an initial estimate was made of the total organic nitrogen and organic phosphorus settling to the river bottom, from particulate nutrient organics, living algae, and phaeophytin, in each segment. This was done by running the baseline scenario once with estimated settling of organics and chlorophyll a, then again with no settling. The difference in the organic matter between the two runs was assumed to settle to the river bottom, where it would be available as a source of nutrient flux and SOD. All phaeophytin was assumed to settle to the bottom. The amount of phaeophytin was estimated from in-stream water quality data. To calculate the organic loads from the algae, it was assumed that the nitrogen to chlorophyll a ratio was 6.25, and the phosphorus to chlorophyll a ratio was 0.625. This analysis was then repeated for the reduced nutrient loading conditions. The percentage difference between the amount of nutrients that settled in the expected condition scenarios and the amount that settled in the reduced loading scenarios was then applied to the nutrient fluxes in each segment. The reduced nutrient scenarios were then run again with the updated fluxes, with a new value of settled organics and new fluxes calculated. The process was repeated several times, until the reduced fluxes remained constant. Along with reductions in nutrient fluxes from the sediments, when the nutrient loads to the system are reduced, the sediment oxygen demand was also reduced (US EPA, 1997). It was assumed that the SOD would be reduced in the same proportion as the reduction in nitrogen fluxes. Simulated reductions in nutrients affect the initial concentrations of chlorophyll a in the fresh water flows at the model's boundaries. To estimate the chlorophyll a reductions, the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus available for algae growth was calculated based on reduced nutrient  Document version: November 7, 2002  A12   DRAFT loads. The maximum possible amount of chlorophyll a that could be grown was calculated twice, once assuming nitrogen was the limiting nutrient, and again assuming phosphorus was the limiting nutrient. The lower of two values was compared to the baseline scenario boundary value for chlorophyll a, and the lower of these three values was then taken to be the boundary for average flow based on principles of nutrient limitations. The NBEM calculates the daily average DO concentrations in the stream. This is not necessarily protective of water quality when one considers the effects of diurnal DO variation due to photosynthesis and respiration of algae. The photosynthetic process centers about the chlorophyll a containing algae, which utilize radiant energy from the sun to convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose, and release oxygen. Because the photosynthetic process is dependent on solar radiant energy, the production of oxygen proceeds only during daylight hours. Concurrently with this production, however, the algae require oxygen for respiration, which can be considered to proceed continuously. Minimum values of DO usually occur in the early morning predawn hours when the algae have been without light for the longest period of time. Maximum values of DO usually occur in the early afternoon. The diurnal range (maximum minus minimum) may be large. If the daily mean level of DO is low, minimum values of DO during a day may approach zero and create a potential for fish kill. A 1998 study performed on the Pocomoke, captured 24-hour DO measurements from May through September (Boynton and Burger, 1999). This study found that the magnitude of diurnal change in the Pocomoke River was typical of other Chesapeake Bay tributaries, amounting on average to about 2.0 mg/l-day for chlorophyll a concentration ranging from 50-100 g/l and 0.5 mg/l-day for chlorophyll a concentration averaging 25 g/l. Using this as a guideline, the following scenarios include an additional 1.0 mg/l margin of safety to protect for the diurnal variation of DO in the areas of high algal concentration and a 0.3 mg/l margin of safety to protect for the diurnal variation of DO in the areas where the algal concentration averages around 25 g/l. Thus, the goal for the final scenarios will be a DO concentration of 6 mg/l and 5.3 mg/l, respectively. The fourth scenario represents improved conditions associated with the maximum allowable loads to the stream during critical low flow (Summer Flow TMDL Scenario). The stream flows, and nonpoint source loads from which reductions were estimated, were the same as baseline Scenario 1. All of the environmental parameters (except sediment nutrient fluxes and SOD) and kinetic coefficients used for the calibration of the model remained the same as baseline Scenario 1. The nonpoint source load of total nitrogen from runoff was reduced by 45% and the direct atmospheric deposition load of nitrogen to the water's surface was reduced by 20%. It is reasonable to estimate that the direct nitrogen atmospheric deposition loads can be reduced by 20% due to anticipated actions under the Clean Air Act. This is consistent with reductions in the ""TMDL Analysis for Indian River, Indian River Bay, and Rehoboth Bay, Delaware (December, 1998)."" The point source loads reflect maximum flow expected from the plant. The point source concentration was reduced for nitrogen to 3.5 mg/l for Tyson Foods, Inc. All other sources remained at the same level as the baseline Scenario 2. More information about point source loads can be found in the technical memorandum entitled ""Significant Nutrient and Biochemical  Document version: November 7, 2002  A13   DRAFT Oxygen Demand Point and Nonpoint Sources in the Newport Bay System,"" and in the section entitled INPUT REQUIREMENTS above. The sediment fluxes were adjusted for reduced nonpoint and point source loading condition as mentioned above and the SOD was adjusted accordingly to reflect the changes of fluxes. In addition to implicit margins of safety discussed below, an explicit margin of safety was included in this scenario. It was computed as 5% of the allowable nonpoint source and direct atmospheric deposition loads. The fifth scenario represents improved conditions associated with the maximum allowable loads to the stream during spring flow (Spring Flow TMDL Scenario). Under spring flow conditions; the algal growth is nitrogen limited. The stream flows and nonpoint source loads from which reductions were estimated were the same as baseline Scenario 2. All the environmental parameters (except nutrient fluxes and SOD) and kinetic coefficients used for the calibration of the model remained the same as Scenario 2. The nonpoint source load of total nitrogen from runoff loads were reduced by 45% in the Newport Bay System except Bottle Branch section where a reduction of 55% was made. In addition, the direct atmospheric deposition of nitrogen to the water's surface was reduced by 20% under the assumption that the load reductions will occur throughout the year. Sediment fluxes were reduced based on the method described above. The point source loads reflect maximum flow expected from the plant. The point source concentration was reduced for nitrogen to 8 mg/l for Tyson Foods, Inc. All other sources stayed at the same level as baseline Scenario 2. More information about point source loads can be found in the technical memorandum entitled ""Significant Nutrient and Biochemical Oxygen Demand Point and Nonpoint Sources in the Newport Bay System,"" and in the section entitled INPUT REQUIREMENTS above. In addition to implicit margins of safety discussed below, an explicit margin of safety was included in this scenario. It was computed as 5% of the allowable nonpoint source and direct atmospheric deposition loads. The sixth scenario represents improved conditions associated with the maximum allowable loads to the stream during high flow (High Flow TMDL Scenario). Under high flow conditions, the algal growth is nitrogen limited. The stream flows, and nonpoint source loads from which reductions were estimated, were the same as baseline Scenario 3. All the environmental parameters (except nutrient fluxes and SOD) and kinetic coefficients used for the calibration of the model remained the same as Scenario 3. The nonpoint source load of total nitrogen from runoff was reduced by 45% and the direct atmospheric deposition load of nitrogen to the water's surface was reduced by 20%. It is reasonable to estimate that the direct nitrogen atmospheric deposition loads can be reduced by 20% due to anticipated actions under the Clean Air Act. This is consistent with reductions in the  Document version: November 7, 2002  A14   DRAFT ""TMDL analysis for Indian River, Indian River Bay, and Rehoboth Bay, Delaware (December, 1998)."" The point source loads reflect maximum flow expected from the plant. The point source concentration was reduced for nitrogen to 18 mg/l for Tyson Foods, Inc. and 24 mg/l for the Berlin WWTP. All other sources stayed at the same level as baseline Scenario 3. More information about point source loads can be found in the technical memorandum entitled ""Significant Nutrient and Biochemical Oxygen Demand Point and Nonpoint Sources in the Newport Bay System,"" and in the section entitled INPUT REQUIREMENTS above. In addition to implicit margins of safety discussed below, an explicit margin of safety was included in this scenario. It was computed as 5% of the allowable nonpoint source and direct atmospheric deposition loads. Scenario Results Baseline Scenarios: 1. Summer Flow (Scenario 1): Simulates critical low stream flow conditions during summer season. Surface water quality parameters (e.g., nutrient concentrations) are based on 1998 observed data. Additional loads due to direct atmospheric deposition and from the direct groundwater discharge are also included. Point source loads are based on expected flow from the plant and the current operating conditions. 2. Spring Flow (Scenario 2): Simulates spring flow conditions, with average annual nonpoint source loads estimated on the basis of 1997 land use, and unit area nutrient loading rates (UMCES, 1993). Point source loads are based on expected flow from the plant and the current operating conditions for the annual condition. 3. Winter Flow (Scenario 3): Simulates winter flow conditions, with average annual nonpoint source loads estimated on the basis of 1997 land use, and unit area nutrient loading rates (UMCES, 1993). Point source loads are based on expected flow from the plant and the current operating conditions for the annual condition. The three baseline scenarios represent the conditions when water quality is impaired by high chlorophyll a levels, and low DO concentrations. The results for Scenario 1, Scenario 2, and Scenario 3 can be seen in Figures A12 through A14, respectively. In Scenario 1 (for low flow conditions), the peak chlorophyll a level is around the value of 110 g/l in the Trappe Creek, which is above the goal of 50 g/l. The DO level in the Trappe Creek along with Ayer Creek, Newport Creek and Newport Bay are below the analysis threshold of 6.0 mg/l and 5.3 mg/l. Recall that the threshold of 6.0 mg/l is used to account for diurnal variations in DO, where chlorophyll a concentrations range from 50-100 g/l and 5.3 mg/l where the average concentration is below 25 g/l.  Document version: November 7, 2002  A15   DRAFT Scenario 2 (for spring flow conditions), shows high chlorophyll a values in the Trappe Creek, with values exceeding 107 g/l. The DO levels are also below the analysis threshold of 6.0 mg/l throughout the Newport Bay, Newport Creek and Ayer Creek. Scenario 3 (for winter flow conditions), shows high chlorophyll a values in the Trappe Creek, with values exceeding 61 g/l. The DO is above the analysis threshold of 6.0 mg/l throughout the Newport Bay System. Future Condition TMDL Scenarios: 4. Summer Flow (Scenario 4): Simulates the future condition of maximum allowable loads for critical low stream flow conditions during summer season. 5. Spring Flow (Scenario 5): Simulates the future condition of maximum allowable loads for spring stream flow conditions. 6. Winter Flow (Scenario 6): Simulates the future condition of maximum allowable loads for winter stream flow conditions. The results of the scenarios indicate that the water quality targets for DO and chlorophyll a are satisfied at all locations within the Newport Bay System under consideration in the analysis. The results of Scenario 4 are presented in Figure A12. The results show the standards have been met throughout the bay system under consideration in the analyses. The results of Scenario 5 and Scenario 6 are presented in Figures A13 and A14, respectively. With the desired load reduction as mentioned above, the water quality standards are met throughout the Newport Bay System.

The effect of Newark WWTP on Newport Bay is not discernable. Consequently, loads from Newark WWTP are being addressed in this analysis as part of the upstream background NPS load to Newport Bay that comes from Marshall Creek. Newark WWTP will be addressed explicitly when a future analysis is conducted for Marshall Creek. It should be noted that current permit requirements for Newark WWTP include zero allowable discharge for the months of June through August.

In 1988, flows were increased to approximately       13 mgd. Annual average flows remained slightly under 13 mgd until 1994.       Since 1995, flows have been approaching the 20-mgd permitted capacity.       Today the city anticipates increasing the permitted capacity to 35 mgd.         With more than a decade of operational data as evidence, the Orlando       Easterly Wetlands has demonstrated that reclaimed water can successfully       be used to restore wetlands and recreate wildlife habitat. For this       reason, the State of Florida considers it to be a beneficial reuse system       in the Florida Department of Environmental Protection’s Reuse Inventory.       Average concentration of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) as       reclaimed water has remained consistently below permit limits of 2.31 mg/L       TN and 0.20 River, and a considerable improvement over the quality of       agricultural runoff from the site prior to its transformation into a       wetland. Samples are collected in the river upstream and downstream of the       Orlando Easterly Wetlands.         With a wetland system in place and outstanding water quality       established, the city has concentrated on enhancing the wildlife habitat       aspects of its wetlands project. Nearly two-thirds of the Orlando Easterly       Wetlands project was designed to encourage and maximize wildlife usage.       The mixed marsh area is managed to maintain open water areas and to       prevent encroachment of nuisance vegetation. A 90-acre lake located in the       area planted with hardwood swamp species also enhances wildlife habitat.         Nearly 200 bird and animal species, including numerous threatened and       endangered ones, now make their home in the Orlando Easterly Wetlands.       Prior to the wetlands project, the site had hosted less than two dozen       animal species.         As testimony to the success of the wetlands as wildlife habitat, the       Orlando Easterly Wetlands has been documented as the northernmost nesting       area of the Everglades snail kite. This endangered species previously had       only been observed as far north as Kissimmee, following its decline in the       mid-1900s. The Everglades snail kite feeds on apple snails, a species that       typically resides in high quality waters, which are provided at the       Orlando Easterly Wetlands.         All areas of the project are actively managed to provide floral       habitats that are conducive to nutrient uptake. In addition to these       management activities, special attention and care are given to the       threatened, endangered, or otherwise listed floral and faunal species       occurring on site. Seventeen state-listed plants have been identified at       the Orlando Easterly Wetlands.

By controlling pollution upstream--in the streams and rivers that feed            the Chesapeake Bay--Maryland's Tributary Teams are working to make a            difference in our neighborhoods, our cities and towns, and the entire            Chesapeake Bay watershed.    Water Pollution Begins on the Land  Here in Maryland, major cleanup actions are now underway in ten key Bay tributaries, under the guidance of the Tributary Teams. Using a watershed approach to pollution control, these teams are tackling the nutrients that find their way into our streams and rivers from widely scattered sources on the land. Excess fertilizers from farm fields and suburban lawns, sewage from old septic systems, and sediment from construction projects all can wash off the land and into our waterways every time it rains. Even pollution from our own backyards and driveways can find its way into our waterways through the network of storm drains that empty into neighborhood streams and rivers. Therefore, the way we manage growth in our towns and cities, care for our lawns, run our households, and grow our food can all affect water quality.     What's Being Done  Maryland's Tributary Teams meet regularly in each of the Bay's ten major tributaries to help implement pollution prevention measures needed to address local water quality problems. These teams are laying the groundwork to ensure clean water and healthy rivers for future generations. A major focus of their efforts is controlling nutrient pollution from farm fields and horse pastures, wastewater treatment plants, construction and road building activities, and hundreds of thousands of suburban properties.            Developing a pollution control plan unique to            each watershed, its population and its land-use patterns is no small            task. Among the pollution control options being implemented in each            tributary basin are upgrades to wastewater treatment plants, the planting            of stream-side forests to absorb nutrient runoff, best management practices            to reduce agricultural runoff and ""smart growth"" plans aimed            at concentrating new development and protecting open spaces and natural            habitat. This coordinated watershed-by-watershed approach brings the            Bay cleanup closer to home for the many citizens, businesses and local            governments working to protect local waterways and ultimately the Chesapeake            Bay.     The Chesapeake Bay Watershed  The Chesapeake Bay Watershed is the land area drained by all the rivers and streams that flow into the Bay. Home to 14 million people, it extends 64,000 square miles and includes parts of six states and the District of Columbia. Like all large watersheds, the Bay's watershed is made up of thousands of smaller watersheds that drain into its tributaries. For example, the Monocacy River Watershed is part of the larger Potomac River Watershed, which, in turn, is part of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.

GX248-60-3521932	"Chesapeake Bay                              1999 Overview Summary of  Pfiesteria  and Fish Health monitoring in Chesapeake Bay                    Prepared by:              The Maryland  Pfiesteria  Study Team              March 8, 2000                 Introduction     A coordinated monitoring effort developed in response to fish and human health events in 1997-98 and continued with significant advances during 1999. Programs included water quality and habitat analyses, field surveys of fish health, field experiments on fish health in the Pocomoke River, pathology and histology of fish, and watershed pollution assessment. Advances in molecular techniques to the level of field application were incorporated into the monitoring and rapid response efforts. The latest techniques allowed, for the first time, for  Pfiesteria  monitoring to be closely integrated with monitoring of fish health and water quality on a Baywide scale.         Results     Advances in fish husbandry with menhaden have pushed the science toward improved experimentation. Baseline parameter estimates of fish health for menhaden were developed for better evaluations of fish condition in the future. Ulcers on fish were studied intensively and the relationships that may exist between ulcers on fish, water quality and the presence of  Pfiesteria  were examined. Due to the discovery of a myxosporidean parasite this year associated with post larval and early juvenile menhaden that were outwardly healthy or exhibited anomolies, there are additional insights and questions on the development of ulcers in fish connected with their habitat.         Characterization of systems with and without  Pfiesteria  continues to support the observation of relatively higher nutrient and phytoplankton concentrations in areas where  Pfiesteria  is present in the water column. Work conducted by the team examining watershed characteristics has demonstrated that alternative fertilizer applications on systems with phosphorus enriched soils can reduce nutrient loading to the Bay.         No fish kills in 1999 were attributable to toxic  Pfiesteria  events.  Pfiesteria piscicida  was, however, associated with a severe and prolonged fish health event involving ulcerated menhaden on the Middle River and found at the site of a human health event on Back Creek that fit the current definition for ""Possible Estuary Associated Syndrome"".     Overall menhaden catches were greater in 1999 versus 1998 but percent of menhaden with ulcers has continued to decline since 1997 (1997: 9.1%, 1998: 2.1%, 1999: 1.7%). Geographically, lesion prevalence in 1999 was clustered in tributaries at the head of the Bay (e.g., Middle River) and the lower Eastern Shore. Assessment of anomaly rate in the broader fish community sampled across fisheries programs indicates a low bay-wide lesion incidence, approximately 0.5%, similar to 1998. Background prevalence has been reported as 0.5% in Mid-Atlantic and 0.7% in Gulf cost estuaries. In general, Chesapeake Bay fish appear to be healthy although there may be localized or species specific problems.     Pathology reports from several cooperating agencies concluded that both ulcerated and superficially normal mehaden from the lower Eastern Shore tributaries in May and June had severe myxosporidian infections, later identified as  Kudoa  sp. In addition to the  Kudoa  spores, a highly invasive, plasmodial stage suggestive of a myxozoan was found in the tissues of the Pocomoke menhaden during late May through early July. Some of the invasive stage lesions were associated with ulcers and chronic inflammatory infiltrates. Bacterial and viral assays on a sample of ulcerated and normal fish were negative, indicating that the invasive sporozoan was most likely the primary pathogen causing these small ulcers.         Summaries of results for the program areas are attached and give more detail to the highlights of the work for 1999.             Table of Contents Page         Section 1.

The evidence in support of this conclusion included the combination of the following factors: identification of  P. piscicida  from the water column by scanning electron microscopy; enumeration of a sufficient density of  Pfiesteria -like cells in the water column at the times of the events to account for toxicity; fish kills with no other apparent cause after an evaluation of numerous factors; and confirmation of  Pfiesteria  toxicity in water samples assayed using fish. Atlantic menhaden  (Brevoortia tyrannus ) in the outbreak areas suffered mortalities, high percentages of lesions, and incidences of distressed behavior. Medical studies revealed significant cognitive deficits in humans exposed to the affected water bodies (Grattan et al. 1998).     These outbreaks led to the implementation of a comprehensive monitoring and research effort by the State of Maryland and its partners to evaluate the factors that are associated with outbreaks of  P. piscicida  and related species with potential toxicity. This monitoring effort has included a rapid response capability to evaluate sites where fish health, human health, or other conditions suggest that a toxic outbreak of  Pfiesteria  may be present.         Objectives         The objectives for the 1999 sampling, analysis and interpretation were the following:         Rapid Response         1. Provide for the rapid response testing of, and reporting on, water quality, habitat,  Pfiesteria -like organisms and associated biological communities in cases of suspected toxic outbreaks.     2. Provide water quality, habitat and  Pfiesteria  data needed to fulfill DNR's obligations under Maryland's ""Protocol for Closing and Reopening Rivers Affected by  Pfiesteria  or  Pfiesteria -like Organisms.""         Environmental Assessments         3. Increase understanding of critical habitat factors contributing to the frequency of toxic outbreaks of  Pfiesteria -like organisms.         4. Evaluate relationships between critical habitat factors and human activities.         5. Identify areas vulnerable to outbreaks of toxic  Pfiesteria  or  Pfiesteria -like organisms.         6. Identify the principal harmful algal bloom species and their distribution in Maryland's waters, including support for development of molecular probes.         7. Track improvements in water bodies affected by  Pfiesteria -like organisms that have implemented management programs.         8. Provide rigorous exposure data to epidemiologists studying the relationship between toxic  Pfiesteria -like dinoflagellates and human health.         Methods     In response to the 1997 outbreaks, six Chesapeake Bay tributary systems and two tributary systems on the Atlantic Coastal Bays were chosen for intensive sampling starting in 1998. These tributaries are in the region affected in 1997 and include five systems that share similar water quality and watershed characteristics with the three that had outbreaks. Sampling for most elements of the monitoring program is conducted once to twice monthly between April and October.     Water quality samples are taken along the longitudinal axes of the tributary systems and include temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and a broad suite of nutrient (N, P, C, Si) fractions.         Phytoplankton sampling is conducted using several techniques. Chlorophyll samples for biomass are collected at all water quality stations, species composition are collected at a subset of these stations, and continuous  in vivo  fluorescence measureents of chlorophyll are made from longitudinal cruises in all of the tributary systems.     Water column sampling for  Pfiesteria  and related dinoflagellates in the water column was conducted initially only in areas that had potential outbreaks. Taxonomic identification has been conducted by Dr. JoAnn Burkholder (North Carolina State University) and Dr. Karen Steidinger (Florida Department of Environmental Protection). This process has been conducted via reading of plates on the armored dinoflagellate from photographs of samples prepared under scanning electron microscopy. Bioassays to assess toxicity to fish have been conducted by Dr. Burkholder's laboratory. Starting in 1998, and to a greater extent in 1999, sampling was conducted routinely at a subset of water quality stations in the affected region as well as in a number of tributaries around the Chesapeake Bay. The recent development of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based genetic probe for  P. piscicida  and two related dinoflagellates by Dr. David Oldach of University of Maryland Institute for Human Virology, Dr. Parke Rublee, University of North Carolina, Greensboro and Dr. Gerardo Vasta of the University of Maryland Center of Marine Biotechnology, has greatly enhanced our ability to detect these species in a matter of hours from the time of collection. During potential outbreaks, samples are analyzed by the PCR probe and by light microscopy to ascertain whether or not there are "" Pfiesteria- like"" cells and, if so, their density. If the samples are positive for  Pfiesteria  or  Pfiesteria -like cells, subsamples are incubated in two cultures, one with fish and one with algal prey to determine potential toxicity.     Sediment sampling for  Pfiesteria  and related dinoflagellates was conducted in 1998 and 1999 at approximately 300 stations in 14 tributaries throughout the Chesapeake and Coastal Bays to determine Bay-wide distributions. Stations for sediment sampling were chosen randomly within a geographic area that included the 3-12 ppt summer salinity zone where  Pfiesteria  has been typically found in Chesapeake Bay and at a depth of less than 2 m. All sediment samples were incubated in two cultures, one with fish and one with algal prey.         Results     Water Quality Relationships with Pfiesteria       Overall water quality in the region affected in 1997 was assessed using the new monitoring data. In general, most nutrient (N, P, C) fractions, especially the dissolved organic fraction, were found to be elevated when compared with a broader array of stations sampled throughout the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Most stations in the affected Lower Eastern Shore region were above the 60th percentile for total N and P pools and above the 80th percentile for dissolved organic N and P pools. Reaches of tributary systems that had outbreaks in 1997 and have also tested positive for  Pfiesteria  in the water column in subsequent years appear to have among the highest nutrient concentrations in this region.     Using 1999 data, water quality was compared in areas with and without  P. piscicida  as determined by PCR probe. From the set of stations where  P. piscicida  was found in the water column (i.e. positive), a geographic area that encompassed the salinity range of 3-12.5 ppt (95% confidence interval on the mean salinity for positive samples) and the time frame of July - October was established as the most likely space - time dimension for  Pfiesteria  to be present in the water column. Water quality data from stations in this same space - time dimension, but where  Pfiesteria  was not found (i.e. negative), was used for comparison with the positive set. This ""negative"" set was then further divided by eliminating tributaries was found active in 1997 or 1998. This comparison showed that almost all total, organic and particulate nutrient pools were higher in waters where  Pfiesteria  was active in the water column; chlorophyll was also higher.     Elevated chlorophyll has been associated with  Pfiesteria  in both North Carolina and Maryland. In the 1997 outbreaks in the Pocomoke R., longitudinal profiles showed that the chlorophyll maximum was in the vicinity of the fish kills during August, the month of the outbreaks (MD DNR 1998). A working hypothesis developed based upon data collected in the Pocomoke R. suggests that high chlorophyll levels may serve as a rich food supply both for the heterotrophic  P. piscicida  and for the menhaden that are associated with toxic outbreaks. The detection of the longitudinal position of chlorophyll maxima has, therefore, been of particular interest and continuous flow-through  in vivo  fluorometry (IVF) has been employed to improve its detection.     In 1999  P.   piscicida  was detected at numerous stations and dates in the Transquaking R. and to a lesser extent in the Chicamacomico R. The 1999 summer-averaged (July-October) chlorophyll for the Chicamacomico/Transquaking system was highest in the Transquaking where summer averages were above 40 ug/l.         During most of the sampling period in 1999 on the Pocomoke River, the chlorophyll maximum region included Shelltown, the vicinity of the 1997 outbreaks. During the period, chlorophyll levels remained below 40 ug/l. In 1999 only one of many water column samples (n=73) were positive for the presence of  P. piscicida .     As seen in past years, the chlorophyll for the Manokin/Kings Cr./Back Cr. system in 1999 sustained algal blooms of over 80 ug/l in its smaller upper tidal reaches during summer. In 1999  P. piscicida  was detected near a report of a human health problem in Back Cr. during August. In 1997, a  Pfiesteria  outbreak occurred in Kings Cr.        Pfiesteria piscicida Distribution in Chesapeake Bay     Pfiesteria piscicida  appears to be widespread throughout tidal tributaries of Chesapeake Bay. An initial investigation in 1992 revealed the presence of  P. piscicida  in Jenkins Creek, a tributary of the Choptank River. Since 1997, a variety of methods have been utilized to test for the presence and toxicity of  P. piscicida . The occurrence of four separate fish health events, all involving kills, lesion outbreaks, and erratic fish behavior on the Pocomoke, Manokin, and Chicamacomico rivers in August and September 1997, prompted the analysis of water samples from these rivers. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fish bioassays confirmed the presence of toxic  P. piscicida  at the time and place of all four events. Recently developed PCR methodologies from two independent laboratories confirmed the presence of  P. piscicida  during lesion outbreaks on the Wicomico and Chicamacomico rivers in 1998 and the Middle, Gunpowder and Bohemia rivers in 1999. PCR also confirmed the presence of  P. piscicida  on Back Creek (a tributary of the Manokin River) in response to a reported incident of possible human exposure to  P. piscicida  toxin in 1999. Bioassays conducted on water from all the 1998 and 1999 events did not detect the toxic form of the dinoflagellate. During 1999, a survey approach was employed in which water samples were collected monthly (April - October) from approximately 50 sites in Chesapeake Bay tributaries and subjected to PCR analysis. This survey revealed  P. piscicda  on the Pocomoke, Wicomico, Chicamacomico/Transquaking system, Potomac, Magothy, Patapsco, and Back rivers. One sample collected in 1998 on the Rhode River and subjected to PCR analysis also revealed  P. piscicida . Finally, approximately 300 sediment samples have been collected on 14 Chesapeake and Coastal bay tributaries during 1998 and 1999. Approximately 15% of these samples have been analyzed to date with  P. piscicida  being detected via PCR and SEM in sediment from the Chicamacomico River.     Pfiesteria shumwayae  has been detected in seven Maryland tributaries. Analysis of sediment samples have revealed its presence in the Big Annemessex, Manokin, Wicomico, and Chicacacomico rivers in the Chesapeake Bay drainage, and Trappe Creek in the Coastal bays. Polymerase chain reaction analysis has also revealed  P. shumwayae  in the water column of the Potomac and Middle rivers.         Summary     Information collected between 1997 and 1999 as part of Maryland's monitoring of environmental conditions related to  Pfiesteria  has significantly increased our understanding of this organism and its relationships with environmental conditions.  P.   piscicida  is widespread in Maryland, having been found in 14 tributary systems of the Chesapeake Bay, with the greatest occurrences, and the only obvious toxic outbreaks, on the mid-Delmarva Peninsula.  Given the broad distribution of tributaries in which it has been confirmed present thus far, it is likely that further sampling will reveal its presence in many other tributaries.  Pfiesteria piscicida  is not, however, necessarily common in these tributaries. In many cases,  P. piscicida's  presence has been confirmed by one or a few of many samples collected over multiple months or years. On the other hand, there are several tributaries that have consistently demonstrated  P. piscicida  activity. The Chicamacomico, in particular, has demonstrated significant  P. piscicida  activity annually since 1997. The Manokin and, to a lesser extent the Pocomoke and Wicomico, have also demonstrated  P. piscicida  activity on multiple years. Evidence to date suggests that this activity is concentrated in the July through October period. To date, only the four events in 1997 have strong evidence on  P. piscicida  present in a toxic state.     The recently named  Pfiesteria shumwayae  has also been confirmed in Maryland tributaries. Evidence to date has confirmed its presence in seven tributaries. The data for this species is far less extensive than that for  P. piscicida , however preliminary evidence suggests that it's distribution in the water column is not as widespread as  P. piscicida . To date, there has been no evidence of  P. shumwayae  toxicity in Maryland waters, however,  P. shumwayae  collected in Maryland sediment samples has repeatedly demonstrated ichthyotoxicity in laboratory settings. Laboratory evidence suggests that  P. shumwayae's  life history and toxic capabilities are similar to  P. piscicida  (J.M. Burkholder, personal communication). Polymerase chain reaction probes are now available for  P. shumwayae , allowing future work to better describe its distribution.     The 1997 through 1999 data indicate several associations between  Pfiesteria , fish health and environmental conditions in Chesapeake Bay. In all incidences (n=7) where young-of-the-year Atlantic menhaden were found with high percentages of lesions for extended periods of time,  P.   piscicida  was also found in the water column, and there is strong evidence that it was in a toxic form at four of these events.  While there is strong evidence that toxic  P. piscicida  was responsible for the fish kills and erratic behavior observed in the 1997 events, the relationship between the dinoflagellate and menhaden ulcers is less clear. The field evidence presented here does not prove a mechanistic relationship between  P. piscicida  and the menhaden ulcers observed, but rather demonstrates a strong association. There have also been cases demonstrated in 1999 of  Pfiesteria  presence in the water column without associated fish health problems. Several hypotheses have been proposed (some suggesting a mechanistic relationship) to explain the observed association between  Pfiesteria  and fish lesions (""Special Report of the Technical Advisory Committee on Harmful Algal Outbreaks in Maryland: Causes and Significance of Menhaden Lesions"", February 12, 1999) and are being pursued as part of Maryland's response. This association between menhaden health and  Pfiesteria , regardless of the underlying relationships, confirms the value of utilizing fish health as one of several indicators of possible  Pfiesteria  activity.       Areas where  Pfiesteria  has been found consistently in the water column have relatively high nutrient and chlorophyll levels; dissolved organic nutrients are particularly high. The positioning of the chlorophyll maxima in affected tributaries often coincides with where  Pfiesteria  is detected and is being closely evaluated as an indicator of outbreak occurrence.  Nutrient enrichment continues to be a common denominator in systems that have exhibited the greatest and toxic  Pfiesteria  activity. A large part of the State's response continues to focus on understanding the complex interactions of specific habitat parameters that contribute to  Pfiesteria  presence and toxicity.

Several species of estuarine and freshwater fish were involved. A variety of possible causes for the abnormalities was suggested, including unusual water quality conditions (low salinity and pH, especially in the spring of 1997), toxic discharges from agricultural, municipal or industrial sources, epizootic fish diseases, and toxic algal blooms. The 1997 events stimulated increased attention to fish health questions in Maryland, in part because of the need to protect the public from exposure to potentially toxic waters, and in part because there were important unanswered questions about the interactions of toxic  Pfiesteria -like organisms with estuarine fish. A coordinated group of studies was initiated in the summer of 1997 to attempt to answer the many questions surrounding the fish health problems.     Intensive fish health investigations were undertaken in the Chesapeake Bay tidal tributaries in 1997 and 1998. These studies included: 1) fishery-independent sampling using bottom trawls, beach seines and cast-nets; 2) fishery-dependent observations conducted by biologically-trained observers on commercial fishing vessels; and 3) experimental studies designed to document the effects of confining fish under conditions reflecting both the estuarine environment and the potential stresses of commercial fishing gear (i.e. pound nets and bank traps). Tissue samples were collected from several species of fish for histopathological and microbiological examination during these studies.     The 1997 fish health study results from the Pocomoke River and Sound indicated an unusually high percentage of physical abnormalities, especially external lesions. Baywide studies, with fishery-independent sampling for lesion incidence in several tributaries , were conducted in 1998 and 1999. (Rickabaugh  et al.  2000). The central findings of their work were 1) a Baywide prevalence of fish lesions (all species combined) of 0.54% in 1998 and 0.46% in 1999, and 2) lower prevalence of lesions on menhaden in 1998 (2.1%) and 1999 (1.7%) than in 1997 (9.1%).     Atlantic menhaden with external ulcers exhibited two general pathologies; both types were chronic and active, but distinguished by the presence or absence of granulomatous tissue (Jordan and May 1998, Jordan  et al.  1999). Chronic active lesions are those that have been present for some time (days) based upon the appearance of well-developed immune responses, and that show no signs of healing. Granulomas reflect a particular type of immune response, and have been closely associated with ulcerative mycosis in menhaden and other species (Sindermann 1988), although granulomas can be induced by a variety of pathogens. The pathology results provided evidence that more than one factor was involved in the high prevalence of fish lesions in the Pocomoke River during 1997. A variety of opportunistic bacterial species was cultured from internal tissues of affected fish, with no consistent evidence of epizootic bacterial disease in the populations. Fungal hyphae were observed in histological sections of menhaden from each of the four 1997 morbidity and mortality events linked to  P. piscicida , including Pocomoke Sound, Kings Creek and the Chicamacomico River. In 1998, menhaden with severe ulcerative lesions were collected from many of the same tributaries, as well as the Wicomico River (Wicomico Co). Unlike 1997, in 1998 there were no reported mortalities associated with any of these lesion events. Histological analyses of samples from these tributaries yielded results similar to those in 1997; the lesions were diagnosed by pathologists as mycotic granulomatosis (Jordan  et al .1999).     There is an important question about how or whether these ulcers are spatially and temporally connected with toxic  Pfiesteria -like blooms. Although  P. piscicida  toxin can cause epidermal necrosis under experimental conditions, its role in formation of chronic ulcers has not been determined (Lewitus  et al.  1995, Burkholder and Glasgow 1997a, Noga 1998). Pathological and microbiological investigations have indicated frequent occurrence of fungal infections in the ulcers of menhaden (Sindermann 1988, Kane et al. 1998). Since the ulcers are chronic (days to weeks old), they are poor indicators of immediate toxic conditions at a particular time and place.     The origins of ulcers in fish are often difficult to discern, because most of our information is obtained during episodic events, or after the lesion has been infected by multiple secondary invaders. In most instances, disease in fish reflects an imbalance in the relationships of the host, pathogen, and environment. May and Sindermann (1999) proposed that ulcers originate from one of three major events: 1) direct physical injury to epithelium by fishing gear, predators, or other causes, 2) underlying systemic infections such as virus, fungi, or bacteria, or 3) stress-induced cellular or tissue changes resulting in necrosis. It is apparent in the literature that resolving the question of lesion origin requires directed experimental studies and detailed histological and physiological examination of infected fish. Since 1997, the Sarbanes Cooperative Oxford Laboratory (SCOL) has been working with researchers at the University of Maryland, U.S. Geological Survey, and Food and Drug Administration to determine the nature and progression of fish lesions in Chesapeake Bay. This report summarizes our collective 1999 findings in the areas of monitoring, histology, physiology, and experimental studies.        Objectives of 1999 studies      1. Document the prevalence and nature of fish abnormalities in commercial fisheries of the lower Pocomoke River and Pocomoke Sound.     2. Investigate the origins, nature and progression of skin abnormalities in Chesapeake Bay fish populations where the involvement of toxic  P. piscicida  is indicated.     3. Establish experimental conditions to re-create the skin abnormalities in a controlled mesocosm system.         4. Document the pathology and microbiology of fish afflicted with skin abnormalities.     5. Integrate the data with data from other components of the study through GIS and database management .         Methods       Onboard Commercial Fisheries Observation Program  - Fisheries observations were conducted from both pound nets and bank traps in the Pocomoke River and Sound in 1999. The initial onboard observations began in April of 1999; regularly scheduled events started in July and continued through September of 1999. Fish from the commercial catch were identified to species and examined for specific skin anomalies. A total of 10,218 fish was sampled.     Menhaden Collection and Husbandry -  Collection of larval menhaden was conducted by the University of Maryland Eastern Shore United States Fish and Wildlife Service Cooperative Unit (USFWS Coop. Unit) starting in late February, 1999. A modified ichthyoplankton tow fitted with a collection jar was used to capture fish at various locations. Late larval stage menhaden were brought to the Horn Point Aquaculture Facility (HPL) from April 23, 1999 through May 20, 1999 and immediately started on a brine shrimp diet ( Artemia franciscana ). The majority of fish were held in 500 gallon flow-through tanks fed by ambient unfiltered Choptank River water (6-15 ppt throughout the summer), with one batch (~500) placed in a fertilized 0.5 acre pond. Through metamorphosis, fish were fed a combination of  Artemia ,  T. isochrysis,  and a commercially available salmon starter diet onto which they were gradually weaned. Approximately 1000 additional juveniles were collected in July with cast nets on the Choptank River and mantained at HPL.      Physiology, Histopathology and Microbiology  - Blood chemistry, hematology, acetylcholinesterase, histology and microbiology samples were collected from adult and juvenile menhaden from May through November 1999 during both lesion and non-lesion events. To establish normal ranges for blood variables and acetylcholinesterase, 95 adults were sampled from pound nets on the Pocomoke and Choptank Rivers. Eighty healthy juveniles were collected from the Choptank River. Variables examined include hematocrit, differential white cell counts, brain acetylcholinesterase levels, and serum protein, osmolarity, glucose, and chlorides. Additional blood chemistry, hematology, and acetylcholinesterase samples were collected in August 1999 in response to three outbreaks of lesions in the Wicomico, Manokin, and Middle River systems. The same variables were examined from 30-100 fish per location.      Histopathological examinations were conducted on 292 YOY Atlantic menhaden from a variety of sites and sampling programs during 1999. If available, five to ten (depending on size) YOY menhaden were fixed for histological analysis from each tributary per sampling date. The Fisheries Service began sampling juvenile menhaden in the Spring of 1999 earlier than previous years, since our goal was to document the beginning of the ulcerative lesions, and follow their progression throughout the summer. Histology slides were prepared at SCOL following standard methods and examined by Dr. Renate Reimschuessel, FDA and other cooperating pathologists.      Cage Studies -  At each of the three lesion outbreaks described above, cage studies were conducted to determine whether healthy fish exposed to the ambient environmental conditions would develop the same type of ulcerative lesions. White perch ( Morone americana ) maintained at the DNR Vienna facility were transported to Back and Shiles Creeks on 8/24/99. Ten fish were placed in each of four 2'x2'x4' wire mesh cages (2 per site). Cages were retrieved after 48 hours and 96 hours with all fish examined for external damage, blood hematology and chemistry, and neurology. The details of cage design, deployment, and transport are described in Jacobs et al. 1999.      Atlantic menhaden (90-110mm) reared in the HPL hatchery were transported on 9/8/99 to the Middle River in fish live shipping boxes at a density of 15 per box. Three cages were deployed in Hopkins Creek and Norman Creek. Cages were pulled at 48, 96, and 144 hours. An additional cage was added to each site on 9/12/99 and allowed to remain for 312 hours. Two cages were deployed on 9/11/99 in the Choptank River off of the HPL pier to serve as controls and were pulled at 96 and 288 hrs. Fish were examined for external abnormalities, with 6 fish bled for hematocrit and protein determination, and preserved for histology. An additional 2 - 6 fish per cage were frozen immediately for Ache determination. Rapid response water quality and pfiesteria detection samples were taken from each system during each sampling day.        Results     Onboard Commercial Fisheries Observation Program -  Of the 10,218 fish sampled, 0.352% (36 individuals) were observed with some form of skin anomaly and 0.078% (8 individuals) of the observed fish possessed a severe skin anomaly (erosions or ulcers). The 1999 percentage of fish with anomalies was comparable to the 1998 percentage of 0.306% (Hedrick  et al.  1998). The percentage of  severe  skin anomalies, however, was lower than 1998 (0.192%). Atlantic menhaden showed a very low percentage of overall anomalies (0.30%; 8 fish), and most of these (6 fish) were affected by external parasites. Abrasions were the most commonly observed skin anomaly, followed by parasites, erosions and ulcers. No correlation between fish size (total length) and the occurrence of skin anomalies was observed for any species.     Menhaden Collection and Husbandry -  Collection and rearing of larval, pre-juvenile, and juvenile stages of Atlantic menhaden was successful in 1999. In all, over 6,000 fish were raised to juvenile stages. However, initial mortality often exceeded 50% from time of collection to tank acclimation. Growth of menhaden equaled that noted in the wild until late September when growth rate declined, most likely due to reduced feeding and crowding in tanks. Transportation in ""fish bags"" (plastic bags filled half with water and half with pure oxygen) or a circular tank were both successful, with minimal mortality. The raised areas found in juveniles on the Pocomoke (possibly associated with  Kudoa  sp . ), were not noticed in hatchery reared fish, although screening efforts were not undertaken. However, by mid-August, approximately 50% of the individuals in a single tank developed ulcers stemming from the maxillary area of the left side of the mouth. We believe the ulcers were initiated by rubbing on the sides of tanks, as the condition always was observed on the tank-wall side of the fish. The condition also was noted in fish held at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS). While it is unlikely that the ulcers are of any overall health concern, VIMS researchers are examining the ulcers histologically.   Hatchery juveniles were used for experimental work by researchers at HPL, the United States Geological Survey, VIMS, and the University of Maryland, Aquatic Pathobiology Center.      Physiology, Histopathology and Microbiology -  Expected ranges for blood variables and acetylcholinesterase were determined from healthy adult and juvenile menhaden collected throughout 1999. Multivariate analysis of juvenile and adult data indicated significant differences between the life stages(p<0.01). Further examination of individual least square means suggested that the overall difference was driven by lower chlorides and glucose in juveniles and higher protein levels. The establishment of normal blood chemistry, hematology, and acetylcholinesterase ranges in menhaden had not previously been attempted, and gives us a valuable reference for future sampling. Although these values cannot be assumed to be true baseline levels, they represent a range encountered with normal sampling techniques for healthy fish.      In May, the Fish and Wildlife Health Program (FWHP) documented small raised areas on juvenile menhaden in the Pocomoke River (Somerset Co.). Samples were taken over the next few weeks for pathology and microbiology. By June, the prevalence of the raised lesions decreased and small ulcerative lesions were documented more frequently. The overall percentage of sampled fish with ulcerative lesions reached its peak of 18% on June 3 rd . The lesion prevalence then began to decline; no fish were collected with significant exterior lesions after July 8 th .      Pathology reports from several cooperating agencies concluded that both the ulcerated and superficially normal fish had severe myxosporidian infections, later identified as  Kudoa  sp. In addition to the  Kudoa  spores, a highly invasive, plasmodial stage suggestive of a myxozoan was found in the tissues of the Pocomoke menhaden during late May through early July. These parasites penetrated and surrounded muscle bundles, causing grossly observable raised lesions in 70% of the cases. In a number of fish, these parasites were also found in the visceral organs, branchial arches and intraocular muscles. Some of the invasive stage lesions were associated with ulcers and chronic inflammatory infiltrates. Bacterial and viral assays on a sample of ulcerated and normal fish were negative, indicating that the invasive sporozoan was most likely the primary pathogen causing these small ulcers.     Ulcerated menhaden were captured during routine sampling by DNR biologists on Shiles Creek, Wicomico River in August 1999. Blood chemistry and acetylcholinesterase sampling revealed no differences from Choptank River controls (p>0.05) however, no ulcerated fish were collected. Interestingly, slightly elevated neutrophil and monocyte counts (above control levels) were detected, indicating a moderate immune response.     In August, 1999 an advisory was issued for portions of Back Creek, Manokin River, due to three individuals who reported skin irritations and flu-like symptoms following water contact. Over 90 juvenile menhaden were sampled with no ulcerative lesions noted. However, the fish mouth isopod  Olencira praegustator  was noted in most fish, and caused mechanical opercular sores in 18% of the fish. In many cases, gill damage was extensive regardless of opercular sores. Hematocrit and white cell differentials in these fish were well within normal ranges. However, slight depressions of glucose, protein and chloride concentration were noted, along with elevation of serum osmolality. These changes could reflect gill damage caused by the parasite, altering osmotic capabilities and influencing feeding. Acetylcholinesterase levels were similar to control (normal) values (p>0.05).     On August 22 nd , 1999 ulcerated menhaden were discovered in abundance in the Middle River, near Essex, MD. The lesion incidence varied from day to day but affected rates were as high as 88% (Rickabaugh  et al.  2000). No other species of fish, including other clupeids, was affected with ulcerative lesions. Blood chemistry analysis of ulcerated fish showed signs of hypoglycemia, depressed protein, and red cell anemia as compared to normal values and other response locations. These conditions are consistent with hemodilution, or thinning of the blood through water entry, as well as infectious disease in the case of protein. Interestingly, the ulcerated Middle River fish were maintaining osmotic balance and chloride levels despite large open sores. It is difficult to explain the exact mechanism by which this was accomplished without a detailed examination of other electrolytes. The salinity in the Middle River (7-8ppt, 200-232 mmol/kg) at the time of collection was fairly close to ""normal"" internal salt concentrations (9-12 ppt, 260-348 mmol/kg) in menhaden. It is also known that muscular exertion releases lactate ions which can be reflected in total osmolality through gradient creation causing a net water movement into blood cells (Wood, 1991). As expected, differential white cell counts suggested an elevated cellular immune response with high neutrophil and monocyte counts. Acetylcholinesterase values were again similar to control values. Of great interest was the response of externally healthy fish collected at the Middle River. Again, elevated neutrophil and monocyte counts were noted, as well as high hematocrit, hyperglycemia, and mild hypochloremia. Although sampling techniques remained constant at all locations, it was possible that sampling influenced the general stress response noted in these fish. However, elevated differential counts suggested the stress may have been chronic. Clearly, as juvenile menhaden are schooling fish and theoretically all subjected to the same event or events preceding lesion development, more attention needs to be directed at those without lesions.      After repeated pathological and microbiological sampling, it was concluded that the lesions from Middle River menhaden were very similar to the lesions seen in both 1997 and 1998. The ulcers were heavily infected with fungi as well as several bacterial organisms. However, there were no common bacterial isolates taken from these fish; they were infected with a variety of gram-negative bacteria, so the bacterial infections were believed to be secondary. The pathological diagnosis for fish caught from the Middle River was essentially the same as the ulcerated fish collected from the Wicomico and Chicamacomico in 1998: chronic mycosis. Granulomatous tissue was seen in most of the fish examined, indicating that the infections had been progressing for some time. The descriptions of the lesions varied somewhat; some lesions were more red in color and characterized as being ""fresh"" and others were more necrotic and gray or white in color. The latter were characterized by some as ""old"" lesions. There was granulomatous tissue in both types of lesions, indicating that the ""fresh"" and ""old"" categories were both describing chronic lesions, and should not be used for field descriptions. Pathologists from other cooperating agencies concluded similar diagnoses.     Cage Studies -  Cage studies conducted with white perch at Back Creek, Manokin River and Shiles Creek, Wicomico River revealed no abnormalities after 96 hours of exposure.   This information, in combination with physiological assessments of juvenile menhaden collected, suggested no adverse conditions at these locations.     Extensive cage studies were conducted in Hopkins and Norman Creeks on the Middle River with juvenile Atlantic menhaden. Overall, mortality was 20% and occurred within 48 hours, most likely reflecting transport and acclimation stress. No lesions attributable to pathogens were noted, with no significant differences found between sites, times, or cages for hematocrit, protein, or acetylcholinesterase (p >0.05). Presumptive cell counts and probe results indicated that  Pfiesteria -like cells were at low levels during the caging experiment.      Overall, the incidence of external anomalies on commercially harvested fish in the Pocomoke River and Sound in 1999 was similar to 1998, and much lower than in 1997. While the trend of sporadic, small scale lesion events continued, the Middle River episode was the first time these abnormalities were reported from a heavily populated Western Shore area. As in 1997 and 1998, histology results from ulcerated juveniles showed a high degree of bacterial colonization and granulomatous tissue, suggesting that the initiating event or events occurred well prior to their discovery. Unsurprisingly, menhaden with ulcerative lesions showed many signs of physiological stress, mostly stemming from hemodilution. It is apparent from this event response sampling that more attention should be paid to healthy fish found with ulcerated individuals; as schooling fish should all be subjected to the same event or events which preceded lesion development. The lack of changes in actetylcholinesterase at all sample sites may reflect lack of toxic organisms. However, we have not had the opportunity to test our hypothesis of inhibition under conditions where  Pfiesteria  toxin is present. Perhaps the most significant finding is the discovery of another invasive pathogen, tentatively described as of the genus  Kudoa . Year 2000 sampling should aid in answering many of these questions through progression studies with those showing clinical signs of  Kudoa , and continued examination of healthy and ulcerated Atlantic menhaden.

Pfiesteria's  toxin is thought to erode the slime coating (and possibly the epithelia), allowing the entry of fungi and bacteria which causes an ulcer. Maryland has adopted a surveillance program that uses ulcerated fish as a bio-indicator of  Pfiesteria  and other harmful algal blooms (HAB's). A program was established by the DNR Fisheries Service in 1997 (Speir and Pyle 1998) to sample fish from water bodies statewide to detect ulcers as an indicator of HAB's. Atlantic menhaden,  Brevoortia tyrannus,  are thought to be a species particularly vulnerable to the toxin and subsequent ulcer formation. Monitoring of areas closed due to presumed  Pfiesteria  toxin caused fish kills was begun as a directed activity in 1997. In 1998, staff were added and sampling was initiated in areas thought to be at risk of  Pfiesteria  activity (Lukacovic et. al. 1999). The 1998 sampling effort was repeated in 1999 with some modification.     Objectives     1. Provide information on the incidence and distribution of fish lesions in Chesapeake Bay and Maryland's Oceanside tributaries.     2. Serve as a platform for researchers to provide healthy and diseased fish for histopathological and microbiological analysis.     3. Respond to citizen calls into the DNR Fish Health Hotline.         Methods     Monitoring in 1999 of fish health and habitat quality was conducted on four levels. Level I was termed Rapid Response deployments. A 24 hour Fish Health Hotline was maintained by the Natural Resources Communication Center in the Tawes Office Building. This Hotline received calls from citizens regarding fish health problems. Fisheries Service biologists staffed the Rapid Response Team and responded to potential problems identified through the Hotline. An agreement  between  Maryland Department of the Environment Fish Kill Unit and Fisheries Service assured a timely response to fish kill or fish health reports.     For Level I investigations, fish communities were sampled with beach seine or cast net. Water samples for  Pfiesteria  and nutrients along with physical parameters were taken when dead fish were present, or more than 20% of one fish species with   ulcerative lesions were collected in a sample of greater than 50 fish.     Level II sampling targeted those rivers which had been closed in 1997 (Pocomoke River, King's Creek and Chicamacomico River). These systems were sampled on a bi-weekly basis.     Level III sampling focused on water bodies with water quality and watershed characteristics similar to Level II rivers and therefore thought vulnerable to development of harmful algal blooms. Sample sites were located on Fishing Bay, Newport Bay, and the Nanticoke, Wicomico, Annemessex, Manokin, and St. Martin rivers and sites were sampled on a bi-weekly basis.     Sampling methods for Levels II and III were identical and sampling days often collected data from both Level II and III sites. Surface trawls had a 5 ft by 5 ft opening with the net body of 3/8 in stretch mesh. The codend was lined with 500 plankton netting. Sites were at specific river mile designations. Exact locations were selected based on site logistics and freedom from snags. One 6-minute trawl was made at each site parallel to the channel. Seine hauls, using a 100 foot net with 1/4 inch mesh, were made at the nearest snag-free beach. Tributaries of each major river were sampled at access points with 20 casts of a six foot cast net at each site. Sampling began in April and ended in October.     Catch was enumerated and twenty fish of each species measured. Any abnormalities such as lesions, mechanical damage or parasites were noted. For reporting purposes, anomalies were considered to be all types of external abnormalities with the exception of parasites. Ulcers on menhaden were characterized as new, old or recovering. All individuals with abnormalities were measured. At the request of fish health specialists, fish samples were retained for histology, microbiology or other analysis. Only Atlantic menhaden were retained from surface trawls. Water samples for analysis of  Pfiesteria  or nutrients were taken on request. Water quality (dissolved oxygen (D.O.), temperature, pH, conductivity and salinity) was recorded at each sampling site. The distribution of Atlantic menhaden captured during level II and level III monitoring was analyzed with the water quality measurements of temperature, D.O., and salinity. Each of these parameters were equally divided into predetermined ranges for this analysis.      For Level IV sampling, all Fisheries Service projects were asked to note the frequency and types of anomalies on fish that were collected in the various fishery dependant and fishery independent samples taken in Maryland tidewater. Projects included an angler survey on head boats out of Crisfield, the Striped Bass Juvenile Seine Survey, Striped Bass Tagging Survey, Crab Trawl Survey, Bay Pound Net Survey, Coastal Bays Trawl and Seine Survey, Baseline Fish Health Survey and Biological Indicators Trawl Survey.          Results     A total of 347,081 resident and migratory finfish were sampled by 8 surveys from 34 water bodies in Maryland's portion of the Chesapeake Bay, and ocean-side tributaries, to monitor for the presence of anomalies or lesions believed to be  Pfiesteria -related. In 1997 and 1998 188,824 and 372,675 fish were sampled respectively. System-specific incidence of anomalies ranged from 0.0 to 29.8%. Lesion prevalence among all fish species sampled by these programs in 1999 was 0.46%.     Atlantic menhaden was the fish of most concern because of associations found between ulcerated menhaden and  Pfiesteria . A total of 83,800   menhaden were collected in 1999 representing 24.1% of all fish sampled. In 1998, 48,789 menhaden were collected accounting for 12.6% of all fish sampled, and 16,622 menhaden were collected in 1997 accounting for 8.8% of the total catch. Lesion prevalence among menhaden was lower in 1999 (1.7%) than in 1998 (2.1%) or 1997 (9.1%) in all systems that were sampled. This trend was also seen in systems which were intensively monitored because of closures in 1997: Chicamacomico River, Kings Creek and Pocomoke River. In 1997, 22.3% of 5,754 menhaden had lesions; 11.2% of 3,012 had them in 1998; and 0.7% of 38,547 had lesions in 1999. Geographically, lesion prevalence in 1999 was clustered in the Head-of-Bay and lower Eastern Shore.     The prevalence of lesions among menhaden collected by cast net from the Chicamacomico River in September through November 1997 (n=865) and 1998 (n= 1783) was 69.1 and 15.6%   respectively compared to 0.6% in September through November 1999 (n=2729). Lesion frequency also declined during the same time period in the other two rivers that were previously closed. King's Creek lesion prevalence in menhaden caught with cast nets in 1999 was 1.1% (n=1090). This declined dramatically from 1997 (22.0%, n= 4719) and 1998 (10.4%, n = 318). Cast netting was not done in the Pocomoke River in 1997, so data from all gears was combined for comparing the September through November time period. Pocomoke River menhaden lesion prevalence declined through the years from 77.2% in 1997 (n= 179), to 8.4% in 1998 (n= 321) and 0.0% in 1999 (n =63).     When comparing sites sampled at the same frequency in 1998 and 1999, total catch (seine and cast net) of menhaden increased more than 1300% in the Chicamacomico River and Kings Creek in 1999. At these sites on the Pocomoke River, in 1998 only 4 menhaden were captured compared to 23,006 in 1999. Menhaden catches increased by 1917% in Fishing Bay, almost 300% in the Nanticoke River, 70% in the Annemessex River and 49% in the Manokin River. The 1999 Wicomico River menhaden catch decreased by 353% because of a single unusually large seine haul in 1998 (27,770 menhaden).      In 1998 over 96% of the menhaden captured were at temperatures between 23.0-28.9C and 64% fell within the same range (23.0-28.9C) in 1999. D.O. between 8 and 9.9 mg/l accounted for over 93% of the menhaden captured in 1998 and 41% in 1999. In 1999, 77% of the menhaden were found between 6.0 and 9.99 mg/l. In 1998, over 85% of the menhaden captured were found in salinities of 6.0-7.9 parts per thousand (ppt). In 1999, four different salinity ranges each accounted for more than 10% of the total menhaden captured. Nearly 40% were collected in 12.0-13.9 ppt in 1999.     Temperatures of 27.0-28.9C accounted for 59% of menhaden with anomalies in 1998 and 39% in 1999. In 1998 nearly 92% of all menhaden collected with anomalies were found in a dissolved oxygen range of 6.0-9.99 mg/l. In 1999, 89% of menhaden with an anomaly were collected at 6.0-9.99 mg/l. During 1998 and 1999, 35% of menhaden with anomalies were captured at 10.0-11.9 ppt. In 1998 one sample produced over 27,000 Atlantic menhaden with 10 anomalies. This sample weighs heavily in the 1998 percentages.     The Fish Health Hotline received 202   calls in 1999. A large proportion (28%) of the calls concerned striped bass displaying shallow sores and reddening of the skin. These calls comprised 35% of 441 calls in 1998. These reports were clustered in areas of high angling activity and were made during the striped bass open season. Most of the remaining calls were from isolated incidents throughout the state involving 15 different species.     Fisheries Service and Department of Environment Fish Kill Unit biologists responded by phone or personal contact to 109 citizens that contacted the Hotline. In most cases, samples of fish were collected by responding biologists and diagnoses were attempted. Several calls reported menhaden with lesions and Rapid Response Teams were sent to collect menhaden and determine the proportion of lesioned fish. None of the sampling resulted in river closures.     On July 22, 1999 a response was made to a report of an Atlantic menhaden kill in Pocomoke Sound. Approximately 500,000 menhaden succumbed to low dissolved oxygen in Bullbegger Creek, a Virginia tributary to Pocomoke Sound. The fish appeared otherwise healthy and had been swept into the Sound by the tide. No living menhaden were captured during the initial investigation. However, 503 healthy menhaden were captured on July 30 and no subsequent problems occurred in this area.     The report of a kayaker becoming ill after exposure to the water of Back Creek, a tributary to the Manokin River, resulted in 9 days of fish sampling during August 11- September 14, 1999. Only 1.8% of 2178 menhaden captured had anomalies. Forty-two fish of other species were captured and all were healthy. No further human health problems occurred and sampling was discontinued.     A response to a call to the Fish Health Hotline involving menhaden with ulcers in Middle River was made on August 22, 1999. Sampling was conducted on 13 days during August 22 - September 22. We captured 1698 Atlantic menhaden and 63.2% (1073) had anomalies; 83% of anomalies were ulcers. Ten other species were captured (n=710), with an anomaly rate of 0.3% (2 fish). During the last 2 days of sampling only 54 menhaden were captured, with an anomaly rate of 20%. Four other upper Chesapeake Bay tributaries were sampled periodically from August 29 to September 30, 1999. The Patapsco and Back rivers produced small catches of menhaden with anomaly rates approximately 15%. The Gunpowder River sampling captured 56 menhaden with a 68% anomaly rate. Sampling conducted on the Magothy River produced 167 menhaden with only 1 nonulcertive lesion (0.6%) recorded.          References     Lukacovic, R., H. Rickabaugh Jr. and H. Speir. 1999.

Summary: Pocomoke Watershed Pollution Assessment 1999                                        Prepared by:                          Maryland Department of the Environment              Maryland Department of Agriculture              United States Geological Survey              Maryland Department of Natural Resources              Natural Resources Conservation Service              Wicomico Soil Conservation District              Worcester Soil Conservation District              Somerset Soil Conservation District                     Introduction     The Pocomoke River watershed is a combined watershed that includes the drainages of the Pocomoke, Manokin and Big Annemessex Rivers. The Pocomoke River watershed drains approximately 433 sq. mi. of Worcester, Somerset, and Wicomico Counties in Maryland, 38 sq. mi. in Delaware, and 17 sq. mi. in Virginia. The primary tributaries of the Pocomoke River are Dividing (62 sq.mi.) and Nassawango(69 sq.mi.) Creeks. The Manokin and Big Annemessex Rivers drain 163 sq. mi. in Somerset and Worcester Counties, Maryland.     The land cover in the Upper Pocomoke River watershed and the Lower Pocomoke River watershed is forested and agricultural. Forest accounts for 53% of the land use in the Upper Pocomoke and 58% in the Lower Pocomoke. This is slightly less than the overall percentage of forest cover for Maryland's Lower Eastern Shore Tributary Strategy Basin, which is 61% forested. Agricultural land in the Upper Pocomoke accounts for 45% of the land use, while in the Lower Pocomoke it accounts for 36% of the land use. This is slightly higher than the overall percentage of agricultural land for Maryland's Tributary Strategy Lower Eastern Shore Basin, which is 32% agricultural. Urban land in these two subwatersheds accounts for 3% of the land use, while overall in the Lower Eastern Shore Basin, urban land accounts for 5% of the land.     The largest communities in the Pocomoke watershed are Pocomoke City, Princess Anne, Crisfield and Snow Hill.     Agriculture in the watershed is mixed cash grain, vegetable crops and livestock. Corn, soybeans, and small grains are the predominate crops. Poultry production is the main type of livestock agriculture. The annual poultry population is estimated at approximately 22,400,000. The manure produced by all of the livestock in the watershed is estimated to be in excess of 329 million pounds.     The modeled nutrient loads for these two basins are not proportional to the land use (1996 CBPO Phase IV Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model Scenario)( MD DNR ,1999). In the Upper Pocomoke basin, 90% of the total nitrogen load is from agricultural land, followed by forested land at 6%, urban land at 2% and point source loads at less than 1 percent. Sources of loads in the Lower Pocomoke are similar to the Upper Pocomoke with 82% of the total nitrogen load from agricultural land, 8% from forested land, 3% from urban land, and 3 % from point source loads. Loads from septic systems and atmospheric deposition to open water make up the difference. For total phosphorus loads, 80% of the load is from agriculture in the Lower Pocomoke, and 97% of the load is from agriculture in the Upper Pocomoke.     In an assessment of the 138 Maryland 8-digit watersheds (of which the Lower Pocomoke River and Upper Pocomoke River are two), a variety of indicators were examined in order to prioritize watersheds for either restoration, protection, or both (Maryland Clean Water Action Plan Technical Workgroup, 1998). These indicators covered water chemistry, aquatic living resources, and landscape characteristics. Both the Lower Pocomoke River and Upper Pocomoke River watersheds were determined to be in need of restoration. The Lower Pocomoke River watershed was also determined to be in need of protection.     In the Upper Pocomoke River watershed, 7 restoration indicators (of 11 pertaining to the watershed) were cause for concern. The most notable of these is the indicator entitled historic wetland loss. This watershed had the most acres of historic wetland loss than any other watershed in the state. 80,903 acres of historic wetlands have been lost. Historically, wetlands covered more than 85% of the watershed.     In the Lower Pocomoke River watershed, 8 restoration indicators (of 12 pertaining to the watershed) were cause for concern. The most notable include the indicators entitled SAV Abundance, SAV Habitat, and Historic Wetland Loss. This watershed received a score of ""most degraded condition"" for SAV Abundance. In fact, all of the MD 8-digit subwatersheds of the Lower Eastern Shore for which there was data, received this score. This watershed also received a very degraded score for SAV Habitat. The Lower Pocomoke River watershed received the second worst score for the state for the historic wetland loss indicator. 71,922 acres of historic wetlands have been lost. Historically, wetlands covered more than 70% of the watershed.     The Atlas of Indicators that has been compiled for the Lower Eastern Shore is presented as Attachment A. The Atlas is coupled with a description of the Lower Eastern Shore Conservation and Restoration Action Strategy Program. The Indicators have been used to target this restoration program in three small sub-watersheds of the Pocomoke Watershed. These three sub-watersheds will be the focus of further assessment and targeting and the focus of the programs restoration activities.         Paired Watershed Study in the Upper Pocomoke     In 1994 the Wicomico Soil Conservation District asked the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to join in a cooperative project designed to demonstrate the effect of nutrient management and poultry litter management on water quality. The project was originally designed to look at the effect on nutrient management and animal waste storage on water quality. In 1997 the outbreak of  Pfiesteria  in the lower Pocomoke River changed Maryland's approach to nutrient management and presented an opportunity for this project to evaluate a more aggressive approach to nutrient management.     The Water Quality Act of 1998, which was enacted as a result of the 1997  Pfiesteria  outbreak, assumes that basing nutrient inputs on the phosphorus needs of a crop where soils test beyond optimum levels for phosphorus fertility, will improve water quality. To test this assumption the project has undertaken an intense implementation and monitoring effort designed to demonstrate the effect on water quality of eliminating P inputs and implementing cover crops on all available cropland.     The project is using a paired watershed study design comparing two watersheds with similar land use and farming practices. Two subwatersheds to Green Run, a tributary to the Upper Pocomoke in Wicomico County, were chosen as the study site. Grab and automated composite water quality samples from a control watershed, in which farming practices remain unaltered, and a treatment watershed in which BMPs will be implemented, will be compared to determine changes to in stream nutrient concentrations and loads. The calibration phase of the project has been completed with the collection of baseline nutrient concentration and load data from both watersheds prior to any BMP implementation. Elevated nutrient levels are evident in both watersheds. Complicating factors in the comparison include dry/no flow conditions and water column anoxia.     The analysis of the calibration period results indicate that significant water quality improvements can be achieved with a 9% change in the difference between mean total nitrogen concentrations at the outlet of the treatment and control watersheds during the treatment period. A 58% change in the difference between mean total phosphorus concentrations at the outlet of the treatment and control watersheds during the treatment period will be needed to improve water quality significantly. The  Upper Pocomoke Calibration of the Agricultural BMP Evaluation 1994-1998  report is presented as Attachment B.         Ground Water Quality     The surficial aquifer on the Pocomoke watershed has a high silt and clay. The sediments are poorly drained because of poorly incised steams and flat water-table gradients. In much of this area, drainage ditches have been constructed, which will act to lower the water table. In the area closer to the Chesapeake Bay in the Pocomoke River Basin, the water table is generally shallow and comprised of poorly-drained, low-permeability sediment. The majority of ground-water in surficial aquifers discharges to adjacent streams and is termed ""base flow"". The percentage of total stream flow contributed by base flow ranges from about 42 to 74% (Bachman and others, 1998). These data are based on using hydrograph separation techniques at 20 sites with stream flow data.      Nitrate concentrations in the surficial aquifers underlying the Pocomoke River basin generally range from <0.1 to 35 milligrams per liter, with about 10 percent of the samples above the maximum contaminant level of 10 mg/L N as NO3 set by U.S. Environmental Protection agency. The median concentration was 1.1 milligram per liter. These values are based on data collected from 1976 to 1990 (Hamilton and others, 1993).      The nitrate concentrations appear to be related to land use and the type of sediments in the aquifer and soils. The nitrate concentrations were elevated in agricultural and residential areas in zones where the aquifer consists of sandy deposits (Hamilton and others, 1993). The sandy composition of the aquifer promotes aerobic conditions under which nitrate is stable. In agricultural and residential areas underlain by clay and silt deposits and anaerobic water, effects of human activities are less evident. The silt and clay deposits can cause lower nitrate concentrations for several reasons (Hamilton and others, 1993). The anaerobic conditions promote denitrification. The high amounts of clay and silt can inhibit downward movement of fertilizers from the land surface into the water table and have abundant exchange sites for ammonia, which reduces the amount of nitrogen available to reach the water table.      The age of the ground-water can also affect the nitrate concentrations. Knowing the apparent age of ground water can help explain nitrogen concentrations and provide an estimate of how long a management practice may take to be effective. Based on existing data the apparent ground-water ages in the surficial Coastal Plain aquifers range from about 5 to 20 years (Focazio and others, 1998).      1999 results from the ground water investigation in the Paired Watersheds support these findings. Nitrate levels vary from spring to fall and are higher along shorter flow paths. At the three sites samples nitrate concentrations ranges from 68 mg/l to <0.05 mg/l. The higher levels always occurring in wells adjacent to ditches representing short lateral flow paths. The lower levels always occurred in the deeper wells in the ditches representing longer flow paths up welling under the stream. Age dating of the water indicates that the apparent age of the water being sampled ranges from 5 to 20 years old. The younger water being collected in the wells adjacent to the streams and the older water being collected in the deeper wells in the stream beds.     Phosphorus concentrations did not follow the same pattern. Concentrations were either the same in the older water as the younger water being sampled adjacent to the streams or the concentrations were higher in the older water. Concentrations as high as 1.13 mg/l were measured in the water under the North Fork of Green Run in the spring of 1999. (Attachment C.)        Nutrient Loads     Nutrient loads and yields have been calculated for four sub-watersheds in the Pocomoke River watershed. The nutrient loads are flow driven. Loads increase with increasing flow for all constituents.      Nutrient yields are the annual loads discharged from a watershed divided by the acreage of that watershed. The yields allow comparisons to be made from one watershed to the next.

Photo 1: An aerial photograph of the constructed wetland for the treatment of     tertiary wastewater               Wastewater is initially treated in an underground primary and secondary     treatment system (SANTEC Model SC-26K) before being pumped to the tertiary     system.    Eight of the treatment     cells were planted with a variety of broad- and narrow-leaved emergent     plants, and six of the cells were     planted with three species of woody plants.        Capacity of the system in 1994 was 6,800 galloons per day and, when     plants matured, final capacity was 13,800 gallons per day.                       The system is unique in that it is the first known system that uses a     combination of emergent and woody plants in treatment cells in combination     with a constructed forested wetland to remove nutrients from wastewater.        The system was designed to facilitate research on     nutrient removal from wastewater by plants.        Current studies in the 14 cells are determining the survival and     growth of the various herbaceous and woody transplants and the volunteer     plants in a nutrient rich environment.                             Figure 1: The layout of the emergent and woody cells                                                                                                Photo 2: Planting of emergent plants                                                                                      Photo 3: Planting of woody plants                                                                                                                   Photo 4: Mature plants after one year                                                   Photo 5: Biologist conducting plant survey                                                                                                     Photo 6: Biologist conducting water quality survey                                                         Photo 7: Measuring growth of woody plants                                                               Figure 2: Planted vegetation within the emergent cells                           Figure 3: Planted vegetation within the woody cells                     RESULTS                       Based on percent ground cover after four growing seasons, none of the     broad-leaved emergents (Cells 1-4) covered more than 5% of the ground and     the total cover for all 5 species was only 17%.        River bulrush ( Schoenoplectus       fluviatilis ) formed 24% of the ground cover of the narrow-leaved     emergent plants (Cells 5-8) and total ground cover was 61%.

Introduction           During late summer and fall 1997, fish kill episodes and lesion events occurred on the Lower Eastern Shore of Maryland, first in the Pocomoke River and then in Kings Creek and the Chicamacomico River. During 1997, the State of Maryland mobilized rapid response and comprehensive assessment teams to protect public health and to learn more about the causes and conditions leading to the observed fish health problems. The toxic stages of  Pfiesteria pisicicida  were confirmed through scanning electron microscopy and bioassay analyses in each of the outbreak areas. A number of alternative hypotheses relating to the fish health problems have been, and continue to be, evaluated by the State's  Pfiesteria  Study Team which is coordinating the environmental studies related to  Pfiesteria . Another important finding during 1997 was the conclusion by a medical team that measurable human health effects were associated with the outbreak areas.     During 1998, the comprehensive assessments related to  Pfiesteria  and fish health were broadened in scope on the Lower Eastern Shore region of Maryland. In addition to these new assessment activities, ongoing Bay-wide programs were selectively enhanced to collect comparative information on fish health, water quality, and other environmental conditions that could help to evaluate unique conditions that may be occurring in the Lower Eastern Shore outbreak areas. Rapid response teams were equipped with protocols to respond to fish kills or lesion events where  Pfiesteria  could be implicated. River systems were prioritized for monitoring intensity as Level I - Rapid response to fish health events, Level II - monitoring on the 3 river systems affected in 1997, Level III - monitoring of 5 more river systems with water quality characteristics similar to Level II systems, and Level IV - use of existing Bay-wide programs to support comparative efforts.     A suite of programs were involved in the comprehensive assessment for 1998. These included:          •fish health surveys for incidences of anomalies     •fish health investigations including experimental studies and pathological/microbiological assessments     •environmental assessments including water quality, habitat,  Pfiesteria , and other biological measurements     •watershed and pollution source assessment     •toxicant assessments              Selected results from these comprehensive assessments are summarized below, followed by a more complete summary of each of these major program elements.         Results           No fish kills attributable to  Pfiesteria piscicida  occurred in 1998. Environmental conditions in the Pocomoke River preceding the fish kills in 1997 were significantly different from the same time period in 1998. Rainfall and flow differences between years changed the patterns and timing of the chlorophyll maxima and low dissolved oxygen levels between the two summer seasons, perhaps preventing ideal conditions for the concentration of menhaden and the proliferation of toxic  Pfiesteria  and/or closely related dinoflagellates.     Incidence of anomalies on fish in general, and menhaden in particular, declined between 1997 and 1998 in the waters of the Lower Eastern Shore. Despite the broad scale statistics on low anomaly incidence, two localized events of elevated incidence rates for lesions on menhaden were recorded in 1998 on the Lower Eastern Shore. Events of two to three weeks duration occurred in the Wicomico River in August and the Chicamacomico River in September. Presumptive counts on water samples collected in these areas indicated relatively low abundances ( <  130 cells/ml) of  Pfiesteria -like cells present in each case. Bioassays of water samples collected failed to show the presence of actively toxic  Pfiesteria  although one bioassay did turn toxic after 8 1/2 weeks. New techniques in genetic identification of  Pfiesteria piscicida  conducted this year did, however, indicate the presence of  Pfiesteria  in the two times and places where elevated levels of menhaden lesions were found.     Atlantic menhaden with lesions, collected from several Chesapeake Bay tributaries, consistently showed evidence of invasive fungal disease. Experimental studies involving caged white perch held in the Pocomoke River showed the development of anomalies such as abrasions and tail rot. These anomalies became more severe the longer the fish were held. Physiological indicators of these caged fish did not show symptoms of severe stress.     Broader scale water quality evaluations of Lower Eastern Shore tributaries in 1998 reinforced the preliminary findings of 1997 that most of these rivers have relatively high nutrient concentrations. This is particularly the case for organic forms of nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon. Watershed studies are beginning to clarify the processes and pathways of nutrient and sediment delivery from the watershed to the lower rivers.         Acknowledgments           In almost all aspects of these comprehensive assessment and rapid response activities, Maryland investigators pursued active collaborations with leading researchers in the field to utilize the latest information and techniques, as well as to provide sampling and logistical support to various researchers. Maryland is indebted to these many collaborators, too numerous to mention here, and the periodic reviews provided by the Harmful Algal Technical Advisory Committee under the leadership of Dr. Donald Boesch. Maryland investigators are also grateful for the funding support provided by several federal agencies and the State legislature.                 Table of Contents For Summary Reports         1.

The mode of activity is thought to be that the toxin erodes the slime coating and possibility the epithelia and allows the entry of fungi and bacteria which causes the ulcer. Based on recommendations from researchers, Maryland has adopted a water contact closure criteria which depends upon finding lesioned fish as an bio-indicator of Pfiesteria activity. A program was set up in the DNR Fisheries Service in 1997 to sample water bodies statewide to detect the presence of Pfiesteria from samples of fish. Atlantic Menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus are thought to be a species particularly vulnerable to the toxin. In the first year, collections of fish were primarily from existing surveys done for purposes of monitoring commercial or recreational species. Monitoring of areas closed due to Pfiesteria-caused fish kills was done as a directed activity. In 1998, staff were added and sampling was done on a directed basis in those areas at risk for Pfiesteria activity.     Objectives          1.  Provide information on the incidence and distribution of fish lesions in Chesapeake Bay and Maryland's Oceanside tributaries.     2. Serve as a platform for researchers to provide healthy and diseased fish for histopathological and microbiological analysis.     3. Respond to citizen calls into the DNR Fish Health Hotline.         Methods           Sampling in 1998 for fish health, Pfiesteria, and habitat quality monitoring was done on four levels. Level I was termed Rapid Response deployments. As had been done in 1997, a 24 hour a day Fish Health Hotline was maintained by the Natural Resources Communication Center in the Tawes Building. This Hotline received calls from citizens regarding fish health problems. Fisheries Service biologists staffed the Rapid Response Team and responded to potential problems identified through the Hotline. An agreement between Maryland Department of the Environment Fish Kill Unit and Fisheries Service assured a timely response to fish kill or fish health reports.     For Level I investigations, fish communities were sampled with otter trawl, beach seine or cast net. Three water samples for Pfiesteria and three for habitat quality along with physical parameters were taken when dead fish were present or closure criteria were met (more than 20% of fish of one species with Pfiesteria-like lesions in a sample greater than 50 fish).     Level II sampling targeted those rivers which had been closed in 1997 (Pocomoke River, King's Creek and Chicamacomico River). These systems had 44 sample sites. Selected sites within these systems were sampled on 60 different days.     Level III sampling focused on water bodies with water quality and watershed characteristics similar to Level II rivers and therefore vulnerable to Pfiesteria outbreaks. There were 40 Level III sample sites on Fishing Bay, Nanticoke, Wicomico, Annemessex and Manokin Rivers. Selected sites in these systems were sampled on 114 different days.     The Chester, Elk, Potomac and Patuxent Rivers were less intensively sampled. Sixty-five sites were sampled during 29 sampling days.     Sampling methods for Levels II and III were identical and sampling days often collected data from both Level II and III sites. Bottom trawls, using a 16 foot net, were made at open water sites in each system. Sites were at equidistant river mile designations. Exact locations were selected based on site logistics and freedom from snags. One 6-minute trawl was made at each site perpendicular to the channel. If the river was too narrow to finish a six minute trawl, the boat and trawl were turned into the tide and parallel to the channel to finish the tow. Seine hauls, using a 100 foot net, were made at the nearest snag-free beach. Tributaries of each major river were sampled at access points using cast nets. Twenty casts were made with a six foot net at each site.     Catch was counted and twenty fish of each species were measured. Any abnormalities such as lesions or parasites were noted and lesions on menhaden were characterized as new, old or recovering. All individuals with anomalies were measured. At the request of fish health specialists, fish samples were retained and processed for histology, microbiology or other analysis. Water samples for analysis of Pfiesteria or nutrients were taken on request. Water quality (dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, conductivity and salinity) was recorded at each sampling site.     For Level IV sampling, all Fisheries Service projects were asked to note the frequency and types of anomalies on fish that were collected in the various fishery dependant and fishery independent samples taken in Maryland tidewater. Projects included an angler survey on head boats out of Crisfield, the Striped Bass Juvenile Seine Survey, Striped Bass Tagging Program, Crab Trawl Survey, Bay Pound Net Survey, Coastal Bays Trawl and Seine Project, Baseline Fish Health Survey and Biological Indicators Trawl Survey.     Results           A total of 372,675 resident and migratory finfish were sampled by 8 projects from 36 water bodies in Maryland's portion of the Chesapeake Bay, and ocean-side tributaries, to monitor for the presence of anomalies or lesions believed to be Pfiesteria-related. In 1997 188,824 fish were sampled. Lesion prevalence among all fish species sampled by these programs in 1998 was 0.5%.     Atlantic menhaden was the fish of most concern since river closures in 1997, and closure criteria in 1998, were based on lesion prevalence in this species. A total of 46,789 menhaden were collected in 1998 and represented 12.6% of all fish sampled. In 1997, 16,622 menhaden were collected and accounted for 8.8% of all fish sampled.     Lesion prevalence among menhaden was lower in 1998 (2.1%) than in 1997 (9.1%) in all systems that were sampled. This trend was also seen in systems which were intensively monitored both years because of closures in 1997: Chicamacomico River, Kings Creek and Pocomoke River. In 1997 of the 5754 menhaden captured in these systems, 22.3% had lesions. In 1998, in these same waters, 3012 menhaden were captured with a 11.2% lesion prevalence.     The prevalence of lesions among menhaden collected by cast net from the Chicamacomico in September through November 1998 (n= 1783) was 15.6% compared to 69.1% in September through November 1997 (n=856). Lesion frequency also showed declines during the same time period in the other two rivers that were previously closed. King's Creek lesion prevalence among menhaden caught with cast nets in 1998 (n=318) was less than one half 1997's (n= 4719; 10.4% vs. 22.0%). Cast netting was not done in the Pocomoke in 1997, so data from all gears was combined for both years. This also showed a decline between 1997 (n= 179) and 1998 (n= 321; 77.2% vs 8.4%).     Numbers of all fish and numbers of menhaden collected per day from the Chicamacomico in 1998 were significantly greater than in 1997. September through November numbers of menhaden captured per day (95.6- 1998 vs. 13.7-1997) and catch per unit of effort (CPUE) for menhaden (2.38-1998 vs. 0.30-1997) suggest that the increase in their numbers in this system is real and not a sampling artifact. Numbers of fish per day and menhaden per day collected in King's Creek and CPUE for menhaden were similar for both years. Data from the Pocomoke is not comparable between years because different gears were used.     The Fish Health Hotline received 441 calls in 1998. A large proportion (35%) of the calls concerned striped bass displaying shallow sores and reddening of the skin. Reports describing this condition were clustered in areas of high angling activity and were made during the striped bass open season. The Fish Health Project in cooperation with Maryland's Department of Agriculture's Animal Health Lab identified a complex of bacteria and fungi in the sores. The causative agent has not yet been identified but Pfiesteria toxicity has been ruled out.     Fisheries Service and Department of Environment Fish Kill Unit biologists responded by phone or personal contact to 50 citizens that called in on the Hotline. Citizens were informed of the present situation and in some cases diseased fish were picked up from callers and diagnoses were attempted or samples of fish were collected by the responding biologists. Several of the calls reported menhaden with lesions and Rapid Response Teams were sent to collect menhaden and determine the proportion of lesioned fish. None of the sampling resulted in finding high numbers of lesioned menhaden.     In early May a Rapid Response Team was sent out to the Pocomoke in response to a report of diseased fish. Trawl and cast net samples on May 8, 9 and 10 found no menhaden and low levels of disease problems in other fish collected.     On August 4 a Fish Health monitoring crew reported high levels of lesions among menhaden collected from the Wicomico River. Repeated sampling by a Rapid Response crew between August 5 and 24 found up to 80% of menhaden with lesions. There was never any evidence of fish kills or erratic behavior by fish and it was felt a closure was not warranted.     On September 3, a large sample number of lesioned menhaden were found in a non-routine cast net sample from the Chicamacomico River. Daily sampling found a high proportion of lesioned menhaden. Again, there was no evidence of a fish kill or erratic behavior. Sampling continued until September 28 when the number of menhaden substantially declined. No closure was enacted.     The routine monitoring and research projects, not specifically involved in Pfiesteria sampling, collected 54% of the total fish examined. Only 0.2% those fish had any sort of cut, wound, infection or other anomaly. Of the 2582 menhaden captured, only 0.7% had any sort of anomaly. In general, Chesapeake Bay fish appear to be healthy although there may be localized or species specific problems which are not related to Pfiesteria.

One purpose of these studies was to monitor for the effects of  Pfiesteria piscicida  and other  Pfiesteri a-like organisms, both to observe impacts on fish populations and communities, and to alert the public should outbreaks of these toxic dinoflagellates occur. A second purpose was to gain better information about the causes, progression and outcomes of the high prevalence of fish abnormalities seen in the Pocomoke River and Sound in 1997.     Toxic  P. piscicida  outbreaks occurred in the Pocomoke system and other tributaries in 1997 in association with fish abnormalities, but there remained questions about whether other factors were involved in the high incidence of fish anomalies. For example, it was clear that some of the less severe lesions seen in commercial fisheries catches were related to physical damage from confinement in traps (pound nets, fyke net and bank traps) and handling. Unfavorable environmental conditions, water quality problems, toxic discharges and epizootic fish diseases also were proposed to explain some or all of the abnormalities.     This report includes results from 1) on-board monitoring of commercial fishery catches in the Pocomoke system; 2) experimental studies conducted to assess physical and physiological responses of caged and uncaged fish exposed to the Pocomoke River and Sound environments; and 3) pathology and microbiology of ulcerated Atlantic menhaden collected from Chesapeake Bay tributaries. Information about Baywide monitoring of fish abnormalities is reported elsewhere (1) .     Commercial Fishery Observations           External abnormalities of fish from Pocomoke River and Sound commercial fisheries were uncommon in 1998, in contrast to observations from 1997. Of 34,942 fish observed from pound net and fyke net catches in 1998, including 44 species, only 0.306% were observed with some form of skin anomaly and only 0.192% possessed a severe skin anomaly (erosions or ulcers). No correlation between fish size (total length) and the occurrence of skin anomalies was observed for any species.   Abrasions were the most commonly observed skin anomaly, followed by erosions and ulcers. A majority of the erosions and ulcers observed were on striped bass. A condition known as ulcerative dermatitis, caused by bacterial infection, has been seen widely in striped bass populations over the past two years, and is under separate investigation. Hemorrhages and tail rot were present in some fish but were less common than other anomalies.     Experimental Studies           Seventeen  in situ  experiments were conducted from April-October 1998, to evaluate the formation and progression of skin anomalies in the lower Pocomoke River. The experimental fish (white perch and striped bass) experienced a consistent progression of common skin anomalies. Confinement of fish in the experimental cages consistently resulted in caudal fin hemorrhage (60-80% of fish). This high percentage of caudal hemorrhage also occurred in the uncaged reference fish, permitted to swim freely in 1000 gallon (3900 L) holding tanks.     The percentage of fish with abrasions was generally 20-60% at all sites, including both caged and uncaged reference experiments. The white perch were abraded by the wire holding cages and physical contact with fish holding tanks. Tail rot typically occurred after 48 hours and steadily increased throughout the experiments. Tail rot was common in fish at all sites including caged and uncaged references. Skin abnormalities were least prevalent in the uncaged reference experiments, indicating that minor skin abnormalities, primarily abrasions and hemorrhage, resulted from caging white perch and striped bass. The occurrence of  severe  skin abnormalities such as erosions and ulcers was very low at all sites, consistent with observations from the nearby commercial catch.     Many fish initially had mild abrasions and caudal hemorrhage, which disappeared as they acclimated to the experimental holding conditions. Some abrasions and caudal hemorrhaging, however, progressed to fungal, viral, or bacterial infections. Abrasions induced by contract with experimental cages and holding tanks often progressed into lymphocystis or formed an erosion which would eventually progress to an ulcer. Fin and tail hemorrhage induced by handing stress and mechanical contract with experimental cages commonly progressed to tail rot. Tail rot sometimes resulted in deterioration of the entire caudal fin within 48 hours after onset and ultimately caused mortality. Although tail rot could proliferate very quickly, most fish  were not severely affected and the experimental period usually ended prior to any mortality.     One of the objectives of the experimental study was to determine whether either the Pocomoke River environment or confinement in cages caused significant physiological stress in fish. Blood samples from caged and uncaged white perch were analyzed for hematocrit (red blood cell concentration), leucocrit (white blood cell concentration), plasma osmolality (roughly equivalent to salt content), plasma chloride concentration and plasma glucose concentration. A pilot study also was conducted to measure acetylcholinesterase (an important enzyme that regulates neuromuscular activity) from the brains of caged and uncaged white perch.     None of the physiological indicators showed differences between caged and uncaged fish large enough to reflect severe stress. The largest differences from mean physiological conditions generally were measured in fish freshly removed from pound nets or fyke nets. These indicators tended to return to mean values after acclimation in the holding tanks. It should be noted that no baseline data on these indicators was available for white perch prior to these studies. The values for the uncaged reference fish are the best available baseline physiology for this species.      Based on pilot work conducted in 1998, we believe that similar experiments can be done in 1999 using Atlantic menhaden, a more fragile species with direct relevance to  Pfiesteria piscicida  toxicity.         Pathology and Microbiology           Atlantic menhaden tissues from four Chesapeake tributaries, the Eastern Shore Wicomico, Annemessex, Chicamacomico, and Nanticoke Rivers, were examined by a fish pathologist. Twenty-four of 27 menhaden (89%) were diagnosed with mycotic granulomatosis, i.e. fungal infections with evidence of specific immune responses by the fish. This diagnosis is equivalent to the ulcerative mycosis thought to be associated with toxic  Pfiesteria piscicida  activity, except that the former designation does not presume that the external ulcers were caused by fungal infection. Bacterial cultures from the internal organs of these menhaden, along with three ulcerated menhaden collected from the Pocomoke River did offer evidence of epizootic bacterial disease.  Aeromonas hydrophila  and  Pseudomonas fluorescens , ubiquitous aquatic species, were the most common isolates. Both species are fish pathogens, but are generally thought to be opportunistic, causing serious infections only stressed or injured fish.      Cultures from liver, kidney and spleen tissues from the experimental white perch also did not show evidence of epizootic bacterial disease.  Aeromonas hydrophila  was the most common isolate; this species was most prevalent in fish that had been caged for over 96h.         Conclusions           • The incidence of external anomalies on commercially harvested fish in the Pocomoke River and Sound was much lower in 1998 than in 1997.     • Atlantic menhaden with ulcers, collected from several Chesapeake tributaries, consistently showed evidence of invasive fungal disease.     • No evidence for acute toxic or pathogenic effects on fish was found either in field sampling or in the experimental deployments in the Pocomoke system during 1998.     • White perch held in  in situ  cages in the Pocomoke system for more than 48h developed abrasions and tail rot, symptoms which became more severe with longer holding times. Mild hemorrhages and abrasions were common even with shorter holding times. Physiological indicators did not show symptoms of severe stress.     • The high incidence of severe anomalies observed in Pocomoke system commercial fisheries during 1997 could not be attributed to effects of the pound nets, fyke nets and bank traps in which they were captured and confined, based on the results of 1998 caging studies and commercial fishery observations.     • The experimental systems and procedures developed during these studies can be employed effectively to monitor and identify potential acute toxic or pathogenic events, and could be used with Atlantic menhaden if great care is taken in capture and transport of the fish.                      SUMMARY              FINDINGS FOR WATER QUALITY, HABITAT AND  PFIESTERIA -RELATED ORGANISMS  -  1988              Prepared by:              Robert Magnien, Dave Goshorn,     Bruce Michael, Peter Tango,     Renee Karrh and Robert Nelson                   Tidewater Ecosystem Assessment Division,     Maryland Department of Natural Resources                   Introduction           During the summer and fall of 1997, Maryland experienced four separate toxic outbreaks of the dinoflagellate,  Pfiesteria piscicida  in three Eastern Shore rivers -- the Pocomoke River, Kings Creek, and the Chicamacomico River. These outbreaks resulted in the deaths of thousands of fish, a high percentage of fish with lesions, and negative impacts to the health of some individuals who came in contact with the affected waterways.     During 1998, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) instituted a monitoring program on the three rivers affected in 1997 and five additional rivers that exhibit similar habitat conditions. The goals of this monitoring program were threefold: first, to protect public health by identifying potential outbreaks as soon as possible, second, to refine our understanding of the environmental factors that contribute to the growth and toxic activity of this very complex organism, and third, to track progress in improving habitat conditions.     Water and habitat quality, including several measures of the phytoplankton community, were monitored monthly at up to 8 to 12 sites in each of the eight monitored rivers, April through October. Additionally, plans were made for intensive, rapid response monitoring of water quality, and phytoplankton if and when unexplainable fish kills or high percentages of fish with lesions were found.         Preliminary Results for 1998 and Comparisons with 1997           Maryland experienced no fish kills or lesion outbreaks in 1998 similar in magnitude to the four 1997 events. During 1998, investigations were made of several limited fish health events. In two cases, a substantially higher than natural percentage of fish were observed with the type of anomalies similar to those associated with toxic  Pfiesteria  outbreaks. One event was at Shiles Creek on the Wicomico River in early August, and the other was on the Chicamacomico River (same site as 1997's outbreak) in early September. Additional fish, water quality, and phytoplankton sampling was initiated at both sites in response to the findings.     During 1997, fish bioassays and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed the presence of toxic  Pfiesteria piscicida  at the time and place of all four fish health events. To date, fish bioassays conducted with samples collected during the two 1998 events have failed to demonstrate that  Pfiesteria  was active in its toxic state. Light microscopy found low levels ( <  130 cells/ml) of a dinoflagellate similar in size to  Pfiesteria  present at both 1998 events, and researchers working on the development of molecular probes specific to  Pfiesteria  have had positive results with water samples collected at the events, suggesting that  Pfiesteria  may have been present at low densities. Toxic activity was eventually demonstrated in a fish bioassay on a sample from the Chicamacomico River after a long incubation, suggesting that  Pfiesteria  was present, but not in an actively toxic state when collections were made. Analysis by SEM to confirm  Pfiesteria's  presence is underway.     Two confirmed toxic outbreaks of  Pfiesteria  occurred on the Pocomoke River during August, 1997. Habitat quality data collected before, during, and after the outbreaks suggests that this could have been the result of a combination of nutrient enrichment, biological activity, and the physical setting. In the vicinity of Shelltown, the Pocomoke River dramatically changes from a relatively deep and narrow river to a wide, shallow, and slow moving river. This change in physical setting provides a more favorable environment (more light, less flushing) for phytoplankton to grow and utilize the high concentrations of nutrients moving downriver. A peak in phytoplankton biomass was seen in the vicinity of Shelltown during August of 1997.  Pfiesteria  feeds on algae during some of its non-toxic stages, and these elevated algal levels could have provided the food supply for large populations of non-toxic  Pfiesteria  to develop. Algae also serve as prey for menhaden, and the blooms may have acted to concentrate schools in this region as demonstrated by research in similar estuaries. Finally, a sharp drop in dissolved oxygen levels immediately upstream of Shelltown may have further concentrated menhaden in this area by restricting their movement upriver. This model suggests the possibility that a combination of 1) a large  Pfiesteria  population and, 2) dense concentrations of menhaden in a slow moving portion of the river, was ideal for  Pfiesteria  to transform to its toxic state and result in the observed fish lesions and kills during August, 1997.     Differences in the timing and amount of rainfall likely prevented the combination of factors that set the stage for toxic outbreaks in 1997 from repeating themselves in 1998. Mid winter through July 1998 was generally wetter on the Lower Eastern Shore than in 1997. As a result, Pocomoke River flow was more than two times greater from January through April, 1998 and May through the third week in July 1998 than during the same periods the previous year. These 1998 differences in flow, especially in the May through late July period, may have resulted in sufficient changes in the timing and location of algal blooms and low dissolved oxygen events to prevent a repeat of 1997's toxic outbreaks.     Flow patterns in 1997 resulted in salinities in the Shelltown region that remained at about 8 ppt from June through September, except for a brief dip in early August due to a storm event. In 1998, salinities in June started at about 2 ppt and gradually rose to 8 ppt in September. These flow patterns appear to have changed the location of the chlorophyll maxima in the river in a similar manner. The effect of flow on the positioning of chlorophyll maxima is a well accepted phenomenon in the Chesapeake Bay. Just as flows in 1997 kept salinities relatively stable, the summer chlorophyll maximum in this year remained primarily in the vicinity of Shelltown, especially in August. In 1998, the chlorophyll maximum moved from downriver of Shelltown in the spring to upriver, near Pocomoke City, in August and September. In 1998, therefore, the summer chlorophyll maximum was not in a location that would have served to concentrate menhaden in the Shelltown region, as hypothesized for conditions in 1997.     Flow patterns may also have influenced the low dissolved oxygen region upriver of Shelltown during summer. In 1998, the severity and extent of this low dissolved oxygen phenomenon was less than it was in 1997. These more favorable habitat conditions may, in turn, have reduced the ""blockage"" effect that was hypothesized as a factor contributing to a possible concentration of menhaden in the Shelltown region. For this type of oxygen depression, which occurred in a non-stratified water column, the higher 1998 summer flows probably lessened the severity and extent by increasing flushing rates.     In general, estuarine nutrient conditions were similar between 1997 and 1998. An exception was observed in orthophosphate concentrations. In 1997, orthophosphate was at high concentrations at and above Pocomoke City from June through September and briefly further downriver following the storm event in early August. These higher concentrations were not observed in 1998 until July and did not penetrate as far downriver in August. Again, flow was the most likely factor contributing to the interannual differences. Soils, sediments and waterbodies in the Pocomoke watershed are known to be highly enriched in phosphorus. Orthophosphate bound to soils and sediments under oxygenated conditions can be released when oxygen levels are very low. It is likely that low oxygen conditions were more prevalent in the watershed (e.g. ditches, streams) as they were in the estuary during 1997 vs. 1998. As previously discussed for the estuary, higher summer flow rates in 1998 probably reduced the severity and extent of low dissolved oxygen conditions in the watershed. The orthophosphate patterns may have influenced the phytoplankton community in general and may have stimulated  Pfiesteria  growth directly, as shown in laboratory studies.     In conclusion, differences in rainfall and flow appear to have changed a number of potentially important environmental factors between 1997 and 1998. The resulting changes to ecological dynamics in the river may have been sufficient to prevent a toxic  Pfiesteria  outbreak from reoccurring in 1998.                      SUMMARY              POCOMOKE WATERSHED POLLUTION ASSESSMENT - 1988                   Prepared By:              Maryland Department of Natural Resources     Maryland Department of the Environment              Background           The Pocomoke River watershed is a combined watershed that includes the drainages of the Pocomoke, Manokin and Big Annemessex Rivers. The Pocomoke River watershed drains approximately 433 sq. mi. of Worcester, Somerset, and Wicomico Counties in Maryland, 38 sq. mi. in Delaware, and 17 sq. mi. in Virginia. The primary tributaries of the Pocomoke River are Dividing (62 sq.mi.) and Nassawango(69 sq.mi.) Creeks. The Manokin and Big Annemessex Rivers drain 163 sq. mi. in Somerset and Worcester Counties, Maryland.     The land cover in the Upper Pocomoke River watershed and the Lower Pocomoke River watershed is forested and agricultural. Forest accounts for 53% of the land use in the Upper Pocomoke and 58% in the Lower Pocomoke. This is slightly less than the overall percentage of forest cover for Maryland's Lower Eastern Shore Tributary Strategy Basin, which is 61% forested. Agricultural land in the Upper Pocomoke accounts for 45% of the land use, while in the Lower Pocomoke it accounts for 36% of the land use. This is slightly higher than the overall percentage of agricultural land for Maryland's Tributary Strategy Lower Eastern Shore Basin, which is 32% agricultural. Urban land in these two subwatersheds accounts for 3% of the land use, while overall in the Lower Eastern Shore Basin, urban land accounts for 5% of the land.      The largest communities in the Pocomoke watershed are Pocomoke City, Princess Anne, Crisfield and Snow Hill.     Agriculture in the watershed is mixed cash grain, vegetable crops and livestock. Corn, soybeans, and small grains are the predominate crops. Poultry production is the main type of livestock agriculture. The annual poultry population is estimated at approximately 22,400,000. The manure produced by all of the livestock in the watershed is estimated to be in excess of 329 million pounds.     The modeled nutrient loads for these two basins are not proportional to the land use. In the Upper Pocomoke basin, 90% of the total nitrogen load is from agricultural land, followed by forested land at 6%, urban land at 2% and point source loads at less than 1 percent. Sources of loads in the Lower Pocomoke are similar to the Upper Pocomoke with 82% of the total nitrogen load from agricultural land, 8% from forested land, 3% from urban land, and 3 % from point source loads. Loads from septic systems and atmospheric deposition to open water make up the difference. For total phosphorus loads, 80% of the load is from agriculture in the Lower Pocomoke, and 97% of the load is from agriculture in the Upper Pocomoke.     In an assessment of the 138 Maryland 8-digit watersheds (of which the Lower Pocomoke River and Upper Pocomoke River are two), a variety of indicators were examined in order to prioritize watersheds for either restoration, protection, or both. These indicators covered water chemistry, aquatic living resources, and landscape characteristics. Both the Lower Pocomoke River and Upper Pocomoke River watersheds were determined to be in need of restoration. The Lower Pocomoke River watershed was also determined to be in need of protection.      In the Upper Pocomoke River watershed, 7 restoration indicators (of 11 pertaining to the watershed) were cause for concern. The most notable of these is the indicator entitled historic wetland loss. This watershed had the most acres of historic wetland loss than any other watershed in the state. 80,903 acres of historic wetlands have been lost. Historically, wetlands covered more than 85% of the watershed.     In the Lower Pocomoke River watershed, 8 restoration indicators (of 12 pertaining to the watershed) were cause for concern. The most notable include the indicators entitled SAV Abundance, SAV Habitat, and Historic Wetland Loss. This watershed received a score of ""most degraded condition"" for SAV Abundance. In fact, all of the MD 8-digit subwatersheds of the Lower Eastern Shore for which there was data, received this score. This watershed also received a very degraded score for SAV Habitat. The Lower Pocomoke River watershed received the second worst score for the state for the historic wetland loss indicator. 71,922 acres of historic wetlands have been lost. Historically, wetlands covered more than 70% of the watershed.         Surface Water Quality Results           Water quality monitoring conducted by MDE and DNR indicates that nutrient concentrations in the fresh water portion of the Pocomoke River system are similar from Snow Hill to the Delaware state line. Total nitrogen concentrations are consistently above 1 mg/l at all sampling sites above Snow Hill. Total phosphorus concentrations are consistently above .1 mg/l.     Concentrations vary with flow and season. Nitrogen concentrations change seasonally throughout the watershed. The highest nitrogen concentrations occur during the winter months when base flows in the ditches and streams are at their highest and the vegetation is dormant. The lowest nitrogen concentrations occur during the summer months when flows are at their lowest, plant uptake is at its peak and the potential for denitrification exists. Many ditches within the watershed support dense vegetative growth along the banks and in the channel. As a result of the growth and decay of the plant material in the ditches and streams, dissolved oxygen in the water column is consumed. Dissolved oxygen concentrations follow the same seasonal patterns as the nitrogen concentrations. Dissolved oxygen levels are highest in the winter and lowest in the late summer. As stated earlier, vegetative growth in the channels creates back water conditions during the growing season. This backwater becomes stagnant during the summer and early fall. Warm, stagnant water with an ample supply of organic material creates an optimal environment for microbial activity. This activity consumes oxygen and with a limited supply of oxygen, ultimately creates anaerobic conditions. Low dissolved oxygen concentrations measured at two small sub-watershed sites within the watershed during the summer months indicates that some of these ditches are anaerobic for extended periods during the late summer. Microbial activity in anaerobic environments consumes nitrate nitrogen releasing nitrogen gas to the environment. Denitrification can be a dominate process in ditches on the lower Eastern Shore (Denver et al. ). In conjunction with plant uptake, denitrification probably contributes significantly to the decreases in nitrate nitrogen concentrations in these ditches during the spring, summer and fall.     Phosphorus concentrations are driven by suspended solid concentrations. During storm flows it appears that elevated suspended solid concentrations are related to sediment in suspension. Suspended solid concentrations and total phosphorus concentrations are also elevated during periods of extended low flow. This may be due to anoxic conditions in the ditches and in the sediment in the ditches. These anoxic conditions may cause phosphorus and iron to be released into solution from the sediment. Once in stream the iron and phosphorus may then reform as a amorphous iron hydroxide that has adsorbed phosphate which remains suspended in solution increasing suspended solid concentrations and phosphorus concentrations (Bricker personal communication).     Nutrient loads and yields have been calculated for the two small sub-watersheds. The nutrient loads are flow driven. Loads increase with increasing flow for all constituents. The seasonal variation in nitrate nitrogen loads due to changes in concentrations that are seen in other watersheds are masked by high nitrate nitrogen loads during high flows.      Nutrient yields are the annual loads discharges from a watershed divided by the acreage of that watershed. The yields allow comparisons to be made from one watershed to the next. Compared to average yields in the literature, the nutrient yields from the small watersheds being monitored in the Upper Pocomoke are elevated (Frink 1991).

From Frink et.al.        Ground Water Quality       The surficial aquifer on the Pocomoke watershed has a high silt and clay. The sediments are poorly drained because of poorly incised steams and flat water-table gradients. In much of this area, drainage ditches have been constructed, which will act to lower the water table. In the area closer to the Chesapeake Bay in the Pocomoke River Basin, the water table is generally shallow and comprised of poorly-drained, low-permeability sediment. The majority of ground-water in surficial aquifers discharges to adjacent streams and is termed ""base flow"". The percentage of total stream flow contributed by base flow ranges from about 42 to 74% (Bachman and others, in press). These data are based on using hydrograph separation techniques at 20 sites with stream flow data.     Nitrate concentrations in the surficial aquifers underlying the Pocomoke River basin generally range from <0.1 to 35 milligrams per liter, with about 10 percent of the samples above the maximum contaminant level of 10 mg/L N as NO3 set by U.S. Environmental Protection agency. The median concentration was 1.1 milligram per liter. These values are based on data collected from 1976 to 1990 (Hamilton and others, p. 45).     The nitrate concentrations appear to be related to land use and the type of sediments in the aquifer and soils. The nitrate concentrations were elevated in agricultural and residential areas in zones where the aquifer consists of sandy deposits (Hamilton and others, p. 65). The sandy composition of the aquifer promotes aerobic conditions under which nitrate is stable. In agricultural and residential areas underlain by clay and silt deposits and anaerobic water, effects of human activities are less evident. The silt and clay deposits can cause lower nitrate concentrations for several reasons (Hamilton and others, p. 65). The anaerobic conditions promote denitrification. The high amounts of clay and silt can inhibit downward movement of fertilizers from the land surface into the water table and have abundant exchange sites for ammonia, which reduces the amount of nitrogen available to reach the water table.     The age of the ground-water can also affect the nitrate concentrations. Knowing the apparent age of ground water can help explain nitrogen concentrations and provide an estimate of how long a management practice may take to be effective. Based on existing data the apparent ground-water ages in the surficial Coastal Plain aquifers range from about 5 to 20 years (Focazio and others, 1998, in press).        Nutrient Budget     Nutrient inputs to the two small sub-watersheds being studied in the Upper Pocomoke are dominated by agricultural sources. On average 96% of the N inputs to these watersheds are supplied by agricultural sources. Crop acreage is roughly 40% corn, 55% soybeans and 5% small grains each year. Typically poultry litter is applied at 5 tons/acre to corn and 2.5 tons/acre to small grains. Soybeans receive no addition nutrient inputs. Total N and P inputs average 291 lbs of N/acre and 67 lbs of P/acre each year.     Annual removal of nutrients through grain harvesting is the largest export of nutrients from the watershed. Nutrient uptake ranges from 139.3 to 184.7 lbs. N / acre of cropland and 19.4 to 34.3 lbs of P/ acre of cropland in these two small watersheds.     Net nutrient inputs to the watersheds vary year to year based on crops and yields. From 1995 through 1997 N surpluses have averaged 147 lbs / acre of cropland and P surpluses averaged 47 lbs of P / acre of cropland.        Watershed Modeling Results     The Chesapeake Bay Program Phase IV Watershed Model (WSM) calculates point and nonpoint source pollutant inputs to Bay watershed streams and the subsequent transport of these pollutants to the Bay. The Pocomoke and Manokin Watersheds are represented by a single segment (Segment 430) in the Watershed Model. Thus one set of model inputs and outputs is used to represent these watersheds.     Land use information in the Watershed Model is based on the Chesapeake Bay Program Land Use coverage (CBPLU). The CBPLU is a combination of EMAP, CCAP, and GIRAS land use data. The Pocomoke watershed extends into Virginia (6%) and Delaware (7%), but is largely contained in Maryland (87%). The watershed in Maryland is roughly 33% agriculture, 48% forest and wetlands, 2% developed land, and 3% water. Agricultural lands are further split into conventional till, conservation till, hayland and pasture base on the 1992 Agricultural census and the Conservation Tillage Information Center.     Nutrient inputs to the model include point sources, septic systems, atmospheric deposition, and manure and chemical fertilizer applied to agricultural lands. Manure inputs to the model are based largely on the 1992 Agricultural Census. Manure is applied to agricultural lands at a rate (137 pounds N per tilled land acre and 40 pounds P per acre in the Pocomoke Watershed) that ensures all manure generated is used. An input rate of 70 pounds N per acre and 20 pounds P per acre is assumed for chemical fertilizer application to tilled land. Atmospheric N is deposited at a rate of 10 pounds per acre to all lands.     The fate of these inputs are modeled (for example, plant uptake accounts for 97 pounds N per tilled acre) by the Watershed Model resulting in land use loading rates to tidal waters given below:                      Convention (lbs/ac)       Conservation (lbs/ac)       Hayland (lbs/ac)       Pasture (lbs/ac)       Forest (lbs/ac)       Developed (lbs/ac)                 Nitrogen       31.5       25       3.7       8.8       1.8       16.5                 Phosphorus       2.6       1.8       0.4       0.3       0.01       0.4                     These loading rates applied to the Watershed Model land use acres result in a load to tidal waters, ignoring Best Management Practice implementation, of 13.4 million pounds of N and 0.16 million pounds of P annually.

SUMMARY: 1998 MONITORING FOR TOXICS IN WATERS DEMONSTRATING TOXIC PFIESTERIA EPISODES: PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF DATA AND COMPARISON TO 1997       Prepared by:     Maryland Department of the Environment              Introduction          In the late summer and fall 1997, a series of fish kill episodes occurred in several water bodies in Maryland?s lower eastern shore, including the Pocomoke River. The fish kills occurred in the absence of other commonly encountered causes (e.g., very low dissolved oxygen, chemical spills) in waters also demonstrating significant incidents of fish lesions (deep, bleeding, and often circular sores) considered typical of those associated with Pfiesteria-like organisms. In response to these episodes, the State undertook a large study to determine possible causes for the fish kills and lesions. Although scanning electron microscopy and fish toxicity bioassays conducted by other investigators subsequently confirmed the presence of toxic life stages of several dinoflagellates, including Pfiesteria piscicida, the State continued investigating other possible contributing factors. Current scientific knowledge suggests that the factors most likely contributing to the presence of toxic Pfiesteria are the natural physical characteristics of the River (especially the broad shallow mouth and deep channel in the upper river), and certain chemical characteristics, both natural (e.g., deeply colored water limiting light penetration) and anthropogenic (e.g., nutrient enrichment). However, acute and/or chronic exposure to certain chemical contaminants are known to cause lesions and kill fish and could play a potential role in the Pocomoke.     To explore toxics as a possible factor in the Pocomoke episodes, concentrations of chemical contaminants in water were evaluated during 1997 and 1998. In the fall 1997, after a 1-1.5 inch rain event, water samples were collected for analysis of a suite of pesticides with reported use in the region, as well as for analysis of trace pesticides and dissolved metals sampled and analyzed using clean technique. Pesticide samples were taken on Day #1 following the storm event, while dissolved metals samples were taken on Day #2.     In the spring 1998, water samples were collected at five locations in the Pocomoke watershed on Day #1 following each of two separate storm events (9 May and 13 June 1998). Both storm events were large enough to produce visible runoff into several tributaries of the Pocomoke River. The two river stations were also sampled a second time, on Day #3 following each storm, to determine if chemical concentrations in the Pocomoke were influenced by period of time after each runoff event.         Objectives        The objectives of 1997-1998 monitoring for toxic substances were:    To determine if chemical contaminants (agricultural pesticides and dissolved metals) are present in the Pocomoke after rain/runoff events (conditions during which pesticides due to contemporary anthropogenic sources approach a near ""worst case"" scenario);    To determine if levels of chemical contaminants observed in fall 1997 and spring 1998 rain/runoff events may possibly be associated with the episodes of fish kills and high fish (menhaden) lesion incidence observed in 1997 in the Pocomoke.            Methods    Grab samples of surface water were collected from the Pocomoke River and three small tributaries to the river following rain/runoff events. Agricultural pesticides receiving substantial use in the region and trace dissolved metals were target analytes. Pesticide analyses were performed by the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) State Chemist Laboratory for both 1997 and 1998 sample collections. Additional trace pesticide analyses were performed by George Mason University (under contract to U.S.Geological Survey) in the fall 1997 and by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (in cooperation with University of Maryland Chesapeake Biological Laboratory) in the spring 1998. Trace pesticide analysis at George Mason University (GMU) and USDA included 14-15 of the MDA analytes (providing inter-laboratory comparison) and addressed analytical sensitivity questions for pesticides (e.g., permethrin) that are highly toxic to aquatic life. Clean technique field collection and analyses for dissolved metals was performed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in 1997. In 1998, dissolved metals were analyzed by the University of Maryland Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL).            Results for 1997 and Preliminary Results for 1998    Fall 1997 and Spring 1998 Results for Pesticides : In the fall 1997, most monitored pesticides were not detected. Of the 14 pesticides found at quantifiable levels, nine were known to receive substantial usage in the watershed (acetochlor, alachlor, atrazine, chlorpyrifos, cyanazine, linuron, metolachlor, metribuzin, and simazine). The remaining five pesticides were not reported to receive substantial usage in the Pocomoke (methyl-parathion, napronamide, prometon, pronamide, and terbacil). All detected pesticides were found in low parts-per-trillion (pptr) or parts per billion (ppb) concentrations and all were within the general ranges commonly found in Maryland streams during other previous USGS fall line and MDE studies.     In the spring 1998, during the period of peak agricultural herbicide and insecticide application, pesticide levels were generally higher, with the exception of chlorpyrifos. The highest levels were found in the tributary stations immediately following runoff, while levels in the River remained at or below several parts per billion. Levels were again found to be similar to those reported elsewhere in Maryland and the Chesapeake Bay region following storm events.     None of these pesticides were found at levels suggesting acute toxicity to fish, aquatic invertebrates, or aquatic plants resident to Maryland.        Fall 1997 and Spring 1998 Results for Dissolved Metals Using ""Clean Technique"": Dissolved metals results for the fall 1997 were reported by USGS in the open file report 99-57, ""Organic Compounds and Trace Elements in the Pocomoke River"", as follows:          ""Initial results indicate that geochemical signatures of some of the dissolved trace elements may be unique to the Pocomoke Basin -- some of the sites sampled had much higher levels of arsenic, selenium, strontium, and lithium than those sampled in other Chesapeake Bay tributaries. At four of the five sampling locations, concentrations of dissolved arsenic ranged from 40 to 67 parts per billion and were more than two orders of magnitude higher than any concentrations measured in 1994 at the Fall Line stations of the Susquehanna, Potomac, James, Rappahannock, York, Choptank, and Nanticoke Rivers. Concentrations of dissolved selenium, strontium, and lithium also were higher by factors of approximately 100, 30, and 50 respectively, than concentrations of these elements measured in 1998 at the Chesterville Branch and Nanticoke River stations of the 1998 Chesapeake Bay Program's Fall Line Toxics Project.""         Levels of arsenic and selenium were inadvertently not determined following the spring 1998 rain/runoff events. Dissolved metals results for the inorganic analytes are summarized by CBL, in ""Amended Final Report- Concentrations of Trace Metal and Pesticides in the Pocomoke River Surface Waters Following Precipitation Events 1998"", as follows:          ""Concentrations of all trace metals except copper were similar to those measured in other tributaries to the Chesapeake Bay, and do not appear to be especially enriched in the Pocomoke River system. The concentration of total copper was elevated in the tributaries on one sampling occasion. Dissolved copper concentrations were also elevated on this occasion. Measurements in the Pocomoke River itself were compromised by an analytical artifact that was not immediately recognized during sample analysis?. Because of the analytical artifacts, further investigation is required to ascertain the copper concentration in the river although the available data (e.g. particulate concentrations) suggests that concentrations are not substantially elevated in the Pocomoke River itself. While the tributary samples should not have been compromised by the analytical artifact, this assumption should also be checked.""              Conclusions and Discussion    Pesticides: Pesticide concentrations in the Pocomoke River and its tributaries after storm events are generally low, vary seasonally, and are similar to those seen in other streams and rivers in the Bay region. Direct chronic toxicity by pesticides resulting in the fish kills or high fish lesion incidence observed in the Pocomoke River also appears to be unlikely. Indirect sub-lethal effects (i.e., effects on fish immune systems in tandem with pathogenic organisms, such as Aphanomyces or Pfiesteria), can not be eliminated from consideration at this time, based on these data. During 1999, MDE will perform an extensive search of the primary scientific literature to determine if there is any evidence associating such effects to low, transient levels of pesticides in surface waters. Since pesticide levels in the Pocomoke were similar to those seen elsewhere in the region where there have not been reports of fish kills and fish lesion incidence such as seen in the Pocomoke in 1997, it currently appears that pesticides were not a significant contributing factor to the Pocomoke's problems.        Dissolved Metals- Fall 1997: Two days following a fall 1997 storm event, USGS found that surface water samples from most of the Pocomoke stations demonstrated elevated levels of dissolved arsenic and selenium. Arsenic and selenium are contained in compounds of known poultry-feed additives and arsenic is believed to be directly excreted by chickens (see USGS report cited previously for further details). Based on reports of relatively high production estimates for chickens in the Delmarva region, it is possible that poultry operations in this region may be contributing relatively large loads of these trace metals to the environment. This premise receives some further support from the results of additional USGS analyses of sediment samples that show levels of arsenic and selenium substantially higher in the Pocomoke and lower eastern shore than levels that USGS finds in sediments in other regions. Further monitoring for these trace elements in the Pocomoke watershed therefore is clearly warranted.     Observed elevations in strontium and lithium are currently unexplained. When further monitoring for arsenic and selenium is conducted in the Pocomoke, it would be interesting to continue to measure the levels of these elements as well.     Thus far, the data for arsenic and selenium are limited to a single sampling. Although collected following a storm event, based on their field observations, USGS concluded that their sampling occurred during base or low flow conditions. Further monitoring for these two elements following storm events as well as during base flow conditions therefore appears warranted. This is especially true since some of the levels of selenium reported by USGS are above Maryland's water quality standards for selenium and some of the levels for arsenic are approaching Maryland?s water quality standards levels.     Dissolved Metals- Spring 1998: With the exception of copper, trace metals analytical results for the spring 1998 storm event collections generally showed levels of metals in the Pocomoke watershed that are within the range seen elsewhere in the Bay region. This suggests that nickel, chromium, lead, zinc, mercury and cadmium were not major contributing factors to the fish kills and other incidents in the Pocomoke in 1997. Levels of copper in the upper region of the watershed also did not appear to be elevated over those seen elsewhere in Maryland, but data for both the lower river and tributary stations are difficult to interpret due to analytical artifacts.     Although sample collections for metals were carried out in both fall and spring seasons, confounding factors prevent sound conclusions from being drawn by direct comparison of the two sets of data collected during the two seasons. There are some differences in their results (e.g., CBL detected significant (order of magnitude) elevations in dissolved copper in two of their tributary stations in the spring 1998, while USGS did not see such significant elevations in the fall 1997) which could be the result of one or more of the following: seasonal and/or hydrogeological differences between the collections; use of different field and analytical methods; as yet unexplained point source or non-point source loadings.     Immediate Future Plans: In an effort to reduce at least one of these confounding factors (use of different field and analytical methods), USGS and CBL will carry out a winter 1998 side-by-side, parallel sample collection and inter-laboratory comparison. Plans as of 1/27/99 call for the collection of two additional spring storm events. It is concluded by USGS, CBL, and MDE that more dissolved metals data are needed to establish potential associations between the concentrations of at least several metals (arsenic, selenium, and copper) and effects on fish health or occurrence of pathogens, as well as the concentrations of metals and the land use and agricultural practices of the region.                               Pfiesteria   Links:     FAQ  |    Monitoring   |  Publications   |  Contact Us   Pfiesteria piscicida  |    Pfiesteria shumwayae                    Search Maryland DNR                                     Search   www.dnr.state.md.us                     Restoration and       Protection  |  Bay Grasses  |      Harmful       Algae  |  Bay Monitoring           Bay Life Guide  |      Bay       Education                      Return to the  Maryland     DNR Home Page .

Required by Section 305(b)            of the federal Clean Water Act, this biennial report also provides a            summary of the Maryland's water pollution control programs, watershed            management efforts and water monitoring programs. This is the first             Maryland 305(b) report  to utilize interim biological criteria to            assess how well the State's non-tidal waters support aquatic life in            terms of fish and benthic macroinvertebrate communities. Application            of biological criteria in this report resulted in a significant            increase in the number of miles of non-tidal waters that do not fully            support a balanced aquatic community (37.2 percent) compared with            results in the 1998 305(b) report which did not utilize biological            criteria (5.6 percent).

The December 2000 version of Maryland's water         monitoring strategy is available online and can be downloaded and read         as an Adobe Acrobat file ( http://www.mgs.md.gov/mwmc/MDStrategyA.html ).         Although this report is narrowly focused on State agency monitoring         plans, Maryland agencies and their staff have a long history of working         on water monitoring efforts with other groups including federal         agencies, local governments, regional agencies, non-governmental         organizations, businesses, and citizens. This report was developed to         meet EPA's needs, but it also will serve as a framework for developing a         more comprehensive Statewide monitoring strategy that will incorporate         other water monitoring activities and provide a basis for more         cooperation and coordination among these groups. The Maryland Water         Monitoring Council ( http://www.mgs.md.gov/mwmc/ )         will play a significant role in helping to develop this comprehensive         strategy in the coming year.                                           A Sea Level Rise Response         Strategy For the State of Maryland ,                     Sea level rise rates along Marylands coastline are nearly         twice those of the global average. Sea level has risen approximately one         foot in the last century and is expected to rise another 2 - 3 feet by         the year 2100. Sea level rise impacts coastal areas by exacerbating         coastal flooding, influencing shoreline erosion, and submerging tidal         wetlands and other low-lying lands. Such impacts pose a significant         threat to the steep cliffs, wetlands and marshes, tidal estuaries, and         sandy beaches, and barrier islands that comprise Marylands coastal         environment. Recognizing the need to begin planning for sea level rise,         a NOAA Coastal Management Fellow with Marylands Coastal Zone         Management Program (CZMP) developed a  Sea Level Rise Response         Strategy for the State of Maryland . The strategy sets forth the         policy and implementation framework for  reducing         the State's overall vulnerability to sea level rise  in the         coming years.                  Lower Eastern Shore         Report ,  This report represents a regional effort to look in         detail at the water quality and living resource issues in Maryland's Lower Eastern Shore,         and the programs available to deal with them.                           The   On-Site Sewage         Disposal System ,  (OSDS), Task Force put a wrap on their intensive         six month work with the submission of this report to the Bay Cabinet on September 10,         1999. Tom Miller, Upper Potomac Trib Team Chair, who Chaired the OSDS Task Force, briefed         Maryland’s Bay Cabinet on the recommendations included in the report. The OSDS Task         Force focused on the policy changes that must occur in order to institutionalize nutrient         reducing non-traditional OSDS technologies while not encouraging unwanted development. The         66 page report includes recommendations for encouraging non-traditional or alternative         nutrient reducing systems, designating areas of special concerns, establishing management         districts, developing verification processes, supporting education needs, and utilizing         shared and community systems.                                       Atmospheric         Deposition in Maryland .         Atmospheric         deposition is an important environmental concern in Maryland and the Chesapeake Bay         region. Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) conducts ongoing efforts to         evaluate the sources of atmospheric deposition and its impacts to Maryland’s natural         resources. Through the Power Plant Research Program, DNR has developed this fact sheet to         provide information on the environmental effects of atmospheric deposition and to discuss         recent status and trends .

This Plan proposes a new collaborative effort by state, federal, and local governments, the private sector and the public to restore those watersheds not meeting clean water and other natural resource goals and to sustain healthy conditions in watersheds that currently meet these goals. The Clean Water Action Plan addresses all aspects of watershed condition: water quality, including public health issues; aquatic living resources; physical habitat and the landscape. The key steps in this national effort are:      Unified Watershed Assessment  - The Unified Watershed Assessment (UWA) uses the best available information to assess the condition of each State's watersheds, identify watersheds in need of restoration, identify watersheds that need preventive action to sustain water quality and aquatic resources, and identify pristine or sensitive watersheds that need extra protection.      Watershed Restoration Priorities  - Based on the UWA, States will establish watershed restoration priorities by October 1998. This involves selecting those watersheds not meeting clean water and other natural resource goals that are most in need of restoration actions during the next two years.      Watershed Restoration Action Strategies  - will identify the most important causes of water pollution and resource degradation, detail the actions needed to address these problems, and set milestones by which to measure progress. Funds available to federal agencies through the federal FY 1999 Clean Water and Watershed Restoration Budget Initiative will be used to help States implement these strategies.    This report describes Maryland's Unified Watershed Assessment, Watershed Restoration Priorities and process under development to identify and implement Watershed Restoration Action Strategies. It was prepared by the Maryland Clean Water Action Plan Technical Workgroup and subject to policy review by a group including Maryland's Chesapeake Bay Cabinet Secretaries and the Maryland Natural Resource Conservation Service State Conservationist. Comments received from other local governments, State and federal agencies, interest groups and the public based on draft reports produced in August and October 1998 were considered in this revision of the report. Also, public comments received through mid-October and comments received during six regional workshops held in cooperation with the Tributary Strategies Teams in September 1998 were considered. The Technical Workgroup established a committee focused on drinking water sources to review the CWAP information in these watersheds in response to comments received about the poor weighting given to these watersheds given their import as a human health issue.     Final recommendations on the Technical Committee's Priority Restoration watersheds and Selected Protection watersheds were forwarded to the Clean Water Action Plan Steering Committee on December 21, 1998. This report includes those final recommendations.       UNIFIED WATERSHED ASSESSMENT     Purpose    The purpose of the Unified Watershed Assessment is to assess the condition of Maryland's watersheds and, based on watershed condition, classify the watersheds into the following categories:     Category 1 - Watersheds not meeting clean water and other natural resource goals and needing restoration     Category 2 - Watersheds currently meeting goals that need preventive actions to sustain water quality and aquatic resources     Category 3 - Pristine or sensitive watersheds that need an extra level of protection    NOTE : The Clean Water Action Plan and the final federal Guidelines issued on June 9, 1998, applied Category 3 only to watersheds on state or federal lands. Maryland is applying this category to all of the State's watersheds, since the identification of watersheds throughout the state that either contain pristine watershed resources or are particularly sensitive can assist many local and state programs beyond the Clean Water Action Plan, such as Rural Legacy and incentive programs for stream buffers and wetland restoration.    Category 4 - Insufficient data    The Unified Watershed Assessment (UWA) provides the foundation for setting watershed restoration, protection, and preservation priorities. Accordingly, the UWA needs to consider all components of the watershed related to aquatic systems including biological, physical, and chemical characteristics and related landscape factors.      Watershed Scale    States are able to make assessments for watersheds at multiple scales under the Clean Water Action Plan, but the hydrologic unit ""basins"" established by the U.S. Geological Survey are to serve as the common scale for unified watershed assessments at the national level. There are portions of 20 of these federal basins in Maryland ( Figure 1 ), with an average area in Maryland of about 500 square miles (for comparison, the average area of a Maryland county is about 400 square miles). The condition of the Maryland portion of these federal basins can be determined either directly or as a result of aggregation of assessments of smaller watersheds. Maryland has chosen the latter approach because information at smaller watershed scales will be invaluable when Watershed Restoration Action Strategies are prepared.   Figure 1       Maryland has identified smaller watersheds ( Figure 2 ) at scales that, for the most part, fall inside or ""nest"" within the larger federal basins. For this report, the State's assessment is focused on smaller watersheds. There are 138 of these State-defined ""8-digit"" watersheds in Maryland, each with an average area of about 75 square miles. The relationships between the State's Tributary Strategy watersheds, the State's ""8-digit"" watersheds and the federal hydrologic units are shown in  Appendix I .     Figure 2        Local governments and other agency studies may identify even smaller watersheds that nest within this Statewide system. Identifying intensive monitoring and restoration activities by state and local governments or non-governmental organizations within these sub-watersheds may be desirable when reviewing watershed priorities or establishing watershed restoration action strategies.      Overall Goals    Two overarching goals were considered in the assessment of Maryland watersheds:     Clean Water Goals - Maryland watersheds should meet water quality standards, including numerical criteria as well as narrative standards and designated uses.     Other Natural Resource Goals - Watersheds should achieve healthy conditions as indicated by natural resource indicators related to the condition of the water itself (e.g. water chemistry), aquatic living resources and physical habitat, as well as landscape factors (e.g. buffered streams and wetland restoration).       Clean Water Goals    To evaluate  clean water goals , the assessment generally examined single factors that result in, or cause, a violation of the numeric/narrative water quality standards described in the Code of Maryland Regulations (§26.08.02). The State's biennial water quality report, required by Section 305(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments, is a primary source of information about water quality impairments in the State. This report provides a summary of violations of State water quality standards as well as information about defined use impairments such as shellfish harvesting closures, swimming and water contact bans, fish consumption advisories. Much of the summary data about impaired waters and violations of State water quality standards in the 305(b) report are used to develop the list of impaired waters required under Section 303(d) of the Act. The final, EPA-approved listing of impaired waters on the State's 303(d) list through 1998 was incorporated in this Unified Watershed Assessment report.      Other Natural Resource Goals    To evaluate  other natural resource goals , multiple and cumulative impacts that prevent watersheds from achieving healthy watershed conditions were assessed using selected natural resource indicators (listed below). These indicators relate to the condition of water chemistry, aquatic living resources, physical habitat and landscape.   Initial assessments used existing data from state monitoring and assessment programs. These constitute the core data for the Unified Watershed Assessment. In addition, supplemental information was solicited from several hundred individuals and organizations, such as local governments and community watershed associations, encouraging them to submit available water quality and aquatic resource information ( Appendix II ). Some supplemental data was received and results were evaluated and applied to assessment and prioritization activities.      Watershed Assessment Methods    In this section, the term ""indicator"" is widely used. Assessing the condition of the State's water quality and natural resources is a difficult undertaking. Not only are these natural conditions complex, but various human activities and impacts adds to the level of complexity.   One way to present the condition of our watersheds is to develop understandable measures or indicators that provide information about these resources. Scientists, managers and the public can use this information to determine the status of these resources, determine information about the pressures that degrade environmental quality, evaluate programs or changes in behavior designed to improve the environment. Over time, indicators help us measure our progress towards meeting our goals.     Category 1 (Restoration) Watersheds     Both the violation of water quality standards, as reflected by inclusion on the 303(d) List, as well as poor values for other natural resource indicators, are used as criteria for determining whether a watershed is classified as a Category 1 watershed ""in need of restoration"":     waters that appear on the 303(d) List are identified as Category 1 watershed and require some restoration action(s) in order to meet water quality standards (some of these watersheds also may require restoration in order to meet other natural resource goals); or     waters that are  not  on the 303(d) List, but require restoration in order to meet other  two or more natural resource goals  are identified as Category 1 watersheds.    Many data sets that could be used as natural resource indicators were examined. A minimal number of indicators were selected that would provide the most accurate, non-duplicative, and comprehensive assessment of watershed condition. These indicators could be grouped into several major ""clusters"" that focused on the key areas of watershed condition:   Water Chemistry     Monitored data for nutrients (total nitrogen, total phosphorus), suspended sediments, and indicators of over-enrichment (chlorophyll a, summer bottom dissolved oxygen and Secchi depth)     Modeled nutrient loadings (total nitrogen and total phosphorus)    Aquatic Living Resources     Submerged aquatic vegetation coverage and habitat requirements     Indices of the health of tidal and non-tidal fish and benthic communities    Instream physical habitat   Landscape     Impervious surface     Population density     Historic wetland loss     Unbuffered streams     Soil erodibility    Data sources and methods of calculation for these indicators are briefly discussed in  Appendix III . More information about these indicators are available as ""metadata"" on the State's Clean Water Action Plan Internet site ( www.dnr.state.md.us/cwap/metadata.pdf ). A set of ""watershed profiles"" for each of the State watersheds that summarizes these indicators is available in a separate report ( Maryland Watershed Profiles , MD Dept. Natural Resources, 1998); an example is shown in  Appendix IV  of this report. Each profile includes a detailed map of the watershed, including sub-watershed boundaries, and a summary listing of data for the watershed).   To determine if a watershed does not meet a Natural Resource Goal, one of two decision-making criteria is used:     An indicator value does not meet an established goal or benchmark level; or     An indicator for which there is no established goal or benchmark level has a value among the worst 25 percent of all watersheds assessed by that indicator.    As an example of the first case, a Non-tidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity score less than 6.0 indicates that fish communities in the watershed's streams are in poor condition, so the basin fails to meet that Natural Resource Goal. As an example of the second case, a watershed where the impervious surface coverage indicator was among the  highest  (i.e. worst) 25 percent among the State's watersheds would identify that basin as failing to meet that Natural Resource Goal.   Application of these criteria is described in  Appendix III . Benchmarks or thresholds for each indicator are listed in  Table 1  and the resulting data for each watershed are listed in  Table 2 .     Table 1.

As such, any watershed that is not on the 303(d) List  and  meets all or all but one of the available Category 1 benchmarks in  Table 1  was placed in Category 2.     Category 3 (Protection) Watersheds     Indicators selected to identify watersheds needing restoration (Category 1) are not necessarily the same indicators that might be used to identify pristine or high quality (Category 3) watersheds that might need additional levels of protection.   Many data sets were examined that would provide an accurate, unique and comprehensive assessment of desired, high quality water quality, natural resource or landscape conditions. Some of the selected Category 3 living resources indicators for pristine watersheds are the same as Category 1 indicators for watersheds needing restoration while others are not. For example, there are no tidal watersheds considered to have pristine or sensitive benthic communities, so the Tidal Benthic IBI used for Category 1 watersheds is not used to help identify Category 3 watersheds.      Other indicators appear useful only in assessing Category 3 watersheds. For example, trout spawning areas are an indicator of relatively pristine natural conditions and is used as a Category 3 indicator. This indicator would not be useful for Category 1 watersheds as the absence of trout spawning areas does not necessarily imply that a stream is degraded - it may never have had the natural conditions that are prerequisite for trout spawning. These indicators can be clustered under key living resource and landscape issues and others address special water use needs (i.e., drinking water and fish hatchery water supply):  Living Resources         Instream physical habitat     Indices of the health of non-tidal and tidal fish communities     Wetland dependent species     ""Imperiled"" (rare, threatened and endangered) aquatic species     Trout spawning areas     Migratory fish spawning areas    Landscape     Headwater stream systems in interior forest     Forest density     Designated State Wildlands    Drinking water source protection watersheds, and   Fish hatchery water supply watersheds  Application of these indicators is described in  Appendix III  and results were compared to Category 3 indicators benchmarks that are listed in  Table 3 . Any watershed with two or more indicators meeting these criteria was placed in Category 3. As with Category 1 indicators, the results of Category 3 indicators are provided in the available ""watershed profiles"" ( Maryland Watershed Profiles , MD Dept. Natural Resources, 1998 (see example in  Appendix IV ) .   Table 3.

Although the data available for different watersheds varies, the Workgroup determined that there was sufficient data to classify all State watersheds as Category 1, 2 or 3.      Results - State Watershed Level    The assessment results are summarized below. Category 1 (Restoration) watersheds are shown in  Figure 3  and listed in  Table 5 . Watersheds with, at most, one indicator exceeding goals and not being identified on the State's 303(d) list, were identified as Category 2 (Preventative Action) watersheds (clear areas in  Figure 3 ) . Category 3 (Protection) watersheds are listed in  Table 6  and shown in  Figure 4 . Watersheds with four or more indicators meeting Category 3 goals were listed as ""Selected Category 3 Watersheds"" ( Table 6  and shown in  Figure 5 ). All watersheds had sufficient data to allocate them to Category 1, 2 or 3 - thus, there are  no  Category 4 watersheds.   Because the selection criteria used for Category 1 (Restoration) and Category 3 (Preservation) watersheds are not the same and because land use and related factors may vary considerably within such a large watershed, many of the State's watersheds are identified as both Category 1 and 3 watersheds. These watersheds show signs of stress or degradation but still contain pristine or sensitive natural resources. For example, a watershed may have undisturbed headwaters but be significantly developed at its mouth. Unless watersheds are assessed at a scale where the land use is relatively homogeneous, Category 1 and Category 3 classifications are not mutually exclusive.      Figure 3          Members of the Technical Workgroup and others observing the process suggested that some watersheds with special characteristics should be considered for listing as Protection watersheds in addition to those identified using the selected indicators. After publication of the August 1998 draft report, the following was added to the Category 3 watershed list:      Seneca Creek  - Data submitted by Montgomery County as well as State data indicates that Seneca Creek has exceptionally pristine headwater streams    Additional comments received in public hearings held around the State in September 1998 to discuss the Plan, and comments received in writing or at other public forums where the Clean Water Action Plan was discussed were considered by the Technical Workgroup. Several additional watersheds with special characteristics in need of protection were added to the Selected Category 3 list after the October 1, 1998 draft report was produced:      Chincoteague Bay  - This waterbody is part of the Coastal Bays National Estuary Program, a boundary area of the National Wildlife Refuge that remains relatively pristine and undisturbed, and;      Zekiah Swamp  - Designated as a State Scenic River, this watershed has unique ecological characteristics and remains relatively undisturbed, but adjacent to an urbanizing area.       Table 5.

A committee of selected representatives of State and local government agencies examined these issues and recommended to the Workgroup that several watersheds be added to the Category 1 and 3 lists. The Workgroup reviewed this list and added one watershed to the Category 1 (Restoration) list:      Brighton Dam (Triadelphia Reservoir)  - This reservoir supplies water through Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission system to the Maryland suburban area of Washington, DC. The watershed is included in the recent Patuxent River Reservoir protection agreement.    The Technical Workgroup also listed three other water supply watersheds as Selected Category 3 (Protection) watersheds:      Loch Raven Reservoir -  This reservoir provides water to Baltimore City and to some of the surrounding suburban areas. The reservoir is included in the Reservoir Protection Agreement designed to protect and restore water quality for this significant drinking water source.      Rocky Gorge Dam (Duckett Reservoir)-  This reservoir provides water through the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission to the Maryland suburban area of Washington, DC. The watershed is included in the Patuxent River Reservoir protection agreement.

Thus, federal Category 1 basins include those where the area of component Maryland Category 1 watersheds comprise at least 15 percent of the area of the federal basin (in Maryland). In following this guidance,  all  of the federal basins in Maryland with any significant size are identified as Category 1 watersheds.   The State's interpretation of the Unified Watershed Assessment guidelines is that a federal basin can be placed in only one of the four Categories. If a federal basin has characteristics of both Category 1 and Category 3, it will be listed as Category 1 in the federal compilation. This same decision rule is applied to Category 2 watersheds as well as Category 4 watersheds (of which there are none in Maryland). Therefore, for purposes of reporting results aggregated to the level of the federal basins, we place each federal basin only in one category, Category 1 ( Table 7 ;  Figure 6 ).      Table 7.

These are defined as Category 1  Priority  Watersheds. Furthermore, the schedule for these restoration and protection actions must be coordinated with the State's schedule to determine Total Maximum Daily Loads for pollutants from watersheds on the Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act.   Results - State Watershed Level    The Clean Water Action Plan Technical Workgroup reviewed a number of methods for identifying Priority Watersheds. As results generated for each method was examined, it was determined that the different methods produced similar results when selecting priority watersheds. This produced confidence that the overall approach actually reflects the condition of the watersheds (and their need for restoration) and not just the particular method selected.   Category 1 Priority Watersheds were defined as watersheds that failed to meet at least half of their goals; i.e., at least half of the indicators had values failing to meet Category 1 benchmarks listed in  Table 1 . This method gives full consideration of all watersheds (since it does not ""penalize"" regions for which fewer statewide data are available, such as the Coastal Bays) and it is simple to calculate. The principal drawback is that this method equally weighs all 17 indicators. As a result, if there are more indicators that relate to a particular aspect of watershed health; e.g. biological integrity, these areas could carry more weight in the ranking process.   The Technical Workgroup recognized that other factors also should be examined to see if they warrant including additional watersheds in the Category 1 Priority list. These included severity of impact (e.g.  Pfiesteria  outbreaks) and evaluation of new data. For these reasons, three additional watersheds were included in the Category 1 Priority list in the August draft report:      Transquaking River  - One of the three watersheds that experienced an outbreak of the toxic microorganism Pfiesteria in 1997 (the Manokin and Lower Pocomoke already are listed).      Georges Creek  - Some streams in this watershed have biological communities in exceptionally poor condition.      Deep Creek Lake  - Some streams in this  watershed  have biological communities in exceptionally poor condition - this does not apply to the biological condition of the lake itself.    Information received from the Bureau of Mines after the August 1998 draft report was produced was evaluated by the Technical Workgroup. These data showed that some streams in Western Maryland have biological communities in exceptionally poor condition; the Workgroup added the  Upper North Branch Potomac River  to the list of Category 1 Priority watersheds.   Comments received at public hearings held in the State in September and in writing were considered by the Technical Workgroup. The Department of Agriculture had identified the  Upper Choptank River  watershed as a priority watershed for potential nutrient loading to Chesapeake Bay. As other priority watersheds already were identified as Category 1 Priority watersheds, the Workgroup added this watershed after the October 1 draft report was produced.   Members of the Technical Workgroup and some public comments received on the draft report suggested that watersheds that serve as part of significant public drinking water supplies also should be considered for restoration and protection. A committee of selected representatives of State and local government agencies examined these issues and recommended to the Workgroup that several watersheds be added to the Category 1 and 3 lists. The Workgroup reviewed this list and added five water supply watersheds as Category 1 Priority watersheds:      Loch Raven, Prettyboy and Liberty Reservoir watersheds  - These reservoirs provide water to Baltimore City and to some of the surrounding suburban areas. These watersheds are included in the Reservoir Protection Agreement designed to protect and restore water quality.      Rocky Gorge Dam (Duckett Reservoir) and Brighton Dam (Triadelphia Reservoir)  - These reservoirs provide water to the Maryland suburban area of Washington, DC through the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission. These watersheds are included in the Patuxent Reservoir agreement to protect water quality.    These Category 1 Priority watersheds ( Table 8 ,  Figure 7 )  are recommended for restoration actions during the next two years. It is important to remember that many other Category 1 watersheds also warrant restoration actions. On-going and planned restoration activities in these watersheds will continue and that future efforts, funded by federal, State and local funds, will address these watersheds.      Table 8.

Fewer watersheds are identified both as  Category 1 Priority watersheds   and   Selected Category 3 watersheds  ( Table 9 ;  Figure 8 ). The State considers that these watersheds deserve special attention in order to address degradation that already is experienced in some areas before the pristine resources in the watershed are lost.      Table 9.

Projects located in a Category 1 Priority watersheds will be considered as a second priority for funding. There are other criteria that will be used to review projects for funding including: maximizing water quality, habitat protection/restoration and other natural resource goals; addressing locally defined geographic priorities at scales smaller than the 138 watersheds evaluated in the Unified Watershed Assessment; using Section 6217 (Coastal Zone Management) measures that are a required part of the coastal nonpoint source pollution program; addressing issues of statewide concern (e.g., nutrient management, habitat goals for wetlands, siting/operation of septic systems, acid mine drainage, growth management); help achieve water quality standards in areas listed on Maryland's 303(d) list; partnering (support/endorsement) with Tributary Teams; implement recommendations contained in an existing watershed restoration strategy; and located within or supporting an EQUIP priority area.         Figure 8           Results - Federal Basin Level    In terms of identifying federal Category 1 Priority basins, the same procedure used to identify federal Category 1 basins was used to aggregate information from the smaller Maryland watersheds to the larger federal basins. In following the federal Clean Water Action Plan guidance federal Category 1 Priority basins include those where the area of the State's Category 1 Priority watersheds comprise at least 15 percent of the area of the federal basin (within Maryland). In following this guidance, nearly all of the federal basins in Maryland with any significant size are identified as Category 1 Priority basins ( Table 10 ;  Figure 9 ).   Table 10.

Assessment information from Virginia's draft report, which would address nearly half of the seventeen interstate federal watersheds, was not provided for analysis. Differences between State interpretation of watershed assessment categories were principally related to the amount of assessment information available.   Identifying Category 1 Priority watersheds in these draft reports showed considerably more variability between States as a result of regional water quality issues, local priorities and different approaches to prioritization. Pennsylvania had not completed their prioritization process. Delaware's prioritization process is governed by a formal consent decree with the US Environmental Protection Agency rather than water quality and other natural resource goals. It is expected that the federal Clean Water Action Plan report to Congress will address interstate variability in the assessment.   An example of a potential impact of different assessments of interstate watersheds was demonstrated in comments received from the Susquehanna River Basin Commission on the Maryland's draft Unified Watershed Assessment report. The letter noted that Pennsylvania might identify the Lower Susquehanna River basin as a Category 1 Priority watershed while Maryland identified its portion of the watershed as a Category 1 (Protection) watershed but not as a Category 1  Priority  watershed.   This difference is mainly due to watershed scale and differences in land use with Maryland's portion of the Lower Susquehanna River basin being one of the smallest in the State. Maryland does recognize the importance of upstream activities to Susquehanna River water quality conditions that affect Chesapeake Bay and would support designation of the Lower Susquehanna River basin as a federal Category 1 Priority basin if funding opportunities for activities and discharges in the larger upstream portion of the watershed in Pennsylvania and New York would be affected by this designation. The State would consider similar support for other interstate basins where State assessment categories differ.       PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT PROCESS     A Steering Committee has been formed to guide the Clean Water Action Plan process in Maryland. The Committee - made up of representatives from the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, the Department of Natural Resources, the Department of Environment, the Department of Agriculture, the Office of Planning, river commissions, Tributary Teams and local governments - outlined the principles that are guiding the State's development of Watershed Restoration Action Strategies.   In addition, a Technical Workgroup was formed to review existing information on watershed conditions and draft the Unified Watershed Assessment. The workgroup included a diverse group of interests: State agencies, local governments, Tributary Teams, environmental and watershed organizations, the Farm Bureau and others.   Outreach included six regional public meetings ( Appendix V ), hosted by Maryland's Tributary Teams, held around the State that reached over 300 people, including representatives of local governments, soil conservation districts, watershed organizations, educators, and citizens. Press releases were sent out to local newspapers, and meeting notices were sent to every county library in the State. Briefings have also been provided to the Tributary Teams, the Chesapeake Bay Program, watershed organizations, and other groups upon request.   In addition, the executive summary of the report was sent out to approximately 500 people. The executive summary and the report, background material, summary of comments and links to other Clean Water Action Plan sites are available to the public on the Department of Natural Resources web site:  www.dnr.state.md.us/cwap . A mirror site also will be available on the Department of the Environment's Internet site.   Public comments received to date have touched on a range of issues. Common concerns have included:  the future impacts of growth on watersheds;     the need to coordinate the many programs that address water quality and natural resources;     the need to coordinate programs and restoration efforts across State boundaries;     the need to better enforce existing regulations;     the need for additional monitoring information on water bodies;     the importance of protecting watersheds in good condition;     the importance of public education on watershed restoration and protection;     the importance of involving local governments that are responsible for making land use decisions; and     site specific concerns about watershed conditions, water quality, and living resources.    Many of these comments relate to implementation, rather than assessment issues, and will be considered in the implementation phase. Public comments on this report were accepted through October 15, and were considered in final revisions to this report.       WATERSHED RESTORATION ACTION STRATEGIES     The State's long term objective is to have Watershed Restoration Action Strategies (WRAS) that are comprehensive, and address all aspects of watershed condition and water quality, including public health; aquatic living resources; physical habitat and the landscape.   A WRAS will provide information and guidance that will help the public, watershed organizations, and federal, state and local agencies focus their staff and monies in areas and on issues important to the public and that will result in measurable environmental improvement.   The strategies may be drawn from existing assessment and targeting efforts such as a county's comprehensive plan, stormwater and sewer plans, capital budgets, greenways and open space plans, watershed stewardship programs, site design standards/BMPs, erosion and sediment control plans, soil conservation district watershed work plans and other efforts.   A comprehensive strategy includes the following:     A watershed-wide assessment of existing and anticipated future conditions that significantly affect water quality and natural resources. The assessment should identify the principal sources and relative contributions of point and nonpoint source pollution; major sources of habitat loss; and threats to drinking water; aquatic life, and natural resources critical to maintaining the integrity of the watershed.     Measurable environmental and programmatic goals and a timeframe for achieving significant milestones/accomplishments.     A public involvement process that provides mechanisms for informing the public and incorporating their concerns and priorities.     A process for targeting individual projects for preventive or remedial activities (e.g. identifying appropriate areas to implement best management practices and buffer strips that will maximize the achievement of clean water and other natural resource goals.     A water quality and natural resources monitoring element that utilizes existing and supplemental data sources to document current and future changes occurring in the watershed.     A process to routinely evaluate the effectiveness of projects and/or systems and their progress toward achieving environmental and programmatic goals.    WRAS need to be developed for watersheds in need of protection and restoration. The State has a number of ""strategies"" at the state and local level that include recommendations for water quality and natural resource restoration or protection. These existing strategies can form the foundation for strengthened, more comprehensive strategies that will maximize benefits for water quality and natural resource goals in a more holistic, coordinated manner.   Many strategies contain recommended ""on the ground"" implementation efforts to improve water quality and meet other natural resource goals such as aquatic health and habitat. Strategy actions will be supported through new funds authorized by the  Clean Water Action Plan  and channeled through existing programs such as §319, as well as through other State and local programs.   Watershed restoration strategies will be encouraged to:     coordinate restoration strategies with TMDL's;     address locally defined geographic priorities at smaller scales than the 134 watersheds evaluated in the Assessment;     address an issue of statewide concern, such as nutrient reduction;     rely on a partnership approach, including work with Tributary Teams and the Coastal Bays Program; and     use Coastal Zone Management Act §6217 management measures.    Over the longer term, the Steering Committee will also address such outstanding issues as the potential for targeting additional funds to the Priority watersheds, future revisions to the Priority watershed list and the need to further coordinate the State's watershed restoration and protection efforts.      Pilot Lower Eastern Shore Conservation and Action Strategy    The Lower Eastern Shore has been selected as a pilot area for the development of the State's first Clean Water Action Plan Strategy. The purpose of this strategy is to coordinate and help to focus both ongoing restoration and conservation activities and potential new restoration funding available under the federal program. The Lower Eastern Shore Action Strategy is being coordinated through the Lower Eastern Shore Tributary Team with the assistance of State agencies. Local governments, the Tributary Team, Delaware state agencies, and other interested citizens and organizations will also be involved in strategy development and implementation.   The initial phase the action strategy will take the analysis in the Unified Watershed Assessment to a more detailed scale, comparing watersheds within the region to identify those most in need of restoration action, those with the greatest conservation values, and opportunities for restoration and protection. Such opportunities might include economic development interests, tourism and recreation initiatives, or the presence of a watershed association already involved in related activities. Since specific local water quality problems require specific solutions, the second phase of strategy development will be to match appropriate tools and new federal funding to particular projects in the impacted watersheds.       CONCLUSIONS     The federal Clean Water Action Plan has stimulated a comprehensive statewide assessment of Maryland's watersheds including a diverse set of factors addressing all aspects of watershed condition. This assessment has involved a broad spectrum of participants from local, state and federal agencies and representatives of many private organizations.   Much additional work to refine our assessment procedures remains to be done, since the time provided to accomplish this initial assessment has been very brief, given the magnitude of the undertaking. As mentioned above, review and evaluation of the available data, some of which is preliminary, will continue. In addition, these data will be supplemented by comments and suggestions from the public workshops, additional local and regional watershed data, and data obtained through mutual exchange with surrounding jurisdictions for interstate watersheds. As a result, the findings and conclusions contained in this report, including watershed restoration priorities, can be expected to undergo modification in the future.   The potential benefits of this approach for Maryland's watersheds are significant. The results of this process will ultimately provide a comprehensive framework which other programs can utilize to conduct coordinated activities on individual watershed issues. These benefits will only increase with the further evolution of the Clean Water Action Plan's Watershed Approach.  Go to  Glossary and Appendices    Go to  Clean Water Action Plan page"

The Program relies on creating partnerships to advance long and short- term goals for nonpoint source pollution control. State agencies assist local governments -- which are primarily responsible for implementation of nonpoint sourc e control measures -- by identifying water quality and resource problems, helping watershed planning efforts, and selecting and implementing management practices tailored to the source and area, as well as directing funding programs to help support those p ractices. The Nonpoint Source Program's 2001 annual report summarizes pollution prevention and control efforts in broad management categories. During the past year, significant progress has been made toward achieving a variety of management measures and program goals including: the development of Watershed Restoration Action Strategies, nutrient management plans, the creation of hundreds of miles of forested buffers, the expanded number of marinas pledging and certified as Clean Marinas, implementation of Phase II Stormwater Management (SWM) guidelines, addressing the On Site Sewage Disposal (OSDS) issue, and increased funding for land preservation, stream restoration and wetland creation.  Introduction Nonpoint source pollution (NPS) is runoff caused by stormwater (rainfall or snowmelt) or irrigation water moving over and through the ground. As this runoff moves, it picks up and carries away pollutants, such as sediments, nutrients, toxics, and pathogens. These pollutants are eventually deposited in lakes, rivers, wetlands, coastal waters, ground waters and the Chesapeake and Coastal Bays. Point source or end of pipe pollution historically has been easier to control than nonpoint source pollution because the source of the pollution is evident. Nonpoint sources of pollution are very diverse and diffuse, not only making the identification, but control, of the pollution sources challenging  Integrated Management of CWA Section 319 and NOAA Coastal Zone Programs Evolving ever since its original inceptio n in 1987, Maryland's Nonpoint Source (NPS) Program is operated in an integrated fashion with Maryland's Coastal Zone Program. The Program has a large number of state and local partners and is based on two authorities: the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) section 319 and Section 6217 of the Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1990  the Coastal Nonpoint Program. In March 2000, EPA approved the NPS Program Management Plan document update that completely revised the original. A number of priorities were identified in the updated management plan as long- term, statewide nonpoint source goals, including watershed programs and initiatives, and partnerships offering educational outreach and financial assistance.  1   Of these priorities, watershed programs a nd initiatives support not only the targeting of nonpoint source pollution control resources, but the Coastal Zone Program goals of: (1) sustainable coastal communities; (2) sustainable coastal ecosystems; and (3) government efficiency. In 2001, funding for the development of local watershed management plans and strategies was made available under two mechanisms: 1) the Clean Water Act Section 319 -- Nonpoint Source Program planning funds, and 2) Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) Section 309  Coastal Enhancement Strategy funds. In addition, the Coastal Nonpoint Source Program funds were targeted within the coastal zone (comprising 66% of Maryland's area) to address septic systems, fund clean marina programs, and measure success.  Watershed Initiatives In 2001, Maryland continued several interrelated watershed initiatives: 1) WRAS Partnership Program, 2) Chesapeake Bay 2000 Watershed Planning Commitment, and 3) Coastal Bays Comprehensive Coastal Management Plan.  WRAS Partnership Program In 2001, Mar yland's premier watershed strategy tool was the Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) Partnership Program. The Program links the state and various local governments in jointly developing action strategies. WRAS watershed targeting is based on Mar yland's Clean Water Action Plan (1998), which called for the assessment of the condition of all the state's waters. The resulting Unified Watershed Assessment (UWA) defined a set of those watersheds that were most in need of restoration  the Category 1 Priority Watersheds. Funding for development and implementation of WRASs is provided from both the 319 and Coastal Zone Management Programs, and is targeted to Category 1 Priority watersheds, with top priority being those Category 1s with special areas ne eding preservation (watersheds sharing Category 3 characteristics). Development of strategies for individual watersheds is a local government - led process resulting in the development of priority water quality and habitat preservation and restoration actio ns within a comprehensive management context. Watershed management planning is primarily a county level function, with the assistance or input from other partners, such as Soil Conservation Districts, landowners, or local watershed associations. The WRAS Partnership Program recognizes that most of the decisions regarding land use, zoning, open space, etc., are the responsibility of local units of government. In addition, these local units of government are most knowledgeable of local conditions and stakeholders, and are best able to develop watershed assessments and plans, and commit resources to implementation. WRASs utilize services of DNR and the state Departments of Environment, Planning and Agriculture to provide technical assistance and funding, with the participation of other partners such as the Soil Conservation District, and watershed associations or other citizen groups. Additional WRAS partners include landowners, Federal agencies, businesses, and schools. Partners also include the Chesapeake Bay Tributary Teams (Governor- appointed volunteers working to develop and implement policy, outreach and education initiatives). These additional partners provide technical assistance, community support, volunteers, and stewardship opportunities suc h as restoration plantings, cleanups, education, or other activities. 2   A completed WRAS strategy is a work plan, prepared with public input, which is based on an assessment of natural resource conditions and scientific monitoring data. The strategy identifies the most important causes of water pollution and resource degradation, and details actions, as well as responsible parties, to address problems. It also provides milestones for measuring progress. The WRAS identifies areas of concern, needed monitor ing, gaps in information, mitigation options, and restoration and protection opportunities.  Chesapeake Bay 2000 Watershed Commitment Implementation and Tracking Watershed management planning is also addressed in the multi- state Chesapeake Bay 2000 Agreement (See http://www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/science/c2k/c2k.html). One commitment, in particular, states: By 2010, work with local governments, community groups and watershed organization s to develop and implement locally supported watershed management plans in two -thirds of the Bay watershed covered by this Agreement. These plans would address the protection, conservation and restoration of stream corridors, riparian forest buffers and wetlands for the purposes of improving habitat and water quality, with collateral benefits for optimizing stream flow and water supply .  Within the Chesapeake Bay's drainage, Maryland has 127 watersheds (Maryland's 8- digit watersheds). Maryland has committed to develop and implement, by 2010, 2/3 of 127 or approximately 85 (8- digit) watershed management plans (WMPs) or strategies covering the Bay watershed. Efforts to achieve this Bay Agreement commitment are two - fold. In 2001, DNR's Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Services continued to lead development of locally- sponsored WRASs. At the same time efforts began to develop a system to recognize, count, and help implement local watershed management plans resulting from various other programs or requirements but which fulfill the requirements of the 2/3 commitment. These may include, for example, the WMPs developed pursuant to NPDES stormwater permit requirements or other programs. The tracking system, beginning with an on- site survey of local watershed management planning efforts, will begin in 2002. Potential benefits to local governments will include: 1) statewide recognition of quality work achieved, 2) ability for local governments to be more competitive for receipt of CWA 319 implementation funds and va rious other grant sources as well as technical assistance services and 3) potential consideration as part of an applicable TMDL (Total Maximum Daily Load) implementation plan or its equivalent (see Water Resource Program Integration section below).  Coasta l Bays Comprehensive Coastal Management Plan In addition, outside the boundaries of the Chesapeake Bay drainage area in Maryland -- in the Coastal Bays watersheds-- watershed planning efforts continued in 2001 with the provision of state technical and financial assistance, and WRAS Partnership development in the Isle of Wight Bay watershed to help implement the Coastal Bays Comprehensive Coastal Management Plan.  3   4   2001 WRAS Accomplishments Completed WRASs The Maryland Department o f Natural Resources, in partnership with five counties continued developing local Watershed Restoration Action Strategies in five of Maryland's Clean Water Action Plan Priority watersheds: C C C C C Allegany County: Howard County: Kent County: Somerset County: Worcester County: Georges Creek Little Patuxent River Middle Chester River Manokin River Isle of Wight (Upper Potomac Tributary Basin) (Patuxent Tributary Basin) (Upper Eastern Shore Tributary Basin) (Lower Eastern Shore Tributary Basin) (Coastal Bays Watershed)  A number of nonpoint source pollution issues have been addressed in the WRASs, as well as such related issues as flood and stormwater management, shore erosion, wildlife and fisheries habitat, greenways, riparian buffers, and public access and recreation, among others. Local governments have used the opportunity to coordinate existing watershed activities and information, focus future activities in a specific watershed, address issues important to the public, and develop marketing tools (for grant applications, etc.). Various forms of implementation are already underway in each watershed. Final WRAS strategies are completed for Isle of Wight and Little Patuxent River, both of which are planning to use 319 implementation monies to implement priority actions. Final strategies will be completed in March 2002 for the Manokin River, Georges Creek, and Middle Chester River. Copies of the WRAS's watershed characterization documents are available at (http://www.dnr.state.md.us/watersheds/surf/proj/proj.html) and final WRAS strategies will be posted or linked on the Maryland Nonpoint Source Program website at: http://www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/czm/nps/  Kickoff of WRAS Second Round In September 2001, awards of new WRAS partnerships (WRAS2s) were made: C C C C C Anne Arundel and Prince Georges Counties Carroll County: Harford County: St. Mary's County Talbot and Caroline Upper Patuxent River (Patuxent River Tributary Basin) Liberty Reservoir Bush River Breton Bay Upper Choptank River (Patapsco/Back River Tributary Basin) (Upper Western Shore Tributary Basin) (Lower Potomac Tributary Basin) (Choptank Tributary Basin)  5   WRAS2 partners are currently working to: C C C C Establish Steering Committees; complete initial public outreach, and develop a process for ongoing public input and participation.

Sample Restoration Targeting Tool -- from Isle of Wight Bay's Watershed Characterization  6   Nonpoint Source Management Measures The Statewide Nonpoint Source Management Plan and the Coastal Nonpoint Program are integrated through a number of management measures. The Coastal Nonpoint Control Program's management measures are defined as economically achievable measures to control the addition of nonpoint pollution to coastal waters. These measures reflect the greatest degree of pollution reduction achievable using the best available nonpoint pollution control practices, technologies, processes, siting criteria, operating methods, or other alternatives.  NPS Management Measure Categories The revised management plan (March 2000) describes nonpoint source programs and initiatives aimed at controlling nonpoint source pollution from six broad pollution categories: agriculture, developed lands, forestry, marinas and recreational boating, hydromodification, and wetlands/riparian areas. This annual report summarizes pollution prevention and control efforts in these broad pollution categories. During the past year significant progress has been made toward achieving a variety of management measures and program goals including: the development of nutrient management plans, the creation of hundreds of miles of forested buffers, the expanded number of marinas pledged and certified as Clean Marinas, implementation of Phase II Stormwater Management (SWM) guidelines, addressing the On Site Sewage Disposal (OSDS) issue, and increased funding for land preservation, stream restoration and wetland creation. This report contains detailed information describing statewide progress and specific projects within each broad pollution category.  Agriculture Good water quality is the most critical element in the overall restoration and protection of the Chesapeake Bay, the Coastal Bays and their tributaries for the support of living resources and to ensure safe drinking water supplies and other beneficial uses. Agricultural activity, human population growth, low density development (i.e., sprawl), and septic systems are each contributing nonpoint source pollution in the form of nutrients and bacteria which affect the State's surface and ground waters. A strong agricultural industry and a healthy environment go hand in hand. The Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model indicates that Maryland farmers achieved the majority of water quality objectives in every major watershed and continue to exceed their goals for implementing best management practices (BMPs) to manage nutrients, control erosion and protect water quality. As we move ahead into the future, agricultural and soil conservation partners will continue to preserve Maryland's rural legacy by developing and promoting farming practices that are both environmentally sensitive and economically sound. Maryland has a variety of agricultural programs (CREP, MACS, Soil Conservation Water Quality, Agricultural Water Management Program) described below that contribute to the overall reduction of nonpoint source pollution.  7   Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) Maryland's conservation programs have come a long way since initial efforts to protect natural resources focused chiefly on soil conservation. Today, agricultural partners work to develop new technologies that address a variety of environmental issues, such as wetland habitat protection, forest buffer plantings and animal waste management. In addition, partners work to develop new programs, including the innovative Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), which helps farmers protect sensitive streamside areas. CREP provides annual rental payments for 10  15 years and cost share for installing BMPS to conserve sensitive resource areas. During calendar year 2001, farmers enrolled a total of 14,695 acres in CREP. Included in this total are 5,658 acres of riparian vegetated buffers, 5,666 acres of riparian forested buffers, 765 acres of wetland restoration, and 2,562 acres of highly erodible land conservation. Some of these efforts are also highlighted in the forestry management measure category detailed below. Also, see the CREP website at http://www.mda.state.md.us/resource/crep.htm Presentation on CREP program in Harford County by Soil Conservation District and MD DNR Forestry personnel, July 2001  8   Nutrient Management /Water Quality Improvement Act (WQIA) In 1998, the Maryland Genera l Assembly passed landmark legislation that places Maryland at the forefront of national efforts to protect water quality. The Water Quality Improvement Act (WQIA) established both short and long- term strategies for reducing nutrient levels in our streams, rivers and Chesapeake Bay. The most significant feature of the Act is a provision requiring nutrient management plans for virtually all Maryland farms. The Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998 changed the nutrient management program to a regulatory program, requiring farmers who use commercial fertilizers to submit a nitrogen and phosphorus based plan to the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) by December 31, 2001 and implement it by December 31, 2002. Farmers who use animal manure or sludge must have nitrogen based plans by the same dates as those who use chemical fertilizers. Those who have sludge or animal manure have until July 1, 2004 to submit a nitrogen and phosphorus based nutrient management plan and must implement it by July 1, 2005. Alt hough the new law includes a number of deadlines and requirements, it also offers many new incentives aimed at helping farmers comply. In 2001, the majority of Maryland farmers complied with the first of the nutrient management plan reporting deadlines stemming from the Water Quality Improvement Act. As of December 31, 2001, Maryland farmers officially submitted nutrient management plan information for approximately 1.1 million acres of agricultural land, representing 65% of the agricultural land that is covered by the law. The information submitted includes 2,152 completed nutrient management plans covering 338,392 acres. Another 2,993 farmers submitted information on a Justification for Delay form indicating they were still working with a consultant to develop their plans on a total of 757,535 acres. The Nonpoint Source Program has provided cost- share funds to have private sector consultants develop nutrient management plans. During 2001, information and instruction on proper sampling of soil and ma nure were disseminated during farm visits, yield checks were performed, nutrient application equipment was calibrated for producers, record keeping tools were distributed to producers to encourage improved record keeping, and instruction on the calibration of equipment was provided. Extension staff participated in numerous nutrient management training courses, and several training sessions on ""Writing Nutrient Management Plans"" were held. Outreach activities geared toward agricultural producers are ongo ing. The pamphlet ""Nutrient Manager - Focus on the Phosphorus Site Index"" was completed and distributed, the Nutrient Management Display was exhibited at county fairs, and the Urban Nutrient Management Workgroup continues to focus on events to educate people about urban and related nutrient practices to minimize or eliminate contamination to waters in Maryland. For example, materials entitled `Fertilizer Recommendations for Trees and Shrubs' and `Recommendations for Cut Flowers Production' were published. For more information on available publications, please see the MDA Nutrient Management website at http://www.mda.state.md.us/nutrient/contents.html  9   Manure Transport Program The Manure Transportation Pilot Project provides support to animal producers who have excess manure and need to find alternative means of managing it in order to be in compliance with the Water Quality Improvement Act. The objectives of the program included subsidizing the cost of transporting animal manure to make it affordable for animal producers to address excess manure and providing an incentive for the development of alternative technologies and business ventures to create a market for use of animal manures. This year (SFY 01), approximately 36,930 tons of excess manure was tr ansported. See http://www.mda.state.md.us/nutrient/transprt.pdf for more information. Operations receiving manure for land application under the Project must apply it in accordance with a nutrient management plan prepared by a certified consultant. Receiving operations with alternative uses for manure are also eligible to participate. To date, practically all of the manure transported has been poultry litter. Reimbursement for all participants is capped at $20 per ton. Fifty percent of the cost of transporting poultry litter is paid by commercial poultry companies. Livestock producers received 87.5% of costs from public funds.  Maryland Agricultural Cost Share (MACS) State and federal funds are used to provide grants to Maryland farmers for the installation of best management practices (BMPs) to alleviate existing or potential critical water pollution conditions associated with farming activity. Management actions were taken to co ntinue to improve MACS Program administra tion at the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) headquarters and to improve the consistency of Program administration at the local Soil Conservation District (SCD) level. These efforts have made the program more attractive to farmers, accelerating the installation of BMPs, and increasing farmer participation in Maryland's nonpoint source pollution control program. For more detailed information on the program, see the MACS website at: http://www.mda.state.md.us/nutrient/costsh61.pdf For the 2001 reporting period (state fiscal year (SFY) 01), there were 1,327 BMPs installed, 68,021 acres of cover crops planted, and 75 Poultry and Livestock Waste Storage facilities built for use under the MACS program. The positive environmental impact of (MACS) BMPs resulted in an estimated 29,489 tons of soil saved, 2,084 tons of manure managed daily, and the prevention of movement of 578,000 pounds nitrogen and 13,600 pounds of phosphorus through the use of cover crops.  10   Soil Conservation and Water Quality Program The Soil Conservation and Water Quality (SCWQ) Program enabled the development of 1,300 SCWQ plans for 101,000 acres with an associated 6,200 BMPs installed. An additional 800 existing SCWQ plans were updated on 87,000 acres. Statewide, 59% of agricultural land is managed under a current SCWQ plan. Plans are considered current for a maximum of ten years. In addition to planning acreage for new cooperators, local Soil Conservation Districts (SCDs) keep a rolling tally of acreage planned in the past and have an ongoing system of regular updates.  Grassed Waterway The Coastal Zone Management Division, through the Nonpoint Source and Coastal Zone Programs, has funded soil conservation and water quality planning activities in many different areas across the state (including Antietam Creek, Deer Creek, Marshyhope Creek, St. Clements Bay, St. Martins, Lower Choptank, Chester River). One watershed, Antietam Creek, provides a snapshot of the tremendous amount of progress made in reducing nonpoint source pollution through the combined efforts of NPS program partners.  Case Study: Agricultural Project - Antietam Creek Targeted Wa tershed Project The Antietam Creek Targeted Watershed Project is a prime example of the effectiveness of conservation partnerships working to solve common water resource problems within a major tributary of the Potomac River. The Washington County Soil Conservation District and its many partners report outstanding progress in improving water quality in Antietam Creek's watershed in Washington County, Maryland. Antietam Creek's watershed placed eighth in the State for nutrient loading to the Chesapeake Bay. Runoff from numerous agricultural operations within the watershed carries nutrients, sediment, pesticides and organic wastes to Antietam Creek and its tributaries. Local stream and  11   water quality concerns include excessive streambank erosion, siltat ion, nutrient enrichment, algal growth, pathogen contamination, elevated stream temperatures, loss of fish habitat and fishery, and loss of riparian habitat.  Dairy barn wash water runoff prior to installation of BMP. In addition to nutrient loading to the Bay and local water quality issues, this watershed was also targeted due to concerns about protecting several local Washington County- designated ""Special Planning Areas"" such as the Powell Trout Hatchery, the South Mountain Natural Environmental Area, the Greenbriar State Park, Appalachian Trail Corridor, and Antietam National Battlefield. The Edgemont and Smithburg Reservoirs, standby water systems for the city of Hagerstown, also lie within the watershed. Funding from Section 319 was used by MDA and the Washington County SCD to employ a Soil Conservation Planner to complete a watershed assessment and to begin educational efforts in the targeted subwatersheds. A Conservation Technician was hired to help install BMPs identified by the planner in Soil and Water Conservation Plans and a nutrient management advisor was added to Cooperative Extension Staff to work with animal producers on nutrient management planning. Over the last ten years, the Washington County SCD has succes sfully accelerated efforts towards implementing conservation practices and increasing conservation education efforts in the county. Examples of BMPs include waste storage structures, stream fencing and alternative livestock water facilities (to keep cattle out of waterways) and planting of riparian buffers. Since 1992, over 3,600 best management practices have been installed.  12   Fenced Stream  Livestock watering trough Recently, the Washington County SCD has focused its efforts on the Little Antietam, Marsh Run, Beaver Creek, Little Antietam South and Sharman Branch subwatersheds. Soil conservation and water quality plans have been completed for 31,081 acres representing 78% of the agricultural acrea ge within these subwatersheds. The SCD also has a nutrient management specialist helping local farmers develop and update nutrient management plans. Local landowners have also participated in the Western Maryland Cover Crop program. In addition to trad itional agricultural projects, the District completed the Beaver Creek Stream Restoration  13   Project, which restored a severely degraded section of the creek downstream from the Albert Powell State Fish Hatchery. As a result of local efforts, supported by state and federal partners and resources, there has been improvement in water quality within Antietam Creek. Eroding stream banks along restored sections of Beaver Creek have been stabilized and the channel has been restored to more natural conditions. Water quality monitoring conducted by Maryland Department of Environment has shown a significant decline in nutrients and sediment. Riparian habitat and the trout fishery have improved dramatically.

U.S. Geologic Survey (USGS) & Maryland Geologic Survey (MGS) Has a network of stream monitoring stations and spring/well locations, which they use to monitor water quality. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Provides funding for staff and BMP installation.  Public Drainage Program The Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) regulates agricultural public drainage facilities administered as Public Drainage Associations (PDAs). PDAs are independent political subdivisions and cover over 850 miles of drainage ditches in the coastal zone, mostly on the Eastern Shore. The PDAs are required to develop operation and maintenance plans which address sediment control and water quality protection. MDA assists PDAs to conduct biannual inspections and provides technical assistance to the PDAs through the SCDs. Typical best management practices include vegetative filter strips and channel stabilization. In June of 1999, the Public Drainage Task Force was formed and charged by Maryland's Chesapeake Bay Cabinet to develop recommendations that would enhance the Eastern Shore environment and agriculture by addressing issues related to the management of public drainage systems. In October of 2000, the Task Force comp leted its report, which was endorsed by the Governor's Chesapeake Bay Workgroup, and forwarded to the Chesapeake Bay Cabinet for approval. Public drainage task force recommendations included recognition that best  15   management practices (BMPs) should incorporate the best achievable methods to reduce nutrient export and increase habitat quality. In 2001, the Nonpoint Source (NPS) Program funded the development of a special video and informational outreach materials to promote the use of weed wiper technology and alternative management measures such as water control structures, pocket wetlands and other practices to retain vegetative buffers and slow the flow of water. The NPS Program has also funded the implementation of these alternative management measure s including pocket wetland projects in the Hubbard Cohee, Weer Levengood, Edinberg and Whitemarsh PDAs.  Longmarsh PDA Pocket wetland  Forestry Programs Forest health is inextricably linked to healthy streams and robust Chesapeake Bay and Coastal Bays watersheds. Forests function as filters removing sediments, nutrients and other pollutants from water before they enter the groundwater system and receiving streams. The influx of excessive nutrients caused in part by deforestation, however, has disrupted the Bays' ecosystems. Forests also regulate the amount, velocity, and rate of runoff maintaining a water body=s natural hydrology. Forested riparian buffers along streams and rivers stabilize banks, reducing erosion and sedimentation. These riparian buffers also enhance wildlife habitat by shading streams, providing woody debris for habitat, and regulating stream temperature. Protecting Maryland =s forest resources greatly contributes to nonpoint source pollution control. Pursuant to Section 6217, Maryland State agencies and local governments are working to implement the ten forestry management measures for the control of nonpoint source pollution. The forestry management measures are well integrated with agricultural, urban, and  16   wetlands/riparian programs. This vital linkage strengthens the individual measures implemented and also makes the combined efforts more effective as a whole. Integrating forestry efforts benefits funding of projects associated with impaired waters, increases volunteerism, helps to educate and involve the public, emphasizes the importance of a `watershed focus', and helps restore habitat values adjacent to cropland, along streams and in urban settings.  Stream ReLeaf In 2001, Marylanders created over 264 miles of forest buffers along waterways under the leadership of DNR, a rate over twice the annual goal. Currently, the total accomplishment is 595.7 miles. This accomplishment brings us very close to the Governor's goal of 600 miles by 2010, and is a bulwark of our efforts to red uce nutrient pollution and restore habitat in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The incentives in the Conservation Reserve Enhance Program helped almost double the rate of forest buffer planting in the last year. CREP is a major factor in making forest buffer establishment affordable for agricultural landowners. For existing buffers, efforts are underway to track conservation occurring through programs such as Forest Conservation Act, Critical Area Law, Rural Legacy, and other local programs.  Buffered stream in Washington County. Based upon the challenge of recruiting additional participants, an independent contractor (funded by a NOAA grant) reviewed incentives for establishing riparian forest buffers in Maryland. The study included a comprehensive summary of existing incentives and rules and a survey of stakeholders. The report recommended expansion of eligibility in several programs, increased  17   coordination efforts, increased funding for incentives and technical assistance, and better funding for maintenance of newly installed buffers. Partnerships, outreach, and coordination have continued to expand in support of Stream ReLeaf goals. See the DNR Forest Service Stream Re - leaf website at http://www.dnr.state.md.us/forests/programapps/ripfbi.html  Other Forestry Programs Special Rivers The Special Rivers Project consists of critical technical and outreach support for watershed improvement through forest restoration and management. Each of the four regional projects: the Anacostia River, Monocacy River, Susquehanna River, and Town Creek -- remain focused on buffer creation and preparation of site- specific forest stewardship plans. Landowner interest increased substantially during the 2000  2001 time period for which data is available. The latest reporting period for Special Rivers indicates that 49 miles and 663 acres of riparian forest buffers were established which totals over 2.5 times the target goal. Stewardship Plans were developed for 182 participants covering 5297 acres -- triple the target goal. Additional activities included ongoing monitoring, reinforcement plantings to assure stand development, and potential sites were tar geted for inspection in 10 subwatersheds and on DNR lands. See the Special Rivers website at http://www.dnr.state.md.us/forests/programapps/srpcon.html for more detail.  Forest Conservation Act The Forest Conservation Act (FCA) applies to all activities requiring a permit for subdivision, grading, or sediment control that is larger than 40,000 square feet, or slightly less than one acre. Information on the condition of the existing forest and a plan for conserving the most valuable portions of the forest are required. Plans are prepared on a site by site basis by qualified resource professionals and are reviewed for adherence to the Act at the county level. For more detail, see the FCA website at http://www.dnr.state.md.us/forests/healthreport/act.html  Urban - Developed land and New Development Programs This category of management measures is intended to control runoff and treat associated pollutants generated from new development, redevelopment, and new and relocated roads, highways and bridges. In Maryland, this measure is met through the State's Stormwater Management (SWM) program, which addresses proposed disturbances over 5,000 square feet, including residential, commercial, industrial, and institutional development, as well as new and relocated roads and bridges. The Phase II SWM regulatory program incorporates low impact development methodologies to reduce the negative impacts of site runoff. Protection is also provided by erosion and sediment controls, smart growth initiatives, and open space preservation programs. In addition, the Critical Area Program (requiring forest buffers along the Chesapeake  18   Bay) is essential to these efforts as an important watershed protection tool. The Critical Areas Program applies to tidal lands and waters of the Chesapeake Bay to the head of tide and all lands within 1000 feet of Mean High Water or from the landward ed ge of tidal wetlands. On a watershed scale, the implementation of these urban programs continues to promote environmentally sensitive site design, increase economic feasibility of low impact development, and contribute to the integrated approach of waters hed protection. This approach is strengthened through the incorporation of non- agricultural nutrient management efforts, forestry, and wetland/riparian management measures.  Stormwater Management -- Phase II Program Final 1999 Stormwater Phase II regulations expand the existing NPDES Stormwater Management (SWM) program to address stormwater discharges from municipal storm sewers and construction activity. The new SWM program incorporates the Phase II requirements, detailed in the publication known as the 2000 Maryland Stormwater Design Manual. It has become part of the State's development regulations by reference and SWM is required on all sites which disturb over 5,000 square feet of land. The new Manual (adopted October 2, 2000) concentrates on controlling runoff increases and mitigating water quality degradation associated with new development as well as redevelopment of more urbanized areas. The Manual includes a unified approach for sizing stormwater BMPs to meet pollutant removal goals, maintain groundwater recharge, reduce stream channel erosion, prevent overbank flooding, and pass extreme floods. For more detail, see the MDE website at www.mde.state.md.us/environment/wma/stormwatermanual.  Low Impact Development (LID ) Bioretention, raingardens, reductions in impervious surface area, disconnections of roof runoff, and directing sheet flow to vegetated buffers are some of the main components of the voluntary Low Impact Development (LID) approach for managing stormwater runoff. Prince George's County was one of the first areas to develop and use bioretention techniques as an integrated management practice (IMP). The County continues to refine the bioretention IMP design and its effectiveness has been documented by studies that show signif icant pollutant loading reductions. The standards address the minimization of impervious area and thus runoff, treatment/ pretreatment, structural and non- structural BMPs, peak discharges, stream channel protection, redevelopment, industrial Pollution Pre vention Plans, sites with high pollution potential (hotspots), and permitting. In addition, an innovative system of ""credits"" is offered to those employing progressive planning techniques. The six credit- producing efforts reduce the impacts of developme nt as well as reduce the size and cost of SWM practices needed onsite.  19   Rain Garden in DNR parking lot: an urban stormwater demonstration project  Sediment and Erosion Control Program The Maryland Sediment and Erosion Control Program is operated at the local level where local governments have shown the ability to enforce the provisions of their ordinances relating to soil erosion and sediment control. In other cases, the state has retained enforcement responsibilities. MDE conducts periodic reviews of local programs to ensure that implementation is acceptable and it has the authority to suspend delegation and take over any program that does not meet state standards.  Onsite Sewage Disposal Systems (OSDS) Maryland has approximately 400,000 septic systems today (approximately 1 in 5 households), with potential for significantly more. With few exceptions, residents are still using the same septic system technology today that was used 50 years ago. These systems are not designed to remove nutrient pollution, which is the key type of pollution targeted by the Chesapeake Bay clean- up effort. The Maryland Department of the Environment, Ground Water Permits Division is responsible for the development of regulations pertaining to the citing, construction, and general permitting of septic systems or OSDS. Authority for permitting, tracking and monitoring OSDS is delegated to county health departments. For the 2002 legislative session, a bill has been introduced for tax inc entives to owners who upgrade their systems to be more efficient and for increased nutrient removal.  20   In 2001, the Coastal Nonpoint Program distributed a Request for Proposals (RFP) to local jurisdictions in the Coastal Zone of Maryland to fund projects that address the siting, design, operation, and maintenance of onsite sewage disposal systems (OSDS). The major objectives of the RFP solicitation were to help ensure conventional onsite or decentralized systems are sited and installed properly in accordance with appropriate state and local regulations and codes; are periodically inspected and repaired as necessary; and that the appropriate regulatory agency is aware of the location of systems to provide oversight and education, for example, periodica lly providing owners with operation and maintenance information. As a result of the RFP, Maryland has approved funding for seven counties interested in improving OSDS management through improved record- keeping, outreach and repair and maintenance of septic systems. Maryland is using federal Coastal Nonpoint Source Program (Section 6217) funds to help coastal counties develop accurate and complete inventories, databases, and maps of properties served by septic systems since outdated, incomplete or missing records and information currently hampers existing local management efforts. These funds will enable local governments to reduce the impacts of septic systems and protect environmentally sensitive areas by (1) identifying areas in need of increased monitoring due to potential water quality impacts, (2) identifying areas that should be placed into sewer service systems, and (3) targeting homeowners for outreach on system maintenance.  Smart Growth Initiatives As the State moves forward with various programs to reduce urban nonpoint source pollution (stormwater, on- site development, sediment and erosion control), it also moves forward with its Smart Growth Initiative. The Smart Growth Initiative addresses nonpoint source pollution by protecting rural landscapes, agricultural lands, forests, and other natural areas, encouraging development in areas with existing infrastructure, and by promoting the principals of Maryland's `GreenPrint' and `Green Building' programs. DNR has numerous programs and initiatives that contribute to achieving the goals of Smart Growth, some of which are described below. More information on Smart Growth is available at http://www.op.state.md.us/smartgrowth/index.html.  Program Open Space The Department of Natural Resources' Program Open Space (POS) is a nationally recognized program that provides funding for Maryland's state and local parks and conservation areas. Established in 1969, Program Open Space symbolizes Maryland's long- term commitment to conserving natural resources while providing exceptional outdoor recreation opportunities. The program has resulted in the acquisition of more than 234,000 acres of open space for state parks and natural resource areas and 31,000 acres of local park land. More than 3,900 county and municipal parks and conservation areas have been built through POS. http://www.dnr.state.md.us/pos.html  21   Rural Legacy Program The Rural Legacy Program provides the focus and funding necessary to protect large, contiguous tracts of land and other strategic areas from sprawl development and to enhance natural resource, agricultural, forestry and environmental protection through cooperative efforts among state and local governments and land trusts. Protection is provided through the acquisition of easements and fee estates from willing landowners and the supporting activities of Rural Legacy Sponsors and local governments. During 2001, the Rural Legacy Program announced grants of $29.6 million to permanently protect 11,000 acres across the State. The State has previously awarded $82 million to counties and Baltimore City to protect rural lands. See http://www.dnr.state.md.us/rurallegacy/index.html for more information.  GreenPrint Program In May 2001, Governor Glendening signed into law a new $35 million program designed to protect lands critical to long- term ecological health. These lands, referred to as Maryland's green infrastructure, provide the natural foundation needed to support a diverse plant and animal population, and enables valuable natural processes like filtering water and cleaning the air, to take place. The GreenPrint Program authorizes two state agencies to undertake activities to conserve targeted lands: the Department of Natural Resources and the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF). DNR has the authority to spend 75% of the funds allocated on green infrastructure land acquisitions and easements. MALPF has authority to spend 25% of the GreenPrint Program funds for protection of properties within MALPF- approved agricultural districts that contain green infrastructure lands. Local government approval is required for all projects using DNR's portion of GreenPrint funds. During September through November 2001, the State's Board of Public Works approved over $11 million in GreenPrint funds to protect almost 3,000 acres of vital Maryland forests and wetlands. See the website at http://www.dnr.state.md.us/greenways/greenprint/  Marinas and Recreational Boating  Clean Marinas The Clean Marinas Initiative was developed in response to Section 6217 of the Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1990, which requires that states address nonpoint source pollution from marinas and recreational boating. Maryland established the Clean Marina Initiative to promote understanding and adoption of pollution prevention measures associated with the impacts of pleasure boats on water quality. Densely populated marinas and the associated operation and maintenance of boats can have seasonal or sporadic water quality impacts.  22   The Clean Marinas Program is able to demonstrate to the marina audience actual examples of effective pollution prevention and reduction practices. A voluntary Clean Marina certification process has proven beneficial as a marketing too l to businesses (marinas, boat maintenance) interested in promoting environmentally sensitive boat and marina operation. In addition, other nonpoint source management measures have been shown to fit well into the Clean Marinas Program. These include vegetated or forested buffers, reducing impervious area, sewage pumpout facilities, wetland creation, and onsite fuel, pesticide, and chemical control. The program goal is to certify 25 percent of the State's 600 boating facilities as Clean Marinas by 2004. As of December 2001, 127 facilities have pledged (Step 1) to protect MD's waterways from harmful chemicals, excess nutrients, and debris. Of these, 44 have implemented pollution prevention measures and been certified (Step 2) as Clean Marinas or Clean Marina Partners. The Clean Marina Partner designation is for facilities, such as public boat ramps, which are not true marinas but that promote Clean Marina ideals. The DNR Clean Marinas Program staff increased participation in the Clean Marina Initiative, and conducted meetings of the Clean Marina Committee, plus workshops, and a program evaluation to identify and address implementation roadblocks. Program staff continuously refine the Initiative by keeping abreast of advances in technology and new BMPs through industry and academic publications and attending relevant meetings, workshops and conferences. The Clean Marina Guidebook will be revised as technologies and laws change. During 2001, the Clean Marina Initiative was implemented through a combinatio n of outreach to marinas, confirmation visits, marketing to boaters, and promotion of certified Clean Marinas. Staff continued to encourage marinas to adopt pollution prevention measures and become certified Clean Marinas by conducting outreach efforts such as personal phone calls and visits, workshops, quarterly newsletter, etc. Certified Clean Marinas were highlighted by award presentations, features in newsletters and exhibits, and through hosting the annual awards ceremony. Press releases announced ne w pledges, new certifications, workshops, clean boating tip cards, free petroleum control kits ( i.e., oil absorbent pad, instructions for use & disposal, and petroleum control brochure), and other outreach materials. Many of these activities were accomplished through a display of the Clean Marina exhibit at the 2001 U.S. Sail and Power Boat Shows and other appropriate shows and festivals. See the Clean Marina website at http://www.dnr.state. md.us/boating/cleanmarina/. The Nonpoint Source Program has funded the installation of best management practices (BMPs) at Maryland marinas located in Priority Category 1 watersheds. The map below indicates the marinas that have used nonpoint source cos t- share funds to install a variety of practices (e.g. the installation of fish cleaning stations, oil and antifreeze recycling stations, recycling pressure washing systems, vacuum sanders, high- volume low pressure (HVLP) spray guns and BayScape buffers). BMP implementation assists the Clean Marinas Program in its overall outreach toward  23   marina owners as it demonstrates cost effective methods of pollution reduction and prevention practices.  During the summer of 2001, EPA Region III representatives toured several nonpoint source program projects in Maryland. As part of their tour, EPA and DNR representatives visited the Tidewater Marina, a Clean Marina in Havre De Grace, Maryland. State and EPA staff were able  24   to see first- hand a clea n marina and on- the- ground implementation of best management practices.

Wash water capture facility at the Tidewater marina  .  25   Hydromodification/Channelization In Maryland there is a network of over 14,000 miles of streams and rivers. Human activities, such as channelization, building of levees, dams, diversions, and floodplain development disrupt the natural hydrologic regime of the system resulting in a widespread deterioration of environmental quality. Current management approaches focus on the modification of watershed hydrology to replicate (to the degree possible) the hydrology in undisturbed fore sted watersheds. This restores stream channels to greater potential for stability because the magnitude and frequencies of peak storm discharges are reduced. Maryland is working to curtail or reverse damages from hydromodification through a variety of programs and projects including the shore erosion control and fish passage programs.  Shore Erosion Control Shoreline and streambank erosion result not only in the loss of land and the reduction of riparian buffer areas and wildlife habitat, but erosion is also identified as a major contributor of sediment to the waters of Maryland. Approximately 5.1 million cubic yards of sediments are delivered annually to the Chesapeake Bay from shoreline and streambank erosion. Sedimentation both increases nutrient pollution and degrades water clarity. There are approximately 4,360 miles of tidal shoreline within the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay and Coastal Bays watershed. One thousand three hundred forty- one miles of tidal shoreline have been identified as eroding at various yearly rates. In addition, approximately 14,063 miles of fresh water streams, an integral part of the Chesapeake Bay watershed system, are experiencing intermittent erosion problems. Maryland's Shore Erosion Control Program was established in 1968 within DNR for the purpose of addressing shoreline and streambank erosion problems along the Chesapeake Bay and Coastal Bay and their tributaries. The Program provides assistance to Maryland property owners in resolving shoreline and streambank erosion problems. Since 1968, Shore Erosion Control has assisted numerous property owners and established more than 800 structural projects and 325 non- structural projects. Property owners in Maryla nd can request technical assistance and financial assistance from Shore Erosion Control. (see http://www.dnr.state.md.us/forests/programapps/sec.html ) In August 1999, Governor Glend ening appointed a Shore Erosion Task Force, charged with investigating shore erosion in Maryland, its causes and effects, effective solutions and available resources. In January 2000, the Task Force published a set of nine recommendations to be implemented under the umbrella of a Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control Plan.  26   In order to initiate statewide planning, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources established substantial partnerships with two coastal counties: Dorchester and St. Mary's. These partnerships will enable the counties to prioritize stretches of shoreline for erosion control measures based on erosion rates, environmental impacts, impacts to public and private infrastructure and vulnerability to sea level rise; prepare detailed data on stretches of shoreline in three coastal areas; conduct public outreach activities to citizens about the causes and solutions to shore erosion; and serve as templates for the development of Statewide components of the Maryland Comprehensive Shore Erosion Control plan.  Fish passage Another related component of water resource and habitat protection, which complements efforts to reduce nonpoint source pollution and restore designated uses, is fish passage improvement. Maryland's Fish Passage Program, administered by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR), began in 1988 and was developed in response to the 1987 Chesapeake Bay Agreement. One of the agreement's priorities was to re- open habitat and remove blockages on streams to allow fish to return to traditional spawning grounds. Since its inception, the program has completed 53 projects, re- opening 292 miles of spawning habitat. The main goal of DNR's Fish Passage Program is to restore migratory fish populations to as near historic leve ls as possible. The program has operated on every major river system in the State by constructing notches and fish ladders, by breeching dams or removing barriers. Some of the program's major works are the Union, Simpkins, Bloede and Daniels passages on the Patapsco River, Ft. Meade on the Little Patuxent River, and Van Bibber on Winters Run, a tributary of the Bush River. DNR's Fish Passage Program is solely funded through development mitigation settlements and grants.  Wetlands and Riparian Areas A var iety of wetlands exist in Maryland, however two basic types of wetlands are commonly recognized: nontidal wetlands and tidal wetlands. Nontidal wetlands found in Maryland are most commonly inland freshwater areas not subject to tidal influence. Tidal wetlands are associated with daily fluctuations of water levels driven by the ocean tides. In Maryland, tidal wetlands are typically found along the ocean coast, in the Chesapeake Bay estuary, and along the tidal reaches of streams and rivers flowing into the ocean and bay, as well as Coastal Bays. Measures to both restore and protect wetlands are an important component of nonpoint source pollution control. During 2001, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) created a draft State Wetlands Conservation Plan whose mission is ""to identify and resolve gaps in current wetlands management for statewide conservation and preservation of wetland ecosystems and their functions through consistent federal, state, public, and private participation, while recognizing competing resource needs."" A workgroup composed of representatives from federal, state, and local governments, private business, and nonprofit environmental advocate organizations is working to provide an organized and comprehensive guide for collaboration and improvement to  27   new and existing federal, state, local and private programs for wetlands conservation and management. A draft of the plan will be available for public comment in 2002.  Created wetland serving bot h environmental education and waste treatment needs behind North Harford High School  Web -Based Tracking Initiative Maryland has ongoing tracking mechanisms for some of the nonpoint source management measures to provide the State and federal agencies with indicators of accomplishments. In 2001, Coastal Nonpoint Program funds were allocated to enhance existing tracking systems at the state and local level for wetlands and riparian areas restoration. This analysis will better ensure coordination of tracking efforts, identify gaps and develop the systems necessary so all implementation activities can be tracked. Opportunities for incorporating this information into Maryland =s nutrient and sediment reduction programs and habitat restoration programs will also be identified and addressed.  401 Water Quality Certifications Protection of wetlands' water quality and habitat is a component of nonpoint source pollution control. Water quality certification for wetlands via Clean Water Act Section 401, State Water Quality Certifications, is under the purview of the MDE Wetlands & Waterways Program. Under Section 401, Maryland has the authority to review any federal permit or license that may result in a discharge to wetlands and other waters under state jurisdiction, in order to ensure that the actions would be consistent with the State=s water quality requirements.  28   The goal of the Section 401 State Water Quality Certifications is to manage nontidal wetlands and to provide essential resource protection by authorizing only necessary and unavoidable impacts. To accomplish this goal, the following activities are regulated by MDE:      Grading or filling Excavating or dredging Changing existing drainage patterns Disturbing the water level or water table Destroying or removing vegetation  A State Water Quality Certification permit is required for any activity that alters a nontidal wetland or its 25- foot buffer. The state- mandated 25- foot buffer is expanded to 100 feet for wetlands of special state concern as defined in Maryland's regulations (COMAR 26.23.06.) Applicants are required to demonstrate that proposed impacts to nontidal wetlands are necessary and unavoidable. The application review process first eliminates, then reduces impacts through avoidance and minimization. An alternatives analysis may be required as part of this process. Mitigation is required for all authorized impacts. Wetland mitigation monitoring is required and extends beyond construction of an approved mitigation project. Mitigation measures may incorporate management measures addressing stream buffers, wetland creation, and habitat. If denied certification by the state, the federal permit or license cannot be issued. For more information, see the MDE web page at: http://www.mde.state.md.us/wetlands/  Case Studies Several case studies below illustrate the effectiveness of partnership efforts to address nonpoint source pollution control and habitat improvement goals in wetlands and urban riparian areas.  Case Study: Wetland Project Worcester County Nontidal Wetlands Project -- The Pocomoke River watershed and the St. Martin River subwatershed (part of the Isle of Wight watershed) have a history of severe nutrient impacts from agricultura l activities. The restoration of agricultural areas back to wetlands can significantly reduce nutrient impacts to receiving waters and provide habitat to a variety of species. The Worcester County Soil Conservation District in cooperation with the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service and the Department of Natural Resources' Watershed Restoration Division and local landowners, recently completed the restoration of over one hundred acres of wetlands and associated buffers in the Pocomoke and St. Martin River watersheds. The District, using Nonpoint Source Program and Transportation Equity Act 21st Century (TEA21) funds administered by DNR's Watershed Restoration Division created forested wetlands on a variety of locations that are capable of supporting a wide range of reptiles, amphibians, migratory waterfowl and fauna associated with wetlands and wetland habitats. The wetland projects ranged from in size from creating three acres to creating nearly forty acres of wetlands.  29   Several smaller projects are part of larger more comprehensive Wetland Reserve Projects. In addition, several wetland sites were constructed in areas that had been drained by Public Drainage Associations. The Worcester County wetland restoration project will have a strong local impact on reducing nutrients and improving wildlife habitat within the Pocomoke and St. Martin River watersheds.  Case Study: Urban Stream Restoration Projects - - Roland Run & Redhouse Run The Back River and Jones Falls watersheds are identified as Pr iority Category 1 watersheds under Maryland's Unified Watershed Assessment. Baltimore County's Department of Environmental Protection and Resource Management also identified these highly urbanized areas as local priority watersheds. The county has develo ped comprehensive water quality management plans for all of its priority watersheds. Each local watershed plan identifies and ranks potential stream restoration projects. In December 2001, Baltimore County completed stream restoration projects identified in the Back River and Jones Falls watershed plans. These restoration projects, through the use of bioengineering techniques, sought to stabilize streambanks and riparian areas and reduce sediment loads. The Roland Run (Gwynns Falls) and Redhouse Run ( Back River) projects were partially funded through the Nonpoint Source Program. The Redhouse Run Stream Restoration project is located on the Overlea High School Property in Eastern Baltimore County. The goal of the Redhouse Run project was to restore approximately 2,600 linear feet of stream channel using an environmentally sensitive approach. At the beginning of the project there was a steeply eroded gully that carried large amounts of sediment and associated pollutants to the project area where sed iment deposition had obliterated the original stream channel. In addition, the stream was head cutting into this depositional area creating extensive erosion and sedimentation. Restoration was accomplished by establishing a stable stream profile, channel dimensions and by maintaining the capacity to convey peak storm discharges. Innovative techniques such as rock cross vanes and step pools were constructed to direct flows in the newly established channel. Banks were stabilized with structures consisting of natural materials (e.g. native plants, boulders) used to withstand erosional forces. The Roland Run Stream Restoration project is located along Essex Farm Park within a residential neighborhood. Roland Run also experiences severe bank erosion and there was headcut erosion on several stream tributaries. This project stabilized 1,000 feet of the Roland Run mainstem and protected exposed sewer lines, stabilized 500 feet of the Jeffers Road tributary and stabilized 500 feet of the Jeffers Road tributary. Similar to the Redhouse Run project, the Roland Run project decreased sediment loads to the stream. The photographs below show the progress of these stream restoration projects.  30   Redhouse Run (Before and After Stream Restoration)  Before Upper reach  After  31   Roland Run (Before and After Stream Restoration)  32   Water Resource Program Integration A number of efforts occurred in 2001 to help increase coordination and public understanding of water resource and water quality programs, particularly within the context of the Chesapeake Bay Agreement commitments. During 2001, Nonpoint Program staff actively participated as part of the State's Tributary Strategy Development Workgroups, as well as the interagency TMDL Workgroup. The Tributary Strategy Development Workgroup is leading an effort to update Maryland's Chesapeake Bay Tributary Strategies, including an effort to define linkages between Tributary Strategies and TMDLs. The TMDL Workgroup, chaired by the Maryland Department of Environment, also includes DNR, and the Departments of Agriculture, Planning and Transportation. The TMDL Workgroup expanded its efforts in 2001 to address needs for enhanced coordination (i.e., data- sharing, TMDL project selectio n and review, and TMDL implementation planning, etc.), stemming from the stepped up schedule for production of TMDLs, as well as 319 funding guidance for TMDL implementation watershed plans.  Nonpoint Source Program Funds The allocation of funds from the NPS and the Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Program under CZMA section 6217 is coordinated by the Department of Natural Resources, Coastal Zone Management Division. The Section 319 funds are used throughout the state primarily for direct implementatio n (80% of funds for in- the - ground improvements) and secondarily, program management, planning and technical assistance. The Coastal Nonpoint Source funds are currently being used within the coastal zone (comprising 66% of Maryland's area) to address septic systems, fund clean marina programs, and measure success. The Division ensures that the projects funded under each grant authority are complimentary and well- coordinated. These two funding sources provide only a small (but necessary) amount of the funds that are currently used by Maryland to protect and restore water quality from the impacts of nonpoint source pollution (see Nonpoint Source Program Funding section). The State of Maryland currently receives over three million dollars from the United States Environmental Protection Agency under CWA Section 319 to control and prevent nonpoint source pollution. The state matches these federal funds with a commitment to spend over two million dollars. Below is a breakdown of funds received and spent during the most recent federal fiscal years. This breakdown includes the expenditures of state and local match funds. Federal Fiscal Year * Federal Allocation Federal Expenditure Non- Federal Allocation Non- Federal Expenditure Total Allocation Total Expenditure  1998 1999^ 2000^ 2001  $1,327,699 $2,856,841 $2,847,302 $3,091,600  $1,279,297 $2,376,026 $1,907,055 $490,335  $885,133 $1,904,559 $1,898,204 $2,061,066  $852,865 $1,636,569 $1,297,910 $593,418  $2,212,832 $4,761,400 $4,745,506 $5,152,666  $2,132,162 $4,012,595 $3,204,965 $1,083,753  33   *Note: The 1999, 2000 and 2001 federal grants remain open. It is expected that the State will spend most, if not all, of allocated federal and state funds before grant close out. ^Includes unexpended prior year balances Section 319(h)(9) of the Clean Water Act requires any State that applies for Section 319 grants to establish and maintain its aggregate annual level of State nonpoint source pollution control expenditures for improving water quality at the average level o f such expenditures in FFY 1985 and 1986. This is referred to as the State's ""Maintenance of Effort"" (MOE) requirement. The goal of the MOE requirement is to insure that states allocate a minimum level of resources to control and prevent nonpoint source pollution. In addition this requirement prevents states from substituting federal resources for state resources. Maryland's MOE requirement is $8,447,270. Maryland's Nonpoint Source Program documented state fiscal year (SFY) 2001 nonpoint source expend itures of over $25 million in state funds to control and prevent nonpoint source pollution. Maryland continues to exceed its MOE requirements. State of Maryland - Nonpoint Source Maintenance of Effort (MOE)  $30,000,000  $25,000,000  $20,000,000  $15,000,000  Required Actual  $10,000,000  $5,000,000  $0 1996 1997 1998 1999 State Fiscal Year 2000 2001  34   The Department of Natural Resources in coordination with other State agencies recently undertook a fiscal analysis of fully implementing the 2000 Chesapeake Bay Agreement in Maryland for FY 2003 - 2010. The analysis was done to calculate the cost of achieving the 100+ commitments found in the Agreement, identify the largest areas of funding need, and identify opportunities for funding to achieve the Bay Agreement commitments between now and 2010. The largest area of need includes improving water quality through sewage treatments plant upgrades, stormwater management, septic systems, and nonpoint source reductions. It is estimated that Maryland will need an additional $4.3 billion (for FY 2003 - 2010) to meet the various Chesapeake Bay commitments related to nutrients and sediment. Funding this gap will be an ongoing challenge.  35"

GX255-04-1940598	"Long Term Strategy    Introduction  Pursuant to the Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1990, Section 6217 guidelines, developed by NOAA and EPA, each coastal state is charged with working to ensure that all applicable management measures to protect and restore coastal waters will be implemented within 15 years of the date of conditional approval. For Maryland, this means that the Section 6217 best management systems or practices, as detailed in Chapter 4 need to be implemented, as appropriate, by the year 2012. It also means that the state should have a process to identify and implement any additional management measures necessary to achieve and maintain applicable water quality standards and protect designated uses. The following section briefly describes how Maryland intends to promote and manage its nonpoint source pollution control activities so that this national goal can be achieved.      The diversity and scope of programs and activities addressing polluted runoff is impressive. While the water quality restoration and protection successes have been significant in Maryland, there is still significant work to be done to protect and restore the waters of the state. This is especially true given the projected population growth; as the population grows, new, more efficient pollution control measures will have to be developed. In addition, we cannot rely on technology alone to restore our waters. Everyone - citizens, farmers, developers, business and all levels of government need to commit to work for a restored Chesapeake Bay, Coastal Bays and the multitude of lakes, rivers, and streams within the state.    Maryland's programs enforce regulations, provide technical and financial assistance, and promote outreach and education to prevent, reduce or mitigate the impacts of nonpoint source pollution from (1) agricultural runoff; (2) silvicultural (forestry) runoff; (3) urban runoff (including developing and developed areas); (4) marinas and recreational boating; and (5) channelization and channel modification, dams, and streambank and shoreline erosion. During the next fifteen years, the state plans to continue to implement its NPS programs statewide and in high priority areas, such as Clean Water Action Plan Category I and III watersheds. The watershed approach is being used more frequently to address, holistically, many of the water quality and living resource problems and opportunities facing the state and its local communities.      Table 6.1 provides an overview of the approach that Maryland intends to take to meet the national goal of ensuring that applicable management measures are implemented within 15 years. The implementation approach for each category of pollutant is divided into both a statewide and a watershed focus.   The ""statewide focus"" indicates that many programs and practices will be implemented across the state. Examples include regulatory programs and technical and financial assistance efforts.   A watershed approach will usually be taken under the following circumstances: (1) the delivery of services will be enhanced if involved stakeholders focus their efforts in one geographic area; (2) there is a high incidence or concentration of a pollutant in a specific watershed; (3) there is an opportunity to leverage federal, state or local financial and technical resources; or (4) limitations in financial and technical resources require a phased approach. Table 6.1 also list examples of program goals organized into five year blocks of time to demonstrate the progression of state nonpoint source implementation and a listing of some of the watersheds where implementation will be focused. Again, Table 6.1 is an overview of the approach to be taken and does not include all implementation activities. Please refer to Chapters two and three for a more detailed description of the watershed approach and Chapter four for additional information on each category of pollutant.

Please refer to Chapters two and three for a more detailed description of the Watershed approach.    ** Identified in ""Maryland Chesapeake Bay River Basin Study"" - potential nutrient   delivery to the Bay from agriculture.    Over the past few years, Maryland's Nonpoint Source Management Program has been moving from a predominately grants administering program to a multi-disciplinary program providing not only financial assistance, but nonpoint source related policy, technical and educational assistance. Keys to the Program's success rely on creating open partnerships with other nonpoint source entities and developing long and short term goals that will advance the Program in the nonpoint source pollution control arena. Some key programmatic goals for the NPS Program staff are to continue to submit information bi-annually through the Grants Reporting and Tracking System, to submit an annual project report to EPA, to maintain a user friendly webpage, to ensure that Section 319(h) grant projects result in measurable environmental results, and to better educate the public about the causes and remedies of nonpoint source pollution. One of the long-term goals for Maryland's program will be to continue to work closely with EPA and NOAA to evaluate and revise the State's Nonpoint Source Management Plan.      Statewide Implementation    The ""statewide focus"" listed in Table 6.1, indicates that many programs and practices will be implemented across the state. Examples include regulatory programs and many technical and financial assistance efforts. Regulatory programs, such as the Stormwater Management Program, the Forest Conservation Act and the Water Quality Improvement Act are implemented either through a permit process where the applicant is not authorized to take action until they can ensure that their activities will comply with state/local requirements or the applicant must submit for approval a plan that outlines how he/she will meet the state requirements. A brief overview of several programs is included below to illustrate how Maryland can ensure that the management measures covered under these regulatory programs will be implemented.    Regulatory Programs      Forestry    The Maryland Forest Conservation Act of 1991 (FCA) was enacted to protect the state's forest by making the identification and protection of forests and other sensitive areas an integral part of the site planning process. DNR's Forest Service is responsible for administering this program which is implemented through 60 local authorities with approved FCA Programs.    The Act requires that DNR conduct a review of local forest conservation programs every two years. In the process of conducting the program reviews, staff assess the compliance of local programs with the intent and standards of the FCA and identify any necessary refinements. The Department works with the jurisdiction to further incorporate sensitive area elements into local review procedures as well as the adoption of the Forest Service's tracking and reporting formats. Through this process of collaboration the successful implementation of forestry management measures is ensured.    Developed Lands    MDE is responsible for minimizing the adverse impacts that land development and urbanization have on stormwater runoff characteristics. The Department establishes policies, procedures, standards, and criteria relating to soil erosion and sediment control and stormwater management. In cases where local governments have shown the ability to enforce the provisions of their ordinances they have been delegated erosion and sediment control enforcement authority. MDE is responsible for approving all state and federal erosion and sediment control plans. Under the state's Stormwater Management Program local jurisdictions have enforcement responsibility. The state sets standards and procedures for local governments to follow and oversees their implementation.      State and local regulatory programs track permits for construction activities. MDE is the lead enforcement agency in most cases, the Inspection and Compliance Division is notified when new projects receive a permit. Applicants must notify the permitting jurisdiction ten days before they begin their construction activities. State and local inspectors make routine site visits throughout the construction process and have the authority to issue cease and disist orders if a project violates state regulations, this includes monetary penalties for projects that remain noncompliant.      Agricultural Lands    On May 12, 1998, Maryland's Governor signed and enacted the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998. The Law provides a framework for a set of regulatory requirements. The regulations are currently being developed by the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) with the assistance of a 35 member Nutrient Advisory Committee.    The most far-reaching requirement of the WQIA is that all agricultural operations with gross annual incomes greater than $2,500 or with more than eight animal units (one animal unit equals 1,000 pounds live weight) must have and implement a nitrogen and phosphorus-based nutrient management   plan. The Act requires that anyone ""who, in operating a farm, or uses chemical fertilizer"" must have a nitrogen-and-phosphorus based plan by December 31, 2001, and must implement it by December 31, 2002.      Persons using sludge or animal manure must have and implement nitrogen-based plans by the same dates as those using chemical fertilizers. Those using sludge or animal manure have until July 1, 2004, to submit a nitrogen and phosphorus based nutrient management plan, and must implement it by July 1, 2005.    This legislation applies to all farming operations. This includes poultry and livestock operations, vegetable growers, organic producers, nurseries, greenhouses, turf grass producers, and certain horse farms. Regulations also formalize required nutrient management plan content, standards and criteria to be followed in the development of state-approved nutrient management plans.      All nutrient management plans developed are subject to the Act, and all plan revisions must be filed with the Maryland Department of Agriculture. MDA has full authority to determine compliance with the Act and will conduct on-farm evaluations of the implementation of the nutrient management plan.      Cost Share Programs and Alternative Financing Strategies    Maryland also offers a myriad of cost-share programs that are applied statewide (See Chapter 5 - Public Education, Outreach and Assistance Programs). For example, financial and technical assistance is provided to landowners by Soil Conservation Districts, MDA, NRCS and DNR to implement on-the-ground BMPs that treat runoff, buffer sensitive areas, or provide assistance on forestry and wildlife management activities. The Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) has been influential in recruiting enrollment of agricultural land for riparian forest buffers (DNR - Stream ReLeaf Program) and created wetlands.    In addition, MDE offers cost-share assistance that can be used to fund implementation of nonpoint source capital improvements such as stormwater management and stream restoration projects.    The state is also promoting alternative and innovative financing strategies. Financial burdens placed upon local watershed and stormwater management programs have increased dramatically in recent years as a result of a growing list of federal, state and Chesapeake Bay requirements as well as increased citizen demands to improve the quality of streams, lakes and the Bay. Local governments are currently exploring the establishment of ""Watershed / Stormwater Utilities"" that will develop a dedicated funding source. Modifications to Maryland's stormwater management law were made in 1992 to allow for ""Watershed / Stormwater Utilities"" to be developed by local governments.    Watershed Based Implementation    The development of the Tributary Strategies, Targeted Watershed Program, Coastal Bays Management Plan, and the various river basin plans has been an effort to more fully address water quality issues at a smaller geographic (i.e., watershed) scale. During the next 15 years, Maryland will continue to implement the recommendations contained in each of our existing strategies and, pursuant to the Clean Water Action Plan, develop new watershed restoration and conservation action strategies. The following section illustrates how some of these watershed plans will be used to ensure implementation of the management measures.         As part of the Tributary Strategies initiative, specific measures of success (i.e., 40%     nutrient reduction goal) were identified and procedures were established so that the State     could track its progress toward accomplishing the goal. Appendix 4 provides an example of     the most recent implementation table.          The Maryland Coastal Bays Management Plan contains information detailing action items,     timetables and implementing authorities. Members of the various committees (Policy,     Implementation, Scientific and Citizens) are charged with ensuring implementation of the     action items. EPA also conducts a biennial review to assess the state's progress.          The Targeted Watersheds Project demonstrates how targeting can be used to focus     implementation of management measures to a smaller geographic scale. The Project's     objective is to demonstrate that improvements in water quality and habitat conditions can     be achieved by coordinating monitoring, pollution control, and restoration programs of     both public and private organizations.      In 1989, four watersheds were targeted because they were threatened by multiple sources of degradation from urbanization or contributed disproportionately high levels of nutrients to the Chesapeake Bay from agricultural nonpoint sources. The project worked with watershed-wide (synoptic) surveys of nutrients and toxics to identify hot spots and source areas and used protocols such as the Stream Corridor Assessment Methodology to locate problem sites. The members of the project developed a suite of methods for targeting and prioritizing restoration activities and have begun to employ better project designs for the project's BMP evaluations. This project has helped refine the delivery and implementation of watershed restoration services. As we take the lessons learned from this study and apply them to other watersheds, it is anticipated that the delivery of services (technical and financial assistance) will greatly improve.        Maryland updates its list of water quality-limited segments     (the ""303(d) list"") using data from the 305(b) report with other readily     available information from monitoring efforts conducted by federal and local governmental     agencies, as well as by academic and research organizations. Once the waters to be     included on the 303(d) list have been identified, priority categories (High, Medium and     Low) are assigned to each water quality limited segment. These priority rankings, which     take into account the severity of the pollution and uses to be made of the waters, are     used for purposes of resource allocation and scheduling. However, due to variable data     needs and analytical complexity, priority may not translate directly to order of TMDL     completion. Once approved by EPA, the TMDL sets the framework for tailoring additional     controls and institutional procedures for restoring and maintaining water quality     standards.               The Integrated Project Priority System (IPPS) recently     developed by MDE, promotes watershed-based selection of water pollution control projects     that are proposed for funding by the State. It outlines criteria and procedures for     prioritizing projects which is based on the condition of the receiving waterbody. The IPPS     uses the 303(d) list to identify impaired waters, and to select projects with the most     water quality benefits to minimize existing water quality impairments.               MDE is implementing a Watershed-Based Permitting System. To     facilitate this, MDE has developed a watershed cycling framework in which the State is     divided into five regions. Water quality management activities will be cycled through     those regions over a five-year period. This approach allows a significant amount of     resources to be concentrated in 20% of the State at any given time, thereby increasing     both the efficient use of resources and the intensity of water quality   evaluation.     The choice of a five-year cycle is dictated in large part by the requirement of federal     surface water discharge permits, which are reissued.      Progress Evaluation      During the next 15 years, Maryland will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of projects and/or management systems and their progress toward achieving environmental and programmatic goals. Chapter four details how the state currently tracks its implementation activities. In addition, there are:        numerous checks and balances in the regulatory programs     (e.g., biennial reviews of the local Forest Conservation Act Programs and state review of     the Storm Water Management Programs);     a variety of indicators ( See Chapter two - Environmental     Indicators) that have been developed that will enable the state to measure its     performance;     water quality monitoring programs; and     advisory committees (Tributary Teams, Coastal and Watershed     Resources Advisory Committee and State Water Quality Advisory Committee) that evaluate     current activities and make recommendations that will ensure that efficiency and     effectiveness of future programs.      For example,        Maryland's Stormwater Management Program continues to     evolve as issues related to existing and developing land runoff are identified. Increased     emphasis on water quality, resource protection and BMP maintenance costs have all     contributed to basic philosophical changes regarding stormwater management. The Program is     currently in the process of finalizing draft regulations in an effort to incorporate the     significant experiences gained by the State's stormwater community and accommodate much     needed improvements for managing urban runoff. The proposed regulations include     incorporating the new Maryland Stormwater Design Manual by reference and addressing     re-development.      The design standards and environmental incentives presented in the Manual are intended to advance the science of managing stormwater by relying less on singular BMPs for all development projects and more on mimicking existing hydrology through total site design policies. Additionally, the inherent philosophical change should produce smaller less obtrusive facilities that are more aesthetic and less burdensome on those responsible for long term performance.   The adoption of these new regulations will directly ensure and enhance the implementation of management measures related to developed lands. Some of the management measures that will be promoted through the new regulations include: New Development, Watershed Protection, Site Development, and Vegetative Treatment Systems.    The Maryland Stormwater Management Program conducts periodic reviews of the local jurisdictions operating with approved stormwater management authority. Approved jurisdictions have enforcement responsibility. It is through program review and BMP evaluation that Maryland has continued to enhance the Stormwater Management Program.        Tributary Teams have become involved in many policy issues,     providing recommendations on technical, funding, and planning programs. Team comments have     helped win funding, shape policy direction, and set priorities. Teams have addressed:     Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, Cover Crop Cost Share Program, Blue Ribbon     Citizens Pfiesteria Action Commission, Stream ReLeaf Implementation Plan, Total Daily     Maximum Loads, Youth Environmental Summit, Clean Water Action Plan, Soil Conservation     District Staffing, Rural Legacy, Priority Funding Areas, Environmental Partnership     Agreement, Implementation Tracking, Stormwater Design Manual, and the1997 Nutrient     Re-evaluation. The Tributary Teams provide an important feedback loop to assist state and     local programs in prioritizing approaches taken in the different watersheds.               Under the TMDL process, the watershed cycling strategy     establishes a natural evaluation framework. As the cycle is completed for a given     watershed, field monitoring will be conducted again where it had been conducted five-years     beforehand. This will serve as an opportunity to assess the initial results of the TMDL     and implementation activities.      The state's efforts to track implementation of best management practices, evaluate program efficiency and effectiveness, along with input received from advisory committees and the results of water quality monitoring and assessments   will allow the state to demonstrate progress, to determine if any mid-course corrections are needed or determine if additional management measures may be required.    Finally, the State of Maryland is participating in the first-ever, comprehensive evaluation of the Chesapeake Bay restoration effort  Chesapeake Bay Program 2000 and Beyond . Extensive public input has been solicited, internal assessment of various provisions have been conducted and various long-term scenarios for the Bay's future are underway. The Chesapeake Bay Program will use the results of this broad valuation process to consider those issues which will be included in the new Chesapeake Bay Agreement. Currently, the Draft Agreement includes new goals as well as issue specific processes that will determine when and how these new efforts will be addressed.    Several examples contained in the Draft Agreement are included below:    (1) While each state continues their efforts to achieve and maintain the 40 percent nutrient reduction goal agreed to in 1987, the new draft agreement commits the Chesapeake Bay Program Signatories to work to ensure that by 2010, we can correct all nutrient-related problems in the Chesapeake Bay and its tidal tributaries sufficient to remove the Bay and the tidal portions of its tributaries from the list of impaired waters under the Clean Water Act. In order to achieve this the following steps will be taken:    •By 2001, define the water quality conditions necessary to protect aquatic living resources; and then, assign load reductions for nitrogen and phosphorus to each major tributary;    •By 2002, complete a public process to develop and begin implementation of revised Tributary Strategies to achieve and maintain the assigned loading goals; and,    •By 2003, the jurisdictions with tidal waters will use their best efforts to adopt new or revised water quality standards consistent with the defined water quality conditions. Once adopted by the jurisdictions, the EPA will work expeditiously to review the new or revised standards, which will then be used as the basis for removing the Bay and its tidal rivers from the list of impaired waters.    (2) By 2010, the Draft Agreement states that the Signatories will correct all sediment-related problems in the Chesapeake Bay and the tidal portion of its tributaries sufficient to remove the Bay and the tidal portions of its tributaries from the list of impaired waters under the Clean Water Act. In order achieve this the following steps will be taken:    •Using a process parallel to that established for nutrients, determine the load reductions to achieve the water quality conditions necessary to protect aquatic living resources and assign load reductions for sediment to each major tributary by 2001;    •Complete tributary strategies to achieve the reductions by 2002; and    •Integrate sediment reductions in order to develop water quality standards for tidal waters by 2003, based upon the defined water quality conditions.    (3) The Draft Agreement states that the Signatories will achieve a net resource gain by restoring 25,000 acres of tidal and non-tidal wetlands by 2010 in the entire Chesapeake Bay Basin. To do this, the Signatories commit to achieve and maintain an average restoration rate of 2,500 acres per year basin wide by 2005 and beyond. The Signatories will evaluate their success in 2005.    (4) Finally, by 2003, the Signatories will ensure that measures are in place to meet the Chesapeake Bay Basin's riparian forest buffer restoration goal of 2,010 miles by 2010 and determine the potential to significantly expand this goal.

Clean Water Act & Nonpoint       Source Pollution       Program Overview                   To                                                                                                                                                                                        Maryland's Nonpoint Source Pollution Prevention Programs       What is Nonpoint Source Pollution ?       N onpoint source  pollution (NPS), unlike pollution from industrial and sewage treatment plants, comes from many diffuse sources. This type of pollution is called nonpoint source pollution because it does not come from a single outlet, waste pipe, or ""point"" source.  NPS  is caused  when  rainfall or snowmelt ,  moving over and through the ground,  picks up and carries away natural and human-made pollutants, finally depositing them into lakes, rivers, wetlands, coastal waters, and even our underground sources of drinking water. These pollutants  potentially include:             Fertilizers, herbicides, and insecticides from agricultural lands    and residential areas;                           Oil, grease, and              chemicals from urban runoff.                           Sediment from construction sites, crop and forest lands, and eroding streambanks;                           Acid drainage from abandoned mines;                           Bacteria and nutrients from livestock, pet wastes, and              septic systems;                           Atmospheric deposition and hydromodification are also sources of nonpoint source pollution.      Maryland's Strategy For Reducing Nonpoint Source Pollution   Because Maryland's nonpoint source pollution problems are as diverse as its landscape, the state has developed a variety of nonpoint source pollution programs aimed at combating these varied pollution sources.   Maryland's strategy is two-fold, first the revised NPS management plan outlines various ongoing NPS control initiatives, and second, Maryland is engaged in a number of special watershed initiatives aimed at water quality improvement.                                1.

Revised Management plan/NPS Control Programs. The  revised NPS management plan     (March 2000) describes the nonpoint source program and initiatives aimed at controlling nonpoint source pollution from six broad categories (see management plan for details).              Agriculture   On the farm, eroded soil, fertilizers, and animal wastes washing off the land can have a profound effect on water quality downstream. The major agricultural nonpoint source pollutants that could potentially result from agricultural activities are sediments, nutrients, pathogens, pesticides.    Agriculture Programs Good water quality is the most critical element in the overall restoration and protection of the Chesapeake Bay, the Coastal Bays and their tributaries.  Maryland has a variety of agricultural programs described below that contribute to the overall reduction of nonpoint source pollution from agricultural sources. a.)   Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP):    CREP provides annual rental payments for 10 -15 years and cost share for installing BMPS to conserve sensitive resource areas.  During calendar year 2001, Maryland farmers enrolled a total of 14,695 acres in CREP.  Included in this total are 5,658 acres of riparian vegetated buffers, 5,666 acres of riparian forested buffers, 765 acres of wetland restoration, and 2,562 acres of highly erodible land conservation. b.)   Nutrient Management /Water Quality Improvement Act (WQIA   ) : In 1998, the Maryland General Assembly passed landmark legislation that places Maryland at the forefront of national efforts to protect water quality. The Water Quality Improvement Act (WQIA) established both short and long-term strategies for reducing nutrient levels in our streams, rivers and Chesapeake Bay.    The most significant feature of the Act is a provision requiring nutrient management plans for virtually all Maryland farms. c.)   Manure Transport Program: The Manure Transport Pilot Project provides support to animal producers who have excess manure and need alternative means of managing it in order to be in compliance with the Water Quality Improvement Act. d.)   Maryland Agricultural Cost Share Program (MACS) : State and federal funds are used to provide grants to Maryland farmers for the installation of best management practices (BMPs) to alleviate existing or potential critical water pollution conditions associated with farming activity.          e.)  Soil Conservation and Water Quality Program: Statewide, 59% of agricultural land is managed under a current SCWQ plan. In 2001 alone,  The Soil Conservation and Water Quality (SCWQ) Program enabled the development of 1,300 SCWQ plans for 101,000 acres with an associated 6,200 BMPs installed. f.)  Public Drainage Program: The Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) regulates agricultural public drainage facilities administered as Public Drainage Associations (PDAs).    PDAs are independent political subdivisions and cover over 850 miles of drainage ditches in the coastal zone, mostly on the Eastern Shore. The PDAs are required to develop operation and maintenance plans which address sediment control and water quality protection.        Forestry  Sources of NPS pollution associated with forestry activities include removal of streamside vegetation, timber harvesting, mechanical preparation for the planting of trees, road construction and use. Harvesting trees in the area beside a stream can affect water quality by increasing sediment loads from runoff,  reducing the streambank shading that regulates water temperature and by removing vegetation that stabilizes the streambanks. These physical  changes can harm aquatic life by limiting sources of food, shade, and shelter.   Forest health is inextricably linked to healthy streams and robust Chesapeake Bay and Coastal Bays watersheds.    Forestry Programs a.)     Riparian Forest Buffer/Stream ReLeaf Initiative:   In October 1994, the Chesapeake Executive Council adopted a directive  to develop a policy which would enhance riparian stewardship and efforts to conserve and to restore riparian forest buffers.  The following goals were adopted for this initiative 1) to assure, to the extent feasible, that all streams and shorelines will be protected by a forested or other riparian buffer; 2) to conserve existing forests along all streams and shorelines; and 3) to increase the use of all riparian buffers and restore riparian forests, targeting efforts where they will be of greatest value to water quality and living resources. In 2001, Marylanders created over 264 miles of forest buffers along waterways under the leadership of DNR, a rate over twice the annual goal.    Currently, the total accomplishment is 595.7 miles.    This accomplishment brings us very close to the Governor’s goal of 600 miles by 2010, and is a bulwark of our efforts to reduce nutrient pollution and restore habitat in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. b.)   Special Rivers Initiative:  The Special Rivers Project consists of critical technical and outreach support for watershed improvement through forest restoration and management.    Each of the four regional projects:  the Anacostia River ,  Monocacy River ,  Susquehanna River , and  Town Creek -- remain focused on  buffer creation and preparation of site-specific forest stewardship plans. c.)  Forest Conservation Act : The Forest Conservation Act provides guidelines for the amount of forest land retained or planted after the completion of development projects. These guidelines vary for each development site and are based on land-use categories. These categories include agricultural and resource, medium-density residential, institutional development, high-density residential, mixed use, planned-units development, and commercial and industrial use areas.     Urban Development Urbanization increases the variety and amount of pollutants transported to receiving waters.  Sediment from development and new construction; oil, grease, and toxic chemicals from automobiles; nutrients and pesticides from turf management and gardening; viruses and bacteria from failing septic systems; road salts; and heavy metals are examples of pollutants generated in urban areas. Sediments and solids constitute the largest volume of pollutant loads to receiving waters in urban areas. Urban Development Programs These management initiatives are intended to control runoff and treat associated pollutants generated from new development, redevelopment, and new and relocated roads, highways and bridges. In Maryland, this measure is met through the State’s Stormwater Management (SWM) program, which addresses proposed disturbances over 5,000 square feet, including residential, commercial, industrial, and institutional development, as well as new and relocated roads and bridges.   a.)   Stormwater Management -- Phase II Program: Final 1999 Stormwater Phase II regulations expand the existing NPDES Stormwater Management (SWM) program to address stormwater discharges from municipal storm sewers and construction activity.     The new SWM program incorporates the Phase II requirements, detailed in the publication known as the 2000 Maryland Stormwater Design Manual. b.)  Low Impact Development (LID): Bioretention,   green roofs, raingardens, reductions in impervious surface area, disconnections of roof runoff, and directing sheet flow to vegetated buffers are some of the main components of the voluntary Low Impact Development (LID) approach for managing stormwater runoff. c.)  Sediment and Erosion Control Program: The Maryland Sediment and Erosion Control Program is operated at the local level where local governments have shown the ability to enforce the provisions of their ordinances relating to soil erosion and sediment control.     In other cases, the state has retained enforcement responsibilities.    Maryland Department of Environment (MDE) conducts periodic reviews of local programs to ensure that implementation is acceptable and it has the authority to suspend delegation and take over any program that does not meet state standards. d.)    Onsite Sewage Disposal Systems (OSDS):   The Maryland Department of the Environment, Ground Water Permits Division is responsible for the development of regulations pertaining to the citing, construction, and general permitting of septic systems or onsite sewage disposal   systems.   Authority for permitting, tracking and monitoring OSDS is delegated to county health departments.   DNR has issued two recent requests for proposals to fund coastal counties to   develop inventories and data management systems for OSDS and  delineate nitrogen sensitive waters and develop OSDS management plans. e.)  Smart Growth Initiatives : The Smart Growth Initiative addresses nonpoint source pollution by protecting rural landscapes, agricultural lands, forests, and other natural areas, encouraging development in areas with existing infrastructure, and by promoting the principals of    Maryland’s    ‘GreenPrint’ and ‘Green Building’ programs.        Marina and Recreational Boating   I ndividual boats and marinas usually release only small amounts of pollutants. Yet, when multiplied by thousands of boaters and marinas, they can cause distinct water quality problems in lakes, rivers, and coastal waters. Potential environmental impacts from boating and marinas are: high toxicity in the water; increased pollutant concentrations in aquatic organisms and sediments; increased erosion rates; increased nutrients, leading to an increase in algae and a decrease in oxygen (eutrophication); and high levels of pathogens. In addition, construction at marinas can lead to the physical destruction of sensitive ecosystems and bottom-dwelling aquatic communities.   Water pollution from boating and marinas is linked to several sources. They include poorly flushed waterways, boat maintenance, discharge of sewage from boats, storm water runoff from marina parking lots, and the physical alteration of shoreline, wetlands, and aquatic habitat during the construction and operation of marinas.   Marinas and Recreational Boating Initiative         Maryland established the Clean Marina Initiative to promote understanding and adoption of pollution prevention measures associated with the impacts of pleasure boats on water quality.      The program goal is to certify 25 percent of the State's 600 boating facilities as   Clean    Marinas by 2004.       Hydromodification/Channelization  In Maryland there is a network of over 14,000 miles of streams and rivers.    Human activities, such as channelization, dams, diversions, and floodplain development can disrupt the natural hydrologic regime of the system resulting in a widespread deterioration of environmental quality.    Hydromodification/Channelization   initiatives           Current management approaches focus on the modification of watershed hydrology to replicate (to the degree possible) the hydrology in undisturbed forested watersheds. Maryland is working to curtail or reverse damages from hydromodification through a variety of programs and projects including the shore erosion control and fish passage programs.      a.)   Shore Erosion Control Initiative: Maryland’s Shore Erosion Control Program was established in 1968 within DNR for the purpose of addressing shoreline and streambank erosion problems along the Chesapeake Bay and Coastal Bays and their tributaries.    The Program provides assistance to Maryland property owners in resolving shoreline and streambank erosion problems. Since 1968, Shore Erosion Control has assisted numerous property owners and established more than 800 structural projects and 325 non-structural projects. Property owners in Maryland can request technical assistance and financial assistance from the Shore Erosion Control Program. b.)   Fish Passage  Initiative: Maryland's Fish Passage Program, administered by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR), began in 1988. One of the  priorities is to re-open habitat and remove blockages on streams to allow fish to return to traditional spawning grounds. Since its inception, the program has completed 53 projects, and re-opening 292 miles of spawning habitat.     Wetlands and Riparian Areas   Initiative           A variety of wetlands exist in Maryland, however two basic types of wetlands are commonly recognized: nontidal wetlands and tidal wetlands. Wetlands serve to filter and remove many pollutants.  Wetlands can intercept runoff and transform and store NPS pollutants like sediment, nutrients, and certain heavy metals without being degraded. In addition, wetlands vegetation can keep stream channels intact by slowing runoff and by evenly distributing the energy in runoff.      Improper development or excessive pollutant loads such as sediments can damage wetlands. The degraded wetlands can no longer provide water quality benefits and become significant sources of NPS pollution. Excessive amounts of decaying wetlands vegetation, for example, can increase biochemical oxygen demand, making habitat unsuitable for fish and other aquatic life. Degraded wetlands also release stored nutrients and other chemicals into surface water and ground water.     Measures to both restore and protect wetlands are an important component of nonpoint source pollution control.  During 2001, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) created a draft State Wetlands Conservation Plan whose mission is to identify and resolve gaps in current wetlands management for statewide conservation and preservation of wetland ecosystems and their functions through consistent federal, state, public, and private participation, while recognizing competing resource needs.       2.  Watershed initiatives aimed at improving water quality Maryland has several interrelated watershed initiatives:    a) WRAS Partnership Program, b) The 2000 Chesapeake Bay Agreement's Watershed Planning Commitment, and c) Coastal Bays Comprehensive Coastal Management Plan.    a .)  Watershed Restoration Action Strategy (WRAS) Partnership Program  : A completed WRAS  is a watershed restoration or protection work plan, prepared by a local   government with public input. It is based on an assessment of natural resources and it identifies priority restoration and   protection areas. It details monitoring programs and the responsible parties   needed to address the restoration or protection goals outlined.  WRAS utilize   assesment services of DNR and the state Departments of Environment, Planning and Agriculture to provide technical assistance and funding, with the participation of other partners such as the Soil Conservation District,  watershed associations or other citizen groups.   b.)  Chesapeake Bay 2000 Watershed Commitment Implementation and Tracking  : Watershed management planning is also addressed in the multi-state Chesapeake Bay 2000 Agreement.   One commitment, in particular, states:   By 2010, work with local governments, community groups and watershed organizations to develop and implement locally supported watershed management plans in two-thirds of the Bay watershed covered by this Agreement. These plans would address the protection, conservation and restoration of stream corridors, riparian forest buffers and wetlands for the purposes of improving habitat and water quality, with collateral benefits for optimizing stream flow and water supply .      Within the Chesapeake Bay’s drainage, Maryland has 127 watersheds (Maryland’s 8-digit watersheds).    Maryland has committed to develop and implement, by 2010, 2/3 of 127 or approximately 85 (8-digit) watershed management plans (WMPs) or strategies covering the Bay watershed.   c.)   C oastal Bays Comprehensive Coastal Management Plan      Outside the boundaries of the Chesapeake Bay drainage area in Maryland i.e. in the Coastal Bays watersheds-- watershed planning efforts are outlined in the Coastal Bays Comprehensive Coastal Management Plan.

GX228-30-5654236	Maryland's       Watershed Initiatives                   Maryland has several interrelated watershed initiatives         underway:                                        WRAS Partnership Program                           Chesapeake Bay 2000 Watershed Planning             Commitment.                             Coastal Bays Comprehensive Coastal Management             Plan.                        WRAS         Partnership Program                                                   Maryland continues its watershed approach         to nonpoint source control, primarily through the Watershed Restoration         Action Strategy (WRAS) Partnership Program.             The program links the state and various local governments to         jointly develop the action strategies.            WRAS watershed targeting is based on Maryland’s Clean Water         Action Plan (1998), which called for the assessment of the condition of         all the state’s waters.    The         resulting Unified Watershed Assessment (UWA) defined a set of those         watersheds that were most in need of restoration – the Category 1         Priority Watersheds.     Funding for development and implementation of WRASs is         provided from both the 319 and Coastal Zone Management Programs, and is         targeted to Category 1 Priority watersheds, with top priority being         those Category 1s with special areas needing preservation (watersheds         sharing Category 3 characteristics).                                 Development of strategies for individual watersheds is a county-led         process resulting in the development of priority water quality and         habitat preservation and restoration actions within a comprehensive         management context.     Watershed         management planning is primarily a  county  level function, with         the assistance or input from other partners, such as Soil Conservation         Districts, landowners, or local watershed associations.            The WRAS Partnership Program recognizes that most of the         decisions regarding land use, zoning, open space, etc., are the         responsibility of local governments.            In addition, county governments possess the local knowledge to         develop watershed assessments and plans, and are able to commit         resources to implementation.              WRASs utilize services of DNR and the state Departments of Environment,         Planning and Agriculture to provide technical assistance and funding,         with the participation of other partners such as the Soil Conservation         District, and watershed associations or other citizen groups.            Additional WRAS partners include landowners, federal agencies,         businesses, and schools.    Partners         also include the Maryland Chesapeake Bay Tributary Teams         (Governor-appointed volunteers working to develop and implement policy,         outreach and education initiatives).            These additional partners provide technical assistance, community         support, volunteers, and stewardship opportunities such as restoration         plantings, cleanups, education, or other activities.           A completed WRAS strategy is a work plan based on an assessment of         natural resource conditions and scientific monitoring data.            The strategy identifies the most important causes of water         pollution and resource degradation, and details actions, as well as         responsible parties, to address problems.    It also provides milestones for measuring progress.            The WRAS identifies areas of concern, needed monitoring, gaps in         information, mitigation options, and restoration and protection         opportunities.                     Chesapeake         Bay 2000 Watershed Commitment Implementation and Tracking                                                             Watershed management planning is also addressed in         the multi-state 2000 Chesapeake Bay Agreement.            One commitment, in particular, states:                                         By 2010,         work with local governments, community groups and watershed         organizations to develop and implement locally supported watershed         management plans in two-thirds of the Bay watershed covered by this         Agreement. These plans would address the protection, conservation and         restoration of stream corridors, riparian forest buffers and wetlands         for the purposes of improving habitat and water quality, with collateral         benefits for optimizing stream flow and water supply                                                  Maryland has 127 watersheds (Maryland’s 8-digit         watersheds) within the Chesapeake Bay’s drainage.            Maryland committed to develop and implement, by 2010, 2/3 of 127         or approximately 85 (8-digit) watershed management plans (WMPs) or         strategies covering the Bay watershed.                               Efforts to achieve this Bay Agreement commitment are         two-fold.    DNR’s         Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Services continues to lead development         of locally-sponsored WRASs.    At         the same time efforts are underway to develop a system to recognize, count, and         help implement local watershed management plans resulting from various         other programs or requirements but which fulfill the requirements of the         2/3 commitment. These may include, for example, the WMPs developed         pursuant to NPDES storm water permit requirements or other programs. The         tracking system, beginning with an on-site survey of local watershed         management planning efforts, began in 2002.            Potential benefits to local governments will include: 1)         statewide recognition of quality work achieved, 2) ability for local         governments to be more competitive for receipt of CWA 319 implementation         funds and various other grant sources as well as technical assistance         services and 3) potential consideration as part of an applicable TMDL         (Total Maximum Daily Load) implementation plan or its equivalent (see         Program Integration section below).                                          Coastal         Bays Comprehensive Coastal Management Plan                                                             In addition, outside the boundaries of the         Chesapeake Bay drainage area in Maryland -- in the Coastal Bays         watersheds-- watershed planning efforts continue with the         provision of state technical and financial assistance, and WRAS         Partnership development to help implement the Coastal Bays Comprehensive         Coastal Management Plan.

GX228-33-14477134	5.)         Nonpoint Source Management Measures                     .                               The         Statewide Nonpoint Source Management Plan and the Coastal Nonpoint         Program are integrated through a number of management measures. The         Coastal Nonpoint Control Program’s management measures are defined as         economically achievable measures to control the addition of nonpoint         pollution to coastal waters.    These         measures reflect the greatest degree of pollution reduction achievable         using the best available nonpoint pollution control practices,         technologies, processes, siting criteria, operating methods, or other         alternatives.                                                               NPS         Management Measure Categories                                                              The revised management plan (March 2000) describes         nonpoint source programs and initiatives aimed at controlling nonpoint         source pollution from six broad pollution categories: agriculture,         developed lands, forestry, marinas and recreational boating,         hydromodification, and wetlands/riparian areas.                                             This         annual report summarizes pollution prevention and control efforts in         these broad pollution categories.    During         the past year significant progress has been made toward achieving a         variety of management measures and program goals including: the         development of nutrient management plans, the creation of hundreds of         miles of forested buffers, the expanded number of marinas pledged and         certified as Clean Marinas, implementation of Phase II Stormwater         Management (SWM) guidelines, addressing the On Site Sewage Disposal (OSDS)         issue, and increased funding for land preservation, stream restoration         and wetland creation.    This         report contains detailed information describing statewide progress and         specific projects within each broad pollution category.                                          5.1.)  Agriculture                                         Good water quality is the most critical element in         the overall restoration and protection of the Chesapeake Bay, the         Coastal Bays and their tributaries for the support of living resources         and to ensure safe drinking water supplies and other beneficial uses.           Agricultural activity, human population growth, low density         development (i.e., sprawl), and septic systems are   each         contributing nonpoint source pollution in the form of nutrients and         bacteria which affect the State’s surface and ground waters.                                           A strong agricultural industry and a healthy         environment go hand in hand. The Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model         indicates that Maryland farmers achieved the majority of water quality         objectives in every major watershed and continue to exceed their goals         for implementing best management practices (BMPs) to manage nutrients,         control erosion and protect water quality.    As         we move ahead into the future, agricultural and soil conservation         partners will continue to preserve Maryland's rural legacy by developing         and promoting farming practices that are both environmentally sensitive         and economically sound.    Maryland         has a variety of agricultural programs (CREP, MACS, Soil Conservation         Water Quality, Agricultural Water Management Program) described below         that contribute to the overall reduction of nonpoint source pollution.                                           5.1.1.)         Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP)                               Maryland's         conservation programs have come a long way since initial efforts to         protect natural resources focused chiefly on soil conservation. Today,         agricultural partners work to develop new technologies that address a         variety of environmental issues, such as wetland habitat protection,         forest buffer plantings and animal waste management. In addition,         partners work to develop new programs, including the innovative         Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), which helps farmers         protect sensitive streamside areas.            CREP provides annual rental payments for 10 –15 years and cost         share for installing BMPS to conserve sensitive resource areas.                                                             During         calendar year 2001, farmers enrolled a total of 14,695 acres in CREP.            Included in this total are 5,658 acres of riparian vegetated         buffers, 5,666 acres of riparian forested buffers, 765 acres of wetland         restoration, and 2,562 acres of highly erodible land conservation.            Some of these efforts are also highlighted in the forestry         management measure category detailed below.            Also, see the CREP website at  http://www.mda.state.md.us/resource/crep.htm                                                                                                                                           Presentation on CREP program in Harford County by Soil         Conservation District and MD DNR Forestry personnel, July 2001.                                                         5.1.2.)  Nutrient Management         /Water Quality Improvement Act (WQIA)                                                   In 1998, the Maryland General Assembly passed landmark legislation that         places Maryland at the forefront of national efforts to protect water         quality. The Water Quality Improvement Act (WQIA) established both short         and long-term strategies for reducing nutrient levels in our streams,         rivers and Chesapeake Bay.    The most significant feature of the Act is a provision         requiring nutrient management plans for virtually all Maryland farms.         The Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998 changed the nutrient         management program to a regulatory program, requiring farmers who use         commercial fertilizers to submit a nitrogen and phosphorus based plan to         the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) by December 31, 2001 and         implement it by December 31, 2002.            Farmers who use animal manure or sludge must have nitrogen based         plans by the same dates as those who use chemical fertilizers.            Those who have sludge or animal manure have until July 1, 2004 to         submit a nitrogen and phosphorus based nutrient management plan and must         implement it by July 1, 2005.    Although         the new law includes a number of deadlines and requirements, it also         offers many new incentives aimed at helping farmers comply.                                         In 2001, the majority of Maryland farmers complied         with the first of the nutrient management plan reporting deadlines         stemming from the Water Quality Improvement Act.            As of December 31, 2001, Maryland farmers officially submitted         nutrient management plan information for approximately 1.1 million acres         of agricultural land, representing 65% of the agricultural land that is         covered by the law.    The         information submitted includes 2,152 completed nutrient management plans         covering 338,392 acres.    Another         2,993 farmers submitted information on a Justification for Delay form         indicating they were still working with a consultant to develop their         plans on a total of 757,535 acres.            The Nonpoint Source Program has provided cost-share funds to have         private sector consultants develop nutrient management plans.                                                              During         2001, information and instruction on proper sampling of soil and manure         were disseminated during farm visits, yield checks were performed,         nutrient application equipment was calibrated for producers, record         keeping tools were distributed to producers to encourage improved record         keeping, and instruction on the calibration of equipment was provided.            Extension staff participated in numerous nutrient management         training courses, and several training sessions on “Writing Nutrient         Management Plans” were held.                                                                Outreach         activities geared toward agricultural producers are ongoing.            The pamphlet “Nutrient Manager - Focus on the Phosphorus Site         Index” was completed and distributed, the Nutrient Management Display         was exhibited at county fairs, and the Urban Nutrient Management         Workgroup continues to focus on events to educate people about urban and         related nutrient practices to minimize or eliminate contamination to         waters in Maryland.    For         example, materials entitled ‘Fertilizer Recommendations for Trees and         Shrubs’ and ‘Recommendations for Cut Flowers Production’ were         published. For more information on available publications, please see         the MDA Nutrient Management website at  http://www.mda.state.md.us/nutrient/contents.html           5.1.3.)         Manure Transport Program                                                   The         Manure Transportation Pilot Project provides support to animal producers         who have excess manure and need to find alternative means of managing it         in order to be in compliance with the Water Quality Improvement Act.            The objectives of the program included subsidizing the cost of         transporting animal manure to make it affordable for animal producers to         address excess manure and providing an incentive for the development of         alternative technologies and business ventures to create a market for         use of animal manures.    This         year (SFY 01), approximately 36,930 tons of excess manure was         transported.     See            http://www.mda.state.md.us/            for more information.                                            Operations         receiving manure for land application under the Project must apply it in         accordance with a nutrient management plan prepared by a certified         consultant.    Receiving         operations with alternative uses for manure are also eligible to         participate. To date, practically all of the manure transported has been         poultry litter. Reimbursement for all participants is capped at $20 per         ton.    Fifty percent of the         cost of transporting poultry litter is paid by commercial poultry         companies.    Livestock         producers received 87.5% of costs from public funds.                                         5.1.4.)         Maryland Agricultural Cost Share (MACS)                                                   State         and federal funds are used to provide grants to Maryland farmers for the         installation of best management practices (BMPs) to alleviate existing         or potential critical water pollution conditions associated with farming         activity.    Management actions were taken to continue to improve MACS         Program administra­tion at the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA)         headquarters and to improve the consistency of Program administration at         the local Soil Conservation District (SCD) level.            These efforts have made the program more attractive to         farmers, accelerating the installation of BMPs, and increasing farmer         participation in Maryland's nonpoint source pollution control program.            For more detailed information on the program,  see the MACS website at:           http://www.mda.state.md.us/nutrient/costsh61.pdf                                                             For         the 2001 reporting period (state fiscal year (SFY) 01), there were 1,327         BMPs installed, 68,021 acres of cover crops planted, and 75 Poultry and         Livestock Waste Storage facilities built for use under the MACS program.            The positive environmental impact of (MACS) BMPs resulted in an         estimated 29,489 tons of soil saved, 2,084 tons of manure managed daily,         and the prevention of movement of 578,000 pounds nitrogen and 13,600         pounds of phosphorus through the use of cover crops.                               5.1.5.)         Soil Conservation and Water Quality Program                                The Soil Conservation and Water Quality (SCWQ) Program         enabled the development of 1,300 SCWQ plans for 101,000 acres with an         associated 6,200 BMPs installed.    An         additional 800 existing SCWQ plans were updated on 87,000 acres.            Statewide, 59% of agricultural land is managed under a current         SCWQ plan.    Plans are         considered current for a maximum of ten years.            In addition to planning acreage for new cooperators, local Soil         Conservation Districts (SCDs) keep a rolling tally of acreage planned in         the past and have an ongoing system of regular updates.                                                                     Grassed Waterway                                               The         Coastal Zone Management Division, through the Nonpoint Source and         Coastal Zone Programs, has funded soil conservation and water quality         planning activities in many different areas across the state (including         Antietam Creek, Deer Creek, Marshyhope Creek, St. Clements Bay, St.         Martins, Lower Choptank, Chester River).            One watershed, Antietam Creek, provides a snapshot of the         tremendous amount of progress made in reducing nonpoint source pollution         through the combined efforts of NPS program partners.                               5.1.6.)         Case Study:    Agricultural         Project - Antietam Creek Targeted Watershed Project                                                             The Antietam Creek Targeted Watershed Project is a         prime example of the effectiveness of conservation partnerships working         to solve common water resource problems within a major tributary of the         Potomac River.    The         Washington County Soil Conservation District and its many partners         report outstanding progress in improving water quality in Antietam         Creek’s watershed in Washington County, Maryland.                                           Antietam Creek’s watershed placed eight in the         State for nutrient loading to the Chesapeake Bay.            Runoff from numerous agricultural operations within the watershed         carries nutrients, sediment, pesticides and organic wastes to Antietam         Creek and its tributaries.    Local         stream and water quality concerns include excessive streambank erosion,         siltation, nutrient enrichment, algal growth, pathogen contamination,         elevated stream temperatures, loss of fish habitat and fishery, and loss         of riparian habitat.                                                                                                                                  Dairy barn wash water runoff prior to         installation of BMP.                                               In addition to nutrient loading to the Bay and         local water quality issues, this watershed was also targeted due to         concerns about protecting several local Washington County-designated         “Special Planning Areas” such as the Powell Trout Hatchery, the         South Mountain Natural Environmental Area, the Greenbriar State Park,         Appalachian Trail Corridor, and Antietam National Battlefield.            The Edgemont and Smithburg Reservoirs, standby water systems for         the city of Hagerstown, also lie within the watershed.                                         Funding         from Section 319 was used by MDA and the Washington County SCD to employ         a Soil Conservation Planner to complete a watershed assessment and to         begin educational efforts in the targeted subwatersheds. A Conservation         Technician was hired to help install BMPs identified by the planner in         Soil and Water Conservation Plans and a nutrient management advisor was         added to Cooperative Extension Staff to work with animal producers on         nutrient management planning.                                                   Over the last ten years, the Washington County SCD         has successfully accelerated efforts towards implementing conservation         practices and increasing conservation education efforts in the county.            Examples of BMPs include waste storage structures, stream fencing         and alternative livestock water facilities (to keep cattle out of         waterways) and planting of riparian buffers.            Since 1992, over 3,600 best management practices have been         installed.                                                                       Fenced Stream                                               Livestock Watering Trough                                 Recently, the Washington County SCD has focused its         efforts on the Little Antietam, Marsh Run, Beaver Creek, Little Antietam         South and Sharman Branch subwatersheds.            Soil conservation and water quality plans have been completed for         31,081 acres representing 78% of the agricultural acreage within these         subwatersheds.     The         SCD also has a nutrient management specialist helping local farmers         develop and update nutrient management plans.            Local landowners have also participated in the Western Maryland         Cover Crop program.    In         addition to traditional agricultural projects, the District completed         the Beaver Creek Stream Restoration Project, which restored a severely         degraded section of the creek downstream from the Albert Powell State         Fish Hatchery.                                           As a result of local efforts, supported by state         and federal partners and resources, there has been improvement in water         quality within Antietam Creek.             Eroding stream banks along restored sections of Beaver Creek have         been stabilized and the channel has been restored to more natural         conditions.    Water quality         monitoring conducted by Maryland Department of Environment has shown a         significant decline in nutrients and sediment. Riparian habitat and the         trout fishery have improved dramatically.                                                                      Beaver Creek Stream Restoration Project                                 Cooperating Agencies and Roles                                                             Washington County Soil Conservation District         (WCSCD)                                         Project sponsor and proponent.

Public Drainage Program                                                              The         Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) regulates agricultural public         drainage facilities administered as Public Drainage Associations (PDAs).            PDAs are independent political subdivisions and cover over 850         miles of drainage ditches in the coastal zone, mostly on the Eastern         Shore. The PDAs are required to develop operation and maintenance plans         which address sediment control and water quality protection.            MDA assists PDAs to conduct biannual inspections and provides         technical assistance to the PDAs through the SCDs.            Typical best management practices include vegetative filter         strips and channel stabilization.                                           In         June of 1999, the Public Drainage Task Force was formed and charged by         Maryland’s Chesapeake Bay Cabinet to develop recommendations that         would enhance the Eastern Shore environment and agriculture by         addressing issues related to the management of public drainage systems.            In October of 2000, the Task Force completed its report, which         was endorsed by the Governor’s Chesapeake Bay Workgroup, and forwarded         to the Chesapeake Bay Cabinet for approval.            Public drainage task force recommendations included recognition         that best management practices (BMPs) should incorporate the best         achievable methods to reduce nutrient export and increase habitat         quality.                                           In         2001, the Nonpoint Source (NPS) Program funded the development of a         special video and informational outreach materials to promote the use of         weed wiper technology and alternative management measures such as water         control structures, pocket wetlands and other practices to retain         vegetative buffers and slow the flow of water.            The NPS Program has also funded the implementation of these         alternative management measures including pocket wetland projects in the         Hubbard Cohee, Weer Levengood, Edinberg and Whitemarsh PDAs.                                                                                                                                         Return To Table Of Contents>>           Last Updated: 06/15/02

Subsection 319(h)(11) of the Clean  Water Act of 1987 requires each state to report annually on the progress made toward achieving Nonpoint Source (NPS) Management program goals.  This report  summarizes statewide efforts to control and prevent nonpoint source pollution during 2000.  The report contains a description of nonpoint source pollution prevention  and control efforts by pollutant category (agriculture, forestry, developed lands, etc.); a description of  DNR's Watershed Restoration Action Strategy initiative and a  summary of progress made toward achieving Chesapeake Bay Program nutrient reduction goals.         Clean Water Act & Nonpoint Source Pollution            In 1972, Congress enacted the Federal Water Pollution Control Act in response to growing public concern for serious and widespread water pollution.   The 1972 law built upon previous federal water pollution statutes.  In 1977 the act was amended and renamed the Clean Water Act.  Congress amended the  Clean Water Act in 1987 to establish the section 319 Nonpoint Source Management Program.   The Clean Water Act was reauthorized in 1991.  The Clean Water  Act is the primary federal law that protects our nation's waters, including lakes, rivers, aquifers and coastal areas.       The Clean Water Act's primary objective is to restore and maintain the integrity of the nation's waters. This objective translates into two fundamental national goals:         eliminate the discharge of pollutants into the nation's waters, and      achieve water quality levels that are fishable and swimmable.       The Clean Water Act provides a comprehensive framework of standards, technical tools and financial assistance to address the many causes of pollution  and poor water quality, including municipal and industrial wastewater discharges, polluted runoff from urban and rural areas, and habitat destruction.      Water pollution comes from two sources, point source pollution and nonpoint source pollution.  Point source pollution refers to pollution from a specific  point of discharge (e.g. from an industrial or municipal wastewater plant).  Nonpoint source pollution is runoff caused by stormwater (rainfall or snowmelt)  or irrigation water moving over and through the ground. Nonpoint source pollution is the major reason why water quality remains impaired in the State of Maryland.        Maryland's Nonpoint Source Program            Maryland's Nonpoint Source Program evolved out of the Clean Water Act of 1987.  This act contained a new section, Section 319, which established a nationwide  requirement that each state evaluate the nature and extent of its water quality problems caused by nonpoint source pollution and then prepare a management  program for addressing its priority nonpoint source pollution problems.       The Coastal Zone Management Division in the Chesapeake and Coastal Watershed Service of the Department of Natural Resources oversees the implementation of the  Section 319 Nonpoint Source Management Program.   The program is multi-disciplinary providing not only financial assistance, but nonpoint source related policy, technical  and educational assistance. Keys to the Program's success rely on creating open partnerships with other nonpoint source entities and  developing long and short term goals  that will advance the Program in the nonpoint source pollution control arena.  Maryland provides reimbursable grants to state and local governments, non-profit  organizations, and institutions of higher learning  to implement nonpoint source pollution control projects and programs in accordance with Section 319(h) of the CWA.   Some key programmatic goals for the NPS Program staff are to continue to submit an annual project report to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to maintain a  user friendly webpage, to ensure that Section 319(h) grant projects result in measurable environmental results (MERs), and to better educate the public about the causes  and remedies of nonpoint source pollution.   Detailed 319(h) project information, including project load reduction estimates are reported bi-annually in EPA's Grant  Reporting & Tracking System.         Regional and State Nonpoint Source Funding            Nationally as of FFY2000, Congress has appropriate over $1 billion to fight nonpoint source pollution.  Since 1988, EPA has provided over $90 million to region  III states (Maryland, Virginia, District of Columbia, Pennsylvania, Delaware and West Virginia) to implement their NPS programs.  Each state is allocated nonpoint  source funds based on a funding allocation system designed by the federal government.  This allocation system, described in EPA grant guidance (see Nonpoint  Source Program & Grant Guidance For Fiscal Year 1997 and Future Years) is based on a variety of factors, including a state's population, total cropland, pastureland  and rangeland acreage, mining activities and critical aquatic habitat.       In October 1997, during the 25th anniversary of the Clean Water Act, Vice President Gore called for a renewed effort to restore and protect water quality.    The Vice President asked that the Secretary of Agriculture and the Administrator of the EPA work with other affected agencies and develop a Clean Water Action  Plan that builds on clean water successes and addresses three major goals:        enhanced protection from public health threats posed by water pollution;       more effective control of polluted runoff; and       promotion of water quality protection on a watershed basis.          With development of the Clean Water Action Plan, there came additional (incremental) grant funds for selected states.  On October 21, 1998, the President signed the  1999 appropriations bill for EPA to allocate $200 million for states to implement their nonpoint source management programs under Section 319 of the Clean Water Act.    This appropriation provided a major increase of funds for states to make significant progress in resolving their remaining water quality problems.   During FFY 1998 Maryland  received approximately $1.3 million for nonpoint source projects.   As a result of the Clean Water Action Plan, Maryland's 1999 appropriation rose to approximately $2.7 million.  The table below shows the rise in federal funds received by the State for its Section 319 nonpoint source pollution program.
