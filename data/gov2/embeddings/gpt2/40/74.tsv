GX242-36-5744744	"DRAFT GFS-BASED MOS WIND GUIDANCE FOR MARINE LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES by Christopher M. McAloon 1. INTRODUCTION The Meteorological Development Laboratory (MDL) of the National Weather Service (NWS) has developed regression equations to predict the wind direction and wind speed at marine locations. The equations were derived by applying the Model Output Statistics (MOS) technique (Glahn and Lowry 1972) to output from the Global Forecast System (GFS) numerical weather prediction model (formerly know as the Aviation (AVN) model) (Kanamitsu 1989, Kanamitsu et al. 1991, Iredell and Caplan 1997, Caplan and Pan 2000). The new equations will be applied at approximately 121 National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoys and Coastal Marine Automated Network (C-MAN) stations (Figure 5). The MOS wind guidance will be available for projections every 3-h from 6 to 84 hours after the initial model times of 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). Forecasts at these stations will replace forecasts based on another statistical technique know as the modified perfect-prog approach, which used output from the Nested Grid Model (NGM) (Burroughs 1991). The NGM-based guidance was only available for 62 stations, and for 6-h projections from 6 to 48 hours from the initial model times of 0000 and 1200 UTC. 2. METHOD The MOS approach uses multiple linear regression to establish relationships between predictand data (station weather observations) and predictor data (output from numerical models, station observations, and climatic data). Predictors which correlate the highest with any of the three predictands (u- and v- wind components or the wind speed), when combined with the other predictors already selected, are chosen as terms in the regression equation. Predictors are chosen until none contributes more than 0.5% to the total reduction of variance or until nine predictors are chosen. Regression equations for the u- and v- wind components and wind speed are developed simultaneously. As a consequence, the same predictors are used in the equation for all three predictands with only the coefficients being different. The wind direction is predicted by using the u- and v- wind components. Wind speed is used as a separate predictand due to an under-forecast of the speed by the individual components. 3. DEVELOPMENT a. Seasons The developmental data set obtained for the majority of stations was from January 1997 through October 2002. Some stations became active during the middle of this period and a complete data set was not available. Equations were developed for both parts of a stratified sample composed of a cool season (October-March) and a warm season (AprilSeptember). Five seasons of data (approximately 900 days) were used to develop cool season equations and six seasons of data (approximately 1100 days) were used for the warm season equations. An additional 15 days on each end of a season were added, thereby smoothing the transition between seasons. b. Predictands Wind speed and direction are reported each hour at NDBC's buoys and C-MAN stations. The u- and v- wind components are computed from the wind speed and direction observations. NDBC archives reports of hourly data from all stations within their system. The historical sample of data used for the development of forecast equations was obtained from the NDBC website (http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov). The observations of the wind speed and u- and v-   wind components were used for the hours of 0000, 0300, 0600, 0900, 1200, 1500, 1800 and 2100 UTC. These observations were then used to form predictands valid at projections from 6 to 84 hours from the initial model times. c. Predictors Predictors available for the development of forecast equations originate from three possible sources: GFS model variables interpolated to the station, surface observations, and climatic variables. The GFS forecast of u- and v- wind and wind speed from 10 m as well as 1000-, 925-, 850-, 700-, and 500-mb levels were used as predictors. Other model variables included were the relative vorticity, vertical velocity, and relative mass divergence from the levels of 925-, 850-, 700-, and 500-mb. The model forecast of atmospheric stability through the layers 1000-925 mb, 1000-850 mb, and 1000-700 mb were also potential predictors. Mean relative humidity was available through the layers 100-850 mb, 850-700 mb, and through the sigma layer from 1-.44 sigma. The final model variable used was the K-index. Model predictors were valid at the concurrent time as the predictand with the exception of the 81 and 84 hour forecast projections. Due to a lack of sufficient model data at 81 and 84 hours the predictors from the 78 hour projection were used as 81 and 84 hour predictors. The predictors from the GFS model were space smoothed by using 25 grid points to reduce the noise of the model forecasts at small scales. In addition to the model forecast variables included as predictors, climate variables and observations were also available. The climate predictors were based on the sinusoidal nature of the calendar year at a particular station, i.e. the first and second harmonics of the day of the year. The observations were the u- and v- wind components and the wind speed. The observations were only used as predictors for the 6-, 9-, 12-, and 15-hr forecast equations. The observations used were valid 3 hours after the initial model times of 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC. At the early projections (6 to 15 hours), the most common predictors included in the forecast equations are the 3-hr observations and the model forecasts of the u- and v- wind components and wind speed at 10 m. In later projections the model forecasts of u- and v- wind components and wind speed at 10 m are most common. The 925-mb relative vorticity is also frequently included in the forecast equations at later projections as well as the first and second harmonics of the day of the year. d. Equation Development Each of the approximately 121 buoy and C-MAN stations have their own individual forecast equation valid for the particular season and forecast projection in question. The only current exception to this is for the buoys in Lake Superior and Lake Huron during the cool season. The three Lake Superior buoys each use an equation based on a combined development sample of predictand data from all the buoy and C-MAN stations in Lake Superior. The two buoys in Lake Huron use an equation based on a development sample of predictand data for both stations combined. This procedure was performed because of the limited sample of predictand data available in this region due to the removal of the buoys in the cool season. Because C-MAN stations are land sites, their sample is not affected and they still use single station equations. During the warm season each station has its own forecast equation. Recall that each of the three predictand equations are developed simultaneously. The predictor with the overall highest correlation with any of the predictands is chosen as the first predictor and incorporated into an equation for all of the predictands. The predictor with the next highest correlation with a predictand in combination with the previously chosen predictor is then added to the equation. This process continues until nine predictors are chosen or until none of the remaining predictors can reduce the variance of any one predictand by more than 0.5%. As a consequence of the simultaneous development only the predictand coefficients are different for the three predictands. For the 6-, 9-, 12-, and 15-h projections, a second set of equations is developed. These equations do not have observations included as predictors. Those which have observations are known as ""primary"" equations and those that do not are known as ""secondary"" equations. The secondary equations are used when observations are not available as predictors during real-time forecast guidance preparation.   e. Post Processing A number of post processing measures are performed on the forecasts of u- and v- wind components and wind speed before they are disseminated. The first step inflates the wind speed forecasts (Carter and Schwartz 1985). This process increases the frequency of strong and weak wind forecasts, thereby increasing the standard deviation of the wind speed forecast distribution. In doing so, the mean absolute error of the wind speed forecasts is also increased. Next, the wind direction is computed from the u- and v- wind components of the wind speed. The wind speed is also checked to be sure it is non-negative due to the inflation routine which could conceivably ""create"" negative wind speeds by decreasing the value of some low wind speeds. Finally, when the wind speed is less than 0.5 knots, the wind direction is set as ""calm"". A new routine developed specifically for the marine wind guidance adjusts the forecast wind speeds to be consistent with a wind speed measured at 10 m. The 10 m height is not only a WMO standard, but also the observing height for all National Weather Service Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) stations. However, many of the NDBC buoys measure wind speed at a height of 5 m, while C-MAN stations measure wind speeds at varying heights. The adjustment performed on the wind speed forecast is based upon the power law wind profile (Hsu et al. 1994)   z2  u2 = u1    z1   011 .  (1)  where u1 and u2 are the forecast wind speed before and after the correction, respectively, z1 and z2 are the original observation height and the adjustment height (10 m), respectively, and the power of 0.11 is a constant derived empirically from near-neutral conditions over water. 4. VERIFICATION Prior to the development of operational equations, test equations were developed for the 0000 UTC cycle of the and cool seasons. The test equations were developed by using cool seasons from October 1997 through March The test equations for the warm season were developed by using data from April 1997 through September Forecasts were made from these equations by using independent data from the 2001-2002 and 2002 cool and seasons, respectively. These forecasts were compared to the direct model output from the GFS model as well NGM-based statistical guidance described in the Introduction. warm 2001. 2001. warm as the  The scores used in the verification of wind speed were the mean absolute error (MAE), probability of detection (POD) of a wind speed greater than 22.5 kts, the threat score of a wind speed greater than 22.5 kts, and the Heidke skill score. The scores used in the verification analysis of wind direction were the MAE and the cumulative relative frequency of errors less than 30 when the observed wind speed is at least 10 kts. Figures 1-4 summarize four of these scores in graphical form. The verification figures shown compare the new GFS guidance to the NGM guidance, therefor projections are only shown out to 48 hours and only 62 sites were included in this overall verification. The results of verification indicate that the new GFS-based marine MOS based guidance and the GFS direct model output during the sample period development in the marine environment, including, air temperature and numerical weather prediction models may be used to develop marine MOS data will also be considered to create a larger overall MOS network. 5. OPERATIONS AND DISSEMINATION The operational guidance for the 6 through 84 hour projections from the 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC forecast cycles will be issued in a set of alphanumeric messages. These messages will be disseminated through the Telecommunications Gateway to the Satellite Broadcast Network, Family of Services, Tropical Predictions Center, guidance indicated. dewpoint guidance. performs better than the NGMMDL will also undertake future temperature. In addition, other Additional observation network   Ocean Prediction Center, National Data Buoy Center, National Ocean Service, and the National Center for Environmental Prediction Centers. These messages will be distributed with the World Meteorological Organization headers given in Figure 5. The alphanumeric message will be described in the following section. The forecast guidance will also be issued in a binary format, for use, most notably, by the NWS forecasters. This guidance will be in supplement to the current MOS wind guidance based on the AVN model (Sfanos 2000). In addition, 91 of the 121 sites will have probability of thunderstorm and conditional probability of severe thunderstorms given within this binary message. Thunderstorm forecasts will not be in the alphanumeric messages. Given the adjustment of the wind speed forecasts based upon the anemometer height, users of these forecasts are advised that the adjustment is derived from idealized conditions and applied universally to all buoys. This adjustment may not be appropriate for all conditions and users should make themselves aware of situations when this may be the case. In addition, the variability among anemometer heights will likely dictate the situation when this adjustment may or may not be appropriate. Users should also note that forecasts for buoys in Lake Superior and Lake Huron are based on equations developed for a region. However the adjustment made at each of these buoys is based upon the anemometer height of that individual buoy. The MOS wind speed and direction forecasts are based on the GFS model output. When using a statistical technique such as MOS, forecast accuracy is only as good as the information input by the forecast model. If a user of these forecasts feels that the model may be in error, they should adjust the forecasts accordingly. The MOS technique is known to account for some model biases, however it cannot account for a bad model forecast. When observations are not available in real time secondary equations are used in making forecasts at projections 6-, 9-, 12-, and 15-h, as described in Section 3d.. The skill of these secondary forecasts may be less than those if primary equations were used. 6. THE ALPHANUMERIC MESSAGE The alphanumeric message containing the GFS MOS wind speed and direction guidance at marine locations will be the first to present the forecast for projections every 3 hours from 6 to 84 hours. Historically, the message has been limited to a 69 character width. Consequently, the message containing the marine wind speed and direction forecasts is a modification of the current AVN MOS message that will show all 27 forecast projections. The message will contain the forecasts of wind speed and direction at the site, as well as a wind speed adjusted to be consistent with 10 m. The most significant difference between the format of the current AVN message and this message, is that the additional forecast projections (69- to 84-h)are in a second block of text placed below what would be the block of text representing the current AVN message. 44013 GFS DT /APR 30 HR 12 15 WD 36 03 WS 11 08 WS10 12 08 DT HR WD WS WS10 /MAY 03 01 15 16 06 01 15 16 3 MOS GUIDANCE /MAY 18 21 00 03 07 10 13 14 07 11 10 08 07 11 11 08 09 01 17 18 12 01 18 19 15 02 19 20 18 03 15 16 1 06 13 08 08 4/30/2003 09 12 09 10 12 12 10 11 15 14 13 14 18 16 13 14 0600 UTC /MAY 21 00 03 17 19 20 13 12 11 14 13 12 2 06 20 12 13 / 00 02 10 11  09 20 13 14  12 20 11 12  15 24 09 10  18 02 11 12  21 05 07 08  In this example, the message is valid for the buoy east of Boston, MA (44013). All stations are identified by the NDBC assigned call letters. The ""GFS MOS GUIDANCE"" appearing on the same line as the station call letters identifies the message contents. The date of the forecast cycle during which the message is issued follows this   information. The form of mm/dd/yyyy where mm is the month (1 through 12), dd is the day (1 through 31), and yyyy is the four-digit year is used. The forecast cycle is identified by the standard 0000, 0600, 1200 or 1800 UTC. In this example, the MOS guidance for 44013 was issued from the 0600 UTC forecast cycle of the GFS on April30, 2003. The DT and HR lines denote the date and hour at which the forecasts are valid. The DT line indicates the day of the month. Note that the month is denoted by the standard three or four letter abbreviation. For wind direction and speed, the date and hour denote the specific time that the forecasts are valid. These forecasts are valid every 3 hours until 84 hours after initial time. Note that the DT and HR lines for the forecasts valid 69 hours after the initial time and later are in the second block of text. The station wind direction (WD) and speed (WS) forecasts are for winds at the height of the anemometer. The wind direction is given in tens of degrees and varies from 01 (10 degrees) to 36 (360 degrees). The normal meteorological convention for specifying wind direction is followed. The wind speed is given in knots; the maximum speed allowed in the message is 98 knots. For both direction and speed, missing forecasts are denoted by 99. A calm wind is indicated by a wind direction and speed of 00. The adjusted wind speed (WS10) is a forecast of wind speed at a height of 10 m above the surface. It is derived from the wind speed forecast given by WS. The adjustment is described in Section 3e. 7. REFERENCES Burroughs, L. D., 1991: Coastal and offshore wind guidance.

This model is being run within the NWSFO Buffalo forecast office as       a result of an ongoing collaboration with SUNY Oswego and support from NWS        Eastern Region Scientific Services Division.         The model runs on a Linux workstation using a        1.7GHZ Athlon (single processor) PC with 1GB of memory.          Our implementation uses a 54 km outer grid and a        18 km inner grid.          Generating hourly output through 36 hours takes about        60 minutes.  Currently we provide a 00z and 12z run with data        available about 5 hours after model time.

GX000-08-16063178	"Polar: System status, information, and FAQs          Polar and the fields on it is meant to be available at all times, to  all people.  It is not, however, 'operational' as this term is used  in our organization.  Please see the     NWS Web distribution disclaimer  for more about what this entails.   One feature of importance to  most users is that the system does not have 24x7 support.          For operational availability of the information which is noted as operational  on  http://polar.wwb.noaa.gov/mmab/products.html   , again, please see    NWS Web distribution disclaimer   for operational distribution channels.     If your question is not addressed below or needed information is not present,  please do write the web master at    NCEP.EMC.MarineWeb@noaa.gov   !         FAQS         Notes for best response         Product availability time table                     FAQs       Q: I hear that polar won't be around much longer.  What is its future   and its replacement?     A: A machine named polar is expected to be around for some time to come.    What hardware stands behind that name can be expected to change, as   has already happened 3 times in the history of the name.       Q: If polar is having problems, is there somewhere else I can go for the   information?     A: As we speak (29 January 2003) the answer is, in general, no.  If   the product is available operationally, then the sources mentioned in        NWS Web distribution disclaimer      can be used.  Many popular products are not on that list at this  time.       Q: If that situation changes, how can I find out?     A: We maintain a mailing list through which we make announcements of changes   to our products, product availability, and distribution methods.       Signing up for the mailing list      is your surest method.  We will also update this notice and make  note  on the branch main page.       Q: Followup question -- how can I find out about planned outages, say to  upgrade the hardware?     A: Same as above.  We perform our upgrades in such a way that it almost  never requires the system to be unavailable to users.  When such an event is planned, we will announce it.       Q: I couldn't get anything from the evening of January 3 to the morning  of January 6.   What happened?     A: This was our worst case scenario.  Polar had a hardware failure  on Friday evening.   This is a rare event, with the last occurrence being a year earlier.  One wonders if polar is partying too much at the new year.         Q: I also couldn't get much on January 25th.  What then?     A: You were apparently affected by collateral damage to the Internet from   the       ""Sapphire"" or ""SQL Slammer,"" worm.       Q: Why is polar now refusing ftp connections to me?     A: This is never a decision of not releasing the data.  It can be,  however, that your system or a firewall your system uses is refusing to identify  itself.  If identity cannot be confirmed, ftp sessions to polar are not permitted.         Q: My access to ftp://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/ has been slow lately, why and   is there anything I can do about it?     A1: Some people find better success with using the address polar.wwb.noaa.gov   instead.  This is surprising, as the same system is being referenced,   but it's worth a try.  (As is the converse if you've been having problems   on polar.wwb.noaa.gov)     A2: Some changes in response time are unavoidable contention from Internet   use to our building, or of polar itself.  Both are upgraded periodically.   A3: See also the  notes on best ftp usage    below.         Notes for    best response       Open only 1 connection at a time.  Some ftp software, command line ftp from Windows 98 and XP is known to have this problem, produces failures  if you attempt to open multiple connections.  Even if this isn't the  case, there is finite bandwidth to polar, and by opening multiple connections  you slow the transfer rate to yourself.     Retrieve data only after it can be expected to be updated -- see the      table below      for times in UTC (equivalent to GMT.  Eastern Standard Time is 5  hours  earlier, Eastern Daylight Time is 4 hours earlier.  So 00 UTC  is 7 PM  EST and 8 PM EDT.) This will prevent a need for multiple transfers.   Please  note that the availability times are approximate and delays  of minutes to  half an hour are not uncommon.  Delays over an hour are  rare.     Retrieve the smallest data files that serve your needs.  If, for   example, you are only interested in significant wave heights for the Western   North Atlantic ocean, it is most efficient to retrieve wna.HTSGW.grb, at  2.1 Mbytes, rather than all fields for that domain, 29.4 Mb.  Only you  can judge what best fills your needs.           Product Availability Time Table       Times in the table are approximate times of availability in UTC.  Eastern   Standard Time is 5 hours earlier; Eastern Daylight Time is 4 hours earlier.    So 00 UTC is 7 PM EST and 8 PM EDT.

GX000-11-8722604	"NCEP MMAB Coastal Visual Range Guidance    revised revised  4 September 2003; reviewed  4 September 2003     PLEASE NOTE : THE ETA MODEL UPON WHICH THESE VISIBILITY PRODUCTSARE BASED WAS CHANGED ON JULY 8, 2003.  THE CLOUD PHYSICS PACKAGES WERE IMPROVEDWHICH RESULTED IN MORE REALISTIC MODELING OF VISUAL RANGE.  THESE CHANGES HAVE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT PATTERN CHANGES AND REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF DECREASED VISIBILITIES OVER LAND AND SEA.  More information can be found at the  mmb  website.  Comments are encouraged.   IN ADDITION ON 4 SEPTEMBER, THIS PAGE WAS REMODELED TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL REGIONAL ANALYSES AND ANIMATIONS AND TABULAR FORMATS.  ALSO, THE PAGE IS UPDATED 4 TIMES A DAY WITH THE DATA FROM EACH CYCLE AVAILABLE. THE 950 hPa GUIDANCE PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN REMOVED.     The lowest layer Coastal Visual Range Guidance products are provided as post-processed fields direct from the eta (12 km resolution currently) model. The data used for the lower 48 states are taken from a 40km Lambert Conformal  grid and applied to a 0.25 deg X 0.25 deg lon/lat grid over N. America.  The data used for Alaska are taken from a 45km polar stereographic grid and applied to a 0.25 deg X 0.25 deg lon/lat grid over Alaska and adjacent water bodies.  These fields are in m and have been converted to n mi on the depictions shown on this web page.     These products are valid all year for the coasts of the contiguous United States, Alaska and Gulf of Alaska.  Three shades of color are given: 7 n mi to gt 3 n mi in blue,  3 n mi to gt 0.5 n mi in green, and le 0.5 n mi in yellow, where 7 n mi is the furthest distance to the horizon that can be seen from the bridge of most ships, le 3 n mi is where National Weather Service Forecasters are required to add obstructions to visibility to their forecasts, and le 0.5 n mi is the WMO definition of dense fog.    The animations and still figures are in gif format; the animations are on the order of 350k, while the stills   are on the order of 15k each.  Model output is available throughout the year.     To ftp binary data, ftp to polar.wwb.noaa.gov and cd to /pub/coastal.fog. do a binary get to download the Alaska or lower 48 GRIB vsby data.  These files contains 29 records: one for each projection from 03 to 84 hours at 3-h intervals on a 45 km polar stereographic grid or a 40 km Lambert Conformal grid, respectively.  gif files are also available.  There is a link below that will take you to the ftp site.    Please send questions and comments to Lawrence D.

GX000-12-12758434	"NCEP MMAB Statistical Fog and Visibility Model Output   rev 28 May 2003; reviewed 28 May 2003     The northern hemispheric fog and visibility forecast system was  developed by using the ""perfect prog"" technique.  It is valid for the North Atlantic (N ATL) and Pacific (N PAC) basins from April through September.  Fog is designated when the visibility is one km (0.5 n mi) or less (yellow on the figures).  Visibilities of 5.6 km (3.0 n mi) or less are also of interest to mariners and are shown in green on the figures.  The figures are in gif format and are on the order of 10k each.  Outside the fog season from 1 April to 30 September, model output is not available.     To ftp binary data, ftp to polar.wwb.noaa.gov and cd to /home/ftp/pub/fog. do a binary get to download the GRIB fog/vsby data for the northern hemisphere.  This file contains seven (7) records: one for each projection from 00 to 72 hours at 12-h intervals on a 1 deg x 1 deg grid.  gif files are also available.

GX000-13-5114909	WFO-Advanced Workstation - D3D Development (FY98-99)      Principal Researchers: Paula McCaslin / Phil McDonald / Ed Szoke     CIRA staff have supported the development of Display-3D (D3D) that was  the focus of an operational exercise by forecast meteorologists during July and August 1998 (RT98). The objectives of the exercise were to evaluate the system in a quasi-operational setting, including determining advantages  and defining areas in need of improvement with respect to: the design and  usability of the application, how to educate and train users to utilize the  application, and the display of data sets that could add value in operational  forecasting.     Information gained from RT98 have been used to improve and enhance the graphical user interface, develop more quantitative meteorological product displays and  highlight areas to emphasize when training users. A second exercise is planned  for 1999 (RT99) to address the use of 3D visualization in operational forecasting and refine the direction of future 3D development.    Vis5D, the core graphics software of D3D, is being developed in collaboration with the University of Wisconsin. General purpose enhancements developed at FSL  by CIRA staff are integrated into the standard releases of Vis5D. This process  eliminates maintenance of separate versions: ours and theirs. A development  effort to allow D3D to be independent of AWIPS hardware and software is beginning. This allows for portability among platforms, including a port of the application  to LINUX.    Several D3D presentations, documents and articles were generated this year. The  D3D User's Guide was completed (www.fsl.noaa.gov/~osborn/d3d/D3DUG_TC.html), educational talks and papers were presented at the 1999 AMS in Dallas, TX, and  'Evolution of 3-D Visualization Development at FSL' was published in the February  1999 FSL Forum.     Figure 1. WFO-Advanced Display-3D and the D3D Volume Browser   (b/w  ,   color).   The image shows a  0-h Eta model forecast valid 1200 UTC 2 October 1998, as viewed from the south.  Displayed is a 100-kt wind speed isosurface (dark gray), a vertical cross section  of wind barbs centered through Denver, a 290-K potential temperature isosurface  (white), a 12.0 g/kg specific humidity isosurface (foreground), and a contoured  and colored vertical cross section displaying heights.

GX000-17-8723073	Last update :   August 29, 2003     Point of contact :  NCEP.EMC.waves@NOAA.gov         Welcome to the home pages for the operational wave models of NOAA/NCEP. As of August 13, 2003, this page includes the new  NPH (North Pacific Hurricane) model , which has been moved over from the  experimental wave pages . There are several ways to access the model results and related information :     The  interactive data interface (JavaScript required)  ( troubleshooting ) gives access maps, spectral plots and spectral text bulletins with a point-and-click interface (several model runs available).  The  tabular data interface  gives access to the same data, but is organized with links in several large tables (most recent model run only).  The  text data interface  gives access to this data in lists, without using any graphical web elements (most recent model run only).  The most recent ERS2 altimeter  wind  and  wave  data.  The  products  page gives a short description of all data accessible through the above interfaces, and instructions on getting additional binary data from our FTP site. The  primer  gives a short description of how to interpret data presented here.  A historical archive of wave hindcast results produced with the latest version of the wave models can be accessed through an  interactive (JavaScript required)  or  tabular  interface.     The operational ocean wave predictions of NOAA/NWS/NCEP are performed using the wave model  WAVEWATCH III  ( source code available ) using operational products of NCEP as input. This combination of inputs and wave model is called NOAA WAVEWATCH III or NWW3. The wave model suite consists of global and regional  implementations . As background information, a list of selected  references  and a chronological list of  model changes  are available. Finally, extensive validation data are available for the  global ,  Alaskan Waters  and  Western North Atlantic  models.

GX000-17-10279348	"FSL Modeling Visualization: A Collection of Case Studies     FSL Modeling and Visualization: A Collection of Case Studies   Forecast Research Division       Overview    On this page is a collection of fairly detailed case studies presented to  document how the local model, the SFM in this case, performs in the area of  northeastern Colorado for a variety of weather phenomenon.      Index of cases    I. Winter snow events.    A. Mountain and/or orographically forced events.                 10-11 February 2000: Mountain snows (also plains and DCVZ event).                 Description: Main upper level low morning of 10th still over Calif due w of us but minor sht wv  ahead of this feature moving across CO with relatively unstable lapse rates in zonal  flow producing areas and some banding of snow in mtns.  So not a straightforward or  simple orographic only case.   Quick look at the verification/comparison:  SFM 15z/10 Feb run had more snow in zone 34 than in zone 33 (where there was very little predicted), whereas snow model had slightly more in 33 vs. 34.  More did tend to fall in 33, and even MORE fell just  to the east with Virginia Dale the big winner with 13.5"" (this band extended e across the plains, with zones 49/50 getting 6-8"" of snow (some of this coming after 12z however).  SFM did pick up on an e-w band onto the plains near the CO/WY border,  tho also had one e from COS and this srn one did NOT occur.  A separate snow max does exist near Virginia Dale in the SFM; R/T model (Rhea/Thaler orographic snow model) had nothing to up to an inch for Virginia Dale/Zone 35.     So, mixed results, would say that it appears the 15z SFM did not do quite as well with the mountain snows, since it erroneously favored the more srn over the more nrn mtns.

Part of a continuing event.  Concentrating here on the evening/overnight snow potential mainly.  Turned out to be a surprisingly heavy event that began really after midnight (though snow did fall much of the day in some mtn areas...tough to say how much...Loveland ski area video looked to be at least S-, maybe toward S at times during the day, but think some of the day stuff diminished before dark, then second batch developed) with passage of a sht wave trof (this was actually the  remnants of a significant wave that had been off the coast on Sunday).  Some  lightning near SLC the near WY/CO border overnight.  At ski report time many  areas were snowing hard, particularly more nrn mtns.   This was a pretty sig miss  for the forecasters as well as the eta 10km model (note how the 00z run had very little predicted for the mountains).  NO SFM for this case, just eta at 10 km.          More info:    obs, forecasts, discussions, etc.             Figure 1:   FSL's 10 km eta (initialized with LAPS), 1200 UTC 14 Feb run, 12h wind and total precipitation forecast for 0000 UTC 15 Feb.

Description: Overprediction of snow for the overnight period as an upper level trof advancing  on the area.  We had consistently predicted snow to begin too early with this one, but question is what did the snow model produce?  Eta had snow begining and accumulating overnight but notice 21z sfm did not.  NOTE: SFM not available for 21z run after 10z (13h fcst).  Also, 21z run was the first SFM run in a couple of days.  Note  that SFM did not predict much of anything, which was correct for this case.  Snow did fall in far wrn CO mtns.

Appears the greatest amount of snow fell farther north, or extreme swrn CO.  Coop site with the greatest snow was at Gould,  near the location of where the SFM had a rather extreme local max.  Note that station Gould  CSFC2: GOULD 4SE                9200  0809:  40 /  4 / 1.03 / 8.2 / 40 reported about 1"" of melted, and they are located near the SFM precipitation max. (Gould is on the west side of Cameron Pass).  Granted the SFM 09z/7 Mar run did have a whopping 3.8"" of melted in this area but it is interesting that this DOES appear  to be a favored area for this storm.

Description: This potential snow followed the end of a period of mountain orographic snows with some SFM  output saved, but no gif files.  This case was saved because of the very focused heavy foothill snows forecasted for the foothills of western Boulder and northern Jefferson Counties up to and east of the Divide.  Very  persistent forecast of well over a foot of snow in this area, with snow forecast area spreading east to  about I-25 (BOU forecast to get as much as 9"" of snow).  There was also an area of snow forecast on the west side of the mountains in NWly flow but to a much lesser extent.     Why the focused snowfall?  Surface pattern on the plains was a Longmont Anticyclone in the SFM forecast, so low-level winds were converging into the foothills from the east, whereas there was NWly flow from the west that would serve to enhance the convergence even further.  Couple this with a fairly unstable atmosphere, and the ingredients were  set (at least in the model) for a persistent area of convective snows.  What happened?  Need to get more info, but there was never any snow in Boulder, and basically none in the foothills  either.  The snowfall farther west in the NWly flow was probably a pretty good forecast.

Description: A pretty intense period of snow in NWly flow with the passage of an embedded shortwave trough, mostly falling overnight after 02z on 12 March.  This was a highly orographically forced event where the max is often squeezed out in the springtime.  Snow amounts forecast for the event were way underdone, though snow was predicted.    Unfortunately did not save the critical SFM runs, which would be the 15z or 21z runs from 11 March.  May try to  rerun this case.

Associated with it was a persistent area of light to perhaps  moderate low-density snow mainly over the srn/wrn DEN suburbs in the aftn/evening of the 6th.    Saved the 1800 UTC runs of the hot-start MM5 and the Mesoeta.           More stuff:    Text saved data (forecasts, obs, etc.).                Figure 1:   MM5 1800 UTC run 0 h surface wind and reflectivity, overlaid with obs and NOWRAD.  Notice how the MM5 initial wind field nicely matches the observations showing the lighter winds with different directions near Boulder County, as would be expected since it initialized with LAPS.          Figure 2:   Mesoeta 1800 UTC run 0 h surface wind, overlaid with obs and NOWRAD.  The match of the winds with the obs is not nearly as good as with MM5 at 0 h.           Figure 3:   0 h surface winds from MM5 and the Mesoeta overlaid for direct comparison.  These are displayed at maximum resolution, which for the AWIPS display is 20 km for the Mesoeta (even though the  model's maximum resolution is actually 22 km), so there are 2 wind barbs from MM5 for every Mesoeta wind.

Figure 13:   Closeup of Figure 12 (but without winds).  Most of the precipitation was forecast for the  foothills, especially west of Boulder, whereas it turned out that most fell in the southern and western Denver suburbs.

Note: a coop site near Nederland, where the max precipitation was forecast,  did not record any snowfall for this event.                             15 November 2000: Potential plains snowfall associated with a Longmont Anticyclone as   well as mountain orographic snowfall.                   Hot start MM5 runs saved from 1200 UTC and 1800 UTC on 15 November.   Shortwave trough passage with synoptic NWly flow behind it, with potential for a LGM Anticyclone and of course mountain orographic snowfall.  In this case the NWlys tended to overwhelm any significant LGM Anticyclone, which was overpredicted by the model runs.  A nice snowband did occur on the plains but appeared to be at the leading edge of the trough and  surge of NWly low level flow, and proceeded to move from near the foothills at 13-14 UTC to vicinity of AKO by ~1800 UTC. This band was not predicted very well by the 1200 UTC MM5 run, while with the hot start the 1800 UTC run nicely captured it and held it together for awhile as it continued east (while diminishing in real life), about as forecast.    In the mountains good snowfall occurred commencing probably ~1000 UTC on 15 Nov, with most of it probably over by the evening of the 15 Nov.  Both runs tended to underforecast the amount of snowfall, but appeared to do a decent job with distribution, with Steamboat (12"" for 24 h ending 16 Nov at 1200 UTC) and Vail (10"" for similar) getting by far the most.

Figure 18:  MM5 1200 UTC run 24 h forecast of storm total precipitation and snowfall, for 24 h period ending at 1200 UTC on 16 Nov 00.  Overall, the mountain snowfall was underforecast, while snowfall associated with the Longmont  Anticyclone (zone 39, for example) was overforecast.           Figure 19:  MM5 1800 UTC run 18 h forecast of storm total precipitation and snowfall, for 18 h period ending at 1200 UTC on 16 Nov 00.  Probably a better forecast than the 1200 UTC run farther east on the plains, capturing the  area of snow associated with the shortwave trough, but still having a band with the LGM Anticyclone that was not there. While it is not possible to know how much snow fell during the 1200-1800 UTC period on 15 Nov in the mountains, it looks like this run did not do as well as the 1200 UTC run, with both underforecasting mountain snowfall for this event.          Figure 20:  Closeup of MM5 1800 UTC run 18 h forecast of storm total precipitation and snowfall,  for 18 h period ending at 1200 UTC on 16 Nov 00.          Figure 21:  Closeup with cities overlay of MM5 1800 UTC run 18 h forecast of storm total precipitation and  snowfall, for 18 h period ending at 1200 UTC on 16 Nov 00.  Note there is a max of snowfall near Steamboat, where  12"" in 24 h ending at 1200 UTC/16 Nov fell.  The forecast is only for a max of 1.5"", but it may be fair to subtract ~6"" from the 24 h snowfall total (based on the ~2 pm snow report on 15 Nov) at Steamboat to get a comparitive ob of  ~6"".  So while still a substantial underforecast, at least the max in location had the right idea.                          17 November 2000: Quick snow event with a northerly surge (Longmont Anticyclone) and    shortwave trough in the northerly flow; also mountain orographic snowfall.                   Setup was a shortwave moving south in the upper level ~nly flow with an  accompanying LGM Anticyclone type surge.  A similar type of feature on  Wednesday produced a burst of snow more on the eastern plains but pretty much  a null event many areas along the Front Range.  MM5 run did not predict much  with this event except for an area of snow more over zone 35 into zone 36, but very little out on the plains or even on the plains near the foothills.  This despite a  good job of predicting the strong turning (to upslope) winds with the LGM Anticyclone/post-surge flow. Mesoeta forecast also had precipitation predicted, but not nearly focused enough, or enough  predicted.  At 20 km resolution perhaps the strong e-w gradient away from the foothills would be too much to expect.    What happened was a burst of snow began ~23z locally and quickly became at least moderate snow here, with a good burst of nely winds producing some blowing snow.  By ~715 pm had accumulated ~3.5"" here in the parking lot, but when I got home at ~730pm could only measure 1.5"", so quite an extreme dropoff with distance  east of the foothills.  Heaviest accumulations were in fact in the foothills themselves of zone 36, with up to 8"" near Tiny Town.  Note how Allenspark had less than an inch. One thing about the snow was it had very low liquid water content; at least 20:1 or higher, so in effect some model predictions were not far off from that perspective.        Saved the 18z run of both the hot-start MM5 and the Mesoeta.  Most of the snow fell  here in BOU from 23z/17th to 04z/18th.   In terms of the mountains, both models predicted a rather light event, and generally only an inch or two fell, with Eldora getting 3"" (upslope from the east there probably responsible  for most of this).

GX000-21-12213590	FSL MDSS Ensemble of Models      These model runs of MM5 and WRF are generated in real time over an area centered on Iowa. Each of these models is initialized by the LAPS hot-start method for diabatic initialization, and the lateral boundaries are provided by NCEP's Eta model. Each model is run every hour out to 15 hours.     This work is done in support of the  Maintenance Decision Support System (MDSS)  project sponsored by the Federal Highways Administration. The goal of this project is to create a decision support software package to help winter road maintenance personnel decide how to best respond to weather problems on highways. MDSS takes automated weather observations and forecasts and runs pavement conditions models to suggest an optimum combination of plowing and chemical applications, and recommends the time to make these treatments.

GX000-23-10210906	NCEP MMAB Superstructure Ice Accretion Guidance     revised 25 September 2003; reviewed 25 September 2003      The NCEP superstructure ice accretion forecast system was developed by applying statistical algorithms developed by Overland and Pease at the Pacific Marine Environmental Research Laboratory in the mid- 1980s.  The algorithm relates icing to wind speed, freezing point of sea water, air temperature, and sea surface temperature.  The method is designed for trawlers in the 20 to 75 meter length range, underway at normal speeds in open seas and not heading downwind.  There are three categories: light - 0.1 to 0.8 inches of ice accretion/ 3 hours (aqua on chart); moderate - 0.8 to 2.4 inches/3 hours (dark blue on chart), and heavy - greater than 2.4 inches/3 hours (red on chart). It is currently available on a 1 deg x 1 deg grid for the North Atlantic (N ATL) , North Atlantic, Baltic and North Seas, and Arctic Ocean over Europe, and Pacific (N PAC) basins.  Binary data files in GRIB are available on a 1 x 1 degree grid grid thoughout the year.  The figures are in gif format and are on the order of 10k each.  Eventually, the figures will be in a single polar stereographic presentation with animation capability.      To ftp binary data, ftp to polar.wwb.noaa.gov, and cd to pub/vessel.icing. Do a binary get t00z.siceg_1x1.all, t06.siceg_1x1.all, t12z.siceg_1x1.all, or t18z.siceg_1x1.all to download the GRIB ice accretion data for the northern hemisphere.  This file contains seven (57) records: one for each projection from 00 to 168 hours at 3-h intervals on a 1 deg x 1 deg grid.   An experimental global product is now available.

GX000-24-3114312	"The Move to Four-Times Daily Medium-Range Forecasts in the Global Forecast System    As of 24 April 2002, the Environmental Modeling Center/Global Modeling Branch    moved from once-daily 384-hour forecasts (the so-called MRF run at 00Z) and    four 126-hour AVN forecasts (plus an AVN extension to 384 hours at 12Z to facilitate    creation of the 12Z ensemble) to four daily 384-hour forecasts at 00, 06, 12,    and 18Z. The resolution of the forecasts is T170L42 from the initial time to    180 hours, then T62L28 from 180 hours to 384 hours. Note that MRF ""look-alike""    files will continue to be available via ftp at   ftp://ftpprd.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/data/nccf/com/mrf/para/ .   Note that the AVN and MRF were actually identical models with respect to physics    and dynamics. The only difference between the 00Z MRF and the 00Z AVN was the    data cut-off time for the global data assimilation system (GDAS); the MRF had    a later data cutoff than the AVN for its initial conditions. The later data    cut-off would give the MRF more accurate initial conditions from which to run,    and theoretically a better forecast.    However, the reality is that there was no significant difference in forecast    skill between the AVN and MRF, in a 1-year experiment where the AVN was run    out to 15 days for direct comparison with the MRF. These results can be seen    on Dr. Hua-Lu Pan's  web    page .   It is anticipated that we will further take advantage of having 4 daily medium    range forecasts by expanding the ensemble product suite to include 06 and 18Z    ensemble runs. As a result, we will have more than 40 ensemble members per day to support    the probabilistic forecast efforts of the NWS."
