The patentability of inventions under U.S. law is determined by the Patent          and Trademark Office (USPTO) in the Department of Commerce. A patent application          is judged on four criteria. The invention must be ""useful"" in a practical          sense (the inventor must identify some useful purpose for it), ""novel""          (i.e., not known or used before the filing), and ""nonobvious"" (i.e., not          an improvement easily made by someone trained in the relevant area). The          invention also must be described in sufficient detail to enable one skilled          in the field to use it for the stated purpose (sometimes called the ""enablement""          criterion).          In general, raw products of nature are not patentable. DNA products usually          become patentable when they have been isolated, purified, or modified          to produce a unique form not found in nature.          The USPTO has 3 years to issue a patent. In Europe, the timeframe is          18 months. The USPTO is adopting a similar system. Patents are good for          20 years from filing date.         In the United States, patent priority is based on the ""first to invent""          principle: whoever made the invention first (and can prove it) is awarded          property rights for the 20-year period. Inventors have a one-year grace          period to file after they publish. All other countries except the Philippines,          however, follow a ""first inventor to file"" rule in establishing priority          when granting patents.          Many biotech patents have been applied for as provisional patents. This          means that persons or companies filing the provisional patent application          have up to one year to file their actual patent claim. The provisional          patent must contain a written description of said invention and the names          of the inventors. This one-year grace period does not count as one of          the 20 years that the patent is issued for.         When a biotechnology patent involving an altered product of nature is          issued, the patent holder is required to deposit a sample of the new invention          into one of the 26 worldwide culture depositories. Most DNA-related patents          are issued by the USPTO, the European Patent Office, or the Japanese Patent          Office.         Currently over three million genome-related patent applications have          been filed. U.S. patent applications are confidential until a patent is          issued, so determining which sequences are the subject of patent applications          is impossible. Those who use sequences from public databases today risk          facing a future injunction if those sequences turn out to be patented          by a private company on the basis of previously filed patent applications.                  Patenting Genes, Gene Fragments, SNPS,          Gene Tests, Proteins, and Stem Cells         In terms of genetics , inventors must           (1) identify novel genetic sequences,           (2) specify the sequence's product,           (3) specify how the product functions in nature --ie, its use           (4) enable one skilled in the field to use the sequence for its stated          purpose         Genes and Gene Fragments            USPTO has issued a few patents for gene fragments. Full sequence and function          often are not known for gene fragments. On pending applications, their          utility has been identified by such vague definitions as providing scientific          probes to help find a gene or another EST or to help map a chromosome.          Questions have arisen over the issue of when, from discovery to development          into useful products, exclusive right to genes could be claimed.          The 300- to 500-base gene fragments, called expressed sequence tags          (ESTs), represent only 10 to 30% of the average cDNA, and the genomic          genes are often 10 to 20 times larger than the cDNA. A cDNA molecule is          a laboratory-made version of a gene that contains only its information-rich          (exon) regions; these molecules provide a way for genome researchers to          fast-forward through the genome to biologically important areas. The original          chromosomal locations and biological functions of the full genes identified          by ESTs are unknown in most cases.          Patent applications for such gene fragments have sparked controversy          among scientists, many of whom have urged the USPTO not to grant broad          patents in this early stage of human genome research to applicants who          have neither characterized the genes nor determined their functions and          uses.          In December 1999, the USPTO issued stiffer interim guidelines (made          final in January 2001) stating that more usefulness—specifically          how the product functions in nature—must now be shown before gene          fragments are considered patentable. The new  rules           call for ""specific and substantial utility that is credible,"" but some          still feel the rules are too lax.          The patenting of gene fragments is controversial. Some say that patenting          such discoveries is inappropriate because the effort to find any given          EST is small compared with the work of isolating and characterizing a          gene and gene product, finding out what it does, and developing a commercial          product. They feel that allowing holders of such ""gatekeeper"" patents          to exercise undue control over the commercial fruits of genome research          would be unfair. Similarly, allowing multiple patents on different parts          of the same genome sequence --say on a gene fragment, the gene, and the          protein-- adds undue costs to the researcher who wants to examine the          sequence. Not only does the researcher have to pay each patent holder          via licensing for the opportunity to study the sequence, he also has to          pay his own staff to research the different patents and determine which          are applicable to the area of the genome he wants to study.         SNPs          Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are DNA sequence variations that          occur when a single nucleotide (A,T,C,or G) in the genome sequence is          altered. For example a SNP might change the DNA sequence AAGGCTAA to ATGGCTAA.          SNPs occur every 100 to 1000 bases along the 3-billion-base human genome.          SNPs can occur in both coding (gene) and noncoding regions of the genome.          Many SNPs have no effect on cell function, but scientists believe others          could predispose people to disease or influence their response to a drug.          Variations in DNA sequence can have a major impact on how humans respond          to disease; environmental insults such as bacteria, viruses, toxins, and          chemicals; and drugs and other therapies. This makes SNPs of great value          for biomedical research and for developing pharmaceutical products or          medical diagnostics. Scientists believe SNP maps will help them identify          the multiple genes associated with such complex diseases as cancer, diabetes,          vascular disease, and some forms of mental illness. These associations          are difficult to establish with conventional gene-hunting methods because          a single altered gene may make only a small contribution to the disease.          In April 1999, ten large pharmaceutical companies and the U.K. Wellcome          Trust philanthropy announced the establishment of a non-profit foundation          to find and map 300,000 common SNPs (they found 1.8 million). Their goal          was to generate a widely accepted, high-quality, extensive, publicly available          map using SNPs as markers evenly distributed throughout the human genome.          The consortium plans to patent all the SNPs found but will enforce the          patents only to prevent others from patenting the same information. Information          found by the consortium is being made freely available.         Gene Tests          As disease genes are found, complementary gene tests are developed to          screen for the gene in humans who suspect they may be at risk for developing          the disease. These tests are usually patented and licensed by the owners          of the disease gene patent. Royalties are due the patent holder each time          the tests are administered, and only licensed entities can conduct the          tests.         Proteins           Proteins do the work of the cell. A complete set of genetic information          is contained in each cell. This information provides a specific set of          instructions to the body. The body carries out these instructions via          proteins. Genes encode proteins.          All living organisms are composed largely of proteins, which have three          main cellular functions: to provide cell structure and be involved in          cell signaling and cell communication functions. Enzymes are proteins.          Proteins are important to researchers because they are the links between          genes and pharmaceutical development. They indicate which genes are expressed          or are being used. Important for understanding gene function, proteins          also have unique shapes or structures. Understanding these structures          and how potential pharmaceuticals will bind to them is a key element in          drug design.         Stem Cells          Therapeutic cloning, also called ""embryo cloning"" or ""cloning          for biomedical research,"" is the production of human embryos for          use in research. The goal of this process is not to create cloned human          beings but rather to harvest stem cells that can be used to study human          development and treat disease. Stem cells are important to biomedical          researchers because they can be used to generate virtually any type of          specialized cell in the human body. See the  Cloning           page for more information on therapeutic and other types of cloning.         Cell lines and genetically modified single-cell organisms are considered          patentable material. One of the earliest cases involving the patentability          of single-cell organisms was Diamond v. Chakrabarty in 1980, in which          the Supreme Court ruled that genetically modified bacteria were patentable.         Patents for stem cells from monkeys and other organisms already have          been issued. Therefore, based on past court rulings, human embryonic stem          cells are technically patentable. A lot of social and legal controversy          has developed in response to the potential patentability of human stem          cells. A major concern is that patents for human stem cells and human          cloning techniques violate the principle against the ownership of human          beings. In the U.S. patent system, patents are granted based on existing          technical patent criteria. Ethical concerns have not influenced this process          in the past, but, the stem cell debate may change this. It will be interesting          to see how patent law regarding stem cell research will play out. (1)                       Why patent?           Research scientists who work in public institutions often are troubled          by the concept of intellectual property because their norms tell them          that science will advance more rapidly if researchers enjoy free access          to knowledge. By contrast, the law of intellectual property rests on an          assumption that, without exclusive rights, no one will be willing to invest          in research and development (R&D).          Patenting provides a strategy for protecting inventions without secrecy.          A patent grants the right to exclude others from making, using, and selling          the invention for a limited term, 20 years from application filing date          in most of the world. To get a patent, an inventor must disclose the invention          fully so as to enable others to make and use it. Within the realm of industrial          research, the patent system promotes more disclosure than would occur          if secrecy were the only means of excluding competitors. This is less          clear in the case of public-sector research, which typically is published          with or without patent protection.          The argument for patenting public-sector inventions is a variation on          the standard justification for patents in commercial settings. The argument          is that postinvention development costs typically far exceed preinvention          research outlays, and firms are unwilling to make this substantial investment          without protection from competition. Patents thus facilitate transfer          of technology to the private sector by providing exclusive rights to preserve          the profit incentives of innovating firms. Patents are generally considered          to be very positive. In the case of genetic patenting, it is the scope          and number of claims that has generated controversy.           What are some of the potential arguments for          gene patenting?                    Researchers are rewarded for their discoveries and can use monies            gained from patenting to further their research                        The investment of resources is encouraged by providing a monopoly            to the inventor and prohibiting competitors from making, using, or selling            the invention without a license.                        Wasteful duplication of effort is prevented.                         Research is forced into new, unexplored areas.                        Secrecy is reduced and all researchers are ensured access to the new            invention.                         What are some of the potential arguments against gene          patenting?                     Patents of partial and uncharacterized cDNA sequences will reward            those who make routine discoveries but penalize those who determine            biological function or application (inappropriate reward given to the            easiest step in the process).                        Patents could impede the development of diagnostics and therapeutics            by third parties because of the costs associated with using patented            research data.                        Patent stacking (allowing a single genomic sequence to be patented            in several ways such as an EST, a gene, and a SNP) may discourage product            development because of high royalty costs owed to all patent owners            of that sequence; these are costs that will likely be passed on to the            consumer.                        Because patent applications remain secret until granted, companies            may work on developing a product only to find that new patents have            been granted along the way, with unexpected licensing costs and possible            infringement penalties.                        Costs increase not only for paying for patent licensing but also for            determining what patents apply and who has rights to downstream products.                        Patent holders are being allowed to patent a part of nature --a basic            constituent of life; this allows one organism to own all or part of            another organism.                        Private biotechs who own certain patents can monopolize certain gene            test markets.                        Patent filings are replacing journal articles as places for public            disclosure --reducing the body of knowledge in the literature.                   What does U.S. patent policy say about gene patenting?                    1980 Diamond v. Chakrabarty              Prior to 1980, life forms were considered a part of nature and were            not patentable.  Diamond v. Chakrabarty changed this with the 5            to 4 U.S. Supreme Court decision that genetically engineered (modified)            bacteria were patentable because they did not occur naturally in nature.            In this case, Chakrabarty had modified a bacteria to create an oil-dissolving            bioengineered microbe.                        Since Diamond v. Chakrabarty, patents have been issued on whole genes            whose function is known. More recently, inventors began to seek patents            on sequences of DNA that were less than a whole gene. The Patent Office            is developing guidelines on how to deal with these fragments since they            often do not have a known function.                        Some patents have been granted for fragments of DNA. That presents            the problem of someone trying to patent a larger fragment or gene that            contains the already patented sequence. Questions have been raised as            to whether the second inventor will need to obtain a license from the            first or whether he can obtain the patent without the first patent holder's            permission. These types of questions are likely to arise in the near            future and will most likely be resolved in courts designated to hear            patent actions.                        Patents have been prohibited by Congress in only a few cases where            the issuance of a patent was contrary to the public interest.             An example of this was the prohibition of patents on nuclear weapons.             The American Medical Association has made a similar request against            the patenting of medical and surgical procedures.                        U.S. House of Representatives Oversight Hearing on "" Gene            Patents and Other Genomic Inventions "" Thursday, July 13, 2000. Related             HGN article .                        Representative Lynn Rivers  introduced             the following two bills addressing the increasingly troublesome effects            of human gene patenting to the 107th Congress. No action has yet been            taken on these bills.                           Genomic Research and Diagnostic Accessibility Act of 2002 ( H.R.                3967 )               Genomic Science and Technology Innovation Act of 2002 ( H.R.                3966 )                               How does genome information placed in the public          domain work? Who can use it?           All genome sequence generated by the Human Genome Project has been deposited          into GenBank, a public database freely accessible by anyone with a connection          to the Internet. For an introduction on how to search GenBank and other          nucleotide databases at the National Center of Biotechnology Information,          see the  Gene          and Protein Database Guide  and a related  tutorial           available at  Gene          Gateway , an online guide to learning about genes, proteins, and disorders.          Disseminating information in the public domain encourages widespread          use of information, minimizes transaction costs, and makes R&D cheaper          and faster. Of particular relevance to research science, a vigorous public          domain can supply a meeting place for people, information, and ideas that          might not find each other in the course of more organized, licensed encounters.          Information in the public domain is accessible to users who otherwise          would be priced out of the market.
