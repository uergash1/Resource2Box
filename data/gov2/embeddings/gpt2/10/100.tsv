GX266-65-15359758	Marshall COUNTY  Created at statehood from Pickens County in the Chickasaw Nation, Indian Territory, this smallest county in the state was settled by the Chickasaws beginning in 1837 with the removal from their Eastern homes. A member of the Constitutional Convention, George A. Henshaw of Madill, succeeded in giving the county his mother's maiden name, Marshall. The county seat, Madill, is named for George A. Madill of St. Louis, an attorney for the railroad. Oil has played a colorful part in the county's history. Leases along the Red River led to the Supreme Court's final decision in the boundary dispute with Texas. Principal industries in the county are: Oklahoma Steel and Wire, W.W. Trailer, Clint Williams Texoma Peanut Co., Madill Manufacturing, S & H Trailer, J & I Manufacturing and Contract Manufacturing. Also important are oil, agriculture, livestock and tourism. The Denison Dam, completed in 1944, created Lake Texoma with 91,200 acres of water. This lake attracts some 500,000 visitors annually and has made tourism a major industry in the county. Native son, Raymond D. Gary of Madill, brought the spotlight of attention to the county when he became the 15th Governor of Oklahoma during the years 1955-59.

Clay County had several sewer projects listed in the plan. The plan provided detailed cost estimates involving the construction of new sewer lines. Other cost estimates were obtained from a draft report provided by Kentucky's 5th District Congressman Harold Rogers, entitled Water Resource Related Environmental Initiatives, dated May 28, 1998. The Cumberland Valley Area Development District utilized the chart below, labeled as Table 1 and Table 2, to assist with the determination of costs for items such as STEP, treatment systems, and costs for collection systems.

The decennial census is the only national survey providing consistent, uniform measures and data for every geographic area in the nation. The results capture a picture in time of the population of Utah; who we are, how we've changed, and the direction we are heading- demographically, socially, and economically. Cities and Counties of Utah is the first in a series of Census 2000 Briefs to provide detailed analysis of the Utah Census 2000 data. This report contains tables, figures, and maps showing current and historical population data for Utah's counties, cities, census designated places (CDPs), and reservations. The report begins with a 1990-2000 summary population table for the U.S., Utah, and Utah's counties and cities. This section is followed by more detailed demographic analysis of the state, including data on population density, land area, and growth and size rankings. The last section of the report provides users with a historical look at Utah and the growth that has occurred over the last hundred years. State of Utah Utah's April 1, 2000 population reached 2,233,169. This represents a population increase of 510,319 persons, or 29.6% from 1990, ranking Utah fourth among states in the rate of population growth from 1990 to 2000. Utah grew more than twice as fast as the U.S. (13.2%) during this ten year period. Utah, as well as four of its neighboring states, ranked as the five fastest growing states in the country during the last decade. They include: Nevada (66.3%), Arizona (40.0%), Colorado (30.6%), Utah (29.6%), and Idaho (28.5%). Utah's Counties Largest . Salt Lake County continues to be the state's largest county with a population of 898,387 in 2000, followed by Utah County (368,536), Davis (238,994), Weber (196,533), Cache (91,391), and Washington  (90,354) Counties. Daggett County remains the smallest county in the state with a 2000 population of 921. Three out of every four people in the state live in the northern metropolitan area, including Weber, Davis, Salt Lake, and Utah Counties, where 1,702,450 residents, or 76% of the state's population reside. Fastest Growing. Summit County was the fastest growing county over the decade, nearly doubling in size and increasing 92%, from 15,518 in 1990 to 29,736 in 2000. Seventy percent of the growth occurred in the unincorporated area of the county. Washington and Iron County were the second and third fastest growing counties, respectively, in the state during the 1990s. Washington County, with an 86% increase over the decade, grew at nearly three times the state rate. Iron County, grew more than twice the state rate from 1990-2000, with a 63% increase. Five of the state's fastest growing counties form a ring of high growth around the northern metropolitan counties. These counties include Summit (92%); Tooele (53%); Wasatch (51%); Juab (42%); and Sanpete (40%). Among the other fastest growing counties in the state are Utah (40%); Daggett (34%); and Cache (30%) Counties. Carbon County, with a growth rate of just 1% over the decade, was the slowest growing county in the state. Most Dense. Salt Lake County remains the most densely populated county in the state with 1,218.4 persons per square mile. Other densely populated counties include Davis (784.9); Weber (341.5); Utah (184.4); Cache (78.5); and Washington (37.2). Garfield County is the least dense county in the state with less than one person per square mile. Utah's Cities Largest . Salt Lake City continues to be the largest city in the state with a 2000 population of 181,743, followed by West Valley City (108,896); Provo 2   (105,166); Sandy (88,418); Orem (84,324); Ogden (77,226); West Jordan (68,336); Layton (58,474); Taylorsville (57,439); and St. George (49,663). Fastest Growing. The City of Draper lead the way among the state's fastest growing cities (greater than 9,000). Draper more than tripled in size from 19902000, increasing by 18,000 people, or 248%. Several other of the state's largest cities doubled in size over the decade, including South Jordan (141%); Lehi (125%); Riverton (122%); and Syracuse (102%). Most Dense. Taylorsville is the most densely populated city in the state with 5,376.2 persons per square mile. Other densely populated Utah cities include Midvale (4,627.4); Orem (4,573.6); Washington Terrace (4,477.4); Roy (4,330.8); Sandy (3,961.5); and South Ogden (3,917.1). Howell Town in Box Elder County is the least dense city/town with only 6.2 persons per square mile. Utah's Census Designated Places (CDPs) A CDP is a statistical entity comprising a dense concentration of population that is not within an incorporated place but is locally identified by a name. CDPs are delineated cooperatively with state and local and tribal government officials based on Census Bureau guidelines. For the first time in Census 2000, CDPs do not have to meet a population threshold to qualify for tabulation of census data. Largest . The ten largest census designated places in Utah in 2000 are all located in Salt Lake County. Kearns CDP is the largest with a population of 33,659, followed by Millcreek CDP (30,377); Cottonwood Heights CDP (27,569); Magna CDP (22,770); and East Millcreek CDP (2,385). Fastest Growing. Of those CDPs present in both the 1990 Census and Census 2000, Montezuma Creek CDP had the largest percent change in population over the decade (214.9%). Erda CDP was the second fastest growing CDP, increasing by 127.5%, followed by Stansbury Park CDP (122.1%); Little Cottonwood Creek CDP (43.2%); and Oquirrh CDP (36.8%).  Most Dense. The eleven most densely populated CDPs in the state are located in Salt Lake County. Kearns CDP is the most dense with 6,994.1 persons per square mile, followed by White City CDP (6,912.6); Millcreek CDP (6,160.5); Oquirrh CDP (5,950.3); and Canyon Rim CDP (5,033.6). Historical Population The final section of this report contains historical population tables for the United States, Utah, and Utah's counties and cities. The historical data dates back to 1790 for the nation, 1850 for the state and its counties, and 1890 for cities. Additional Information American FactFinder.

CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located. The boundaries usually are defined in cooperation with local or tribal officials. These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or other legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.  *New CDP for Census 2000 Source: U.S. Census Bureau  42   Census Designated Places Ranked by Population Size Size Rank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 CDP Kearns CDP Millcreek CDP Cottonwood Heights CDP Magna CDP East Millcreek CDP Cottonwood West CDP Canyon Rim CDP Oquirrh CDP Little Cottonwood Creek Valley CDP Mount Olympus CDP *Summit Park CDP White City CDP Hooper CDP *South Snyderville Basin CDP Maeser CDP Erda CDP Stansbury Park CDP Granite CDP Dugway CDP *North Snyderville Basin CDP *Benson CDP *Benjamin CDP *Oljato-Monument Valley CDP *West Mountain CDP *Daniel CDP *Lake Shore CDP *Riverside CDP Fort Duchesne CDP *Aneth CDP *South Willard CDP Neola CDP Montezuma Creek CDP *Palmyra CDP *Spring Lake CDP *Cove CDP *Navajo Mountain CDP Whiterocks CDP *La Sal CDP *Woodland CDP *Bluff CDP *Avon CDP *Timber Lakes CDP *Elberta CDP *White Mesa CDP *Halchita CDP *Peter CDP Randlett CDP *Spanish Valley CDP *Samak CDP *Tselakai Dezza CDP *Halls Crossing CDP Mexican Hat CDP *Garden CDP *Cache CDP County Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Summit Salt Lake Weber Summit Uintah Tooele Tooele Salt Lake Tooele Summit Cache Utah San Juan Utah Wasatch Utah Box Elder Uintah San Juan Box Elder Duchesne San Juan Utah Utah Cache San Juan Uintah San Juan Summit San Juan Cache Wasatch Utah San Juan San Juan Cache Uintah San Juan Summit San Juan San Juan San Juan Rich Cache 2000 Population 33,659 30,377 27,569 22,770 21,385 18,727 10,428 10,390 7,221 7,103 6,597 5,988 3,926 3,636 2,855 2,473 2,385 2,018 2,016 1,821 1,451 1,029 864 838 770 755 678 621 598 586 533 507 485 469 443 379 341 339 335 320 306 289 278 277 270 230 224 181 161 103 89 88 83 37  *New CDP for Census 2000 Source: U.S. Census Bureau  43   Census Designated Place Comparisons: 1990-2000 1990-2000 Absolute Change -99 -1,197 1,251 239 201 1,386 -6 -1,282 458 5,285 2,179 257 4,941 -200 -1,853 346 -310 -24 2,797 -57 1,311 -518 21 1990-2000 Percent Change -0.9% -4.2% 7.2% 13.4% 0.9% 127.5% -1.0% -38.8% 13.2% 18.6% 43.2% 9.9% 27.7% -69.4% -5.7% 214.9% -4.2% -4.3% 36.8% -20.3% 122.1% -8.0% 6.6% Rank By Absolute Change 17 21 7 11 12 5 14 22 8 1 4 10 2 18 23 9 19 15 3 16 6 20 13 Rank By Percent Change 14 16 11 8 13 2 15 22 9 7 4 10 6 23 19 1 17 18 5 21 3 20 12  Census Designated Place (CDP) Canyon Rim CDP Cottonwood Heights CDP Cottonwood West CDP Dugway CDP East Millcreek CDP Erda CDP Fort Duchesne CDP Granite CDP Hooper CDP Kearns CDP Little Cottonwood Creek Valley CDP Maeser CDP Magna CDP Mexican Hat CDP Millcreek CDP Montezuma Creek CDP Mount Olympus CDP Neola CDP Oquirrh CDP Randlett CDP Stansbury Park CDP White City CDP Whiterocks CDP  County Salt Lake Salt Lake Salt Lake Tooele Salt Lake Tooele Uintah Salt Lake Weber Salt Lake Salt Lake Uintah Salt Lake San Juan Salt Lake San Juan Salt Lake Duchesne Salt Lake Uintah Tooele Salt Lake Uintah  1990 Population 10,527 28,766 17,476 1,777 21,184 1,087 627 3,300 3,468 28,374 5,042 2,598 17,829 288 32,230 161 7,413 557 7,593 281 1,074 6,506 320  2000 Population 10,428 27,569 18,727 2,016 21,385 2,473 621 2,018 3,926 33,659 7,221 2,855 22,770 88 30,377 507 7,103 533 10,390 224 2,385 5,988 341  Note: This comparison includes only those CDPs present in both the 1990 Census and Census 2000.

K-Z         Special Schedules of the Eleventh Census (1890) Enumerating Union Veterans  and Widows of Union Veterans of the Civil War. M123. 118 rolls.    An act of March 1, 1889, provided that the Superintendent of Census in taking    the Eleventh Census should ""cause to be taken on a special schedule of    inquiry, according to such form as he may prescribe, the names, organizations,    and length of service of those who had served in the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps    of the United States in the war of the rebellion, and who are survivors at the    time of said inquiry, and the widows of soldiers, sailors, or marines.""            Each schedule calls for the following information: name of the veteran (or if    he did not survive, the names of both the widow and her deceased husband); the    veteran's rank, company, regiment or vessel, date of enlistment, date of discharge,    and length of service in years, months, and days; post office and address of    each person listed; disability incurred by the veteran; and remarks necessary    to a complete statement of his term of service.

GX257-80-9885247	"Recycle, Ohio!  Special Annual Report Issue March 2000 - Volume VII - Issue 1 Ohio Department of Natural Resources Division of Recycling & Litter Prevention Bob Taft, Governor Sam Speck, Director Mike Canf ield, Chief  COMMUNIQU H ow many times have you read or heard the words, ""closing the loop is important to the success of Ohio's recycling programs?"" The Recycling Market Development Grant program symbolizes the importance of those words. In the past five years, the ODNR Division of Recycling and Litter Prevention has awarded cooperating solid waste management districts and partnering companies more than $3 million. Funds are used for a variety of projects, including research and development, equipment upgrades and purchases, and facility improvements. ""Developing new markets for plastics and other recyclables helps strengthen Ohio's recycling industry,"" said ODNR Director Sam Speck. ""We will continue to work aggressively to create stronger markets for the recycled materials our communities collect."" The Recycling Market Development Grant (RMDG) is a matching grant that enables Ohio companies to invest in initiatives that strengthen local or regional markets for plastic, paper and other recycled materials. The grants have resulted in companies replacing virgin materials with recycled-content feedstock collected from Ohio's recycling programs, and have created new job opportunities locally. The grant program has produced a number of success stories; Custom PlasTech, Ltd. is a recent example of how the RMDG program continues to strengthen recycling markets. Last fall, a $75,000 grant was awarded to the Portage County Solid Waste Management District and Custom PlasTech. According to Custom PlasTech, without the grant, the company wouldn't have been able to use recycled feedstock in their line of highway barricade signs and commercial sandwich board signs. Custom PlasTech officials learned about the grant opportunity when they began plans to relocate their present 10,000 sq. ft. facility in Geauga County to a new site in Portage County. Construction begins on their new 26,000 sq. ft. facility this spring; a building that will hold new equipment purchased with '00 RMDG funds and house employees in new jobs created by that new equipment. Custom PlasTech's line of barricade signs are used by highway and roadway crews to close streets and re-route cars during construction and other projects. These signs use pelletized, natural colored recycled plastic processed by an Ohio firm, milk jugs that were tossed into Ohio recycling bins. With grant funding, the company purchased molds for the new recycled-content products and a vacuum blending system instrumental in maintaining product quality. ""The blender mixes the recycled plastic with the virgin feedstock and guarantees a consistent product, which helps reduce our costs up front. Otherwise, we'd have wild swings in product qualitywe want all good parts,"" said Ron Zab, manager of Custom PlasTech's strategic business unit. ""We were using virgin HDPE plastic in our line of barricades,"" said Zab, Continued on back cover  Improving markets is the key to recycling's success  Marquee  Sentinel 12 Top  Marquee Jr.  Marquee Mini (12)  PMG  Sentinel Mini  Custom PlasTech's line of recycled-content products.  Still Rockin', Still Rollin', Still Recyclin' after 20 years Ohio's recycling, litter prevention and solid waste management professionals will have a chance to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to the Division of Recycling and Litter Prevention (DRLP) at the 20th Anniversar y Conference being held July 16-19 in Cleveland. The conference will feature tours, technical and educational sessions, as well as other professional enrichment opportunities. Reserve your room today by calling the Cleveland Lakeside Holiday Inn at (216) 241-5100. Remember to ask for the DRLP 20th Anniversary Conference  rates are only good until June 24. For more information on the conference, check the division's website at www.dnr.state.oh.us/odnr/recycling/anniversary.htm.   FOCUS ON... Community Success Stories Catching up on DRLP news As winter winds down and thoughts turn to planning spring activities, division staff are finishing up the work required to turn a pile of deserving nomination forms into the annual Take Pride, Ohio! Awards Luncheon on April 6. This year, DRLP will also be honoring individuals, organizations and agencies who have provided successful partnering opportunities for state campaigns and programs. America Recycles Day fever is catching on both nationally and here in the Buckeye state. Thanks to our local participants and sponsoring organizations, Ohio's 1999 ARD campaign results included more than 100 special events, 78 displays and more than 150 print and media advertisements. Best of all, more than 12,000 pledge cards were delivered to ARD headquarters, and those pledge cards will be eligible for the 2000 American Green Dream Home giveaway in December 2000. 2000 ROG Grant Awards As they saythe Recycle, Ohio! grant checks are in the mail! Ninety-eight Ohio counties, cities and solid waste management districts received more than $6.7 million in 2000 Recycle, Ohio! grant (ROG) funding. I'm encouraged by the range and depth of projects coordinated by local recycling and litter prevention programs across the state. A complete listing of ROG awards is opposite this column. As in past years, division staff presented ceremonial checks to a select number of county commissioners. Deputy Chief Tom Davis and I had the honor to share the successes of our grant programs with local elected officials. I think it is important that all Ohioans, citizens and local officials alike, recognize the hard work of our talented, hands-on and committed recycling and litter prevention professionalsthe backbone of Ohio's recycling and litter prevention programs. Sincerely,  2000 Recycle, Ohio! Grant Awards  N  ow in its twentieth year of funding local recycling and litter prevention programs, the division awarded a total of $6,782,843 in Recycle, Ohio! grant funding to 98 Ohio communities, county governments and regional solid waste management districts. ""These grants help encourage recycling programs across Ohio, allowing local communities to provide recycling services at the neighborhood level,"" Governor Bob Taft said. ""Recycle, Ohio! grants have a positive affect on all Ohioans, helping improve curbside recycling programs and community litter clean-up efforts.""  2000 Recycle, Ohio!

Deadline to submit Recycling Market Development Grant applications to DRLP. Ohio companies are encouraged to contact their local solid waste management district or DRLP for more information.  Improving Markets, continued from page 1 ""Using recycled-content HDPE made sense; we're cutting down on landfill space and we're reusing the materials rather than throwing them out."" And according to Zab, the environmental benefits of using recycledcontent feedstock had another important anglecost savings of 30 percent. Currently, Custom PlasTech is using 10 percent recycled-content and Zab says the company is experimenting with the plastic blend to further increase the recycled-content percentage. ""The investment of grant dollars overall helped the company. We currently employ 10 people in a facility that is busting at the seams,"" said Zab. ""At the new facility we'll be purchasing new molding machinery (for their newest product made from recycled-contenta commercial plastic signboard) that will immediately employ six more people."" For companies like Custom PlasTech, and the other two dozen companies that have participated in the Recycling Market Development Grant program, the grant dollars made an environmental and economic difference.

GX266-95-11813340	"STATE OF TENNESSEE HOUSING RESOURCE DIRECTORY  COMPILED BY THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION, DIVISION OF MENTAL RETARDATION SERVICES 2002  1   HOUSING RESOURCE DIRECTORY INTRODUCTION  In order to support various housing options and resources, the Tennessee Division of Mental Retardation Services (DMRS), in partnership with the Tennessee Housing Development Agency, TN Fair Housing Council, West TN Legal Services, U.S. Dept of Agriculture - Office of Housing and Rural Development, TN Disability Information & Referral Office, John F. Kennedy Center at Vanderbilt University, The Arc of TN, Council for Developmental Disabilities, Peggy and Jo Davis, TN Disability Coalition, People First of TN, and TN Network for Community Economic Development have developed this Housing Resource Directory. The directory will cover a wide variety of topics such as rental assistance, the Tennessee Home of your Own Program, housing grants to non-profits, as well as providing a wide array of pointers on issues such as housing laws and accessibility resources. The directory will point you in the right direction and help you begin to understand how housing support options work here in Tennessee. While our goal is to get people, all people, whether people receiving support services, parents, advocates, providers, community business owners, etc. thinking about how to support people with disabilities to have control of their housing and to purchase their own homes, this directory is not guaranteed to lead to homeownership. The goal of this directory is to provide resources to help people move through the housing and homeownership system, sort out and understand the unique language of the housing/ownership community, and provide an overall outline of the process and procedures that must be followed in order to use the housing and homeownership programs. Where we live is an issue important to all people. We all want a place to call our own. Our very own castle and isle of refuge in a world so fast paced that the pool of information is doubling every 2 to 3 years. This desire, to have a home, is not alien to the life experience of people with disabilities. ""People with disabilities want a place that they can call their own. In this regard, their dreams are no different from their fellow citizens. Many people with disabilities, however, also need supports in order to enjoy everyday community living. For these individuals, having a home of their own frequently is intertwined with the availability of natural, community and public supports to help address their needs"" (Gary Smith, national strategist and advocate). ""Person-owned/controlled housing and personalized support have become part of this nation's agenda as grassroots efforts have challenged the standard way of providing services for people with developmental and other disabilities. Throughout the nation individuals, advocates and innovative service providers have made significant moves from institutions and group homes to the creation of housing and support that permit all people, including those with the most intensive support needs, to live in homes of their choosing"" (Home of Your Own Alliance Brochure).

Section 8 Rental Assistance The Tennessee Housing Development Agency (THDA) is the lead state agency for affordable housing. It serves Tennesseans with low to moderate income who are elderly and/or have a disability. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the State of Tennessee fund THDA programs. There is often a waiting list for services but persons with disabilities are often offered a priority for rental assistance. Agencies that administer Section 8 are listed below.

Frequently Asked Questions about the Section 8 Program What is the Section 8 Program? The Section 8 tenant-based program is a rental assistance (voucher) program that is funded by the Federal Government through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The purpose of the Section 8 Program is to enable eligible families or individuals to obtain decent, safe and sanitary housing by paying a portion of rental costs (including utilities) for the families directly to their landlord. Thirty percent of a person's income is utilized for rent. The HUD Voucher pays the rest. Who is eligible to receive a Housing Choice Voucher? Both families and individuals may be eligible for the Program. Eligibility is primarily based on income and family composition. There may be a waiting list for rental vouchers, but individuals are encouraged to apply even if there is. Most offices prioritize individuals with disabilities on the waiting list. To apply, call the office covering the county where the individual resides.  What is a Housing Choice Voucher? In October, 1999, the certificate and voucher programs merged into a single rental assistance program, the housing choice voucher program.  Where may I live with a Housing Choice Voucher? In the Section 8 Program, you select a unit of your choice, as long as it meets the criteria. If you apply for the waiting list in a county where you do not reside at the time of your application, you must lease a unit in the county where you applied for one-year of your application before you are eligible to relocate with continued assistance to a different Co  8   If I find a landlord not signed up with Section 8, what can I do? The landlord can call the same office to apply as a landlord. Once approved, then the applicant can live there.  How do I Apply for the Program? You must apply with the agency that administers the Program in the county where you desire to live.

All copies of this publication must include the cover page and acknowledgements section before redistribution.  B. Working With Public Housing Agencies Guide for Advocates or Agencies       First identify the agency with Section 8 jurisdiction of your county, a local PHA or TN Housing Development Agency field Office. Identify the agency accessing federal HOME grants. Get an appointment with the director of the agency to establish a relationship. Questions to ask: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. Is the waiting list open? If not. How long has it been closed? Does the PHA give preference to those with disabilities? Does the PHA have an Olmstead Plan? (See page for further information, ""Olmstead Decision) Has the PHA asked HUD for additional Section 8 vouchers, specifically for those with disabilities or specifically those waiting to leave institutional settings to prevent institutionalization? Has the PHA looked at implementing Section 8 voucher use for home ownership/mortgages as now allowed by HUD?  9     Other Information to Know or Ask: 1. On individual cases where a person (Section 8 approved) can't find a Section 8 approved home/apartment that is under that area what can you do? Fair Market can be asked for an exception to: use housing with a higher rent based on reasonable accommodation needs, or an extra bedroom is needed for a live-in companion/couple. 2. Agencies that own homes can apply for a home to be Section 8 approved just like any other landlord can. 3. Section 8 vouchers are now choice based. Although some are available in ""project developments,"" once a person is approved for Section 8, they can choose any place that will consider being approved to take Section 8 and involves a simple inspection that the local PHA or THDA office would do. There is a landlord application and yes the rent must fall within HUD fair market, although again a request from the person receiving a voucher can request an exception if there are specific reasons due to disability is needed.  10   II.

One Family's Perspective of the Home of Your Own Program       Attend home ownership classes with the individual in the area where the home is sought. If your family member is not able to attend, you can attend for them. Contact the TNCED office TNCED2@aol.com phone: (615) 226-8868, in Nashville. Their information and guidance is invaluable. Apply for a TNCED assistance in locating down payment and closing costs. The tenant rent will subsidize the buyer's mortgage payment and in effect increase his or her purchasing power. Contact the financial institution of your choice that issues home mortgages and obtain loan pre-approval. The mortgage company will establish the price range of the home your individual can afford.  If the home is going to be a shared ownership the mortgage company will need financial information on all prospective owners. The individuals will pool their income to get their loan approval. If the home is to be owned by one person with others leasing, you will have to have a signed lease listing all shared expenses such as: The leaseholder (housemate) will be responsible for one-half of the cost of the house note, utilities, yard maintenance, trash pickup, food, etc. (List all shared expenses--have a clear understanding and documentation of what the housemate is obligated to pay.  Check with the Division of Mental Retardation attorney to verify the currency and accuracy of your conservatorship. Some conservators are only guardians over health and well-being. If this is the case, the state attorney can petition the court for a one-time transaction approval for the purchase of the home, when the court agrees that this purchase is in the best interest of your ward. There is no financial obligation for any one other than the owner/s of the home. A conservator is not liable for the mortgage or expenses. The state attorney will need to provide the court with a copy of the real estate appraisal, a copy of the sales contract, and a copy of the good faith estimate of closing costs. These  16   documents provide the court the specifics of the mortgage transaction and prove that the transaction is in your ward's best interest. If the court agrees, a court order will be issued allowing you to make this one-time transaction on behalf of your ward. This process assures there is no financial responsibility or obligation to you as conservator and allows your ward to purchase a home in their name. Since the home is in their name, they cannot be evicted if a change to a different provider agency is required. The correct wording the conservator uses when signing the closing documents is extremely important. Ask the DMRS' Conservator attorney to provide you with the correct phrasing to be used when you sign each document at the closing. In our case we were instructed to sign the closing papers as follows: ""Conservator or Guardian's Name/s, Conservator for, Ward's Name as Pursuant to Court Authority"". The state attorney will walk you through this process and your handicapped individual will be able to purchase a home in their name free from any financial responsibility to their family. MR individuals are unique and do not have to have all of their rights taken away. They simply need extra supervision. If the conservator is over all aspects of their ward's life including financial, the conservator can allow their ward to purchase their home. As conservator, you do not have any obligation to use any of your personal funds. It is totally the buyer's (ward's) responsibility.  If the individual is under 65 years of age, you can establish a ""Special Needs Fund"" to help pay for future maintenance on the home. The fund can only be used for the purpose for which it is established. Check with your caseworker at the Dept. of Human Services before establishing any fund. After 65 years of age all special needs funds are frozen. They are retained for the purpose for which they were established, but you can no longer contribute to it after age 65. Any contributions made after 65 years of age are considered assets and will be counted in the ward's assets. The importance of checking with your Dept. of Human Services caseworker before establishing any funds cannot be stressed enough. If your ward has more than $2000 in assets, they will lose their Medicaid eligibility funding. Written from personal experiences by Peggy and Jo Davis  17   E. Home buyer Education Classes  Tennessee Homebuyer's Education Trainers: A lot of thinking and planning is necessary for a successful home buying experience. Many lenders, real estate professionals and not-for-profit organizations offer homebuyers education classes to help you make your plans. Topics include different kinds of mortgages, down payment requirements, underwriting criteria, and special programs that exist to encourage homeownership with reduced costs. Tennessee Housing Development Agency maintains a list of trainers approved to teach homebuyers about a home. Some classes are free while others may charge a nominal fee. If interested in a homebuyer education class in your county, a complete listing by county is on the following web site: www.state.tn.us/thda/Programs/Mortgage/trainers. In most counties the Agricultural Extension Service offers this class.  F. Legal Assistance/Special Needs Trust   A special needs trust is a trust account that can be set up for a specific reason at a local bank that will not affect benefits. Reasons regarding housing may include an account for house maintenance or to save for a home. A Special Needs Trust is a specific type of trust established with the assets of a disabled individual which meets the following conditions: The trust is established solely for the benefit of a disabled individual by a parent, grandparent, legal guardian, or by a court: AND the trust must stipulate that any remaining amounts in the trust not retained by the trust, upon the beneficiary's death, are to be paid to the State in an amount equal to the total medical assistance paid on the beneficiary's behalf by the State. This type of Special Needs Trust is not a countable resource and would not effect the eligibility of the individual in terms of the resource limit. Disbursements from the trust will be counted as income to the individual in the month of the disbursement unless the disbursement is made to a third party for items that are not food, clothing, or shelter. In other words, if money is paid out to the individual from the trust, that money will count as income in the month. If money is paid out to a provider or other source for anything that is not considered to be food, clothing, or shelter, then the money is not countable as income. Depending on the payment and disbursement, the money paid out could effect eligibility.

Exclusion of Home Ownership on Social Security Benefits Exclusion of TN Home of Your Own as Countable Resource from Federal Register    Your home is not counted regardless of its value. If an individual moves out of his or her home without the intent to return, the home becomes a countable resource because it is no longer the individual's principal place of residence. If an individual leaves his or her home to live in an institution, we still consider the home to be the individual's principal place of residence, irrespective of the individual's intent to return, as long as a spouse or dependent relative of the eligible individual continues to live there. The individual's equity in the former home becomes a countable resource effective with the first day of the month following the month it is no longer his or her principal place of residence. Proceeds from the sale of a home which is excluded from the individual's resources will also be excluded from resources to the extent they are intended to be used and are, in fact, used to purchase another home, which is similarly excluded, within 3 months of the date of receipt of the proceeds. Other proceeds from the sale of the former home are excluded resources if they are used within 3 months of receipt to make payment on the replacement home. Such proceeds, which consist of the down payment and that portion of any installment amount constituting payment against the principal, represent a conversion of a resource. Failure to purchase another home in 3 months, the value of a promissory note or similar installment sales contract received from the sale of a home is a countable resource effective with the first moment of the month following the month the note is executed.

Division of Mental Retardation Services Family Support The Family Support Program is administered by the Division of Mental Retardation Services through contracts with community agencies across the state. The program assists individuals with severe or developmental disabilities and their families to stay together in their homes and communities. It helps families purchase services, supplies, and equipment; however, this program does not reimburse you for costs that are covered under other programs, including Medicaid Waiver, TennCare, Medicare, or private insurance. It is not a substitute for comprehensive long-term services. To     be eligible, you must: Be a fulltime resident at time of application and when services are delivered. Have a severe or developmental disability which is likely to continue indefinitely. Have a disability that results in substantial functional limitations in three or more areas of life function. Reside in a home, alone or with a parent, relative, or other caregiver in the community in an unsupported setting. (A supported setting is a residential setting that is state or federally funded, e.g., institutions, group homes, supported living or state funded foster homes). Individuals who live in subsidized housing (Section 8) or boarding homes are eligible because the living situation is not a ""residential service"" and does not include supportive services.  Many families may be eligible for the Family Support Program, but may not actually receive services, based on funds available, selection criteria, and other factors.

E. Olmstead Decision  The Olmstead Decision  What is it? On June 22, 1999, the United States Supreme Court decided in Olmstead vs. L.C. to support the Americans with Disabilities Act ""Integration Mandate"", which declares that the unnecessary segregation of individuals with disabilities in institutions may constitute discrimination based on disability. The court ruled that the Americans with Disabilities Act may require states to provide communitybased services rather than institutional placements for individuals with disabilities. The decision is a victory in several ways:  44   1. 2. 3.  It upholds the United States Department of Justice's regulations, which mandate that a state must administer its programs in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of individuals with disabilities; It states that unjustified isolation is properly regarded as discrimination on the basis of disability under the ADA; and It recognizes that the United States Congress intended the ADA to step up earlier efforts in the Developmental Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act to secure community living opportunities for people with disabilities. Olmstead affects all people with a current or previous disability or who are regarded as having a disability that substantially limits one or more major life activities. This includes people who currently reside in institutions, including nursing homes, and individuals at risk of institutionalization. All states, including Tennessee, are mandated to provide community settings for individuals who would otherwise be entitled to institutional services when:   Community placement is determined to be appropriate by the state's treatment professionals,  The individual does not oppose community placement, and  Community placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account available resources and the needs of others receiving disability services. Lastly, the Olmstead Decision is also important for what it does not say:      It It It It It does does does does does not not not not not say say say say say that all institutions must be closed. when community services must be available. that lack of resources alone is a valid excuse for failure to move qualified individuals into the community. the state's responsibility is limitless. that modification must be made which would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program or activity.  45   VI. Housing Grants to NonProfits A. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) B. Lending Resources for Non-profits  46   A. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is the Federal agency responsible for national policy and programs that address America's housing needs, that improve and develop the nation's communities, and that enforce fair housing laws. Several programs funded by HUD and administered by state and local housing agencies include the following:  Public Housing - Low-income housing, operated by your local housing authority  Section 8 - Tenant based subsidized housing in which the housing authority gives the tenant a certificate or voucher that says the government will subsidize your rent payments and then the tenant finds his/her own housing  FHA Mortgage Insurance Program - A mortgage financing program through FHA, a division of HUD    The Section 811 program provides grants to non-profit organizations to develop and construct or rehabilitate rental housing with support services for very low-income persons with disabilities. Mainstream Program awards funding for Section 8 rental vouchers and certificates to very low-income families whose head or spouse is a person with a disability. The Section 811 program allows persons with disabilities to live independently increasing the supply of rental housing with supportive services and related facilities. The program also allows the sponsor to get project rental assistance which can cover any part of the HUD-approved operating costs of the family that is not met from project income. The Section 811 program grants interest-free capital advances for non-profit sponsors to help finance the development of rental housing with supported services for persons with disabilities. The capital advance can finance the construction or rehabilitation of supportive housing. The advance is interest free and does not have to be repaid as long as the housing remains available for low-income persons with disabilities for at least 40 years. The program also provides project rental assistance; this covers the difference between the HUD-approved operating cost per unit and the amount the individual pays--usually 30 percent of adjusted income.      47     Eligible Customers include persons between the ages of 18 and 62 who have disabilities and are very low-income. The term ""disabled family"" may include two persons with disabilities living together and one or more persons with disabilities living with one or more live-in aides. Availability of funds is published in the Federal Register once a year announcing the allocation of 811 funds to HUD Field Offices usually May is the deadline for applications.

Services include assistance with public school placement, enrollment; referrals for social and health services. Tutoring and extended outreach services available in some areas)  The Child Care Program is located at Christ the King Lutheran Church and is made available during the day to families using the IOS shelter. This enables parents to seek employment and housing with the comfort of knowing that their children are in a safe, stable, and nurturing atmosphere. Caring for and about children is one of the most critical steps in stopping the cycle of homelessness. Child care volunteers are needed to carry out this ministry to children, bringing hope and help where often there is none.

Different agencies receive different kinds of funds; some funds allow a choice of activities. Among the assistance provided by some community action programs are weatherization, energy assistance, housing rehabilitation programs, minor home repair, housing counseling, and emergency housing assistance, as well as programs for job training and emergency food.

Services offered by some shelters are sometimes very basic. Other shelters provide several services: counseling, help in finding employment, medical care, and other assistance. Because there are different resources and different needs for the homeless throughout the state, communities approach the problem in various ways. Some emphasize providing shelters, some issue vouchers to pay for persons to stay in inexpensive hotels, and some provide a combination of resources. This chapter lists emergency providers and shelter facilities within the county. The following agencies are knowledgeable about funds available in the community for emergency shelter.

OHCS uses a system of subgrantee agencies to determine eligibility. Once a home is scheduled for weatherization, the applicant is contacted and an energy audit is scheduled. The energy audit determines the appropriate measures to be initiated based on the existing condition of the home and the funds available. Services provided may include: ceiling, wall, and floor insulation; energy related minor home repairs; energy conservation education; infiltration reduction; as well as furnace repair and replacement. Completed work is inspected by the local agency to ensure compliance with program standards.  Oregon Department of Energy Oregon Department of Energy 625 Marion St NE Ste 1 Salem OR 97301-3742 email: energy.in.internet@state.or.us website: www.energy.state.or.us 503.378.4040 or 800.221.8035 All electric and gas utilities in Oregon are required to provide free energy audits for both owneroccupied and renter- occupied buildings. Interested persons should call the utility that provides their heat to arrange an audit. The utility will provide an energy analysis of the home and will make recommendations for cost-effective energy conservation measures. Because companies that provide oil, propane, butane, or kerosene heat are generally too small to provide energy audits, the Oregon Department of Energy (ODOE) State Home Oil Weatherization Program provides energy audits. Persons with these heat sources should contact ODOE for their energy audit. Homes that are heated primarily with wood can obtain free energy audits from their local electric utility. Owners of owner-occupied or renter-occupied homes that use these heating sources can receive 6.5 percent interest rate loans through private lenders. ODOE can provide a list of available lenders. Low and moderate income renters or owners can receive rebates for up to half the cost of the weatherization. The weatherization must be approved by ODOE for this rebate before the work takes place. The maximum rebate amount is $600.  Energy Rated Homes of Oregon (ERHO) A home energy rating is a measure of a home's overall energy efficiency. The energy efficiency is calculated by collecting data on the performance of various systems within the house, such as the air flow into and out of the house, insulation levels, and the mechanical equipment. This information is then analyzed to determine how efficiently the ""systems"" within the house are working and what improvements would make them work better. The house is then assigned an overall rating and the person requesting the rating is given a report listing the suggested improvements and an estimate of how much money can be saved on energy by making the improvements. For more information, please call toll-free 888.986.ERHO (3746), or visit the department's website at www.hcs.state.or.us.  Low Income Energy Assistance Program The Low Income Energy Assistance Program is a federally funded program through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and is not an entitlement program. The Low Income Energy Assistance Program is a program designed to help low income households with home heating costs. Eligible households include any whose income is at or below 60 percent of statewide median income. Poverty levels are based on household income and household size. To be eligible, the households must have documented energy costs. Both homeowner and renter households are eligible. Applications are made through a local Community Action Agency or a local senior service agency.  Low Income Weatherization Programs The Low Income Weatherization Program provides weatherization and energy conservation services at no cost to households below 60 percent of statewide median income. Major funding for the program is from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) with other funds from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, utility companies and the Bonneville Power Administration. The waiting period varies with each local agency depending on the need in the area. Households with  January 2001  19   Weatherization for Owner-Occupied or Renter-Occupied Dwelling Units Owners of owner-occupied or renter-occupied homes may be eligible for weatherization loans and grants from the utility that provides their heat. These programs vary according to the source of funds available to provide this assistance. Unless otherwise specified, these programs are not based upon income. The loan and grant amount for weatherization is generally based upon the cost of providing recommended measures.

Oregon Food Bank The Oregon Food Bank (OFB) is a private, not-for-profit organization dedicated to fighting hunger and its root causes. Food from a variety of sources moves through warehouses to a network of eighteen regional food banks across Oregon. Eighteen are independent charitable organizations.

The Oregon Food Bank Network links a total of 650 hunger-relief agencies in an alliance against hunger. Together, they help more than half a million people each year. In addition to providing food, the Oregon Food Bank supports the members of the network with technical assistance for fundraising, food resource development, food drives, volunteer programs, and more.

They are the major source of housing assistance in Oregon. Local housing authorities give up-to-date information on eligibility requirements. Demand is great and waiting lists are usually long, sometimes requiring extended waiting periods. Housing Authorities offer three main programs: Public housing is owned by housing authorities and is rented to persons earning no more than 50 percent of area median income. The renter pays no more than 30 percent of household income for rent and utilities. The housing authority pays the balance of the rent with federally provided funds. The rules of occupancy are set out by the housing authority in a lease. Section 8 Certificate/Voucher Program in which the eligible renter (income no more than 50 percent of median) finds a housing unit on the open market and asks the landlord to participate in the Section 8 program. The housing authority inspects the unit to insure it is decent and safe. Under the Certificate program, the renter pays no more than 30 percent of household income for rent and utilities. Under the Voucher program, the renter pays no more than 40 percent of household income for rent and utilities. The housing authority pays the balance of the rent from federally provided funds. Rules of occupancy are determined by the landlord in a lease. Housing owned by some housing authorities is available to households earning between 50 percent and 80 percent of median income. This housing is a bit more costly in monthly rents than public housing or Section 8, but it will usually be less expensive than market rate. In addition to these programs, some housing authorities provide emergency rent assistance and/or security deposits to eligible applicants.

The number of parks across Oregon has increased to approximately 1500 with over 63,000 spaces. One thing hasn't changed: Owning a home and renting the land it's placed on still presents some unique challenges. To address these challenges, the 1989 Oregon State Legislature created the Manufactured Dwelling Park Ombudsman Program, or MDPO. The Program has three main purposes, the first of which is to assist park owners and residents in resolving concerns associated with their parks and living situations through informal dispute resolution, and to engage in activities that lead to improvements in manufactured dwelling park relationships. The second is to provide general and technical information about Oregon law as it pertains to manufactured dwelling park communities, and information about resources available that might assist in the voluntary resolution of disputes. The last is to gather information for legislators, the public and others about manufactured dwelling park living. The MDPO Program:  publishes a park directory annually, which includes the park name, address, approximate number of park spaces, and a contact representative  provides copies of the Oregon Landlord Tenant Law upon request ...and can help you:  communicate  clarify the facts in your situation  know and understand your agreement  understand your rights and responsibilities  arrange and facilitate meetings  connect with other appropriate resources Call the number below to request your copy of ORS Chapter 90 Landlord Tenant Law, the Oregon State Park Directory, or for other assistance.

The department administers the Program through local public service agencies (PSAs) which consist of either a housing authority or a community action agency (please see those chapters for contact information). The PSA administers the program in its service area. To qualify, a household consisting of an individual or group of individuals, must be very low income, i.e., cannot have a total gross household income from all sources (not including income from the employment of children under the age of 18) that exceeds 50 percent of the area median income for that household size. A qualifying household is eligible to receive a LIRHF grant covering up to six months' rental housing expenses.  Tenant-Based Rental Assistance This program offers up to two (2) years of rental assistance to qualified very low income tenants and is provided through local Public Service Agencies established through the department's Low Income Rental Housing Assistance (LIRHF) Program. A grant may cover rent payments plus any reasonable refundable security deposit. (Please see the Housing Authority and Community Action chapters for current contact information.)  Emergency Housing Account The Oregon Legislature established this account to assist persons who are homeless or at-risk of becoming homeless, especially those who are over 65 years of age, disabled, farmworkers, or Native Americans. Designated Lead Agencies coordinate the use of these funds through an inclusive community planning process. The funds may pay for emergency shelter and attendant services, housing services designed to transition households from homelessness to permanent housing and economic independence, supportive housing services designed to enable individuals to continue living in their own homes, or programs that provide emergency payment of mortgage, rent, or utilities obligations.
