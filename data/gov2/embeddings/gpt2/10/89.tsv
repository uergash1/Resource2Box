GX000-64-14847491	"VOLCANIC HAZARDS                Hawaiian volcanoes can erupt either at their summits or on their flanks. Young Hawaiian volcanoes, such as Kilauea and Mauna Loa, have summit calderas. A caldera is a crater several miles in diameter that forms as the result of collapse when magma drains from beneath the summit. (Magma is the term used for molten rock that is still beneath the earth's surface; it is called lava when it reaches the surface.) Summit eruptions of Kilauea and Mauna Loa occur within or near their calderas. Flank eruptions usually take place along rift zones, which are highly fractured zones of weakness within the volcano. Rift zones typically extend from the summit of a volcano toward the coastline and may continue for many miles under the sea.                             The Pu'u 'O'o vent began erupting in 1983 on Kilauea's east rift zone, 12 miles from the volcano's summit.  (Photograph provided by the National Park Service)                              Lava flows from the Kupaianaha vent on Kilauea's east rift zone bury a street intersection in Kalapana Gardens subdivision in December 1986.  (Photograph  by J.D. Griggs, USGS)                  Lava flows are the most common of the direct hazards created by Hawaiian eruptions and pose the greatest threat to property. Other hazards include airborne particles of ash, cinder, and fragile strands of volcanic glass called Pele's hair, and corrosive volcanic gases. Explosive eruptions occur much less often than non-explosive eruptions at Hawaiian volcanoes but have been witnessed in historic time. The greatest danger associated with explosive eruptions is their potential to produce pyroclastic surges. These surges are highly destructive, turbulent gas clouds that flow rapidly along the ground carrying hot ash and rock fragments. A lesser volcanic hazard is created by ground movement, which may result in large cracks across roads and other property or cause uneven settling of foundations. Generally, only areas near an active or recently active volcanic vent are affected by large-scale ground cracks and settling.    Lava  Flows    Lava flows are the most common of the direct volcanic hazards in Hawaii. Flows may endanger people's property, livelihood, and peace of mind, but seldom their lives. The fronts of Hawaiian lava flows generally move more slowly than the speed at which people walk, although the lava in the channel behind the front may be flowing much faster. On steep slopes a large flow could travel rapidly enough to endanger persons in its path. During the 1950 eruption of Mauna Loa, a flow front advanced at an average speed of almost 6 mph for over 2 hours.                            A lava flow from the Pu'u 'O'o vent advances down a street in the Royal Gardens subdivision in April 1983.  (Photograph by J.D. Griggs, USGS)                              Lava flows from Pu'u 'O'o had already cut a swath through the Royal Gardens subdivision when this photograph was taken in 1983. Many more flows were to follow. The  subdivision was developed on a steep slope below Kilaeua's east rift zone.  (Photograph  by J.D. Griggs, USGS)                   The speed of a lava flow is determined not only by the steepness of the terrain, but also by the volume of lava that is erupted, because large flows tend to advance more rapidly than do small flows. The distance that a flow travels ultimately depends both on the eruption rate and on the duration of the eruption.    The chemical composition of lava will also affect how rapidly a flow travels. Most Hawaiian lavas are classified as basalts, but within this category there are many types. Some basalts are more fluid and will flow at greater speeds than others. The eruption of Hualalai in 1800-1801 produced lava flows that appear to have been more fluid than flows from similar eruptions on Kilauea and Mauna Loa.                      An active lava pond overlies the Kupaianaha vent.  Lave enters the lava tube system at the far end of the long neck on the pond. (Photograph by E.W. Wolfe,  USGS)          The continuing eruption on Kilauea's east rift zone, which began in 1983, provides a good example of two common, but very different, types of eruptive behavior: rapidly-moving flows produced during brief, high-volume eruptions, and slow-moving flows created by a prolonged low-volume eruption. The Pu'u 'O'o-Kupaianaha eruption on Kilauea's east rift zone, which began in 1983, provides a good example of two common, but very different, types of eruptive behavior: rapidly-moving flows produced during brief, high-volume eruptions, and slow-moving flows created by a prolonged low-volume eruption. The episodic eruptions at the Pu'u 'O'o vent, which was active from June 1983 through June 1986, produced a large volume of lava within a few hours' time. These outbursts were characterized by spectacular lava fountains and lava flows that moved rapidly down the volcano's south flank. The flows entered the Royal Gardens subdivision during 7 episodes and destroyed 16 homes. Each flow was short-lived, however, and stagnated soon after the lava fountains died. None of these flows reached the coastline.    In July 1986, the site of the eruption shifted to the Kupaianaha vent, 1.8 miles to the northeast of Pu'u 'O'o. Kupaianaha erupted almost continuously for over 5 years but at a much lower rate than Pu'u 'O'o. During the first few months of activity at Kupaianaha, the lava flows did not advance more than a mile beyond the vent. But after months of continuous eruption, a lava tube system formed as channeled lava flows gradually formed roofs, enclosing the rivers of lava within. Lava tubes are significant in terms of hazard, since the tubes insulate the lava and allow it to flow much farther before cooling and stopping.                      A Kalapana house is ignited by a lava flow. By 1991, this  community lay buried beneath 50-75 feet of lava.  (Photograph by J.B. Stokes, USGS)             The hazards posed by a prolonged low-volume eruption soon became apparent as lava tubes from Kupaianaha extended toward the Kalapana coast. From November 1986 to October 1991, tube-fed flows repeatedly engulfed residential areas on the coastal plain, destroying 165 houses. Although these flows buried many acres within a single day, there was ample time to evacuate residents. Warnings issued by the Hawaii County Civil Defense allowed people enough time to remove most of their belongings and, in some cases, even to dismantle and move their homes. In 1992, the threat to inhabited areas eased when the eruption shifted to new vents on the southwest flank of the Pu'u 'O'o cone, inside Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.    The chief threat of lava flows to property owners is that the flows may burn structures and bury land. There are other effects, however, that may be almost as disruptive, as the Kalapana community discovered during the repeated inundations of the area by lava. In addition to destroying homes, the flows covered almost 2 miles of the coastal highway. Some residents were forced to move when the highway closure increased their daily commute by nearly 100 miles. Many more residents of the Kalapana area were faced with financial losses as land values dropped and insurance companies refused to issue new homeowners policies.   Even houses that are spared by the lava, however, may be rendered uninhabitable when the roads and utility lines leading to them are destroyed. By 1996, lava flows from Kilauea's eruption had covered 8 miles of the coastal highway, isolating the few structures that remained within the area.     Airborne Lava Fragments    Most volcanic eruptions produce fragments of lava that are airborne for at least a short time before being deposited on the ground. These fragments are called ""tephra,"" and include ash, cinders, and Pele's hair. In Hawaii, tephra is usually ejected by lava fountains and poses a serious hazard only in the immediate vicinity of an erupting vent. Windborne tephra, however, can be disruptive at greater distances. The combination of high lava fountains and strong winds may result in tephra being carried many miles downwind of the eruption site. During lava fountaining episodes at Pu'u 'O'o from 1984 to 1986, the prevailing trade winds deposited most of the tephra in remote areas of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, but small particles reached the town of Naalehu 39 miles away. During the same episodes, Kona winds (from the southwest) occasionally carried tephra to Hilo, 22 miles from the vent.                              The high lava fountains of Pu'u 'O'o produced black clouds of tephra,  cooled bits of lava that collected downwind of the vent to form deposits of cinders and  Pele's hair.                                       A close-up view of tephra, including cinders and Pele's hair (lower left).  (Photograph by J.D. Griggs, USGS)                  The small amount of tephra that fell on inhabited areas was not harmful to most people, but it was a source of irritation to those with respiratory problems and an inconvenience to the many residents with rain-water-catchment systems. Following at least three high-fountaining episodes, Hawaii County Civil Defense recommended that people disconnect and clean their rain-water catchment systems to prevent the particles from washing into their water supply.    Volcanic Gases                     Each episode of high fountaining from Pu'u 'O'o released a tremendous  plume of volcanic gas into the atmosphere.  (Photograph by J.D. Griggs, USGS)          Volcanic gases are emitted during all types of eruptions. Gases also can be released during repose periods by inactive eruptive vents and by fumaroles, vents that may never have produced any lava. The gas plume rising from an active vent on Kilauea consists of about 80 percent water vapor with lesser amounts of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. Small quantities (typically less than 1 percent by volume) of carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrogen fluoride are also present. Extremely small amounts of mercury and other metals have been detected in gases emitted from vents along the east rift zone of Kilauea, but none have been found in concentrations large enough to create a direct health hazard.    Any hazard posed by volcanic gases is greatest immediately downwind from active vents; the concentration of the gases quickly diminishes as the gases mix with air and are carried by winds away from the source. Brief exposure to gases near vents generally does not harm healthy people, but it can endanger those with heart and respiratory ailments, such as chronic asthma.    A common gas produced during Hawaiian eruptions that is potentially harmful to human health is sulfur dioxide. Even small concentrations of sulfur dioxide can combine with water to form sulfuric acid, which can attack skin, cloth, metal, and other materials. When a volcanic plume mixes with atmospheric moisture, acid rain results. Acid rain can significantly retard the growth of cultivated or natural plant life downwind of a vent that degasses over a long period of time.    The sulfur dioxide emitted from Kilauea's summit during typical non-eruptive periods affects a relatively small area downwind of the summit. Similarly, the gases produced during short-lived eruptions affect only a limited area, although their odor may be detected many miles from the vent. The continuous emission of volcanic fumes during Kilauea's Pu'u 'O'o-Kupaianaha eruption, however, resulted in persistent volcanic haze and acid-rain conditions in the South Kona district on the leeward side of the island.                      Broccoli plants damaged by volcanic fumes from Pu'u 'O'o vent, 12 miles away.  (Photograph by J.D. Griggs, USGS)           In late 1987, studies conducted on private water-catchment systems in the South Kona area revealed higher than average acidity in several water samples. Drinking the acidic water does not pose a health hazard, but such water can leach lead from the lead roof flashings, lead-headed nails, and solder connections found in many plumbing systems, resulting in unsafe levels of lead in the drinking water. Extensive testing in 1988 determined that many water-catchment systems on the island, particularly those in the districts adjacent to or downwind of the active vent, contained elevated levels of lead. Residents with rain-catchment systems should contact the Hawaii State Department of Health for information on how to avoid lead contamination of their drinking water.    Volcanic fumes can also damage agricultural crops. During the 1969-74 eruption of Kilauea's Mauna Ulu vent, the South Kona district experienced prolonged periods of eruption-related smog. A study conducted in 1972 by the University of Hawaii's Agricultural Experiment Station at Hilo concluded that the acid rain resulting from the fume was responsible for severe damage to the Kona tomato crop. The Pu'u 'O'o-Kupaianaha eruption of Kilauea caused similar problems for vegetable and flower growers in both the Kona and Puna districts, who reported light-to-moderate crop damage during periods when winds blew the gases over their fields.    Explosive Eruptions   The rare explosive eruptions in Hawaii generally are caused by the interaction of magma and ground water. The magnitude of the resulting steam explosion varies from harmless to catastrophic. Small steam-blast explosions occurred during the 1960 Kapoho eruption when the magma beneath the vents, which were near sea level, encountered saltwater trapped in the surrounding rocks. These steam blasts ejected black clouds of pulverized rock fragments but were of little hazard except to scientists working close to the vents.                     The 1924 explosive eruption of Kilaeua mainly affected the immediate vivinity of Halemaumau crater.  (Photograph courtesy of the Bishop Museum)           A much larger steam-blast eruption occurred at the summit of Kilauea in 1924, when ground water apparently flowed into the heated rocks beneath the Halemaumau vent, which had been erupting nearly continuously for over a century. The explosions continued at intervals for 2 weeks, carpeting the area around Halemaumau crater with large rocks and a thin layer of ash. Boulders weighing several tons were thrown as far as 3,000 feet from the crater. The greatest hazard posed by this type of activity is that it may start abruptly and endanger unwary onlookers. The 1924 eruption claimed one fatality--a man who ventured too close to. the vent between explosions to take photographs and was struck by a rock when the activity suddenly resumed.    The largest explosive eruption on Hawaii within historical time occurred in 1790. This eruption produced pyroclastic surges (turbulent clouds of hot gas and rock fragments) that originated at Kilauea's summit and flowed several miles to the southwest. Pyroclastic surges are extremely dangerous because they move at speeds of 30 to 200 mph, and humans and animals caught in their path are killed by either asphyxiation or heat. A band of Hawaiian warriors traveling from Hilo to the Ka'u district to battle with Chief Kamehameha were overtaken by one of the 1790 pyroclastic surges, and about 80 of them were killed. The 1790 eruption left deposits of rock fragments and ash up to 30 feet thick on the rim of Kilauea's summit caldera.    The thick deposits of ash exposed at many sites on the island indicate that even larger explosive eruptions occurred in prehistoric times and probably originated from Mauna Kea as well as from Kilauea. Explosive eruptions of any size take place infrequently in Hawaii, but the possibility of one occurring in our lifetime should not be totally discounted. Such eruptions are unlikely to begin without some warning. The most widespread hazard from an explosive eruption would be windborne ash, which could damage structures, machinery, and agricultural crops.    Ground Cracks and Settling  Ground cracks and settling are commonly associated with volcanic activity; both generally occur near active or recently active volcanic vents as the result of shallow underground movement of magma. The beginning of an eruption at a new site is preceded by cracking of the ground as magma is forcefully injected into the area. The cracks may be as much as 6 feet wide and over a mile long; typically they form within a period of hours. The Kapoho area on Kilauea's lower east rift zone experienced such ground breakage prior to eruptions in 1924, 1955, and 1960.                             Before the 1960 eruption, a large ground crack opened in the village of Kapoho, which was built on Kilaeua's east rift zone. The village was later completely destroyed by the eruption.

Griggs, USGS)                    Ground settling may occur near a vent at the end of an eruption as magma drains away from beneath the vent area. This process produces both small depressions and large collapse features, such as the pit craters and summit calderas of Kilauea and Mauna Loa. In either case, the subsidence may be gradual or abrupt.    The hazard presented by ground cracks and settling associated with eruptions is usually limited to areas near the active vent and thus is overshadowed by the hazard posed by lava flows. Man-made structures that escape other damage from an eruption, however, can be damaged or destroyed by cracking, tilting, or settling of the ground beneath them. Ground cracks will remain after the eruption is over and can pose a threat to unwary people and animals if the cracks are obscured by heavy vegetation.

When such a large volume of magma is removed from beneath a volcano, the ground subsides or collapses into the emptied space, to form  a huge depression called a caldera .  Some calderas are more than 25 kilometers in diameter and several kilometers deep.       Calderas  are among the most spectacular and active volcanic features on Earth.  Earthquakes, ground cracks, uplift or subsidence of the ground, and     thermal activity   such as hot springs, geysers, and boiling mud pots are common at many calderas.  Such activity is caused by complex interactions among magma stored beneath a caldera, ground water, and the regional buildup of stress in the large plates of the Earth's crust.  Significant changes in the level of activity at some calderas are common; these new activity levels can be intermittent, lasting for months to years, or persistent over decades to centuries.  Although most caldera unrest does not lead to an eruption, the possibility of violent explosive eruptions warrants detailed scientific study and monitoring of some active calderas.      Recently, scientists have recognized volcanic unrest at two calderas in the United States,    Long Valley Caldera in eastern California    and    Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming .    Whether unrest at these calderas simply punctuates long periods of quiet or is the early warning sign of future eruptions is an important but still unanswered question.          From:  Wright and Pierson, 1992, Living With Volcanoes, The  U. S. Geological Survey's Volcano Hazards Program: U. S. Geological Survey Circular 1973       Caldera:  Large depression commonly formed by collapse of the ground following explosive eruption of a large body of stored magma.  Calderas at     Yellowstone   and  Long Valley    are associated with eruption of silicic magma  as pyroclastic flows that covered large areas around and within the caldera.     Kilauea caldera ,    by contrast, is thought to be associated with draining of basaltic magma from beneath Kilauea's summit.  The caldera now filled by Oregon's     Crater Lake    was produced by an eruption that destroyed a volcano the size of Mount St. Helens and sent     volcanic ash  as far east as Nebraska.         From: Christopher G. Newhall and Daniel Dzurisin, 1988,   Historical Unrest at Large Calderas of the World: U. S. Geological Survey Bulletin 1855, 2 volumes         Processes of Caldera Unrest:     Caldera unrest reflects    tectonic ,   magmatic , and   hydrologic  processes.  For the purposes of this discussion, we define   tectonic processes  as those that occur in country rock and dominantly involve changes in mechanical energy with little or no movement of mass into or out of the subcaldera environment.    Magmatic processes   are those that occur within a magma reservoir, and in which thermal energy, magma, and magmatic volatiles can (though need not) move into or out of the subcaldera environment.    Hydrologic processes  are those involving movement of subcaldera ground water or in which the physical or chemical state of subcaldera ground water is changed.  Probably no episode of unrest is purely tectonic, purely magmatic, or purely hydrologic, because tectonic and magmatic changes invariably influence a ground water system and vice versa, and magma (if present) invariably interacts with the local tectonic stress field.                Aniakchak Caldera, Alaska             From: U.S. National Park Service Website,  Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve, Alaska, April 2000        The  Aniakchak Caldera , covering some 10 square miles, is one of the great dry calderas in the world.  Located in the volcanically active Aleutian Mountains, the Aniakchak last erupted in 1911.  The crater includes    lava flows ,     cinder cones , and     explosion pits ,   as well as Surprise Lake, source of the Aniakchak River, which cascades through a 1,500-foot gash in the crater wall.

E. Scott           From: Tilling, 1985, Volcanoes: USGS General Interest Publication       An interesting variation of a     composite volcano   can be seen at     Crater Lake    in Oregon.  From what geologists can interpret of its past, a high volcano -- called  Mount Mazama  -- probably similar in appearance to present-day Mount Rainier was once located at this spot.  Following a series of tremendous explosions about 6,600 years ago, the volcano lost its top.  Enormous volumes of volcanic ash and dust were expelled and swept down the slopes as ash flows and avalanches.  These large-volume explosions rapidly drained the lava beneath the mountain and weakened the upper part.  The top then collapsed to form a large depression, which later filled with water and is now completely occupied by beautiful Crater Lake.  A last gasp of eruptions produced a small     cinder cone   which rises above the water surface as  Wizard Island  in, and near the rim, of the lake.  Depressions such as  Crater Lake , formed by collapse of volcanoes, are known as  calderas . They are usually large, steep-walled, basin-shaped depressions formed by the collapse of a large area over, and around, a volcanic vent or vents.  Calderas range in form and size from roughly circular depressions 1 to 15 miles in diameter to huge elongated depressions as much as 60 miles long.                 Crater Lake Caldera Menu               Hawaiian Calderas            From: Tilling, Heliker, and Wright, 1987, Eruptions of Hawaiian Volcanoes: Past, Present, and Future: USGS General Interest Publication        Hawaiian and other     shield volcanoes   characteristically have a broad summit, indented with a  caldera , a term commonly used for a large depression of volcanic origin.  Most calderas form by collapse because of removal of magma from the volcano's reservoir by eruption and/or intrusion.   Kilauea's   summit caldera is about 2.5 miles long and 2 miles wide.     Mokuaweoweo , the summit caldera complex of  Mauna Loa    is more elongate, measuring about 3 by 1.5 miles.  The terms  crater  or  pit crater  are applied to similar but smaller collapse features. ...       If the     hot-spot theory    is correct, the next volcano in the Hawaiian chain should form east or south of the big Island.  Abundant evidence indicates that such a new volcano exists at   Loihi , a seamount (or submarine peak) located about 20 miles off the south coast of the Big Island.  Loihi rises 10,100 feet above the ocean floor to within 3,100 feet of the water surface.  Recent detailed mapping shows Loihi to be similar in form to Kilauea and Mauna Loa.  Its relatively flat summit apparently contains a  caldera   about 3 miles across; two distinct ridges radiating from the summit are probably rift zones.                 Link to: Hawaiian Volcano Observatory Website for MORE Information                     Krakatau, Indonesia            From: Newhall and Dzurisin, 1988, Historical Unrest at Large Calderas of the World: USGS Bulletin 1855        The     August 1883 eruption of Krakatau    is often cited as    a classic example of caldera formation   by collapse following eruption of large volumes of pumice (Williams, 1941; Williams and McBirney, 1979; Self and Rampino, 1981, 1982; Francis and Self, 1983).  However, other workers have suggested alternate mechanisms for formation of the Krakatau Caldera.  Yokoyama (1981, 1982) concluded that the caldera formed by explosive destruction and reaming of the preeruption edifice, and Camus and Vincent (1983) and Francis (1985) favored an origin by large-scale collapse of the northern part of Krakatau Island (similar to the     volcanic landslide at Mount St. Helens on 18 May 1980 ).  Regrettable, much of the evidence is sumbmarine and inaccessible, but we are impressed by the similarity of Krakatau and other, better-exposed calderas (for example,    Crater Lake )   that are thought to have formed by simple collapse following voluminous pumice eruptions.  The volume of magma erupted in the plinian eruption (9 cubic kilometers) is adequate to explain the caldera without invoking a landslide origin. ...                Indonesian Volcano Menu                 Long Valley Caldera, California            From: Hill, et.al., 1996,   Living With a Restless Caldera -- Long Valley, California: USGS Fact Sheet 108-96        About 760,000 years ago a cataclysmic volcanic eruption in the  area blew out 150 cubic miles of     magma (molten rock)  from  a depth of about 4 miles beneath the Earth's surface.  Rapidly moving     flows of glowing hot ash    covered much of east-central California, and     airborne ash    fell as far east as Nebraska.  The Earth's surface sank more than 1 mile into the space once occupied by the erupted magma, forming a large  volcanic depression that geologists call a     caldera .       Today,  Long Valley  occupies the eastern half of this 10-mile-wide,  20-mile-long caldera. Magma still underlies the caldera and heats underground water. The heated water feeds local  hot springs and natural steam vents and drives three    geothermal power plants ,   producing a combined 40 megawatts of electricity.        The  Long Valley Caldera  is only one part of a large volcanic  system in eastern California that also includes the    Mono-Inyo Craters volcanic chain .   This chain extends from  Mammoth Mountain    at the southwest rim of the caldera northward  25 miles to  Mono Lake .   Eruptions along this chain began 400,000 years ago,  and  Mammoth Mountain  itself was formed by a series of eruptions ending 50,000 years ago.  The volcanic system is still active. Scientists have determined that eruptions occurred in both the  Inyo Craters  and  Mono Craters  parts of  the volcanic chain as recently as 600 years ago and that small eruptions occurred in  Mono Lake   sometime between the mid-1700's and mid-1800's.            From: Bailey, Miller, and Sieh, 1989, Field Guide to Long Valley Caldera and Mono-Inyo Craters Volcanic Chain, Eastern California: GSA Field Trip Guidebook T313        Long Valley      caldera    is located at the western edge of the  Basin and Range Province   straddling the eastern frontal fault escarpment of the  Sierra Nevada , in which it forms a reentrant or offset commonly referred to as the    ""Mammoth embayment"" .    The floor of the caldera ranges in elevation from 2,000 meters in its eastern half, where it is dominated by  Lake Crowley  and sage- and grass-covered  Long Valley ,  to 2,600 meters in its western half, which is hillier and heavily forested.  The caldera walls rise steeply to elevations of 3,000 to 3,500 meters on all sides except the east and southeast, where the floor rises only 150 meters before merging with the  Volcanic Tableland   at 2,300 meters elevation.  The  Mono-Inyo Craters volcanic chain   extends from the western part of Long Valley caldera northward  from  Mammoth Mountain   to  Mono Lake , a distance of 50 kilometers.

Catastrophic eruptions occurred here about 2 million years ago, then 1.2 million years ago, and then 600,000 years ago. The latest eruption spewed out nearly 240 cubic miles of debris.  What is now the park's central portion then collapsed, forming a 28- by 47- mile     caldera  (or basin).    The magmatic heat powering those eruptions still powers the park's famous geysers, hot springs, fumaroles, and mud pots.  The spectacular Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River provides a glimpse of Earth's interior: its waterfalls highlight the boundaries of lava flows and thermal areas.  Rugged mountains flank the park's volcanic plateau, rewarding both eye and spirit.

GX000-98-11729205	U.S. Geological    Survey Fact Sheet 073-97    Version 1.1          Future        Eruptions in California's Long Valley Area—What's Likely?                         Long Valley        Caldera and the Mono-Inyo Craters chain form a large volcanic complex in        eastern California that has had persistent earthquake activity and ground        uplift in recent decades. Volcanoes have been active in the area for millions        of years, and future eruptions are certain to occur. When the next eruption        in the area does occur, it will most likely be small and from a site in        the Mono-Inyo chain.                                                                                           The three            Inyo Craters, part of the Mono-Inyo Craters volcanic chain, stretch            northward across the floor of Long Valley Caldera, a large volcanic            depression in eastern California. During the past 1,000 years there            have been at least 12 volcanic eruptions along the chain, including            those that formed the Inyo Craters and South Deadman Creek Dome (seen            here just beyond the farthest Crater).                    After four strong (magnitude    6) earthquakes rocked the Long Valley area of eastern California in May 1980,    U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists also detected evidence of renewed volcanic    unrest in the region. They discovered that the central part of Long Valley Caldera,    a broad depression formed in a cataclysmic volcanic eruption 760,000 years ago,    was slowly rising. Because such ground deformation and earthquakes are common    precursors of volcanic eruptions, the USGS has continued to closely monitor    the unrest in this region.   It is natural to wonder    when and where the next volcanic eruption might occur in the Long Valley area.    Geologic processes generally proceed at a slow pace, and when viewed on the    scale of a human lifetime, volcanic eruptions and destructive earthquakes happen    rarely. Nevertheless, the long history of volcanic activity in the Long Valley    area indicates that future eruptions will occur.   Geologists studying the    Long Valley Caldera have found that following its creation in the violent eruption    760,000 years ago, clusters of smaller volcanic eruptions have occurred in the    caldera at roughly 200,000-year intervals. About 100,000 years ago, the most    recent of these eruptions formed the Mammoth Knolls, low hills just north of    the Town of Mammoth Lakes.   Mammoth Mountain, a young    volcano on the rim of Long Valley Caldera, was built by numerous eruptions between    220,000 and 50,000 years ago. Volcanoes in the Mono-Inyo Craters volcanic chain,    which extends from just south of Mammoth Mountain to the north shore of Mono    Lake, have erupted often over the past 40,000 years. During the last 5,000 years,    an eruption has broken out somewhere along this chain every 250 to 700 years.    The Inyo Craters and nearby lava domes were formed by a series of small to moderate    eruptions 550 to 600 years ago, and the most recent eruptions along the volcanic    chain took place about 250 years ago at Paoha Island in Mono Lake.   The pattern of volcanic    activity over the past 5,000 years suggests that the next eruption in the Long    Valley area will most likely happen somewhere along the Mono-Inyo volcanic chain.    However, the probability of such an eruption occurring in any given year is    less than 1%. This is comparable to the annual chance of a magnitude 8 earthquake    (like the Great 1906 San Francisco Earthquake) along the San Andreas Fault in    coastal California or of an eruption from one of the more active Cascade Range    volcanoes in the Pacific Northwest, such as Mount Rainier.   As long as increased volcanic    unrest (including earthquake swarms, ground deformation, and CO2 gas emissions)    continues in the Long Valley area, the chances of an eruption occurring in the    near future will remain somewhat increased. However, evidence from large volcanic    areas and calderas worldwide shows that unrest, such as the current activity    in eastern California, can persist for decades or even centuries without leading    to an eruption. Nevertheless, recent eruptions at Rabaul Caldera in Papua New    Guinea (1994) and the Izu volcanic complex in Japan (1989) following short periods    of unrest emphasize the need to closely monitor restless calderas.   When an eruption does break    out in the Long Valley area, its impact will depend on the location, size, and    type of eruption, as well as the wind direction. Also, an eruption during the    winter months could melt heavy snow packs, generating mudflows and locally destructive    flooding.   Most likely, the next eruption    will be small and similar to  previous eruptions along    the Mono-Inyo volcanic chain during the past 5,000 years . Such eruptions    typically begin with a series of steam-blast explosions as rising molten rock    (magma) encounters and vaporizes underground water near the Earth's surface.    These blasts can throw large blocks of rock and smaller fragments hundreds of    feet into the air, leaving deep, circular pits like the Inyo Craters.   If magma reaches the surface,    gases trapped within it can escape explosively, hurling volcanic ash (tiny fragments    of the solidifying magma) as high as 6 miles or more. Airborne volcanic ash    can be carried hundreds of miles downwind, and the amount and size of falling    ash decrease with distance from the eruption site. Thin accumulations of ash    pose little threat to life or property, especially in areas where the roofs    of most buildings are constructed to withstand heavy snow loads. However, even    a light dusting of fine volcanic ash can close roads and seriously disrupt communications    and utilities for weeks or months after an eruption.                                                                       The eruptions            that led to the creation of the 600-year-old South Deadman Creek Dome            covered the area of what is now the Town of Mammoth Lakes with a layer            of volcanic ash about 1 inch thick. During these eruptions, the wind            first blew toward the northeast (tan) and later toward the southwest            (pink), spreading volcanic ash in the pattern shown on the map. These            eruptions also produced fiery flows of hot ash (pyroclastic flows).            Depending on the wind direction and the location of an eruption site,            future eruptions in the Long Valley area could spread volcanic ash over            the communities of Mammoth Lakes, June Lake, or Lee Vining (see also             eruption chart ). Pyroclastic flows incicated            by yellow and orange area.                          Explosive volcanic eruptions    may also produce fiery flows of hot ash (pyroclastic flows) that can sweep over    the ground at speeds greater than 100 miles an hour, devastating everything    in their paths. In the past 5,000 years, eruptions from several sites along    the Mono-Inyo chain have produced narrow, tongue-like pyroclastic flows that    extended more than 5 miles. Fortunately, the main population centers in the    Long Valley area are far enough from probable eruption sites that they are unlikely    to be directly impacted by future pyroclastic flows.   Less violent eruptions have    also taken place in the Long Valley area. These eruptions typically began with    mild explosions that formed relatively small volcanic cones less than 1,000    feet in diameter and then produced hot, fluid lava flows that extended a few    miles. Eruptions of this type about 5,000 years ago created the Red Cones, just    south of Mammoth Mountain. Flows of fluid lava were also erupted from sites    near the base of Mammoth Mountain between 400,000 and 60,000 years ago. Such    flows are highly destructive to property, but seldom endanger people because    lava flows rarely move faster than a brisk walk.   Although the chance of a    volcanic eruption in any given year is small, future eruptions will occur in    the Long Valley area. Because volcanic unrest can escalate to an eruption in    a few weeks or less, USGS scientists are closely monitoring activity in this    region. To be able to provide the public with reliable and timely warnings before    an eruption, the USGS has joined local and State authorities in developing procedures    for responding to changing levels of volcanic unrest in the Long Valley area.    The ongoing work of the USGS Volcano Hazards Program in this and other volcanic    regions of the United States helps to better protect people's lives and property    from volcano hazards.               David P.

It is a Tertiary to Quaternary  edifice exhibiting at least eight vents which produced mafic to felsic rocks.  Numerous feeder dikes to older units are exposed by deep erosion.  The volcano is dominated by porphyritic andesite to rhyodacite lava and pyroclastic breccias, although several Quaternary basalt flows and breccias occur on the periphery.  Plagioclase porphyritic andesite lava flows and breccia (0.5 to 1.0 million years ago) are the most voluminous rocks, with a maximum of 1,200 meters of total flow thickness.  The most recent volcanic activity occurred 2,350 years ago and produced three distinct units known as the Bridge River Assemblage.  ...

After Mount Rainier, it is the most heavily  glaciated of the Cascade volcanoes: the volume of snow and ice on  Mount Baker (about 1.8 cubic kilometers; 0.43 cubic miles)  is greater than that of all  the other Cascades volcanoes (except Rainier) combined.  Isolated  ridges of lava and hydrothermally altered rock, especially in the  area of Sherman Crater, are exposed between glaciers on the upper  flanks of the volcano: the lower flanks are steep and heavily  vegetated.  The volcano rests on a foundation of non-volcanic rocks  in a region that is largely non-volcanic in origin.   -- Gardner, et.al., 1995          Historical Activity        Historical activity at Mount Baker includes several  explosions during the mid-19th century, which were witnessed from  the Bellingham area, and since the late 1950s, numerous small- volume debris avalanches.  In 1975, increased fumarolic activity  in the Sherman Crater area caused concern that an eruption might  be imminent.  Additional monitoring equipment was installed and  several geophysical surveys were conducted to try to detect the  movement of magma.  The level of Baker Lake was lowered and people  were restricted from the area due to concerns that an eruption- induced debris avalanche or debris flow might enter Baker Lake and  displace enough water to either cause a wave to overtop the Upper  Baker Dam or cause complete failure of the dam.  However, few  anomalies other than the increased heat flow were recorded during  the geophysical surveys nor were any other precursory activities  observed to indicate that magma was moving up into the volcano.  An  increased level of fumarolic activity has continued at Mount Baker  from 1975 to the present, but there are no other changes that  suggest that magma movement is involved.   -- Gardner, et.al., 1995                 Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates            1995 Hazards Assessment Report    -- Gardner, et.al., 1995, OFR95-498             Mount Baker -- Living With An Active Volcano    -- Scott, et.al., 2000, USGS FS-059-00               [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                                .

It is not prominently visible from any major population center, and so its attractions, as well as its hazards, tend to be over-looked.   Yet since the end of the last ice age, Glacier Peak has produced some of the largest and most explosive eruptions in the state.  During this time period,  Glacier Peak has erupted multiple times during at least six separate episodes, most recently about 300 years ago.     -- Mastin and Waitt, 2000          Eruptive History      Glacier Peak is a small Cascade Range stratovolcano. Although its summit reaches greater then 3,000 meters above the surrounding valleys, the main cone of Glacier Peak is perched on a high ridge, and the volcanic pile is no more than 500-1,000 meters thick.  More than a dozen glaciers occur on the flanks of the volcano, and unconsolidated pyroclastic deposits over 12,000 years old have been largely removed by glaciation. Lava flows locally cap ridges to the northeast of the volcano.  While small basaltic flows and cones are found at several points around the flanks of Glacier Peak, the main edifice is largely dacite and andesite.  Lava flows extend no more than a few kilometers from the summit.  Glacier Peak is probably best known as the source of voluminous tephra eruptions dated to 11,250 years BP.  Two tephra layers produced at this time have been identified as far as 800-1,000 kilometers to the east, and are widely used by geologists, anthropologists, and paleoecologists to date late Pleistocene sediments.  Also at this time, an extensive valley fill of pumiceous lahars and alluvium was deposited downriver to the west, blocking valleys and affecting drainages as far as 80 kilometers from the volcano. After these major eruptions, Glacier Peak apparently was dormant for 6,000 years.  The volcano rewoke 5,500-5,100 years B.P. and intermittent eruptions of pyroclastic flows and tephra have occurred since that time.  perhaps the most dramatic geologic features at Glacier Peak are enormous and relatively undissected late Pleistocene and Holocene pyroclastic fans which almost completely fill valleys on the eastern and western flanks of the volcano.   -- Beget, 1994, IN: Wood and Kienle           18th Century      Indian legends and a thin tephra fall preserved east of the volcano may record a recent eruption in the 18th century, although no eruptive activity has occurred during at least the last 150 years.     -- Beget, 1994, IN: Wood and Kienle          Hot Springs and Dacite Domes      Three hot springs surround the volcano, and warm ground and snow-free areas occur near fresh-appearing dacite domes which form subsidiary summits both north and south of the ice-covered main summit.   -- Beget, 1994, IN: Wood and Kienle                  Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates            1995 Hazards Assessment Report    -- Waitt, et.al., 1995, OFR95-499             Glacier Peak -- History and Hazards of a Cascade Volcano    -- Mastin and Waitt, 2000, USGS FS-058-00                [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                                .

The Mountain is, however, the most dangerous volcano in the range, owing to the large population and to the huge area and volume of ice and snow on its flanks that could theoretically melt to generate debris flows during cataclysmic eruptions.     -- Swanson, et.al., 1989          Mount Rainier Dominates the Landscape      Mount Rainier volcano dominates the landscape of a large part of western Washington.  It stands nearly 3 miles higher than the lowlands to the west and 1.5 miles higher than the surrounding mountains.  The base of the volcano spreads over an area of about 100 square miles, and lava flows that radiate from the base of the cone extend to distances of as much as 9 miles.  The flanks of Mount Rainier are drained by five major rivers and their tributaries.  Clockwise from the northwest the major rivers are the Carbon, White, Cowlitz, Nisqually, and Puyallup.  Each river flows westerly through the Cascade Range and, with the exception of the Cowlitz, empties into Puget Sound near Tacoma, Washington.  The Cowlitz joins the Columbia River in the southwestern part of the State to flow to the Pacific Ocean.   -- Crandell, 1971          Eruptive Background       Mount Rainier is an active volcano that first erupted about half a million  years ago.  Because of Rainier's great height (14,410 feet above sea level)  and northerly location, glaciers have cut deeply into its lavas, making it  appear deceptively older than it actually is.  Mount Rainier is known to  have erupted as recently as in the 1840s, and large eruptions took place as  recently as about 1,000 and 2,300 years ago.   Mount Rainier and other similar volcanoes in the Cascade Range, such as  Mount Adams and Mount Baker, erupt much less frequently than the more  familiar Hawaiian volcanoes, but their eruptions are vastly more destructive.   Hot lava and rock debris from Rainier's eruptions have melted snow  and glacier ice and triggered debris flows (mudflows) - with a consistency  of churning wet concrete - that have swept down all of the river valleys that  head on the volcano.  Debris flows have also formed by collapse of unstable  parts of the volcano without accompanying eruptions.  Some debris flows have  traveled as far as the present margin of Puget Sound, and much of the lowland  to the east of Tacoma and the south of Seattle is formed of pre-historic  debris from Mount Rainier    -- Sisson, 1995                  Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates            Revised 1998 Hazards Assessment Report    -- Hoblitt, et.al., 1998, OFR98-428            History and Hazards of Mount Rainier, Washington    -- Sisson, 1995, USGS OFR95-642             Mount Rainier -- Living With Perilous Beauty    -- Scott, et.al., 1998, USGS FS-065-97                [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                               .

The nearby Indian Heaven and  Simcoe Mountains volcanic fields lie west and  southeast, respectively, of the 1250 square kilometers (500 square miles)  Adams field. Even though Mount Adams has  been less active during the past few thousand years  than neighboring Mounts St. Helens, Rainier, and Hood,  it assuredly will erupt again.  Future eruptions will  probably occur more frequently from vents on the  summit and upper flanks of Mount Adams than from vents  scattered in the volcanic fields beyond.  Large  landslides and lahars that need not be related to  eruptions probably pose the most destructive, far-reaching hazard of Mount Adams.     -- Scott, et.al., 1995           Eruptive History      Mount Adams stands astride the Cascade Crest some 50 kilometers due east of Mount St. Helens.  The towering stratovolcano is marked by a dozen glaciers, most of which are fed radially from its summit icecap.  In the High Cascades, Mount Adams is second in eruptive volume only to Mount Shasta, and it far surpasses its loftier neighbor Mount Rainier (which is perched on a pedestal of Miocene granodiorite).  Adams's main cone exceeds 200 cubic kilometers, and at least half as much more was eroded during late Pleistocene time form earlier high-standing components of the compound edifice: peripheral basalt adds another 70 cubic kilometers or so.  Nearly all the high cone above 2,300 meters in elevation was constructed during latest Pleistocene time, probably between 20 and 10 thousand years ago, explaining the abundance of late-glacial till and the scarcity of older till.    -- Hildreth, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle          Recent Volcanic Activity      Approximately 1,000 years ago: four tephra falls and perhaps small lava flows from two vents  on upper flanks.   -- Scott, et.al., 1995          Debris Avalanches and Lahars      During the past 10,000 years, the steep upper slopes  of Mount Adams have produced several notable debris  avalanches. In 1921, about 4 million cubic  meters (5 million cubic yards) of altered rock fell  from the head of Avalanche Glacier on the southwest  flank of the volcano and traveled almost 6 kilometers (4 miles)  down Salt Creek valley.  The debris avalanche  contained or acquired sufficient water to partly  transform into small lahars.  Ancient debris  avalanches of much larger size have also occurred at  Mount Adams, and these formed lahars that traveled  far down the White Salmon and other valleys.  An  avalanche of roughly 70 million cubic meters (90  million cubic yards) of debris initiated the largest  of these lahars about 6000 years ago.  This lahar  inundated the Trout Lake lowland and continued down  the valley of the White Salmon River at least as far  as Husum, more than 55 kilometers (35 miles) from Mount Adams.   The lahar deposit left in the lowland varies from 1 to  20 meters (3 to 65 feet) thick;  it is clearly visible today  as a sediment layer in the banks of the White Salmon  River and as isolated blocks (some more than 5 meters (16  feet) in diameter) that protrude from fields and meadows.   -- Scott, et.al., 1995                 Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates            1995 Hazards Assessment Report    -- Scott, et.al., 1995, OFR95-492               [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                             .

Most were probably active for relatively short times ranging  from days to tens of years.  Unlike Mount Adams, which  has erupted repeatedly for hundreds of thousands of  years, these vents typically did not erupt more than  once.  Rather, each erupting vent built a separate,  small volcano, and over time a field of numerous  overlapping volcanoes was created.   Clusters of these vents define the Mount Adams,  Indian Heaven, and Simcoe Mountains volcanic fields.   In addition, the Goat Rocks volcanic center  lies 30 kilometers (18 miles) north of Mount Adams.   The Mount Adams and Indian Heaven fields  have been the most active recently; the Simcoe field  and the Goat Rocks center have not erupted for  hundreds of thousands of years.   -- Scott, et.al., 1995          About 60 Eruptive Centers      The Indian Heaven volcanic field, midway between Mount St. Helens and Mount Adams, is a Quaternary center, chiefly of basalt.

Geologists call Mount St. Helens a composite  volcano (or stratovolcano), a term for steep-sided, often  symmetrical cones constructed of alternating  layers of lava flows, ash, and  other volcanic debris. Composite volcanoes tend to erupt explosively  and pose considerable danger to nearby  life and property. In contrast, the  gently sloping shield volcanoes,  such as those in Hawaii, typically erupt  nonexplosively, producing fluid lavas that  can flow great distances from the  active vents. Although Hawaiian-type  eruptions may destroy property, they rarely cause death or injury.  Before 1980, snow-capped, gracefully  symmetrical Mount St. Helens  was known as the ""Fujiyama of America.""   Mount St. Helens, other active Cascade  volcanoes, and those of Alaska  comprise the North American segment   of the circum-Pacific ""Ring of Fire,""  a notorious zone that produces frequent,  often destructive, earthquake and  volcanic activity.    -- Tilling, et.al., 1990           Baron St. Helens      Some Indians of the Pacific Northwest  variously called Mount St. Helens  ""Louwala-Clough,"" or ""smoking   mountain."" The modern name,  Mount St. Helens, was given to the  volcanic peak in 1792 by Captain George   Vancouver of the British Royal Navy,  a seafarer and explorer. He named it in honor of a fellow countryman,   Alleyne Fitzherbert, who held the  title Baron St. Helens and who was at the time the British Ambassador to   Spain. Vancouver also named  three other volcanoes in the Cascades -  Mounts Baker, Hood, and Rainier - for British naval officers.    -- Tilling, et.al., 1990           Background      Ancestral Mount St. Helens began to grow before the  last major glaciation of the Ice Age had ended about   10,000 years ago. The oldest ash deposits were erupted at  least 40,000 years ago onto an eroded surface of   still older volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Intermittent volcanism  continued after the glaciers disappeared, and   nine main pulses of pre-1980 volcanic activity have been recognized.  These pulses lasted from about 5,000   years to less than 100 years each and were separated by  dormant intervals of about 15,000 years to only 200   years. A forerunner of Spirit Lake was born about  3,500 years ago, or possibly earlier, when eruption debris   formed a natural dam across the valley of the  North Fork of the Toutle River. The most recent of the pre-1980   eruptive activity began in A.D. 1800 with an  explosive eruption, followed by several additional minor explosions   and extrusions of lava, and ended with the formation of the Goat Rocks lava dome by 1857.   Mount St. Helens is the youngest of the major  Cascade volcanoes, in the sense that its visible cone was entirely   formed during the past 2,200 years,  well after the melting of the last of the Ice Age glaciers about 10,000 years   ago. Mount St. Helens' smooth, symmetrical  slopes are little affected by erosion as compared with its older,   more glacially scarred neighbors - Mount Rainier and  Mount Adams in Washington, and Mount Hood in Oregon.   The local Indians and early settlers in the then  sparsely populated region witnessed the occasional violent   outbursts of Mount St. Helens. The volcano was  particularly restless in the mid-19th century, when it was   intermittently active for at least a 26-year  span from 1831 to 1857. Some scientists suspect that Mount St.   Helens also was active sporadically during the  three decades before 1831, including a major explosive eruption   in 1800. Although minor steam explosions may  have occurred in 1898, 1903, and 1921, the mountain gave little   or no evidence of being a volcanic hazard for  more than a century after 1857. Consequently, the majority of   20th-century residents and visitors thought of  Mount St. Helens not as a menace, but as a serene, beautiful   mountain playground teeming with wildlife and  available for leisure activities throughout the year. At the base of   the volcano's northern flank, Spirit Lake,  with its clear, refreshing water and wooded shores, was especially   popular as a recreational area for hiking,  camping, fishing, swimming and boating.  The tranquility of the Mount St. Helens region  was shattered in the spring of 1980, however, when the volcano   stirred from its long repose, shook, swelled,  and exploded back to life.    -- Tilling, et.al., 1990           Mount St. Helens Awakens      The 1980 eruptions of Mount St. Helens in southwestern Washington marked the re-awakening of a relatively young (40,000 years) volcano that had been dormant since 1857.  Frequent dacitic eruptions during the previous 2,500 years had produced pyroclastic flows, ash falls, debris flows, lava domes, and lava flows of andesite and basalt.  Pyroclastic flows and lahars accompanied most eruptive periods and were largely responsible for forming fans around the base of the volcano, some of which dammed the North Fork Toutle River to form Spirit Lake between 3,300 and 4,000 years ago.  The magnitudes of the 1980 eruptions were not exceptional by worldwide historical standards; however, they were the first volcanic eruptions in the conterminous United States since 1914 (Lassen Peak) and focused national attention on events leading up to the climactic eruption of May 18, 1980.   That eruption led to exceptional opportunities for scientific observations, data collection, and the study of infrequent and often inaccessible geologic events and processes.   -- Simon, 1999              May 18, 1980      The catastrophic eruption on May 18, 1980, was preceded by 2 months of intense activity that included more than 10,000 earthquakes, hundreds of small phreatic (steam-blast) explosions,  and the outward growth of the volcano's entire north flank by more than 80 meters.  A magnitude 5.1 earthquake struck beneath the volcano at 8:32 a.m. on May 18, setting in motion the devastating eruption. Within seconds of the earthquake, the volcano's bulging north flank slid away in the largest landslide in recorded history, triggering a destructive, lethal lateral blast of hot gas, steam, and rock debris that swept across the landscape as fast as 1,100 kilometers per hour.  Temperatures within the blast reached as high as 300 degrees Celsius.  Snow and ice on the volcano melted, forming torrents of water and rock debris that swept down river valleys leading from the volcano.  Within minutes, a massive plume of ash thrust 19 kilometers into the sky, where the prevailing wind carried about 490 tons of ash across 57,000 square kilometers of the Western United States.   -- Brantley, 1994            Following May 18, 1980      Following the most recent major eruption, on  May 18, 1980, there were 5 smaller explosive eruptions over a  period of 5 months. Thereafter, a series of 16 dome-building  eruptions through October 1986 constructed the new, 270-meter- (-880- feet) high, lava dome in the crater formed by the May 18, 1980  eruption.   -- Wolfe and Pierson, 1995                   Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates            Current Volcanic Activity -- Monthly Updates            1995 Hazards Assessment Report    -- Wolfe and Pierson, 1995, OFR95-497            Mount St. Helens -- From the 1980 Eruption to 2000    -- Brantley and Myers, 2000, USGS Fact Sheet 036-00              [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                               Oregon         .

It is the highest peak in the state  (3,426 meters - 11,239 feet) and one of the most often climbed peaks in the Pacific Northwest.  In summer, Mount Hood's timberline wilderness is a pastoral garden for backpackers.  In winter and spring the volcano's slopes host several downhill ski runs and cross-country tracks.   -- Sherrod, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle          Eruptive History       Mount Hood is also  one of the major volcanoes of the Cascade Range, having erupted repeatedly for hundreds of thousands of  years, most recently during two episodes in the past  1,500 years. The last episode ended shortly before the  arrival of Lewis and Clark in 1805. When Mount Hood  erupts again, it will severely affect areas on its  flanks and far downstream in the major river valleys  that head on the volcano. Volcanic ash may fall on  areas up to several hundred kilometers downwind.   -- Scott, et.al., 1997          Collapse of Lava Domes      Eruptive activity at Mount Hood during the  past 30,000 years has been dominated by growth and  collapse of lava domes.  The last two episodes of  eruptive activity occurred 1,500 and 200 years ago.  Repeated collapse of lava domes extruded near the site  of Crater Rock, Mount Hood's youngest lava dome,  generated pyroclastic flows and lahars and built much  of the broad smooth fan on the south and southwest  flank of the volcano.   -- Scott, et.al., 1997          Quicksand River      In 1805, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark  named a river on the south side of the                 Columbia River gorge the ""Quicksand River.""  Their description of a wide, shallow river                 with a bed ""formed entirely of quicksand,""  bears little resemblance to the narrow,                 moderately deep river we call today  the Sandy River. What happened? The answer lay                 50 miles away at Mount Hood.  An eruption in the 1790's caused a tremendous amount                 of volcanic rock and sand to enter the Sandy River drainage. That sediment was still                 being flushed downstream when Lewis and Clark saw and named the river. Since 1806,                 the river has removed the excess sediment from its channel. The Toutle River in                 southwest Washington was similarly affected by the 1980 eruptions of Mount St.                 Helens.   -- Gardner, et.al., 2000                  Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates            1997 Hazards Assessment Report     -- Scott, et.al., 1997, OFR97-89        Geological History and Field Trip Guidebook     -- Scott, et.al., 1997, OFR97-263        Mount Hood -- History and Hazards of Oregon's Most Recently Active Volcano    -- Gardner, et.al., 2000, FS060-00               [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                        .

Mount Jefferson (one of thirteen major volcanic centers in the Cascade Range) has erupted repeatedly for hundreds of thousands of years, with its last eruptive episode during the last major glaciation which culminated about 15,000 years ago. Geologic evidence shows that Mount Jefferson is capable of large explosive eruptions. The largest such eruption occurred between 35,000 and 100,000 years ago, and caused ash to fall as far away as the present-day town of Arco in southeast Idaho. Although there has not been an eruption at Mount Jefferson for some time, experience at explosive volcanoes elsewhere suggests that Mount Jefferson cannot be regarded as extinct. If Mount Jefferson erupts again, areas close to the eruptive vent will be severely affected, and even areas tens of kilometers (tens of miles) downstream along river valleys or hundreds of kilometers (hundreds of miles) downwind may be at risk.    -- Walder, et.al., 1999          Upper Cone      Most of the cone (upper 1,000 meters) of Mount Jefferson is less than 100,000 years old, with much of it younger than the explosive event described above. The upper cone is composed largely of dacite lava flows and domes, many of which appear to have been emplaced when glaciers on the volcano were much large than at present.  It is likely that during growth of the domes, material was shed off to form pyroclastic flows and lahars, but if so, that record has been largely removed by glacial erosion.   -- Walder, et.al., 1999           Youngest Lava Flows      The youngest lava flows in the Mount Jefferson area are basaltic lava flows from Forked Butte and an unnamed butte south of Bear Butte.  Both of these flows postdate the large eruption of Mount Mazama (Crater Lake) of about 7,600 years.   -- Walder, et.al., 1999           Localized Floods and Lahars      During the last few centuries, several small lakes were formed on the flanks of Mount Jefferson when small tributary valleys became dammed by glacial moraines (ridges of sediment left behind by glaciers).  Several of these moraines have breached during the 20th century, producing local floods and small lahars.   -- Walder, et.al., 1999                   Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates            1999 Hazards Assessment Report    -- Walder, et.al., 1999, OFR99-24              [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                             .

The cone lacks a high-level conduit-filling plug, however, unlike other shield volcanoes such as nearby  Mount Washington south of Santiam Pass.  Three Fingered Jack is undated by radiometric methods, but its age probably lies between 0.50 and 0.25 million years ago (500,000 and 250,000 years ago),  as inferred from its erosional state compared to other shield volcanoes in the High Cascades.   -- Sherrod, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle               Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates               [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                                            .

Mafic ash accumulated on the flanks of the shield and has been preserved as thick sections of palagonitic tuff on the southwest and northeast sides of the summit cone.  The volcano was intruded by a micronorite plug which now forms the central pinnacle, 0.4 kilometers in diameter.   Although no isotopic ages are available, all of the Mount Washington lavas and the underlying basalt appear to be of normal paleomagnetic polarity; the age of Mount Washington is probably no more than a few 100,000 years, similar to that of other central High Cascade stratovolcanoes. During the late Pleistocene, cirques were excavated into the flanks of the summit cone by valley glaciers which extended more than 12 kilometers east and west.      -- Taylor, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle          Recent Spatter Cones      The is no evidence of recent reactivation of Mount Washington volcanism, but a series of aligned small basaltic andesite spatter cones erupted on the northeast flank approximately 1,330 years ago (carbon-14).   -- Taylor, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle                Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates                [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                                         .

This type of activity has built shield volcanoes  typically 5-15 kilometers in diameter and several hundred meters to  more than 1000 meters high.  Many have summit cinder cones.   Belknap in central Oregon  is the youngest such shield volcano in the Cascades and has lava flows  as young as 1,400 years.   -- Hoblitt, et.al., 1987           Eruptive History      The Belknap shield volcano  and its distal lava tongues cover 98 square kilometers of the crest of the central High Cascades in Oregon.  Prior to 2,900 years before present, the first eruptive phase distributed basaltic cinders and ash over a broad area to the northeast and southeast, while basaltic lavas moved 10 kilometers eastward from a growing shield.  A second phase, 2,883 years before present (carbon-14), produced an adventive shield of basaltic andesite on the east flank, known as ""Little Belknap"".  The third phase was responsible for the bulk of modern Belknap volcano.  It was constructed by effusion of basaltic andesite lavas from the central vent (Belknap Crater), 1,495 years before present (carbon-14), and from a vent 2 kilometers to the south (South Belknap cone), 1,775 years before present (carbon-14).  The final eruptions from the northeast base of Belknap Crater sent lavas 15 kilometers westward into the valley of the McKenzie River.   -- Taylor, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle                Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates               [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                                   .

South Sister, Middle Sister, and Broken Top, major composite volcanoes clustered near the center of the region, have erupted repeatedly over tens of thousands of years and may erupt explosively in the future. In contrast, mafic volcanoes, which range from small cinder cones to large shield volcanoes like North Sister and Belknap Crater, are typically short-lived (weeks to centuries) and erupt less explosively than do composite volcanoes. Hundreds of mafic volcanoes scattered through the Three Sisters region are part of a much longer zone along the High Cascades of Oregon in which birth of new mafic volcanoes is possible.   -- Scott, et.al., 2001             The Three Sisters Volcanoes       The Three Sisters area contains 5 large cones of Quaternary age--  North Sister,  Middle Sister,  South Sister,  Broken Top, and  Mount Bachelor.    North Sister and Broken Top  are deeply dissected and probably have been inactive  for at least 100,000 years.   Middle Sister is younger than North Sister,  and was active in late  Pleistocene but not postglacial time.   South Sister is the least dissected; its basaltic andesite  summit cone has a well preserved crater.    Most of South Sister predates late  Wisconsin glaciation and is therefore older than 25,000 years;  however, eruptions of rhyolite from flank vents  have occurred as recently as 2,000 years ago.    -- Hoblitt, et.al., 1987             Latest South Sister Activity      The latest eruptions on South Sister, which occurred in two closely spaced episodes about 2,000 years ago, illustrate a relatively modest scale of eruptive activity.  Initial explosive eruptions produced small pyroclastic flows and tephra fallout from several aligned vents low on the south flank.  Tephra fallout deposits more than 2 meters (7 feet) thick, composed of pumice, rock fragments, and ash, blanketed areas within 2 kilometers (1 mile) downwind of vents;  at 13 kilometers (8 miles) about 10 centimeters (4 inches) fell.  Less than one centimeter (0.5 inch) of ash fell at least as far as 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the vents (at Cultus Lake) and east of the vents (at Bend).  Following tephra eruptions, lava emerged from two vent areas, forming a large lava flow, Rock Mesa, and several small lava domes.  Decades to a few centuries later, a similar eruptive sequence occurred along a zone of vents that  extended from just north of Sparks Lake to high on the southeast flank of South Sister, as well as along a shorter zone on  the north flank near Carver Lake.   -- Scott, et.al., 2001                Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates               1999 Hazards Assessment Report     -- Scott, et.al., 2001, OFR99-437               Information Statement, May 8, 2001        Ground Uplift Near South Sister Volcano, Central Oregon Cascade Range         West Uplift - InSAR Monitoring                   [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                                               .

Pleistocene eruptions of basaltic andesite lava produced a broad shield with a core of oxidized agglomerate invaded by dikes and sills.  Subordinate silicic magmas were erupted intermittently; andesite, dacite, and rhyodacite lavas, intrusives, and pyroclastic flow deposits are associated with the predominant mafic lavas from the lower flanks to the summit of the volcano.  The central crater of Broken Top was enlarged to a diameter of 0.8 kilometers, probably by subsidence.  The resulting depression was filled by thick flows of basaltic andesite and eventually the summit cone was buried beneath a shroud of thin, vesicular lavas.  After the central conduit had congealed to a plug of micronorite, the core of the volcano was subjected to hydrothermal alteration. Glacial cirques have been carved into three sides of the mountain, revealing internal structure.  Holocene eruptive activity on the flanks has produced  basaltic cones, flows, and ash deposits interbedded with Neoglacial moraines and outwash.   -- Taylor, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle                Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates                [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                                           .

It has been built by thousands of eruptions, beginning about  600,000 years ago. At least 25 vents on the flanks and summit have  been active during several eruptive episodes of the past 10,000 years.  The most recent eruption 1,300 years ago produced the Big Obsidian  Flow. Thus, the volcano's long history and recent activity indicate  that Newberry will erupt in the future.   -- Sherrod, et.al., 1997           Newberry Caldera, Paulina Peak, Paulina and East Lakes      Newberry Volcano, centered about 20 miles southeast of Bend, Oregon, is among the largest Quaternary volcanoes in thee conterminous United States.  It covers and area in excess of 500 square miles, and lavas from it extend northward many tens of miles beyond the volcano.  The highest point on the volcano, Paulina Peak with an elevation of 7,984 feet, is about 4,000 feet higher than the terrain surrounding the volcano.  The  gently sloping flanks, embellished by more than 400 cinder cones, consist of basalt and basaltic andesite flows, andesitic to rhyolitic ash-flow and air-fall tuffs and other types of pyroclastic deposits, dacite to rhyolite domes and flows, and alluvial sediments produced during periods of erosion of the volcano.  At Newberry's summit is a 4- to 5-mile-wide caldera that contains scenic Paulina and East Lakes. The caldera has been the site of numerous Holocene eruptions, mostly of rhyolitic composition, that occurred as recently as 1,400 years ago. ... Newberry lies 40 miles east of the crest of the Cascade Range ...   -- MacLeod, 1981            Newberry Basaltic Eruptions      Basaltic eruptions are well known from observations elsewhere, such  as at Hawaii, where spectacular fountains of spatter and cinders are  associated with lava flows. At Newberry, basaltic eruptions have occurred  repeatedly on the volcano's flanks and in the caldera. Typical products  of a basaltic eruption are the 7,000-yr-old cinder cone of Lava Butte  and its surrounding lava flows, located 10 kilometers (6 miles) south of Bend.  Basaltic eruptions commonly begin with lava fountains that  hurl cinders or spatter as far as 1 kilometers (0.6 miles) from the vent. Ejecta  are thrown aloft for hundreds to a few thousand meters. Large fragments  are expelled from the vent along ballistic trajectories, like artillery  shells. Smaller particles are carried by wind and convective updrafts. The  resulting deposits may be many meters thick near the vent and build  a steep-sided cinder cone, but they generally thin to a few millimeters  within 10 kilometers (6 miles) distance downwind. The chief hazard from ballistic  ejection is direct impact. Some spatter will be hot upon impact and  likely will start forest fires.   -- Sherrod, et.al., 1997           Big Obsidian Flow      The eruptive sequence that culminated in the Big Obsidian Flow 1,300  years ago exemplifies several aspects of a typical rhyolitic eruptive  sequence at Newberry volcano. The eruptions began with tephra showers  that deposited pumice lumps and dense lava blocks as large as 1 meter (3 feet) within the caldera. ...  As the eruption progressed, pyroclastic flows swept downslope from  the Big Obsidian vent to Paulina Lake. The boat ramp at  Little Crater Campground is excavated in these pyroclastic-flow deposits,  as is the caldera road upslope from Paulina Lake. The flows entered  Paulina Lake, perhaps causing secondary steam explosions and displacing  water from the lake into Paulina Creek.  The final stage of eruption produced the Big Obsidian Flow itself,  a lava flow that moved slowly, probably advancing only a few meters  or tens of meters per day as it oozed down an inner caldera wall and  ponded on the caldera floor. The Big Obsidian Flow is about  1.8 kilometers (6,000 feet) long and locally thicker than 20 meters (65 feet).   -- Sherrod, et.al., 1997                   Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates            1997 Hazards Assessment Report    -- Sherrod, et.al., 1997, OFR97-513              [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                                             .

Diamond Peak began erupting from a vent near its northern summit.  A second vent later opened near the southern summit, piggy-backing its lava and tephra over the previously erupted volcanic rocks.

Thielsen is remarkable even at a distance for its colorfully interbedded pyroclastic rocks that dip away from the jagged spire of the central plug, often called the ""lightning rod of the Cascades"".  The most spectacular views are on the north and east sides (accessible only by foot or horseback) where now-vanished glaciers have carved precipitous cirque walls that reveal the construction.  Thielsen's age is approximately 290,000 years (whole-rock  K-Ar ), and its geomorphology is a reference point for assigning Cascade Range volcanoes to the age division 0-0.25 million years (younger than Thielsen) or 0.25-0.73 million years (older than Thielsen).  Very little of Thielsen's underpinnings are exposed because Holocene Mazama ash, which erupted from vents at Crater Lake National Park (20 kilometers south), forms a shroud 4-20 meters thick in the Thielsen area.   -- Sherrod, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle                Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates                [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                                       .

Prior to its climactic eruption, Mount Mazama's summit had an elevation between 3,300 meters and 3,700 meters (10,800 - 12,000 feet).

McLoughlin is easily recognized from as far away as Medicine Lake in California,  along I-5 between Yreka, California, and Medford, Oregon, or around the rim of  Crater Lake. Although it is the tallest volcano between  Shasta and Crater Lake, McLoughlin, with a volume of only 13 cubic kilometers, is dwarfed by the bulk of Shasta (350 cubic kilometers) and Mazama (130 cubic kilometers [Crater Lake]).   -- Smith, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle          Part of the Mountain is Missing      When viewed from the south or southeast it appears a seemingly perfectly symmetrical Fuji-like volcano.   However, when seen from the east, along the shores of Klamath Lake, or from the north along Crater Lake's rim, it is apparent that a major part of the mountain is missing.  Late Pleistocene glaciers have carved away the entire northeast side of the mountain, lowering the summit about a hundred meters, excavated the large bowl-like cirque, and exposed the congealed lava that fills two small central conduits.  Steeply dipping layers of pyroclastic breccia and tuff and numerous interlayered lava flows are exposed in the walls of the cirque.  An explosive origin is sometimes ascribed to this cirque; however, there is no evidence of deposits that would have resulted from such an explosion.  Glacial striae and other glacial features are common in the cirque, and glacial deposits such as moraines and till are present at the mouth of the cirque and around the north base of the mountain.  Finally, the composition of McLoughlin's lava is much more mafic than that of other volcanoes at which explosive events of the required size have occurred.   -- Smith, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle          A Young Volcano      Mount McLoughlin is a young volcano.  A pronounced magnetic high centered just east of McLoughlin's main vent is interpreted as indicating that most of the main cone is normally polarized and thus less than approximately 700,000 years old.  The well preserved shape of the mountain's west and south flanks, the lack of soil development on many flows, and preservation of primary flow features suggests that the bulk of the main cone is no older than 200,000 years, with much of it probably younger.  The main cone was essentially complete before the last major Pleistocene glaciation.  Many flank flows are younger than the main cone; some may be as young as 20,000 - 30,000 years.   -- Smith, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle                Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates                [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                               California         .

The volcano is located in a zone of east-west crustal extension east of the main axis of the Cascade Range. The 1-kilometer-thick shield is 35 kilometers from east to west and  45-50 kilometers from north to south,  and covers more than 2000 square kilometers.   The volcano is composed primarily of basalt and basaltic andesite lava flows, and has a 7 x 12 kilometer caldera at the center.   Eruptive activity during Holocene time has included numerous  rhyolite and dacite lava flows erupted at high elevations inside and outside the caldera;  cinder cones and associated lava flows of basalt and basaltic andesite have resulted from eruptions at  vents on the flanks of the shield.   Most vents are aligned along zones of crustal weakness that trend NNE to NNW.   -- Hoblitt, et.al., 1987         The Medicine Lake shield rises about 1200 meters above the Modoc Plateau to an elevation of 2,376 meters.  Lavas from Medicine Lake volcano  cover nearly 2000 square kilometers, and their volume is estimated to be at least 600 cubic kilometers, making it the largest volcano by volume in the Cascade Range.    -- Dzurisin, et.al., 1991          Eruptive History      Medicine Lake volcano began to grow about one million years ago, following eruption of a large volume of tholeiitic high-alumina basalt.  Similar high-alumina basalt has continued to erupt around the volcano throughout its history.  Although mafic lavas predominate on the volcano's flanks, all lava compositions from basalt to rhyolite have erupted during Pleistocene time.  The lower flanks consist of mostly basaltic and some andesitic lavas.  Basalt is mostly absent at higher elevation, where andesite dominates and rhyolite and small volumes of dacite are present.  During the past 11,000 years, eruptive activity at Medicine Lake volcano has been episodic.  Eight eruptions produced about 5.3 cubic kilometers of basaltic lava during a time interval of a few hundred years about 10,500 years ago.  That eruptive episode was followed by a hiatus that ended with a small andesitic eruption about 4,300 years ago.  During the most recent eruptive episode between 3000 and 900 years ago, eight eruptions produced approximately 2.5 cubic kilometers of lava ranging in composition from basalt to rhyolite.  Late Holocene lava compositions include basalt and andesite, but silicic lavas dominate.   -- Dzurisin, et.al., 1991          The Caldera       Medicine Lake caldera is a 7 x 12 kilometer depression in the summit area of the volcano.   Anderson  (1941) suggested that the caldera formed by collapse after a large volume of andesite was erupted from vents along the caldera rim.  However, the distribution of late Pleistocene vents, mostly concentrated along the rim, suggests that ring faults already existed when most of the andesite erupted (Donnelly-Nolan, 1988).  No single large eruption has been related to caldera formation.  The only eruption recognized to have produced ash flow tuff occurred in late Pleistocene time, and this eruption was too small to account for formation of the caldera.   Donnelly-Nolan  (1988) concluded that  Medicine Lake caldera formed by collapse in response to repeated extrusions of mostly mafic lava beginning early in the history of the volcano (perhaps in a manner similar to the formation of Kilauea caldera, Hawaii).   She hypothesized several small differentiated magma bodies fed by and interspersed among a plexus of dikes and sills.  In her model, late Holocene andesitic to rhyolitic lavas were derived by fractionation, assimilation, and mixing from high alumina basalt parental magma.   -- Dzurisin, et.al., 1991          The Lake      The small lake from which Medicine Lake volcano derives its name lies within the 7x12-kilometer central caldera.   -- Donnelly-Nolan, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle          Glass Mountain Obsidian Flow      The most recent eruption occurred around 1,000 years ago when rhyolite and dacite erupted at Glass Mountain and associated vents near the caldera's eastern rim.   No field evidence has been found to substantiate a report of an eruption in 1910.    -- Donnelly-Nolan, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle         Glass Mountain consists of a spectacular, nearly treeless, steep-sided rhyolite and dacite obsidian flow that erupted just outside the eastern  caldera rim and flowed down the steep eastern flank of Medicine Lake volcano.   Ten additional small domes of Glass Mountain rhyolite and rhyodacite lava lie on a N25degreesW trend to the north and one to the south.  The age of Glass Mountain and its preceding pumice deposits has been a matter of discussion for some time.  A radiocarbon age of 885+/-40 years B.P. was obtained on a dead cedar tree without limbs or bark that is preserved in the edge of one of the distal tongues of the flow.  The dated material consisted of a piece of exterior wood containing about 30 annual growth rings.  This age may be too old, because some of the outside of the tree is missing.  The tephra deposits that precede the flow and domes may be somewhat older but are constrained to be less than about 1050 years B.P. by the  Little Glass Mountain and Lassen data.    -- Donnelly-Nolan, 1990                Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates                 [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                                           .

One of the largest and highest of the Cascade volcanoes, snowclad Mount Shasta is near the southern end of the range that terminates near Lassen Peak.    -- Miller, 1980     Mount Shasta, a compound stratovolcano rising 3,500 meters above its base to an elevation of 4,317 meters, dominates the landscape of northern California.   ... Mount Shasta hosts five glaciers, including the Whitney Glacier, the largest in California.  Shastina is a large subsidiary cone that rises to 3,758 meters on the west flank of the compound volcano. ...   -- Christiansen, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle            Early Volcanic History      Mount Shasta is a massive compound stratovolcano composed of overlapping cones centered at four or more main vents; it was constructed during a period of more than 100,000 years.  Each of the cone-building periods produced pyroxene-andesite lava flows, block-and-ash flows, and mudflows originating mainly at the central vents. ...  Construction of each cone was followed by eruption of domes and pyroclastic flows of more silicic rock at central vents, and of  domes, cinder cones, and lava flows at vents on the flanks of the cones.   Two of the main eruptive centers at Mount Shasta, the  Shastina and Hotlum cones were constructed during  Holocene time, which includes about the last 10,000 years.  Holocene eruptions also occurred at  Black Butte, a group of overlapping dacite domes about 13 kilometers (8 miles) west of Mount Shasta.    -- Miller, 1980           Historical Activity      Shastina, west of the cluster of other central vents, was formed mainly between 9,700 and 9,400 years; the Hotlum cone, which forms the summit and the north and northwest slopes of Shasta, may overlap Shastina in age, but most of the Hotlum cone is probably younger.  Mount Shasta has continued to erupt at least once every 600-800 years for the past 10,000 years.  Its most recent eruption probably was in 1786.  Evidence for this eruption, recorded from sea by the explorer La Perouse, is somewhat ambiguous, but his description could only have referred to Mount Shasta.  A small craterlike depression in the summit dome, containing several small groups of  fumaroles and an acidic hot spring, might have formed during that eruption; lithic ash preserved on the slopes of the volcano and widely to the east yields charcoal dates of about 200 years.   -- Christiansen, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle           Debris Avalanche Deposit      For more than a century, hundreds of mounds, hills, and ridges of volcanic rocks in Shasta valley, north-central California, had puzzled geologists. ... Comparison with the Mount St. Helens debris-avalanche deposit,  however, clearly establishes that the hills are part of a giant debris-avalanche  deposit derived from a volcano ancestral to Mount Shasta. ...  The Mount Shasta debris-avalanche deposit covers and area of at least 450 square kilometers with about 26 cubic kilometers of debris --  roughly 10 times the volume of the 1980 Mount St. Helens avalanche deposit.  Radiometric ages of rocks in the deposit and of a post-avalanche basalt flow indicate that the avalanche occurred between about 300,000 and 360,000 years ago.   -- Brantley and Glicken, 1986                 Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates            1980 Hazards Report     -- Miller, 1980, USGS Bulletin 1503              [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                                           .

The Lassen ""volcanic center"" began to erupt about 600,000 years ago.  From 600,000 to 400,000 years ago, eruptions built a large volcano, often referred to as ""Brokeoff Volcano"" or ""Mount Tehama"".  Later, this volcano became inactive and was mostly eroded away, leaving remnants that include Brokeoff Mountain, Mount Conard, Mount Diller, and Diamond Peak.   Subsequent eruptions in the Lassen volcanic center have formed more than 30 steep-sided lava domes (the  Lassen dome field).  The most recently active parts of the volcanic center are Lassen Peak and other young domes formed in the past 50,000 years.  Clynne, et.al., 2000          Lassen Peak Volcanic Dome      Lassen Peak is the largest of a group of more than 30  volcanic domes erupted over the past 300,000 years in Lassen Volcanic National Park in northern California.  These mound-shaped accumulations of volcanic rock, called lava domes, were created by eruptions of lava too viscous to readily flow away from its source.  Eruptions about 27,000 years ago formed  Lassen Peak, probably within only a few years.  With a height of 2,000 feet and a volume of half a cubic mile, it is one of the largest lava domes on Earth. When Lassen Peak formed, it looked much like the nearby 1,100-year-old  Chaos Crags Domes, with steep sides covered with angular rock talus.  However, from 25,000 to 18,000 years ago, during the last ice age, Lassen's shape was significantly altered by glacial erosion.  For example, the bowl-shaped depression on the volcano's northeastern flank, called a cirque, was eroded by a glacier that extended out 7 miles from the dome.   -- Clynne, 1998          Eruptive Activity During the Past 1,100 Years      Three episodes of volcanism have occurred at the Lassen volcanic center in the past 1,100 years.  These are the complex eruption at Chaos Crags,  the eruptions at Cinder Cone,  and the summit eruptions of Lassen Peak in 1914-1917.   -- Clynne, 1990, IN: Wood and Kienle          Eruptive Activity 1914-1917      The most recent eruptive activity occurred at Lassen Peak in 1914-1917 A.D..  This eruptive episode began on May 30, 1914, when a small phreatic  eruption occurred at a new vent near the summit of the peak.   More than 150 explosions of various sizes  occurred during the following year.   By mid-May 1915, the eruption changed in character;  lava appeared in the summit crater and subsequently  flowed about 100 meters over the west and probably over  the east crater walls.   Disruption of the sticky lava on the upper east side of  Lassen Peak on May 19 resulted  in an avalanche of hot rock onto a snowfield.   A lahar was generated that reached more than 18 kilometers down  Lost Creek.  On May 22, an explosive  eruption produced a pyroclastic flow that devastated an  area as far as 6 kilometers northeast of the summit.  The  eruption also generated lahars that traveled more than  20 kilometers down Lost Creek and floods that went down  Hat Creek.  A vertical  eruption column resulting from the pyroclastic eruption  rose to an altitude of more than 9 kilometers above the vent  and deposited a lobe of pumiceous tephra that can be traced as far  as 30 kilometers to the east-northeast  The fall of fine ash was  reported as far away as Elko Nevada,  more than 500 kilometers east of Lassen Peak.   Intermittent eruptions of  variable intensity continued until about the middle of 1917.   -- Hoblitt, et.al., 1987                  Cascade Range Current Activity Update    -- Monthly (or sooner) Updates            Eruptions of Lassen Peak, California, 1914 to 1917    -- Clynne, et.al., 1998, USGS FS-173-98               [Return to  Top of Page ]   [Return to  Cascade Range Volcanoes Menu ]   [Return to  Visit A Volcano Menu ]                     References      Table originally compiled in 1997, redesigned in 2000, and continuously modified when needed.

""Crater Lake partially fills a 1,200-meter deep caldera, a depression formed by collapse of ancestral Mount Mazama during the violent eruption of 50 cubic kilometers of magma, or molten rock, about 7,700 years ago (6,845 +/_ 50 14C years before present). By comparison, Mount St. Helens in 1980 erupted about half a cubic kilometer of new magma. Geologic history shows that catastrophic events of this kind can repeat. Are volcanic eruptions likely again at Crater Lake? One of the approaches U.S. Geological Survey scientists are using to answer this important question is to unravel the geologic history of the Crater Lake caldera floor.""        --Dr. Hans Nelson and Dr. Charles R. Bacon   U.S. Geological Survey                                   Young calderas pose a number of hazards for human activity   The foremost threat from young calderas is that of renewed volcanism. Several post-caldera volcanic features are present at Crater Lake, although only Wizard Island breaks the lake surface. The youngest post-caldera volcano is a small rhyodacite dome in Crater Lake on the east flank of Wizard Island that dates from about 5,000 years ago. Another eruption of the magnitude of the caldera-forming event is unlikely within the next several thousand years: no volcanic rocks or layers of ash younger than the dome are known at Crater Lake, seismic profile studies of lake sediment show no evidence of subsurface magma movement, and there have been no earthquakes of the kind associated with volcanism. However, there is every reason to expect future activity in the place where it has been occurring for at least 400,000 years. Should there be an eruption within the caldera, it would likely happen underwater, increasing the possibility of enhanced explosive power due to the interaction of magma and hot rock with water.    Calderas filled with water can produce tremendous flooding in the immediate vicinity if the caldera wall fails, as happened to Aniakchak Crater in Alaska when its rim was breached. Crater Lake shows no signs of imminent crater-wall failure: the last major wall failure occurred over 7,500 years ago, after the formation of the subaerial central platform of post-caldera lava flows, but before the lake water began accumulating. The Chaski slide, one block of which forms a prominent bench east of Crater Lake Lodge, was the last major landslide event and carried debris to the center of the caldera floor.    Water-filled craters or calderas can release very large quantities of CO2 as happened at Lake Nyos, Cameroon, where hundreds of villagers in the vicinity of the Lake died of asphyxiation. Crater Lake, however, produces some circulation in its bottom half from hydrothermal activity on the caldera floor and strong circulation throughout from normal atmospheric influences. Moreover, sediment from the lake bottom shows no indication of the presence of gas, and the lake itself is surprisingly well-oxygenated, considering its depth. There is no evidence that Crater Lake is likely to turn over, as did Lake Nyos, and release large amounts of CO2.

Not drawn to scale or as an exact cross section line.                   Understanding the history and evolution of calderas may help scientists predict when and where disasters are likely to occur   The interdisciplinary study of the Crater Lake caldera floor required extensive logistical assistance from the  National Park Service  and collaboration with scientists from  Oregon State University  in use of underwater vehicles. U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists determined the geologic history of Crater Lake itself through detailed studies of the caldera and the Pacific ocean floor. The climactic eruption of Mount Mazama resulted in deposition of pumice and ash over more than a million square kilometers of the Pacific Northwest. Soon after, ash deposited in the Columbia River drainage basin was transported westward from the Pacific coast up to 700 kilometers offshore on the northeast Pacific ocean floor by turbidity currents along deep-sea channels. Collapse of the former volcanic edifice along a ring fracture system, forming the caldera, occurred during the eruption and compensated for the ejection of the 50 cubic kilometers of magma. Part of the erupted material fell within the developing caldera to form a plug of intracaldera tuff that may be as much as 2 kilometers thick. The basin that now contains Crater Lake is the resulting collapse caldera, 1,200 meters deep and 8 to10 kilometers in diameter at the rim. In a matter of only a few hundred years, the caldera was partially filled, first with landslide debris from the walls and later with post-caldera volcanic rocks, water, and lake sediment.    USGS workers used Crater Lake's well-preserved, detailed geologic history to develop a genetic model of small caldera evolution   Post-caldera volcanic vents, geothermal features, and buried steam-explosion (phreatic) craters detected by seismic surveys collectively outline a ring fracture zone along which Mount Mazama subsided. These features began to form after caldera collapse about 7,700 years ago, but before the caldera filled with water to essentially its present level over the following 300 years. The large central platform of subaerial lava flows and domes erupted before the lake was present. Radiocarbon dates taken from lake-bottom organic matter indicate that the lake covered the central platform within at least 150 years of the caldera collapse. Wizard Island, one of the two major caldera-floor volcanic cones, erupted additional material into the lake as it finished filling. These subaqueous Wizard Island deposits accumulated to a height 70 meters below today's lake surface, and the subaerial island continued to grow nearly 250 meters above the present lake surface. Merriam Cone, the other large volcanic cone, erupted completely underwater, rising more than 400 meters above the caldera floor, but it remains 200 meters below the present lake surface.    Evidence for the timing of these events is found in detailed analysis of sediment sources and of radiocarbon dates from the central platform deposits. The age of the central platform sediment shows that the last main volcanic event, extrusion of a small rhyodacite dome east of Wizard Island, happened about 5,000 years ago. Investigations also show that the early lake sediment contained pollen from gradual re-establishment of post-eruption forest surrounding the lake as well as primitive diatoms that lived in the early, more hydrothermal water. Warmer and drier climatic conditions existed during the lake's early history, but a colder and wetter neoglacial climate has dominated for the past several thousand years.    There is evidence that large slope failures may have been triggered while volcanic and seismic activity continued up to 5,000 years ago. Since then, the geologic history of the caldera floor is marked by a distinct absence of volcanic activity. Mass wasting from the caldera walls continues, but on a much reduced scale. Lake bottom sediments now cover the chaotic subaerial debris wedges and volcanic deposits laid down as the lake was forming. This lake sediment blanket on the floor is well-bedded with a variety of sediment sizes ranging from gravel at the edge to very fine sand toward the lake center. Organic-rich muds also have accumulated on the submerged volcanic features. The lake sedimentation rate is currently high, but remains considerably lower than that found during the subaerial mass wasting that occurred before the lake formed.    Other USGS studies at Crater Lake, either published in scientific journals or in progress, include research on development of the shallow magma chamber which produced the climactic eruption, eruptive processes and caldera collapse as indicated by features of the volcanic deposits, and the early history of Mount Mazama and the many smaller volcanoes in the Crater Lake area. In addition, scientists from the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory periodically make geodetic measurements and look for tilting or swelling of the caldera area that might forewarn of renewed volcanic activity.            Interpretive drawing (right) of a continuous seismic airgun profile (left) across the east basin showing the subsurface sedimentary units of the caldera floor. The early lake sediment was probably deposited prior to 5,000 years ago while active volcanic eruptions were occurring, whereas the late lake sediment has been deposited during the period of volcanic quiescence over the past 5,000 years.

GX014-62-0246040	USGS/Cascades Volcano Observatory, Vancouver, Washington                      Preparing for    The Next Eruption in the Cascades          -- Cascades Volcano Observatory, 1994,   Preparing for the Next Eruption in the Cascades: USGS Open-File Report 94-585                 Active volcanoes dominate the skyline    in many parts of  the Pacific Northwest. These familiar snow-clad peaks are  part of a 1,000 mile-long chain of volcanoes, the  Cascade Range, which extends from northern California to  southern British Columbia. Many of these volcanoes have  erupted in the recent past and will erupt again in the  foreseeable future. The time between eruptions is  usually measured in decades or centuries, so eruptions  are not a part of our everyday experience. However, in  1980 Mount St. Helens vividly demonstrated the power  that Cascade volcanoes can unleash when they  do erupt .    The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for  assessing volcano hazards, monitoring the activity of  U.S. volcanoes, and issuing warnings of impending  eruptions. To help prevent loss of life and property  from the next eruption in the Cascades, scientists at  the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO) in  Vancouver, Washington, are working to determine the type  and extent of hazards posed by the Cascade volcanoes.            Cascade Volcanoes        Eruptions in the Cascades   have occurred at an average  rate of 1-2 per century during the last 4000 years, and  future eruptions are certain. Seven volcanoes in the  Cascades have erupted since the first U.S. Independence  Day a little more than 200 years ago. Four of those  eruptions would have caused considerable property damage  and loss of life if they had occurred today without  warning. As population increases in the Pacific  Northwest, areas near the volcanoes are being developed  and recreational usage is expanding. As a result, more  and more people and property are at risk from volcanic  activity. The next eruption in the Cascades could affect  hundreds of thousands of people.              VOLCANOES AND WATER: A Dangerous Combination     Large parts of most Cascade volcanoes are covered with  permanent snow and ice that pose a special hazard during  periods of volcanic unrest. Even small eruptions can  melt a large amount of snow and ice, triggering debris  flows that can travel tens of miles beyond the flanks of  the volcano into populated valleys. Years after volcanic  unrest has stopped, erosion of deposits can cause  increased sediment that clogs waterways, disrupts  aquatic ecosystems, and worsens flooding. Debris flows  are the most costly effects of eruptions at snow-clad  volcanoes.            USGS CASCADES VOLCANO OBSERVATORY     -- Preparing for the Next Eruption             EVALUATING Volcano Hazards:    To identify the areas that are likely to be affected by  future eruptions, rock deposits from pre-historic  eruptions are mapped, studied, and dated to learn about  the types and frequency of past eruptions at each  volcano. This information helps scientists to better  anticipate future activity at a volcano, and provides a  basis for mitigating the effects of future eruptions  through land-use and emergency planning.                MONITORING Restless Volcanoes:    Volcanoes often show signs that they are getting ready  to erupt days to months in advance. Seismic activity,  ground movements, and gas emissions at Cascade volcanoes  are monitored by CVO in order to detect subtle changes  that may herald the next eruption. Seismic activity is  continuously monitored under the auspices of the USGS  Volcano Hazards and Geothermal Studies Program through  CVO, the USGS in Menlo Park, California, and the  University of Washington Geophysics Program in Seattle,  Washington.                COMMUNICATING Hazards Information    CVO provides information about volcanoes and volcano  hazards to public officials, land-use planners,  emergency response organizations, the Federal Aviation  Administration and other federal agencies, the news  media, schools, and the general public. When volcanic  activity increases, CVO issues advisories, warnings, and  whenever possible, specific predictions concerning  eruptions and their potential impacts.          DEVELOPING New Tools, Testing New Ideas:    USGS scientists study Mount St. Helens and other  volcanoes around the world to develop new ideas about  how volcanoes work and to improve eruption-prediction  methods. Related research topics include dynamics of  debris flows, effects of volcanic gases on weather and  climate, and effects of increased sediment transport on  streams. New instrumentation, software, and hardware  developed by the USGS enable scientists to acquire,  process, and interpret data more quickly and effectively  than ever before.                READY to Respond:    At CVO, a multi-disciplinary team of scientists and a  cache of portable volcano-monitoring equipment function  as a mobile volcano observatory ready to respond to  volcanic unrest anywhere in the U. S. and, in cooperation  with the U. S. Agency for International Development's  Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, anywhere in the  world. Since 1980 this team has responded to volcanic  unrest in Alaska, California, Washington, Colombia,  Ecuador, Guatemala, Indonesia, Mexico, Papua New Guinea,  and the Philippines.              The USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory strives to serve  the national interest by helping people to live  knowledgeably and safely with volcanoes and related  natural hazards including earthquakes, landslides, and  debris flows in the western United States and elsewhere  in the world. CVO assesses hazards before they occur by  identifying and studying past hazardous events. We  provide warnings during volcanic crises by intensively  monitoring restless volcanoes and interpreting results  in the context of current hazards assessments. We  investigate and report on hazardous events after they  occur to improve our assessment and prediction skills,  and to help develop new concepts of how volcanoes work.            Our goal is to keep natural processes from becoming  natural disasters.                       Return to:      [Report Menu]  ...      [Read About Volcanoes Menu]  ...

GX001-37-3213127	"U.S. Geological Survey Fact Sheet 059-00  Online Version 1.0    Mount BakerLiving with an Active Volcano                             Mount Baker     dominates the skyline from Bellingham, Washington, and Vancouver, British     Columbia. On cold, clear winter days, dramatic increases in the steam plume     rising continuously from Sherman Crater can alarm local residents. This     apparent increase in plume vigor occurs because of condensation of steam in     cold, calm air. In 1975, however, increased steaming and melting of snow and     ice around Sherman Crater did signify a change in heat output from the     volcano's interior. Although the increased heat flow gradually subsided, it     could have signaled the start of eruptive activity, and precautions were     wisely undertaken. So that the public can be warned of, and be prepared for,     future eruptions and other hazardous events at Mount Baker, U.S. Geological     Survey (USGS) scientists are studying the volcano's past behavior and     monitoring its current activity.                                                                                                       Mount Baker (10,781 feet) viewed from east side with steam plume rising from         Sherman Crater (left side of summit, small photo shows crater interior). Scar of         the 1891 flank collapse is visible in lower left of photo. Photos by Kevin         Scott and Robert Symonds, USGS.                                            WHAT ARE THE HAZARDS?       The next  eruption of Mount Baker may produce  lava flows, pyroclastic flows,  volcanic ash  (tephra) , and  lahars  . Lahars are by far the greatest concern at Mount Baker because of its history of frequent lahars, the ability of lahars to flow for tens of miles, and the potential for hazardous future impacts of lahars on two reservoirs on the east side of the volcano. Tephra hazards at Mount Baker are less important than at neighboring Glacier Peak volcano to the south.    Lahars can originate in two ways:    1) During eruptions, pyroclastic flows can melt snow and ice to create torrents of ash, rock, and water that move downvalley as sandy (noncohesive) lahars.   2) Because the volcano is locally weakened and altered to clay by percolating, acidic, hot water and steam (like that venting from Sherman Crater), future volcanic landslides known as flank collapses can mobilize to form muddy (cohesive) lahars.    Lahars of collapse origin occur during eruptions. They also occur during  non-eruptive periods triggered by regional earthquakes, gravity, or increases in hydrovolcanic activity not associated with magma intrusion.    When ground water comes in contact with either magma or hot rock, hydrovolcanic explosions of steam and rock can occur. Such events, in addition to possibly triggering collapse, can themselves be hazardous.           MOUNT BAKEREARLY HISTORY     USGS research in the last decade shows Mount Baker to be the youngest of several volcanic centers in the area and one of the youngest volcanoes in the Cascade Range. Volcanic activity in the Mount Baker area began more than one million years ago, but many of the earliest lava and tephra deposits have been removed by glacial erosion. The pale-colored rocks northeast of the modern volcano mark the site of ancient Kulshan Caldera that collapsed after an enormous ash eruption one million years ago. Subsequently, eruptions in the Mount Baker area have produced cones and lava flows of andesite, the rock that makes up much of other Cascade Range volcanoes like Mounts Rainier, Adams, and Hood. From about 900,000 years ago to the present, numerous andesitic volcanic centers in the area have come and gone, eroded by glaciers. The largest is the Black Buttes edifice, active between 400,000 and 300,000 years ago and formerly bigger than today's Mount Baker.    Although numerous in Oregon and southern Washington, cinder  cones formed of the rock type called basalt are rare around Mount Baker. A  cinder cone that formed 9,800 years ago in Schriebers Meadow produced a  widespread tephra layer, and lava flows that reached the Baker River.                                                                                      click         here for larger version of graphic                                     Eruptions and flank collapses at Mount Baker during the past 12,000 years.                                          TODAY'S MOUNT BAKER    Modern Mount  Baker formed during and since the last ice age, which ended about  15,000 years ago. Lava flows from the summit vent erupted between 30,000 and 10,000 years ago and, during the final stages of edifice construction, blocky pyroclastic flows poured down most of the volcano's drainages. An eruption 6,600 years ago produced a blanket of ash that extended more than 20 miles to the northeast. This eruption probably occurred from the presently ice-filled summit crater. Subsequently, sulfurous gases have found two pathways to the  surfaceDorr Fumaroles, northeast of the summit, and Sherman Crater, south of the summit. Both these area are sites of pervasive bedrock alteration, converting lavas to weak, white-to-yellow material rich in clays, silica, and sulfur-bearing minerals. At Sherman Crater, collapses of this weakened rock created lahars in 1843 and as recently as the 1970's.       PAST  EVENTS FUTURE HAZARDS    Like most volcanoes, Mount Baker's history records great variations in behavior. Scientists believe the following case histories are good examples of the range in size and types of hazardous activity that have occurred in the past and could occur again. Small events are more common than large ones, and during a future hazardous event only parts of the hazard zones shown on the map may be affected.

Flank Collapses, Lahars, and Tephra Eruptions,  about 6,600 Years Ago     A series of discrete events culminated with the largest tephra-producing eruption in post- glacial time at Mount Baker. First, the largest collapse in the history of the volcano occurred from the Roman Wall (see map) and transformed into a lahar that was over 300 feet deep in the upper reaches of the Middle Fork of the Nooksack River. It was at least 25 feet deep 30 miles downstream from the volcano and probably reached Bellingham Bay. Next, a huge hydrovolcanic explosion occurred near the site of present day Sherman Crater, triggering a second collapse of the flank just east of the Roman Wall. That collapse also became a lahar that mainly followed the course of the first one for at least 20 miles, but also spilled into tributaries of the Baker River. Finally, an eruption cloud deposited several inches of ash as far as 20 miles downwind to the northeast.      Sherman Crater Forms in 1843     The present shape of Sherman Crater originated with a large hydrovolcanic explosion. In 1843, explorers reported a widespread layer of newly fallen rock fragments ""like a snowfall"" and the forest ""on fire for miles around."" Rivers south of the volcano were clogged with ash, and Native Americans reported that many salmon were killed. A short time later, two collapses of the east side of Sherman Crater produced two lahars, the first and larger of which flowed into the natural Baker Lake, raising its level at least 10 feet. The location of this 19th-century lake is now covered by waters of the modern dam-impounded Baker Lake. Similar but lower level hydrovolcanic activity at Sherman Crater continued intermittently for several decades afterwards.

Flank Collapse and Lahar in 1891     In 1891, about 20 million cubic yards of rock fell from the scar shown in the photo on the front page, producing a lahar that traveled more than 6 miles and covered 1 square mile.      Sherman Crater Heats Up in 1975, Triggering Concern     In 1975, scientists believed that the dramatic increase in the steam plume and heat output  from Sherman Crater could herald either a new magmatic eruption or hydrovolcanic activity like that of 1843. Either of these possibilities would have increased the risk of collapse, raising concerns that lahars could flow rapidly into Baker Lake or Lake Shannon, displacing water and creating a flood surge or even causing dam failure. The volcano was subjected to the most intensive monitoring ever applied to a Cascade Range volcano up to that time. As time passed, no signs of rising  magmaearthquakes, significant changes in gas composition, or surface deformationappeared. The main risk, therefore, was of flank collapses and lahars similar to those of 1843 (Map Inundation Zone II). Had magmatic activity been confirmed, a much larger collapse  and flow would have been possible (Map Inundation Zone I), and a magmatic eruption could have ensued like those between 30,000 and 10,000 years ago or that of 6,600 years ago.    When magmatic activity does recur, all the drainages of Mount Baker will be at risk from lahars, and upstream areas will be at risk from pyroclastic flows and lava flows in the hazard zone shown on the map. The Dorr Fumaroles are also a potential site of hydrovolcanic explosions. Steep headwalls on the north flank are also at risk of flank collapse, but Sherman Crater is the most likely area on Mount Baker for renewed failure.    On the basis of conclusions by USGS scientists in June 1975,an interagency task force advised lowering the level of Baker Lake so that it could accommodate lahar inflow without displacing water from the reservoir that could have flooded the downstream Skagit River valley. Because a lahar could also trigger waves that would inundate areas around the lake, shoreline residences, campgrounds, and businesses were evacuated. On the basis of recent research, the west side of Sherman Crater, site of a previous collapse, could also be unstable. Today, if there were a similar increase in activity at Sherman Crater, USGS scientists might also recommend drawdown of Lake Shannon, the smaller downstream reservoir that is the catchment for drainages from the west side of the crater.                                                                       This notice         was posted at campgrounds around Baker Lake by the US Forest        Service in June 1975. Normally, Baker Reservoir approaches capacity during        mid-summer. At most other times, reservoir levels are low enough to impound        lahars the size of those that occurred in 1843.                                           MONITORING FOR THE FUTURE     The University of Washington Geophysics Program, in cooperation with the USGS, monitors seismic (earthquake) activity at Mount Baker and other Cascade Range volcanoes. Seismic activity is the most common precursor of magma intrusion, which potentially could lead to an eruption. The risk and potential size of flank collapse and lahars increase progressively as magma rises toward and into a volcano's edifice.     The USGS monitors gas emissions from Sherman Crater in order to detect changes in the volcano's ""plumbing system"" that may be a warning of impending magmatic activity or an increase in hydrovolcanic activity, and thus an increased chance of eruption or collapse.

Introduction   The eruption has progressed through three main epochs:  3.5 years of episodic fountaining, mainly from the Pu‘u ‘O‘o central vent, producing a cinder-and-spatter cone and ‘a‘a flows; 5.5 years of continuous effusion from the Kupaianaha vent, producing a shield and tube-fed pahoehoe flows; and over 11 years (as of January 2003) of nearly continuous effusion from flank vents on Pu‘u ‘O‘o, again producing a shield and tube-fed pahoehoe flows.     Episodes     1983–1986:  The Rise of Pu‘u ‘O‘o–Episodic Lava Fountains Build Massive Cone   The Pu‘u ‘O‘o–Kupaianaha eruption began on January 3, 1983.  For the first six months (episodes 1–3), fissures erupted intermittently along the middle east rift zone from Napau Crater to Kalalua.  In June 1983, the activity became localized at the Pu‘u ‘O‘o vent, which straddles the boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park.  For the next three years (episodes 4–47), Pu‘u ‘O‘o erupted approximately every three to four weeks, usually for less than 24 hours.  Spectacular lava fountains that catapulted lava as high as 470 m above the vent characterized these eruptive episodes.    The high fountains produced mainly ‘a‘a flows, the more viscous and gas-poor of the two types of Hawaiian lava.  ‘A‘a flows from Pu‘u ‘O‘o were typically 3–5 m thick and advanced at speeds of 50–500 m/h, picking up speed and narrowing on steep slopes.  Because of the short duration of each eruptive episode, none of these flows reached the ocean or the coastal highway.  The flows posed an immediate threat, however, to the sparsely populated Royal Gardens subdivision, located on a steep slope 6 km southeast of the vent.  ‘A‘a flows reached the subdivision in as little as 13 hours during several eruptive episodes and destroyed 16 houses in 1983 and 1984.   Fallout from the towering lava fountains built a cinder-and-spatter cone 255 m high, over twice the height of any other cone on the east rift zone.  The cone was strikingly asymmetrical, because the prevailing trade winds caused most of the airborne fragments to pile up on the southwest side of the conduit.   1986–1992:  Continuous Eruption of Kupaianaha Sends Lava to the Sea   In July 1986, the vertical conduit of Pu‘u ‘O‘o ruptured, and the eruption shifted to a new vent, Kupaianaha, 3 km northeast of Pu‘u ‘O‘o.  This event marked the end of episodic high fountaining and the beginning of five-and-a-half years of nearly continuous, quiet effusion (episode 48).  A lava pond formed over the new vent, and its frequent overflows resulted in a broad, low shield that reached its maximum height of 56 m in less than a year.    After weeks of continuous eruption, the main channel exiting the pond gradually developed a roof as crust at the sides of the channel extended across the lava stream.  This was the beginning of a lava tube that would eventually extend to the ocean.  Lava tubes insulate rivers of lava from both heat and gas loss.  Flows that break out of tubes are usually pahoehoe, a type of lava more fluid than ‘a‘a.  The surface of a cooled pahoehoe flow can be flat and smooth, ropy, shelly, or undulating.   A broad field of tube-fed pahoehoe spread gradually from Kupaianaha to the ocean, 12 km to the southeast, taking three months to cover the same distance that ‘a‘a  from Pu‘u ‘O‘o traveled in less than a day.  By early November 1986, the flows were visible on the steep slope above the small community of Kapa‘ahu, and their leisurely pace was no longer reassuring.   On November 28, 1986, flows from Kupaianaha reached the ocean, cutting a swath through Kapa‘ahu and closing the coastal highway.  A few weeks later, the lava took a more easterly course and overran 14 homes on the northwest edge of Kalapana in a single day.  Fortunately for the rest of the village, this flow abruptly stagnated when the tube became blocked near the vent.   Over the next three years, lava destroyed a few homes on either side of the ever-widening flow field.  Initially, the course of pahoehoe flows was strongly influenced by topography, but, eventually, even the highest ground was inundated.  The depth of the lava increased as flows covered many areas repeatedly and the tube-fed flows grew from within, inflating as more lava was intruded under the already solid crust of the flow front.    From mid–1987 through 1989, most of the lava that erupted from Kupaianaha flowed directly to the sea.  Steam explosions at the ocean entry fragmented the lava, creating black sand that collected to form new beaches in protected bays down-current of the lava entry.  New, albeit unstable, acreage was added to the island as lava deltas built seaward over a steep submarine slope of fragmented lava.    The long-lived tube system delivering lava to the ocean began to break down in the spring of 1989, and surface flows were a common sight, particularly on the steep slope (pali) above the coastal plain.  Lava flows encroached on new territory, overrunning the Waha‘ula Visitor Center and adjoining residences in Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park.    The eruption began to change in 1990, when a series of nine pauses, lasting from one to four days, interrupted the steady effusion of lava.  At the same time, the eruption entered its most destructive phase.  In March 1990, the flows turned toward Kalapana, an area cherished for its historic sites and black sand beaches.  By the end of the summer, the entire community, including a church, store, and 100 homes, lay buried under 15–25 m of lava.  In May 1990, a Federal Disaster Declaration was issued for Kalapana and all other areas previously affected by the eruption.    As the flows advanced eastward, they took to the sea, covering the palm-lined Kaimu Bay with a plain of lava that extends 300 m beyond the original shoreline.  In late 1990, a new lava tube diverted lava away from Kalapana and back into the national park, where flows again entered the ocean.    During the five-and-a-half years that Kupaianaha reigned, repeated collapses of the Pu‘u ‘O‘o conduit gradually formed a crater approximately 300 m in diameter.  A lava pond appeared sporadically at the bottom of the crater starting in 1987; after 1990 it was present most of the time.   The volume of lava erupted from Kupaianaha steadily declined in 1991.  Concurrently the level and activity of the Pu‘u ‘O‘o lava pond rose.  In November 1991, fissures opened between Pu‘u ‘O‘o and Kupaianaha and erupted for three weeks.  Kupaianaha continued to erupt during this event (episode 49), but its output was waning.  On February 7, 1992, the Kupaianaha vent was dead.   1992–1997: The Return to Pu‘u ‘O‘o   Ten days later, the eruption returned to Pu‘u ‘O‘o.  Lava erupted in low fountains along a fissure on the west flank of the massive cone.  This was the first in a series of flank vents that were active for the next five years (episodes 50–53).  As at Kupaianaha, the style of the eruption was nearly continuous, quiet effusion.   Episodes 50–53 built a lava shield 45 m high and 1 km in diameter that banked up against the western flank of Pu‘u ‘O‘o.  In November 1992, lava crossed the Chain of Craters Road in Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park and entered the ocean at Kamoamoa, 11 km from the vents.  Over the next month, tube-fed pahoehoe flows buried the Kamoamoa archaeological site, the National Park‘s campground and picnic area, and the black sand beach formed earlier in the eruption by flows from Kupaianaha entering the ocean farther east.  From the end of 1992 through January 1997, tubes fed lava to the ocean almost continuously, broadening the episode 50–53 flow field, which lies mostly within the National Park.    Beginning in 1993, collapse pits appeared on the west flank of Pu‘u ‘O‘o as the magma feeding the flank vents undermined that side of the cone.  Collapse pits had engulfed most of the west flank by the end of 1996.   January 1997:  Cone Collapse Heralds Fissure Eruption   On the night of January 30, 1997, Pu‘u ‘O‘o cone changed dramatically.  Magma drained from the Pu‘u ‘O‘o conduit, causing, first, the crater floor, then the west wall of the cone, to collapse.  Shortly thereafter, new fissures broke open and erupted briefly in and near Napau Crater.  The fissure eruption, designated episode 54, lasted 22 hours.     The collapse at Pu‘u ‘O‘o left a large gap in the west side of the cone.  The rubble-lined crater was now 210 m deep.   February 1997 to Present:  Eruption of Pu‘u ‘O‘o Flank Vents Resumes   Episode 54 was followed by the longest eruptive hiatus in more than 10 years.  Twenty-four days passed before episode 55 began on February 24, 1997, when lava rose through the rubble on the floor of the crater to form a new pond.  Lava erupted outside the crater a month later, when new vents opened on the west and southwest flanks of the cone.   In April 1997, a single vent on the west side of the crater replaced the active lava pond in Pu‘u ‘O‘o.  Flows from this vent intermittently ponded at the crater‘s east end.  In June 1997, the lava rose until it overtopped the gap in the west wall of Pu‘u ‘O‘o formed by the January 1997 collapse.  Lava spilled from the crater for the first time in 11 years.  Subsequent crater overflows overtopped the east crater rim and extended as far as 1.5 km downrift.  The spillovers were brief events, ending when the pond drained through conduits in the crater floor.    Tube-fed flows from the episode–55 flank vents reached the ocean in July 1997 near the eastern boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park.  Episode 55 flows have subsequently buried much of the episode–50–53-flow field.  In early 2000, flows crossed the eastern boundary of the park and encroached on private property.  During the next two years, lava overran five abandoned houses in Royal Gardens subdivision, bringing the total number of structures destroyed by this eruption to 189 by the end of May 2002.

Wright, T.L., Takahashi, T.J., and Griggs, J.D., 1992, Hawai‘i volcano watch:  a pictorial history: University of Hawaii Press and Hawaii Natural History Association, 162 p.      Contents  This CD–ROM contains 100 digitized color 35-mm images of eruptions of Pu‘u ‘O‘o and Kupaianaha from 1983 to 1997, designed for use by the interested public, multimedia producers, desktop publishers, and the high-end printing industry.  The digital images are stored in the “images” folder and can be read across Macintosh, Windows, DOS, OS/2, SGI, UNIX system-based, and Linux platforms with applications that can read JPG (JPEG – Joint Photographic Experts Group format) or PCD (Kodak‘s PhotoCD (YCC) format) files.  Throughout this publication, the image numbers match the file names, figure captions, thumbnail labels, and other references.  Also included on this CD–ROM are Windows and Macintosh viewers and engines for keyword searches (Adobe Acrobat Reader with Search).  At the time of this publication, Kodak‘s policy on the distribution of color-management files is still unresolved, and so none is included on this CD–ROM.  However, using the Universal Ektachrome or Universal Kodachrome transforms found in your software will provide excellent color.  In addition to PhotoCD (PCD) files, this CD–ROM contains large (14.2”x19.5”) and small (4”x6”) screen-resolution (72 dots per inch; dpi) images in JPEG format.  These undergo downsizing and compression relative to the PhotoCD images.  Each of these resolutions is located in the following folders:    PhotoCD format (PCDs): /images/PCD/ (490 MB)  14.2”x19.5”: /images/JPG/large_screen/ (16.5 MB)  4”x6”: /images/JPG/small_screen/ (2.1 MB)      Images  This CD–ROM presents text and 100 photographs showing volcanic activity of Pu‘u ‘O‘o and Kupaianaha.  The images are presented in a variety of ways:   an “album” in Web-browser (HyperText Markup Language; HTML) format that contains brief introductory text, photographs (screen-resolution), and captions   a “book” in Adobe Acrobat (PDF) format that contains detailed text, photographs (print-resolution), and captions   a “contact sheet” photograph collection in PDF format   a “slideshow” of the photographs in PDF format available for two sizes of monitors   a set of “thumbnails” of the photographs in PDF format that consist of tiny versions of each image and its image number   as individual images in folders containing Kodak PhotoCD (PCD) image-pac format and JPG format files       Album in Web-browser (HTML) Format  An “album” is provided here as an HTML file.  Each image is first presented as a 4”x6” image.  Clicking on any 4”x6” image will bring up a larger version (14” wide or 10” high).  Use your browser‘s “Back” button to return to the album.  The color “palate” contains 16.7 million colors.           View the Web-browser album  (album.html; 85 KB with links to 18.6 MB of image files)   Accessibility   The content within this publication is presented in several formats.  The HTML forms (index.html; this file, and album.html) are presented with alternative text to make them fully accessible using assistive technology such as screen readers; they comply with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 508.  As the PDF forms (DDS-80.pdf, contact_sheet.pdf, thumbnails.pdf, and the two slideshow PDFs) contain the same images and the same text, it was unnecessary to “tag” them for accessibility.   Text and Photographs in Acrobat (PDF) Format   To view PDF files on this CD–ROM, you will need Adobe Acrobat Reader, which is provided in the “Acrobat” folder for both Macintosh and Windows (version 5.1).  You can also download the latest version at no cost using the button below.            Book in Acrobat (PDF) Format   A “book” is provided here as an Adobe Acrobat PDF file (DDS-80.pdf).  The book includes the complete text, photographs, and captions with each image in print- quality (3072x2048 pixels; 4”x6” 512 dpi).          View the Acrobat book  (DDS-80.pdf; 61.3 MB)      Contact Sheet in Acrobat (PDF) Format  A “contact sheet” collection is provided here as PDF file.  It consists of the 100 photographs with image numbers.  It contains five pages with 20 shots to the page.  You can print it on standard letter paper or view it on your screen.  The image numbers match the file names in the “images” folder for both the JPG and the PCD files.           View the contact sheet collection  (contact_sheet.pdf; 2.6 MB)      Slideshow in Acrobat (PDF) Format   A “slideshow” is provided in the “slideshow” folder as a pair of Adobe Acrobat PDF files, slideshow1024.pdf (9.9 MB) or slideshow1920.pdf (24.7 MB).  The images in slideshow1024.pdf are 1024 pixels wide or 768 pixels high, typical of what monitors up to 17” use.  The images in slideshow1920.pdf are 1900 pixels wide or 1200 pixels high, typical of what monitors up to 23” use.  If you are using a smaller monitor, select the smaller file because it will load and display faster.  To run either slideshow, you need to open it directly with Acrobat Reader rather than through this HTML front end with its browser “plugin.”  To do this, quit (or minimize) this page, go directly to the CD–ROM, open the slideshow folder, and open the slideshow file of your choice.            Go to the slideshow files  and download the one of your choice by right-clicking (PC) or clicking-and-holding or dragging-and-dropping (Mac).    Tip:  To automate the slideshow, open Acrobat Reader, select Edit, Preferences, General, Full Screen... and check Advance Every 3 Seconds.  Then open the slideshow.  To exit the slideshow at any time, hit the “Esc” button.   (Older versions of Acrobat Reader such as 4.0 have the automate choice under File, Preferences, Full Screen).      Thumbnails in Acrobat (PDF) Format   The “thumbnails” from the inside front cover of the CD–ROM jewel box are provided here as an Adobe Acrobat PDF file (thumbnails.pdf).  This file consists of a set of three small (4 ¾”) pages that show a tiny version of each image and its image number.  For those who want to make copies of this CD–ROM or download and record a CD–ROM of this publication from the Web, printing this file will give a convenient view of the contents.          View the thumbnails  (thumbnails.pdf; 701 KB)      Individual Images  The small-screen images (432x288 pixels) used in the HTML album, the large-screen images (landscape, 1024x683 pixels; portrait, 768x512 pixels) used in both the HTML and PDF slideshow, and print-quality (3072x2048 pixels) images in PCD format and used in the PDF album are available individually using the links below.          View the collection of small-screen images  (images/JPG/small_screen; 2.1 MB total)          View the collection of large-screen images  (images/JPG/large_screen; 16.5 MB total)          View the collection of PCDs  (images/PCD; 490.1 MB total)     Kodak PhotoCD (PCD) Format   For users with commercial software that can read and print PCD files, the photographs are provided on this CD–ROM in that format in the “PCD” folder which is in the “images” folder.  In the hierarchy of file formats, PhotoCD (YCC) resides above BMP, EPS, GIF, JPEG, MOV, PCX, PICT, PSD, TIF, TIFF, etc., enabling end users to go from YCC to other formats but not in the other direction without losing image quality.  The latest information about PhotoCD is on the World Wide Web at  http://www.kodak.com/go/photocd .  Each 24-bit color image is stored at five resolutions:   1.  Thumbnail [192 x 128 pixels]–Contact-sheet-size images for quick previewing of the entire collection.   2. FPO “For Placement Only” [384 x 256 pixels]–A proxy for high-resolution images to determine placement in page-layout programs.   3. Screen Resolution [786 x 512 pixels]–Ideal for computer viewing and multimedia projects.   4. HDTV High-Definition Television [1536 x 1024 pixels]–Sufficient resolution for high-definition TV, newspapers, and high-quality half-page layouts.   5. High Resolution [3072 x 2048 pixels]–Provides the printing industry with resolution sufficient for high-quality, full-page layouts at 300 dpi/150 lpi and 24-bit color.    Captions   The captions for each image, besides being included in the HTML front end and the PDF file, are provided in ASCII format in the captions.txt file.          View the Captions file  for this CD–ROM (captions.txt; 70 KB)   Information about This Publication   The scans for this publication were made in the Western Publications Group of the U.S. Geological Survey from the original slides using a Nikon LS-1000 film scanner on a Macintosh G4/500 computer running Mac OS 9.2.2.  The resulting TIF files were edited in Adobe Photoshop 7.0.1 and converted to PhotoCD (PCD) image-pac files using Kodak BuildIt software.  The same TIF files were used to generate the PDF and JPG files on this disc.  The small-screen images were made with JPG compression set to 3; the large-screen images were made with JPG compression set to 9.  The book PDF file was constructed using Adobe InDesign 2.0.1 page-layout software on a Macintosh G4/dual 1.25-GHz computer running Mac OS X Version 10.2.6; the Acrobat Distiller settings were 512 dpi using JPG medium compression.  The master for the CD–ROM was made on a LaCie CDBP-401248A CD–ROM recorder using Roxio Toast Titanium 5.2 software for Macintosh set at ISO-9660 Level II CD–ROM format with Macintosh names (compatible with Windows) and Apple Extensions.
