GX246-71-12481122	Choctaw County     First Oil Well In Alabama         On January 2, 1944, the State of Alabama granted Hunt Oil Company a permit to drill the A.R. Jackson Well No. 1 at this location near Gilbertown. Hunt Oil Company was owned by the famous oil man, H.L. Hunt of Dallas, Texas. Drilling commenced on January 10, 1944, and was completed approximately one month later. The well struck oil at a depth of 2,580 feet in fractured Selma chalk. The discovery of this well led to the creation of the State Oil and Gas Board of Alabama in 1945, and to the development and growth of the petroleum industry in the State.

Office of Economic Opportunity.    The grants were awarded to 107 nonprofit organizations and 3 local government    units operating 134 facilities for homeless people in 55 counties. (You may    access a complete list of grant recipients in PDF format on the Internet at    the following address:  www.dhhs.state.nc.us/pressrel/sheltergrants.pdf .    A free PDF reader is available at:  www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html .)     The Office of Economic Opportunity, a division of the N.C. Department of Health    and Human Services, strives to help families pursue economic independence. The    grant program is designed to provide needed social services to homeless individuals    and families with children, improve the quality of existing shelters, help meet    the costs of operating emergency shelters and transitional housing programs,    and provide programs and activities that prevent homelessness.    Agencies receiving grants are in the following counties: Alamance, Beaufort,    Buncombe, Burke, Cabarrus, Caldwell, Carteret, Caswell, Catawba, Chatham, Cherokee,    Cleveland Columbus, Craven, Cumberland, Dare, Davidson, Durham, Edgecombe, Forsyth,    Gaston, Granville, Guilford, Haywood, Henderson, Iredell, Jackson, Johnston,    Lee, Macon, McDowell, Mecklenburg, Montgomery, Moore, Nash, New Hanover, Orange,    Onslow, Pasquotank, Pitt, Richmond, Robeson, Rockingham, Rowan, Rutherford,    Scotland, Surry, Swain, Union, Vance, Wake, Watauga, Wayne, Wilkes and Wilson.     The 1990 census found that 13 percent or 830,000 people in North Carolina live    in poverty. While many are employed, their wages are too low to cover their    basic needs for food, clothing and shelter.    The grant recipients depend on the funds from the Emergency Shelter Grant program    to provide shelter and needed services to homeless people in their local communities.    There are thousands of homeless people in North Carolina on any given night.    Of those, an estimated 60 percent are women and children.    Leading causes of homelessness in North Carolina are unemployment/underemployment,    alcohol and substance abuse, mental illness, eviction, domestic violence/sexual    assault, release from prison, child abuse and neglect, parental/child conflict,    natural disasters and HIV/AIDS.    The grants are available to non-profit organizations and general divisions    of local government that have operated an emergency shelter or transitional    housing facility for at least one year prior to the date of application for    funds and meet other program eligibility requirements.    The ESG program is authorized under the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance    Act of 1988 and is administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban    Development. Grants awarded in 1998 helped recipients in North Carolina provide    shelter and services to more than 43,000 homeless people in the state.              # # #                                        Public Affairs Office 101 Blair Drive, Raleigh, NC 27603 (919)733-9190 FAX (919)733-7447                   Debbie Crane Director
GX233-43-9606866	"Long Term Care in North Carolina              Housing and Retirement in North Carolina Frequently Asked Questions   The following questions/answers have been developed to assist persons who need information regarding housing options in North Carolina.       Does North Carolina offer special housing tax benefits for older citizens ?   What types of retirement housing are available in NC ?   I have never been to NC, but I have heard that it is a good place to retire so I'm making plans to move there now.  Do you have any advice ?   Where would be the best areas to look for a retirement community for someone on a fixed income ?   Where can I find information about available retirement housing in North Carolina ?   What about leisure-living retirement communities for active retirees which are comparable to ""Sun City"" in Florida and certain other states ?        Does North Carolina offer special housing tax benefits for older citizens?     North Carolina offers older and disabled homeowners the  Homestead Exemption , which provides qualifying homeowners a reduction on their property tax. The first $20,000 in appraised value of a permanent residence owned and occupied by a qualified owner is excluded from taxation. A qualifying owner: (1) is at least 65 years of age or totally and permanently disabled; (2) has an income for the preceding calendar year of not more than $15,000; and (3) is a North Carolina resident.    For more information, you can contact your local county tax office or  area agency on aging  that serves your county.        What types of retirement housing are available in NC?       Retirement housing  for independent living can be divided into two general categories. They are:      Independent housing/congregate housing for older adults that may or may not provide supportive services. Such housing may be privately owned with market rate rentals only, or it may be subsidized housing for persons who qualify based on income. Contact the  Area Agency on Aging  serving the county in which you are interested for a list of such properties.    Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs), which offer independent living (apartments, villas, some detached homes), meals and other services and amenities for active retirees. In addition, licensed nursing home care and/or licensed assisted living are available if needed. Because CCRCs guarantee certain health and/or personal care through a contractual agreement, they are regarded as an insurance product and regulated by the NC Department of Insurance. Contact the  area agency on aging  serving the county in which you are interested for a list of such properties. You can also contact the  Department of Insurance , Box 26387, Raleigh, NC 27611, 919/733-5633 or call toll-free within North Carolina through CARE-LINE, Information Referral Service, 1-800-662-7030 and ask to be connected to this agency.       I have never been to NC, but I have heard that it is a good place to retire so I'm making plans to move there now. Do you have any advice?      Relocating for retirement is a big step, but  resource information  is available to help with the process.  Such a major move has the greatest potential for success when retirees move to an area with which they are already well acquainted, and where family members or close friends can serve as a support network. It is important to have well-planned arrangements for housing, transportation, medical care, living costs, social needs, and finances before making a move.  It is beneficial for potential retirees to arrange for an extended stay in any area they are considering before making a commitment.  This allows an opportunity to develop a realistic sense of surroundings, differences in climate, cost of living, available services, and day-to-day life before making firm plans. Many rural areas and even cities may not offer the public transportation options that one may now depend on. Medical facilities and costs may differ in various parts of the country.  Our best advice is look before you leap. Out of state relocation can be expensive and complicated if you end up needing to ""re-relocate!""     Where would be the best areas to look for a retirement community for someone on a fixed income?      Cost of living rates vary considerably across the state, with highly urbanized areas such as the Triangle (Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill) generally having higher costs. Unfortunately housing demand by growing numbers of older North Carolinians has created waiting lists for many retirement communities, particularly those of moderate cost. We highly recommend spending some time in the area you are considering so that you can visit potential communities and learn about them first hand.  The  Elder Housing Locator Service  and Housing links on the Division of Aging web site provide information on options available for individuals on a fixed income.     Where can I find information about available retirement housing in North Carolina?     You an find  information on housing  specifically planned for older adults, including subsidized housing.  You should first narrow your search to one or two areas of the state.  Also, the area  agency on aging  that serves the county(ies) in which you are interested, can direct you to various local sources of information or send you a listing of types of housing in the area. You may also want to review our  North Carolina Elder Housing Locator Service .     What about leisure-living retirement communities for active retirees which are comparable to ""Sun City"" in Florida and certain other states?      In North Carolina, there are a few leisure-living communities for active retirees, although at this point, we are not aware of any NC retirement communities on the scale of Sun City. The existing communities may offer building sites, single-family homes, condos or manufactured homes. Because such communities are not required to be licensed or registered with the state, they are not as easy for our office to identify and update. For such properties and for other single-family homes, town homes or apartments, contact a private real estate agency in the town of your interest, or the local chamber of commerce.

The red imported fire ant was first detected in the United States in Alabama in 1918. It was first identified in the southeastern part of North Carolina in Brunswick County in 1957.                Portions or entire areas of  57 of North Carolina's 100 counties  are considered generally infested with red imported fire ants. The NCDA&CS issues certification and compliance agreements to individuals and industries engaged in the movement of potentially contaminated commodities  (regulated articles)  to reduce man assisted movement of these ants.                Within the infested areas, the NCDA&CS maintains a Community Assistance Program to assist local citizens in the identification of efficacious and environmentally sound control measures.

One of our first steps to facilitate this objective is to ensure that your agency is aware of the duty of permitting authorities to notify Tribal Governments of issuance of title V permits to sources located near indian country.       The requirements of 40 CFR section 70.8(b) establish that a permitting authority shall ""give notice of each draft permit to any affected state"" on or before the time that the permitting authority provides notice to the public under 40 CFR section 70.7(h).  Section 301(d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) authorizes the Administrator to treat Indian tribes as states.  Even though the definition of ""affected state"" in 40 CFR section 70.2 does not clearly establish the status of Indian tribes, the CAA specifies that unless the Administrator makes a determination deeming inappropriate to treat Indian tribes as states, they should be afforded the same treatment.  Therefore, title V permitting authorities must ensure that proper notification is given to the government of an Indian tribe as required by 40 CFR section 70.8(b).       To assist you in determining whether a permit action affects an Indian tribe, we are providing you with a listing of the counties in where the indian country areas in Region 4 are located, and the name and address of the environmental contact for the Indian tribes to whom correspondence should be addressed. If you need any additional information or have any questions about the contents of this letter, please contact Gracy R. Danois, Air Division Tribal Coordinator at 404/562-9119.                                Sincerely,                                /s/                                R.

GX266-38-8981287	"A Message from N.C. I n s u ran ce Commis s i on er Jim Long  Dear Consumer: The North Carolina Department of Insurance is proud to present the 2003 edition of the Continuing Care Retirement Communities Reference Guide. This guide has been compiled by the North Carolina Department of Insurance to assist prospective residents in their search for a continuing care retirement community (CCRC) in North Carolina. CCRCs are unique to the area of long-term care in that they provide a continuum of care to older adults under a contract for the life of an individual, or for a period longer than one year. Continuing care laws in North Carolina are designed to give you, the consumer, full disclosure concerning a community prior to the execution of a contract for continuing care. These laws exist for your benefit. I urge you to read the disclosure statement and the contract provided to you by a continuing care provider, and to ask questions if you are unsure of any of the provisions contained within them. If necessary, seek professional advice from an attorney and/or accountant. If you have any questions, please contact the Continuing Care Retirement Communities Section of the North Carolina Department of Insurance at (919) 733-5633, extension 249 or 268.  Sincerely,  Jim Long Commissioner   C  OVER STORY  For the first time, the North Carolina Department of Insurance held a Cover Art Contest for the 2003 edition of the Continuing Care Retirement Communities Reference Guide. Contestants were restricted to residents of continuing care retirement communities licensed and regulated by the North Carolina Department of Insurance. Each entry was requested to exemplify, in some manner, life at a continuing care retirement community. Artwork had to be of the contestants own creation, and could not be copied or duplicated from previously published artwork. Photography was not allowed. Each entry also had to be accompanied by a short description describing how the artwork related to the contest theme. The winning entry was selected based on artistic quality, tastefulness, reproducibility, and depiction of theme.  Winning Entry: Artist: Kitty O'Meallie (also known as Kitty Johnson)  Title of Work: ""...So Blessed..."" Type of Medium: Pencil and Pastel Community: Glenaire  Artist's Description: She's 101, predictable pains. She's black, can barely walk. But she's all smiles, constantly saying, ""I am so Blessed!"" She's in Glenaire's Continuing Care Community and also echoes views of Independent Residents...singing, golf, sightseeing, bridge, lectures, music, and more. ""Don't call us a Nursing Home"", they say, ""We are truly BLESSED!""  In addition to Ms. O'Meallie (Johnson), The North Carolina Department of Insurance would also like to thank each of the following individuals who participated in the Cover Art Contest: ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

Continuing care is defined by the North Carolina General Statutes as, ""... the furnishing to an individual other than an individual related by blood, marriage, or adoption to the person furnishing the care, of lodging together with nursing services, medical services, or other health related services pursuant to an agreement effective for the life of the individual or for a period longer than one year."" In general, CCRCs are communities that provide a continuum of care to older adults under a contract for the life of an individual or for a period longer than one year. Typically there are three levels/stages of care offered by CCRCs: 1. Independent Living  is for individuals who are capable of doing the basic chores of everyday life but who may need occasional help from others. 2. Assisted Living  provides assistance for residents with chronic care needs excluding complete 24-hour skilled nursing care. Assisted living services include helping a resident with bathing, dressing, taking medications, and other daily activities. 3. Skilled Nursing Care  generally provides 24-hour nursing care, rehabilitative services, and assistance with activities of daily living to the chronically ill as well as those who have been hospitalized for an illness or operation and require a short period of rehabilitation before returning home. CCRCs are generally a collection of apartments, town homes, or cottages and include common activity areas such as a library, activity and craft rooms, a restaurant-like dining room, an assisted living facility, and a nursing home. Other amenities often include banking services, convenience stores, a golf course, walking trails, gardens, swimming pool, fitness center, beauty/barber shops, and guest accommodations.  ENTRANCE FEES There is usually a large up front payment called an entrance fee required to enter a CCRC. The amount of the entrance fee may depend on the size and type of dwelling you choose, your age, or the type of refund plan you choose. Entrance fees for North Carolina CCRCs range from a few thousand dollars to near $500,000. However, a typical entrance fee would range anywhere from $50,000 to $150,000. Entrance fee refund plans typically fall within one of the following categories: 1. Full Refund  Full refunds are rare, but sometimes offered. A fixed charge may be deducted before the refund is made and the agreement will state for how long the refund is valid and usually under what conditions a refund is due. Entry fees that  I   North Carolina Department of Insurance Continuing Care Retirement Communities Reference Guide ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________  offer full refunds are typically more expensive than those without refunds or those that are refundable partially or on a declining basis. 2. Partial Refund  Partially refundable entry fees guarantee that a specific percentage of the entrance fee will be refunded. For example, certain contracts guarantee that ninety percent (90%) or fifty percent (50%) of the entrance fee will be refunded upon the death of the resident or termination of the contract. 3. Declining Refund  With this type of refund, the agreement made specifies a period of time during which the entrance fee will be refundable to the resident on a declining basis. For example, if a entrance fee is refundable and declines at the rate of one percent (1%) per month, then eight-eight percent (88%) of the entrance fee would be refundable after twelve (12) months. 4. No Refund  Under this type of contract no refund is given. In addition to the entrance fee, a resident is usually expected to pay a monthly fee. Monthly fees for CCRCs in North Carolina can range from several hundred dollars up to just over $3,000. However, monthly fees will typically fall within the $1,100 to $2,000 per month range.  D  ISCLOSURE STATEMENT  One of the most important documents you will receive from a CCRC will be the disclosure statement. This document is required by law to be given to the person with whom a continuing care contract is being entered into, at the time of, or prior to, the transfer of any money or other property to a provider by, or on behalf of, a prospective resident. N.C.G.S. 58-64-20 requires the text of the disclosure statement to contain certain disclosure. Since the required disclosure is quite lengthy, it will not be addressed here, however, you are highly encouraged to obtain a copy of the statute and to become familiar with the required disclosure. Take your time reading the disclosure statement, and do not be pressured into signing any contract until you have had ample time to read and understand the information contained within it. If after reading the disclosure statement you are confused, or have questions, ask for clarification. You are also highly encouraged to seek professional advice from an attorney and/or accountant prior to signing any contract for continuing care.  C  ONTINUING  C  ARE  C  ONTRACTS  Probably the most distinguishing feature of a CCRC is the contract. A contract is typically defined as a binding agreement between two or more persons or parties. In order for a contract to be considered a continuing care contract, it must provide for lodging, together with nursing services, medical services, or other health related services, and be either for the life of an individual or for a period longer than one year.  T  YPES OF  CONTRACTS  II   North Carolina Department of Insurance Continuing Care Retirement Communities Reference Guide ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________  CCRCs typically offer one (or more) of the following types of agreements or contracts: 1. Extensive  Extensive contracts provide housing, residential services, and healthrelated services in exchange for a price, usually consisting of an entrance fee and a monthly fee. No additional fees are generally required as one moves from one level of service to another. 2. Modified  Modified contracts provide housing, residential services, and a specified amount of health-related services in exchange for an entrance fee and a monthly fee. Healthrelated services are provided at a subsidized rate or are free for a specified number of days. 3. Fee-for-Service  Fee-for-Service contracts provide housing, residential services, and guaranteed access to health-related services in exchange for an entrance fee and a monthly fee. Health related services are provided at the going, full per-diem rate. 4. Equity  Equity contracts involve an actual real estate purchase, with a transfer of ownership of the unit. Health-related service arrangements vary.  REQUIRED PROV  ISIONS  Although contracts may vary from community to community, all must, according to N.C.G.S. 58-64-25, contain certain provisions. Detailed below are the provisions that each provider must include within their contract for continuing care: 1. The party contracting with the provider may rescind the contract within 30 days following the later of the execution of the contract or the receipt of a disclosure statement that meets the requirements of N.C.G.S. 58-64. 2. The resident to whom the contract pertains is not required to move into the facility before the expiration of the 30-day rescission period. 3. If a resident dies before occupying a living unit in the facility, or if, on account of illness, injury, or incapacity, a resident would be precluded from occupying a living unit in the facility under the terms of the contract for continuing care, the contract is automatically cancelled. 4. If a contract is cancelled during the 30-day rescission period or if a resident dies before moving into a unit then the resident or the residents legal representative shall receive a refund of all money or property transferred to the provider less: - Periodic charges specified in the contract and applicable only to the period a living unit was actually occupied by the resident; - Those nonstandard costs specifically incurred by the provider or facility at the request of the resident and described in the contract or any contract amendment signed by the resident; - Nonrefundable fees, if set out in the contract; - A reasonable service charge, if set out in the contract, not to exceed the greater of one thousand dollars ($1,000) or two percent (2%) of the entrance fee. 5. The total consideration to be paid.  III   North Carolina Department of Insurance Continuing Care Retirement Communities Reference Guide ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________  6. The services to be provided. 7. The procedures the provider shall follow to change the resident's accommodation if necessary for the protection of the health or safety of the resident or the general and economic welfare of the residents. 8. The policies to be implemented if the resident cannot pay the periodic fees. 9. The terms governing the refund of any portion of the entrance fee in the event of discharge by the provider or cancellation by the resident. 10. The policy regarding increasing the periodic fees. 11. The description of the living quarters. 12. Any religious or charitable affiliations of the provider and the extent, if any, to which the affiliate organization will be responsible for the financial and contractual obligations of the provider. 13. Any property rights of the resident. 14. The policy, if any, regarding fee adjustments if the resident is voluntarily absent from the facility. 15. Any requirement, if any, that the resident apply for Medicaid, public assistance, or any public benefit program.  A  NNUAL  D  ISCLOSURE STATEMENT  R  EVISION  Pursuant to N.C.G.S. 58-64-30, every licensed provider must file with the North Carolina Department of Insurance a revised disclosure statement, setting forth current information required pursuant to N.C.G.S. 58-64-20, within 150 days following the end of each fiscal year. The revised disclosure statement must be made available to all of the residents of the facility.  C  ONTINUING  C  ARE  A  DVISORY  C  OMMITTEE  Pursuant to N.C.G.S. 58-64-80, there is a nine member Continuing Care Advisory Committee that serves in an advisory capacity to both the Commissioner of Insurance and the Continuing Care Retirement Communities Section of the North Carolina Department of Insurance. Members of the Committee are appointed by the Commissioner of Insurance and serve on the Committee for a two-year term. By law the Committee is to consist of at least two facility residents, two representatives of the North Carolina Association of Non-Profit Homes for the Aging (NCANPHA), one individual who is a certified public accountant and licensed to practice in the State of North Carolina, one individual skilled in the field of architecture or engineering, and one individual who is a health care professional.  IV   North Carolina Department of Insurance Continuing Care Retirement Communities Reference Guide ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________  A list of the current Continuing Care Advisory Committee members may be obtained by contacting the Continuing Care Retirement Communities Section at (919) 733-5633, extension 249 or 268.  O  PERATING  R  ESERVES  All licensed CCRCs are required, pursuant to N.C.G.S. 58-64-33, to maintain, after opening, operating reserves equal to fifty percent (50%) of the total operating costs projected for the twelve month period following the period covered by the most recent annual statement filed with the North Carolina Department of Insurance. However, if a facility maintains an occupancy level (independent and assisted living) in excess of ninety percent (90%), then the facility only has to maintain a twenty-five percent (25%) operating reserve. Operating reserves are to be funded by cash, by invested cash, or by investment grade securities, including bonds, stocks, U.S. Treasury obligations, or obligations of U.S. government agencies. Operating reserves can only be released upon the approval of the Commissioner.  R SELF-ORGANIZATION  IGHT TO  O  RGANIZATION  N.C.G.S. 58-64-40 gives residents of licensed CCRCs the right of self-organization, the right to be represented by an individual of his or her own choosing, and the right to engage in concerted activities to keep informed on the operation of the facility in which they are a resident or for mutual aid or protection. SEMI-ANNUAL MEETINGS N.C.G.S. 58-64-40 requires the board of directors or other governing body of a facility, or its representative, to hold semi-annual meetings with the residents of its' facility for free discussions of subjects including, but not limited to, income, expenditures, and financial trends and problems as they apply to the facility, and discussions of proposed changes in policies, programs and services. In addition, upon request of the most representative residents' organization, a member of the governing body of the provider, such as a board member, a general partner, or a principal owner shall attend such meetings. All residents are entitled to at least seven days advance notice of each meeting, and any agenda or other materials that are distributed by the governing body are to be made available upon request to all residents.

SHIIP stands for Seniors' Health Insurance Information Program. SHIIP is a consumer information division of the North Carolina Department of Insurance that helps Medicare beneficiaries and their families with Medicare, Medicare supplements, Medicare+Choice and long-term care insurance questions.  How does SHIIP work? SHIIP provides education and assistance to North Carolinians in three ways: ! by operating a Toll Free consumer information phone line, Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. ! by training volunteer senior citizens to counsel other seniors within their community about Medicare, Medicare supplements, Medicare+Choice and long-term care insurance, and ! by offering educational materials for consumer's use and speaking to civic, community, church and other groups about Medicare and other senior health issues.  When was SHIIP started? The program was founded in 1986 by Insurance Commissioner, Jim Long, in direct response to the growing concerns about health insurance for the more than 800,000 senior citizens in North Carolina. More than 70 different insurance companies sell Medicare supplements, Medicare+Choice, long-term care insurance and other medical insurance products to seniors in North Carolina. Because there are so many companies, and because the Medicare system is so complex, Commissioner Long says he felt there needed to be an objective information service for senior consumers, so he founded SHIIP.  How do North Carolinians contact SHIIP? You can contact SHIIP by dialing the Toll Free consumer line, 1-800-443-9354 or by visiting the website at www.ncshiip.com. There are also trained SHIIP volunteer counselors in all 100 counties of North Carolina who are coordinated through an existing human service agency such as the Council on Aging or the Cooperative Extension in each county. If your problem is too complex to handle over the phone, you will need to contact your local SHIIP coordinator for a one-on-one appointment with a SHIIP volunteer.  Can I get more information on SHIIP? Yes! Call SHIIP at 1-800-443-9354 and ask for more details on the Seniors' Health Insurance Information Program and how it can help you. 111 Seaboard Avenue# Raleigh, NC # 27601# 919-733-0111# 1-800-443-9354 # www.ncshiip.com"
