GX058-03-12283898	The following material is from  Natural Resource Year in Review--1997 , published by the National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, in April 1998 (publication D-1247)       Chapter 5: RESTORATION     Issue Update     A new twist in the Elwha River ecosystem restoration by  Brian Winter  (Elwha Project Coordinator; Olympic National Park, Washington)      The Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act (P.L.   102-495) authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire and   remove the Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams on the Elwha River (Washington)   if that action is needed to fully restore the ecosystem and native   anadromous fisheries. In a report to the Congress and in an environmental   impact statement (EIS), the Secretary concluded that the removal   of both dams is necessary.      Through fiscal year 1998, $11 million has been appropriated for   Elwha Dam acquisition. Additional funds to acquire the dams may   be available from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Washington   Senator Slade Gorton, a previous opponent of dam removal, now   supports acquisition of both dams, removal of the lower dam (Elwha),   and determination of the upper dam's (Glines Canyon–within Olympic   National Park) fate following documentation of salmon restoration   for 12 years after removal of the Elwha Dam.      Meeting Senator Gorton's proposal will require the development   of a supplemental EIS; the “phased removal” option was rejected   originally because of the added environmental impacts from two   distinct dam removal periods as opposed to simultaneous removal,   additional cost, and the delay in meeting the goal of the act.   Removal of just the lower dam (outside the park) will result in,   at most, the restoration of 30,000 salmon and steelhead compared   to the 392,000 that can be restored with both dams removed. Nevertheless,   Senator Gorton's proposal would allow the restoration process   to move forward. Funding to complete acquisition and removal of   the Elwha Dam will be decided in early 1998.

The continuing   increase in the number of nests at the park–nine during 1997–may   signal the success of a two-decade, international, multiagency   effort to establish a secondary nesting colony of this species   at the seashore.]      [photo not shown] Removal of the Glines Canyon Dam (shown) and   its downstream companion, the Elwha Dam, is necessary to fully   restore the native salmon and steelhead fishery in the Elwha River   drainage within and adjacent to Olympic National Park (Washington).

GX103-47-10938086	[Federal Register: July 20, 2000 (Volume 65, Number 140)] [Notices]                [Page 45099-45100] From the Federal Register Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov] [DOCID:fr20jy00-88]                           -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR  Fish and Wildlife Service    Availability of an Environmental Action Statement and Receipt of  an Application for a Permit To Enhance the Survival of the Northern  Idaho Ground Squirrel in Adams County, Idaho Under a Safe Harbor  Agreement  AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.  ACTION: Notice of availability.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: Bob and Peggy Mack (Applicants) have applied to the Fish and  Wildlife Service (Service) for an enhancement of a survival permit  pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(A) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973,  as amended. The permit application includes a proposed Safe Harbor  Agreement (Agreement) between the Applicants and the Service. The  Agreement and permit application are available for public comment.     The Agreement allows for management and conservation of the  threatened northern Idaho ground squirrel (Spermophilus brunneus  brunneus) on approximately 14 acres of private land, owned by the  Applicants, approximately 5.5 miles northwest of New Meadows, Idaho.  Northern Idaho ground squirrels currently occupy less than 5 of the 14  acres. The proposed duration of the Agreement is 10 years, and the  proposed term of the enhancement of a survival permit is 20 years.     Under the Agreement, a 5-acre area, which includes all the habitat  currently occupied by northern Idaho ground squirrels on the  Applicants' property, is identified as a protected area. This 5-acre  protected area would have a baseline greater than zero (0), and no  incidental take would be authorized under the permit within this area.  The Agreement allows for a variety of conservation measures to be  carried out by the Service within the 5-acre protected area to benefit  the conservation of northern Idaho ground squirrels. The permit would  authorize the Applicants to return the 9 acres outside of the 5-acre  protected area to the existing baseline condition of zero (0) northern  Idaho ground squirrels. We expect this Agreement to result in a net  conservation benefit by enhancing northern Idaho ground squirrel  habitat within the 5-acre protected area, and expanding the northern  Idaho ground squirrel population to lands outside the protected area.  Recovery of northern Idaho ground squirrels is expected to be enhanced  under the Agreement by improving habitat, expanding the northern Idaho  ground squirrel population at this site, and potentially providing a  population with surplus individuals for transplanting to other sites in  need of supplementation. Under the Agreement, the Applicants will  receive funding under the Service's Endangered Species Act Private  Landowner Incentive Program.     The Service has made a preliminary determination that the proposed  Agreement and permit application are eligible for categorical exclusion  under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. We explain the  basis for this determination in an Environmental Action Statement,  which also is available for public review.     We request comments from the public on the permit application, and  Agreement. All comments we receive, including names and addresses, will  become part of the administrative record and may be released to the  public.  DATES: Written comments should be received on or before August 21,  2000.  ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to Dennis Mackey, Project  Biologist, Fish and Wildlife Service, 1387 S. Vinnell Way, Room 368,  Boise, Idaho 83709 (telephone: 208/378-5267; facsimile: 208/378-5262).  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dennis Mackey at the above address or  telephone 208/378-5267.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Document Availability      You may obtain copies of the documents for review by contacting the  individual named above. You also may make an appointment to view the  documents at the above address during normal business hours. The  documents are also available electronically on the World Wide Web at   http://www.fws.gov/r1srbo/ .  Background      Under a Safe Harbor Agreement, participating property owners  voluntarily undertake management activities on their property to  enhance, restore, or maintain habitat benefitting species listed under  the Endangered Species Act. Safe Harbor Agreements encourage private  and other non-Federal property owners to implement conservation efforts  for listed species by assuring property owners they will not be  subjected to increased property use restrictions if their efforts  attract listed species to their property or increase the numbers or  distribution of listed species already on their property. Application  requirements and issuance criteria for enhancement of survival permits  through Safe Harbor Agreements are found in 50 CFR 17.22(c).     We have worked with the Applicants to develop the proposed  Agreement for the conservation of northern Idaho ground squirrels on  their 14 acres of land in Adams County, Idaho. Less than 5 of the 14  acres are currently occupied by northern Idaho ground squirrels. Under  the proposed Agreement, the Applicants will: (1) Protect 5 acres of  occupied, suitable northern Idaho ground squirrel habitat from land use  activities that may result in ``take'' of ground squirrels; (2) allow  Service personnel access to the property to conduct ground squirrel  conservation activities such as habitat enhancement, artificial  feeding, ground squirrel surveys, and translocation of excess ground  squirrels should the current population expand beyond the 5-acre  protected area; (3) if appropriate, in cooperation with the Service,  develop signs to discourage shooting of ground squirrels; and (4) work  cooperatively with the Service on other issues  [[Page 45100]]  necessary to further the purposes of the Agreement.     Threats to the northern Idaho ground squirrel include: habitat loss  due to seral forest encroachment into suitable meadow habitats;  competition from Columbian ground squirrels (Spermophilus columbianus);  land use changes; recreational shooting; and naturally occurring  events. The Agreement provides a net conservation benefit to northern  Idaho ground squirrels by providing measures for ground squirrel  habitat protection and enhancement, managing competition from Columbian  ground squirrels, and controlling recreational shooting. The biological  goal of ground squirrel conservation measures in the Agreement is to  expand the northern Idaho ground squirrel population at this site  beyond the 5-acre protected area by reducing threats to the species.  The Agreement is expected to contribute to recovery of northern Idaho  ground squirrels by reducing threats and expanding the ground squirrel  population at this site. Recovery of the species would be enhanced by  increasing the viability of the population at this site and potentially  allowing ground squirrels to be translocated to other sites in need of  population supplementation.     Consistent with the Service's Safe Harbor policy, under the  Agreement, the Service would issue a permit to the Applicants  authorizing incidental take of northern Idaho ground squirrels, as a  result of activities on 9 acres of their property, outside the 5-acre  protected area. These activities include construction and use of the  Applicants' house, garage, and other associated out-buildings proposed  for development on the property; installation of a well, underground  power and telephone lines, a septic system/drainfield, and other  required utilities; and operation of all terrain vehicles. We expect  that the maximum level of incidental take authorized under the proposed  Agreement will never be realized. The level of incidental take would be  dependent on if, and how rapidly, northern Idaho ground squirrels  expand beyond the 5-acre protected area.     We are providing this notice pursuant to section 10(c) of the  Endangered Species Act and pursuant to implementing regulations for the  National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1506.6). We will evaluate the  permit application, associated documents, and comments submitted  thereon to determine whether the permit application meets the  requirements of section 10(a) of the Endangered Species Act and  National Environmental Policy Act regulations. If we determine that the  requirements are met, we will sign the proposed Agreement and issue an  enhancement of survival permit under section 10(a)(1)(A) of the  Endangered Species Act to the Applicants for take of northern Idaho  ground squirrels incidental to otherwise lawful activities in  accordance with the terms of the Agreement. We will not make our final  decision until after the end of the 30-day comment period and will  fully consider all comments received during the comment period.      Dated: July 3, 2000. William F. Shake, Acting Deputy Regional Director, Fish and Wildlife Service, Portland,  Oregon. [FR Doc.  00 - 18182   Filed  7-19- 00 ; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310-55-P

The season is open statewide from August 18 through January 31, 2002, except during the week of deer gun hunting season.           The daily bag limit for squirrels, which includes fox squirrels, gray squirrels, and red squirrels, is four. Squirrels may be hunted from one-half hour before sunrise to sunset.           ""This should be a good year for Ohio squirrel hunters,"" said Mike Reynolds, ODNR Division of Wildlife squirrel project leader. ""Last fall's abundant crop of acorns, beechnuts and hickory nuts is a good indicator of squirrel populations for this season in most areas of the state.""           When acorns and assorted nut crops -- also referred to as mast crops - are plentiful, they provide squirrels with storable winter food and result in improved winter survival and better reproductive success for the animals. The mast crop index for last year was up nearly 25 percent over 1999.           Reynolds encourages all squirrel hunters to promptly field dress and cool harvested game. ""With the season starting in August there will be many days of high temperatures where hunters will want to quickly cool their harvest.""           Hunters can still use their 2000 hunting license through August 31, after which a 2001 hunting license is required.                                       -30-                            For Further Information Contact:           Vicki Mountz, ODNR Division of Wildlife           (614) 265-6393 or           Mike Reynolds, ODNR Division of Wildlife           (740) 664-2745"

Col. William Daniel of the West Virginia Division of          Natural Resources. Investigating conservation officer Robert Waybright          reports that Hoover was struck in the upper left abdomen with the path          of the shot going into his upper chest.         This is the first hunting          related incident reported in 2000. In 1999, 40 hunting related incidents          were reported, including 10 fatalities. Of those fatalities, three were          accidently self-inflicted, four were caused by heart attacks, two were          caused as a result of falling out of tree stands, and one is of unknown          cause.         The chances of being injured          or killed while hunting can be greatly reduced by taking a free hunter          education class, sponsored by the Law Enforcement Section of the Division          of Natural Resources and held across the state.

On October 16, 59-year old          Robert M. Pigott of Southington, Ohio received injuries to the right shoulder          and ribs when he fell out of a tree stand while bow hunting for deer in          the Pheasant Run area of Randolph County, according to investigating Conservation          Officer Rocky Spencer. He was reported in stable condition at a local          hospital soon after the incident.         On October 17, 41-year old          Curtis A. Naylor of Chloe, West Virginia, was injured in the left arm          when a loaded shotgun he was carrying on an all terrain vehicle (ATV)          discharged while he was returning home after hunting squirrel in the Walnut          area of Calhoun County. He was treated at Charleston Area Medical Center.          DNR Law Enforcement Sgt. Tom Fox reports charges may be filed pending          completion of an investigation.         On October 21, 58-year old          Aaron James Culver of Summersville died of an apparent heart attack while          turkey hunting in the Phillips Run area of Nicholas County, according          to Conservation Officer C.

ACTION: Final rule.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: We, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), list the Santa  Barbara County Distinct Vertebrate Population Segment (DPS) of the  California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) as endangered  under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Of six  habitat complexes, consisting of 27 documented breeding sites and  associated uplands, five have suffered moderate to severe levels of  habitat destruction or degradation between 1996 and 2000. Plans to  convert additional sites from grazing to intensive agriculture are  being developed and implemented. We emergency listed the population  segment on January 19, 2000.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Background      The California tiger salamander was first described as a distinct  species, Ambystoma californiense, by Gray in 1853 from specimens  collected in Monterey (Grinnell and Camp 1917). Storer (1925) and  Bishop (1943) likewise considered the California tiger salamander as a  distinct species. However, Dunn (1940), Gehlbach (1967), and Frost  (1985) considered the California tiger salamander a subspecies  (Ambystoma tigrinum californiense) that belonged within the A. tigrinum  complex. Based on recent morphological and genetic work, geographic  isolation, and ecological differences among the members of the A.  tigrinum complex, the California tiger salamander is considered to be a  distinct species (Shaffer and Stanley 1991; Jones 1993; Shaffer and  McKnight 1996; Irschick and Shaffer 1997). The California tiger  salamander was recognized as a distinct species in the November 21,  1991, Animal Notice of Review (56 FR 58804).     The California tiger salamander is a large, stocky, terrestrial  salamander with a broad, rounded snout. Adults may reach a total length  of 207 millimeters (mm) (8.2 inches (in)), with males generally  averaging about 200 mm (8 in) in total length and females averaging  about 170 mm (6.8 in) in total length. For both sexes, the average  snout--vent length is approximately 90 mm (3.6 in). The small eyes have  black irises and protrude from the head. Coloration consists of white  or pale yellow spots or bars on a black background on the back and  sides. The belly varies from almost uniform white or pale yellow to a  variegated pattern of white or pale yellow and black. Males can be  distinguished from females, especially during the breeding season, by  their swollen cloacae (a common chamber into which the intestinal,  urinary, and reproductive canals discharge), more developed tail fins,  and larger overall size (Stebbins 1962; Loredo and Van Vuren 1996).     California tiger salamanders are restricted to California, and  their range does not overlap with any other species of tiger salamander  (Stebbins 1985). Within California, the Santa Barbara County population  is separated by the Coast Ranges, particularly the La Panza and Sierra  Madre Ranges, and the Carrizo Plain from the closest other population,  which extends into the Temblor Range in eastern San Luis Obispo and  western Kern Counties (Shaffer et al. 1993).     The California tiger salamander inhabits low elevation, typically  below 427 meters (m) (1400 feet (ft)), vernal pools and seasonal ponds  and the associated grassland, oak savannah, and coastal scrub plant  communities of the Santa Maria, Los Alamos, and Santa Rita Valleys in  western Santa Barbara County (Shaffer et al. 1993; Sam Sweet,  University of California, Santa Barbara, in litt. 1993, 1998a, 2000a).  Although California tiger salamanders are adapted to natural vernal  pools, manmade or modified ephemeral and permanent pools are now  frequently used (Fisher and Shaffer 1996). California tiger salamanders  prefer open grassland to areas of continuous woody vegetation (Trenham  in revision). Although California tiger salamanders still exist across  most of their historic range in Santa Barbara County, the habitat  available to them has been reduced greatly. The ponds available to the  salamanders for breeding have been degraded and reduced in number and  the associated upland habitats inhabited by salamanders for most of  their life cycle have been degraded and reduced in area through changes  in agriculture practices, urbanization, building of roads and highways,  chemical applications, and overgrazing (S. Sweet in litt. 1993,  1998a,b; Gira et al. 1999; Santa Barbara County Planning and  Development 2000).     The salamanders breeding in and living around a pool or seasonal  pond, or a local complex of pools or seasonal ponds, constitute a local  subpopulation. The rate of natural movement of salamanders among  subpopulations depends on the distance between the ponds or complexes  and on the intervening habitat (e.g., salamanders may move more quickly  through sparsely covered and more open grassland versus more densely  vegetated scrublands).     Subadult and adult California tiger salamanders spend much of their  lives in small mammal burrows found in the upland component of their  habitat, particularly those of ground squirrels and pocket gophers  (Loredo and Van Vuren 1996) at depths ranging from 20 centimeters (cm)  (7.9 in) to 1 m (3.3 ft) beneath the ground surface (Trenham in  revision). California tiger salamanders use both occupied and  unoccupied small mammal burrows but, since burrows collapse within 18  months if not maintained, an active population of burrowing mammals is  necessary to sustain sufficient underground refugia for the species  (Loredo et al. 1996). California tiger salamanders may remain active  underground into summer, moving small distances within burrow systems  (Trenham in revision). During estivation (a state of dormancy or  inactivity in response to hot, dry weather), California tiger  salamanders eat very little (Shaffer et al. 1993). Once fall and winter  rains begin, they emerge from these retreats on nights of high relative  humidity and during rains to feed and to migrate to the breeding ponds  (Stebbins 1985, 1989; Shaffer et al. 1993).     Adults may migrate long distances between summering and breeding  sites. The distance from breeding sites may depend on local topography  and  [[Page 57243]]  vegetation, the distribution of ground squirrel or other rodent  burrows, and climatic conditions (Stebbins 1989, Hunt 1998). In Santa  Barbara County, juvenile California tiger salamanders have been trapped  more than 360 m (1,200 ft) away while dispersing from their natal  (birth) pond (Ted Mullen, Science Applications International  Corporation (SAIC), personal communication, 1998), and adults have been  found along roads more than 2 km (1.2 mi) from breeding ponds (S. Sweet  in litt. 1998a). Although most marked salamanders have been recaptured  at the pond where they were initially captured, in one study  approximately 20 percent of California tiger salamanders hatched in one  pond traveled to ponds a minimum of 580 m (1900 ft) away to breed  (Trenham 1998; Trenham et al. in review). Non-dispersing California  tiger salamanders, however, tend to stay closer to breeding ponds; 95  percent of California tiger salamanders at a study site in Monterey  County probably stay within 173 m (568 ft) of the pond in which they  bred. Once established in underground burrows, California tiger  salamanders may move short distances within burrows or overland to  other burrows, generally during wet weather. Dispersal distance is  closely tied to precipitation; California tiger salamanders travel  further in years with more precipitation (Trenham in revision). As with  migration distances, the number of ponds used by an individual over its  lifetime will be dependent on landscape features.     Migration to breeding ponds is concentrated during a few rainy  nights early in the winter, with males migrating before females (Twitty  1941; Shaffer et al. 1993; Loredo and Van Vuren 1996; Trenham 1998;  Trenham et al. 2000). Males usually remain in the ponds for an average  of 6 to 8 weeks, while females stay for approximately 1 to 2 weeks. In  dry years, both sexes may stay for shorter periods (Loredo and Van  Vuren 1996, Trenham 1998). In years where rainfall begins late in the  season, females may forego breeding altogether (Loredo and Van Vuren  1996, Trenham et al. 2000).     Female California tiger salamanders mate and lay their eggs singly  or in small groups (Twitty 1941; Shaffer et al. 1993). The number of  eggs laid by a single female ranges from approximately 400 to 1,300 per  breeding season (Trenham 1998). The eggs typically are attached to  vegetation near the edge of the breeding pond (Storer 1925, Twitty  1941), but in ponds with no or limited vegetation, they may be attached  to objects (rocks, boards, etc.) on the bottom (Jennings and Hayes  1994). After breeding, adults leave the pond and typically return to  small mammal burrows (Loredo et al. 1996; Trenham in revision),  although they may continue to come out nightly for approximately the  next 2 weeks to feed (Shaffer et al. 1993).     Eggs hatch in 10 to 14 days with newly hatched larvae ranging from  11.5 to 14.2 mm (0.45 to 0.56 in) in total length. Larvae feed on  algae, small crustaceans, and mosquito larvae for about 6 weeks after  hatching, when they switch to larger prey (P.R. Anderson 1968). Larger  larvae will consume smaller tadpoles of Pacific treefrogs (Hyla  regilla), California red-legged frogs (Rana aurora), western toads  (Bufo boreas), and spadefoot toads (Scaphiopus hammondii), as well as  many aquatic insects and other aquatic invertebrates (J.D. Anderson  1968; P.R. Anderson 1968). The larvae also will eat each other under  certain conditions (H.B. Shaffer and S. Sweet cited in Paul Collins,  Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, in litt. 2000a). Captive  salamanders appear to locate food by vision and smell (J.D. Anderson  1968).     Amphibian larvae must grow to a critical minimum body size before  they can metamorphose (change into a different physical form) to the  terrestrial stage (Wilbur and Collins 1973). Feaver (1971) found that  California tiger salamander larvae metamorphosed and left the breeding  ponds 60 to 94 days after the eggs had been laid, with larvae  developing faster in smaller, more rapidly drying ponds. In general,  the longer the ponding duration, the larger the larvae and  metamorphosed juveniles are able to grow. The larger juvenile  amphibians grow, the more likely they are to survive and reproduce  (Semlitsch et al. 1988; Morey 1998).     In the late spring or early summer, before the ponds dry  completely, metamorphosed juveniles leave the ponds and enter small  mammal burrows after spending up to a few days in mud cracks or tunnels  in moist soil near the water (Zeiner et al. 1988; Shaffer et al. 1993;  Loredo et al. 1996). Like the adults, juveniles may emerge from these  retreats to feed during nights of high relative humidity (Storer 1925;  Shaffer et al. 1993) before settling in their selected estivation sites  for the dry summer months. Newly metamorphosed juveniles range in size  from 41 to 78 mm (1.6 to 3.1 in) snout-vent length (Trenham et al.  2000).     Many of the pools in which California tiger salamanders lay eggs do  not hold water long enough for successful metamorphosis. Generally, 10  weeks is required to allow sufficient time to metamorphose. The larvae  will desiccate (dry out and perish) if a site dries before larvae  complete metamorphosis (P.R. Anderson 1968, Feaver 1971). Pechmann et  al. (1989) found a strong positive correlation with ponding duration  and total number of metamorphosing juveniles in five salamander  species. In one study, successful metamorphosis of California tiger  salamanders occurred only in larger pools with longer ponding durations  (Feaver 1971), which is typical range-wide (Jennings and Hayes 1994).  Even though there is little difference in the number of pools used by  salamanders between wet and dry years, pool duration is the most  important factor to consider in relation to persistence and survival  (Feaver 1971; Shaffer et al. 1993; Seymour and Westphal 1994, 1995).     Lifetime reproductive success for other tiger salamanders is  typically low, with fewer than 30 metamorphic juveniles per breeding  female. Trenham et al. (2000) found even lower numbers for California  tiger salamanders, with roughly 12 lifetime metamorphic offspring per  breeding female. In part, this is due to the extended length of time it  takes for California tiger salamanders to reach sexual maturity; most  do not breed until 4 or 5 years of age. While individuals may survive  for more than 10 years, less than 50 percent breed more than once  (Trenham et al. 2000). Combined with low survivorship of metamorphs (in  some populations, less than 5 percent of marked juveniles survive to  become breeding adults (Trenham 1998)), reproductive output in most  years is not sufficient to maintain populations. This suggests that the  species requires occasional ``boom'' breeding events to prevent  extirpation (temporary or permanent loss of the species from a  particular habitat) or extinction (Trenham et al. 2000). With such low  recruitment, isolated subpopulations can decline greatly from unusual,  randomly occurring natural events as well as from human-caused factors  that reduce breeding success and individual survival. Factors that  repeatedly lower breeding success in isolated ponds that are too far  from other ponds for migrating individuals to replenish the population  can quickly drive a local population to extinction.  Distinct Vertebrate Population Segment      The evidence supports recognition of Santa Barbara County  California tiger salamanders as a DPS for purposes of listing, as  defined in our February 7, 1996, Policy Regarding the Recognition of  Distinct Vertebrate Population Segments (61 FR 4722). The definition of  ``species'' in section 3(16) of the Act  [[Page 57244]]  includes ``any distinct population segment of any species of vertebrate  fish or wildlife which interbreeds when mature.'' When listing a  population under the Act as a DPS, three elements are considered--(1)  the discreteness of the population segment in relation to the remainder  of the species to which it belongs; (2) the significance of the  population segment to the species to which it belongs; and (3) the  population segment's conservation status in relation to the Act's  standards for listing (i.e., is the population segment, when treated as  if it were a species, endangered or threatened?) (61 FR 4722).     The DPS of California tiger salamanders in Santa Barbara County is  discrete in relation to the remainder of the species as a whole. The  DPS is geographically isolated and separate from other California tiger  salamanders; no mixing of the population with other California tiger  salamander populations occurs. As detailed below, this finding is  supported by an evaluation of the species' genetic variability.     Genetic analyses of the California tiger salamander suggest that  levels of interchange among populations are very low, and that  populations or subpopulations are genetically isolated from one another  (Jones 1993; Shaffer et al. 1993). Allozyme variation (distinct types  of enzymes (proteins) in the cells, which are formed from an  individual's inherited genes) and mitochondrial DNA sequence data  indicate the existence of at least seven genetically distinct  California tiger salamander populations (Shaffer et al. 1993). Although  the allozyme variation reported by Shaffer et al. (1993) is quite low,  it does indicate patterns of geographic isolation. Probably because of  this isolation, the population in Santa Barbara County is one of the  two most genetically distinct, and these salamanders are more similar  to California tiger salamanders on the eastern side of the Central  Valley than to those in the closest populations found in the Temblor  Range (Shaffer et al. 1993). The populations in the Temblor Range are  about 67.5 km or 44 mi by air, from the Santa Barbara County  population, while the eastern Central Valley populations are 200 km or  128 mi by air, across mountain ranges, an arid plain, and the Central  Valley, all of which are inhospitable zones for California tiger  salamanders. The Santa Barbara County population may be a relict  population of a much more widespread group that extended across the  area where the Tehachapi and Transverse Ranges now extend. The uplift  of those ranges changed the terrain and the local climatic conditions,  isolating salamanders in what is now northwestern Santa Barbara County.  The Temblor Range salamanders appear to be a more recent extension from  the populations south of San Francisco Bay. Based upon what is probably  the largest genetic data set for a non-human vertebrate (H. Bradley  Shaffer, University of California, Davis (UCD), in litt. 2000a), the  sequence divergence between the Santa Barbara County tiger salamanders  and other samples from throughout the species' range is on the order of  1.7 to 1.8 percent (Shaffer et al. 1993; H.B. Shaffer in litt. 1998,  2000a). Shaffer's mitochondrial DNA sequence data (Shaffer and McKnight  1996, and unpublished data) suggest that the seven distinct populations  differ markedly in their genetic characteristics, with Santa Barbara  County tiger salamanders having gene sequences not found in any other  California tiger salamander populations (H.B. Shaffer in litt. 1998).  California tiger salamanders in Santa Barbara County may have been  separated from the other populations for about 1 to 1.5 million years  (Shaffer et al. 1993; Shaffer and McKnight 1996; H.B. Shaffer in litt.  1998). Shaffer et al. (1993) and Shaffer (in litt. 1998) suggest that  differentiation at this level is sufficient to justify species-level  recognition; Shaffer will probably describe Santa Barbara County tiger  salamanders as a distinct species when he and his colleagues submit  their results for publication (H.B. Shaffer in litt. 2000b).     The genetic differences between Santa Barbara County California  tiger salamanders and the remainder of the species as a whole are  accompanied by a morphological difference that is diagnostic for the  DPS. Individuals in Santa Barbara County have a distinct color pattern  consisting of a yellow band, rather than distinct spots, along the  lateral side of the animal, and a distinct yellow pattern on the  lateral margins of the belly (H.B. Shaffer in litt. 2000b; Scott  Stanley, American Museum of Natural History, New York, New York, in  litt. 2000; S. Sweet in litt. 2000a).     The Santa Barbara County California tiger salamander population is  biologically and ecologically significant to the species. As discussed  above, the Santa Barbara County population is genetically distinct from  other populations of California tiger salamanders, and individuals  exhibit genetic characteristics not found in other California tiger  salamanders. The Santa Barbara County population is also significant in  that it constitutes the only population of California tiger salamanders  west of the outer Coast Ranges, and it is the southernmost population  of the species. The DPS covered in this final rule is found only in  Santa Barbara County. The extinction of the Santa Barbara County  California tiger salamander population would result in the loss of a  significant genetic entity, the curtailment of the range of the species  as a whole, and the loss of a top predator in the aquatic systems that  Santa Barbara County California tiger salamanders inhabit. Based on  geographic isolation, the lack of evidence of gene flow with other  populations, and marked genetic differentiation, we conclude that the  Santa Barbara County population of California tiger salamanders meets  the discreteness and significance criteria in our Policy Regarding the  Recognition of Distinct Vertebrate Population Segments and qualifies as   a DPS. We discuss the Santa Barbara County population's conservation  status below.  Status and Distribution      Currently, California tiger salamanders are found in six  metapopulations in Santa Barbara County. Collectively, salamanders in  these regions constitute a single genetic population or DPS,  reproductively separate from the rest of the California tiger  salamanders (Jones 1993; Shaffer et al. 1993; Shaffer and McKnight  1996). Ponds and associated uplands in southwestern (West Orcutt) and  southeastern (Bradley-Dominion) Santa Maria Valley, west Solomon Hills/ north Los Alamos Valley, east Los Alamos Valley, Purisima Hills and  Santa Rita Valley constitute the six discrete regions or  metapopulations where California tiger salamanders are documented in  Santa Barbara County (S. Sweet in litt. 1998a, 2000b; Monk & Associates  2000a). Ponds and upland habitats occupied by the California tiger  salamander on the crest of the Purisima Hills between the Los Alamos  and Santa Rita Valleys may provide a genetic link between these two  metapopulations (S. Sweet in litt. 2000b).     For the purposes of this rule, a metapopulation is defined as a  group of subpopulations or ``local populations'' linked by genetic  exchange. Of 14 breeding sites or subpopulations within this DPS  documented at the time of the emergency listing, 1 was destroyed in  1998, the upland habitat around 3 had been converted into more  intensive agriculture practices (i.e., vineyards, gladiolus fields, and  row crops) which may have eliminated the salamander subpopulations, 1  was surrounded by agriculture and urban development, 2 were affected by  overgrazing, 4 were  [[Page 57245]]  believed to be threatened with conversion to vineyards or other  intensive agriculture practices, and the remaining 3 were in areas  rapidly undergoing conversion to vineyards and row crops (Sweet et al.  1998; Sweet in litt. 1998a, b; Santa Barbara County Planning and  Development 1998; Grace McLaughlin, Service, personal observations  1998). Since the publication of the emergency rule, nine breeding ponds  have been verified in two pool complexes previously designated as  potential breeding areas (Purisima Hills and eastern Los Alamos), and  four new ponds have been found in known complexes (S. Sweet in litt.  2000a, pers. comm. 2000a; Monk & Associates 2000a; Lawrence Hunt,  Biological Consultant, in litt. 2000). The ponds are all within 2  kilometers (km) (1.2 miles (mi)) of previously mapped known or  potential ponds. Of the new ponds and surrounding upland habitats, only  the Purisima Hills complex, with six ponds, is relatively free from  threats. Of the other seven ponds, three are threatened by vineyard  development (although discussions aimed at providing protection for the  California tiger salamander and its habitat are underway), one is  adjacent to an intensively farmed area near Highway 101 and two are  adjacent to roads; one of the latter is near a reservoir occupied by  bullfrogs. The seventh pond may not be large enough to sustain a viable  population of California tiger salamanders over the long term. A larger  nearby pond, only 76 m (250 ft) away, appears to have suitable habitat  but may not have had successful breeding for several years due to the  introduction of catfish by the previous owner (S. Sweet pers. comm.  2000a).     Additional breeding ponds could exist within each of the  metapopulations noted above, but searches in other areas with  apparently suitable habitat have not identified additional probable  habitat areas or subpopulations (Christopher 1996; John Storrer,  Biological Consultant, in litt. 1997, 1998a, b, c; P. Collins in litt.  1998, 2000b, pers. comm. 1999; S. Sweet in litt. 1998a, 2000b; L. Hunt  in litt. 2000; Monk & Associates 2000a). All of the known and potential  localities of the California tiger salamander in Santa Barbara County  are largely on private lands, none are protected by signed and  implemented habitat conservation plans, and access is limited. Although  one habitat management plan, which was written before the listing at  the request of the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) as mitigation for a  Clean Water Act violation, has been implemented recently, we do not  know if it will ensure the continued existence of the California tiger  salamanders population on that property. Discussions with several other  landowners show promise of developing agreements that will provide  sufficient high quality habitat for the long-term persistence of  California tiger salamanders on their lands.     Although historical evidence of California tiger salamanders from  San Luis Obispo County exists in the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural  History's vertebrate collection (Collins in litt. 2000a), no California  tiger salamanders have been found during more recent survey efforts in  appropriate habitat in southern San Luis Obispo County (Scott and  Harker 1998, California Army National Guard 2000, S. Sweet in litt.  2000a). Any California tiger salamanders found in southern San Luis  Obispo County would probably be part of the Santa Barbara County DPS,  although genetic testing would need to be conducted to verify this, in  the event that any are discovered.  Previous Federal Action      On September 18, 1985, we published the Vertebrate Notice of Review  (50 FR 37958), which included the California tiger salamander as a  category 2 candidate species for possible future listing as threatened  or endangered. Category 2 candidates were those taxa for which  information contained in our files indicated that listing may be  appropriate but for which additional data were needed to support a  listing proposal. The January 6, 1989, and November 21, 1991, Candidate  Notices of Review (54 FR 554 and 56 FR 58804, respectively) also  included the California tiger salamander as a category 2 candidate,  soliciting information on the status of the species. On February 21,  1992, we received a petition from Dr. H. Bradley Shaffer of the  University of California, Davis, to list the California tiger  salamander as an endangered species. We published a 90-day petition  finding on November 19, 1992 (57 FR 54545), concluding that the  petition presented substantial information indicating that listing may  be warranted. On April 18, 1994, we published a 12-month petition  finding (59 FR 18353) that the listing of the California tiger  salamander was warranted but precluded by higher priority listing  actions. We elevated the species to category 1 status at that time,  which was reflected in the November 15, 1994, Notice of Candidate  Review (59 FR 58982). Category 1 candidates were those taxa for which  we had on file sufficient information on biological vulnerability and  threats to support preparation of listing proposals. In a memorandum  dated November 3, 1994, from the acting Assistant Regional Director to  the Field Supervisor, the recycled 12-month finding on the petition and  a proposed rule to list the species under the Act were given a due date  of December 15, 1995. However, on April 10, 1995, Public Law 104-6  imposed a moratorium on listings and critical habitat designations and  rescinded $1.5 million from the listing program funding. The moratorium  was lifted and listing funding was restored through passage of the  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act on April 26, 1996, following severe  funding constraints imposed by a number of continuing resolutions  between November 1995 and April 1996. The listing of the California  tiger salamander throughout its range was precluded by the need to  address higher priority species, although the status of the entire  species is currently under review.     On January 19, 2000, we published an emergency rule to list the  Santa Barbara County distinct population segment of the California  tiger salamander as endangered (65 FR 3096), concurrently with a  proposed rule (65 FR 3110) to list the species as endangered. Our  decision to emergency list this DPS of the California tiger salamander  was based on information contained in the original petition,  information referenced in the petition, and new information available  to us. We re-opened the comment period associated with the proposed  rule twice (65 FR 15887 and 65 FR 31869). We held a public hearing on  March 24, 2000.     The processing of this final rule conforms with our Listing  Priority Guidance published in the Federal Register on October 22, 1999  (64 FR 57114). The guidance clarifies the order in which we will  process rulemakings. Highest priority is processing emergency listing  rules for any species determined to face a significant and imminent  risk to its well-being (Priority 1). Second priority (Priority 2) is  processing final determinations on proposed additions to the lists of  endangered and threatened wildlife and plants. Third priority is  processing new proposals to add species to the lists. The processing of  administrative petition findings (petitions  filed  under section 4 of  the Act) is the fourth priority. The processing of critical habitat  determinations (prudency and determinability decisions) and proposed or  final designations of critical habitat are no longer subject to  prioritization under the Listing Priority Guidance. This final rule is  a Priority 2 action and  [[Page 57246]]  is being completed in accordance with the current Listing Priority  Guidance. We have updated this rule to reflect new information  concerning changes in distribution, status, and threats since  publication of the emergency and proposed rules.  Summary of Comments and Responses      In the January 19, 2000, proposed rule (65 FR 3110), we requested  all interested parties to submit factual reports or information that  might contribute to development of a final rule. A 60-day comment  period closed on March 20, 2000. We contacted appropriate Federal  agencies, State agencies, county and city governments, scientific  organizations, and other interested parties and requested comments, and  notified affected landowners of the emergency listing. We submitted  public notices of the proposed rule, which invited general public  comment, to the Santa Maria Times and the Santa Barbara News-Press,  both in Santa Barbara County, on January 19, 2000. We requested peer  review in compliance with our policy, published in the Federal Register  on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34270).     We received several requests for a public hearing and on March 24,  2000, we re-opened the public comment period (65 FR 15887) until May 4,  2000, to accommodate that hearing, which was held on April 20, 2000. On  May 19, 2000, we published an additional re-opening of the public  comment period (65 FR 31869), extending the comment period until June  5, 2000.     During the public comment period, we received written comments and  new information from 657 individuals, businesses and organizations,  with several commenters submitting comments during more than one  comment period. We received oral comments from 37 people at the public  hearing; 22 provided written comments also. In all, 231 commenters  opposed the listing, and 426 supported continued protection for the  DPS. Issues raised by the commenters, and our response to each, are  summarized below.     Issue 1: One commenter stated that additional research on the life  history and habitat needs of the Santa Barbara County population of  California tiger salamanders is needed before making a decision to  list. Specifically, the commenter felt that we disregarded the  possibility of tiger salamanders using seasonal drainages as breeding  habitat.     Our Response: We respectfully disagree. None of the surveys and  research conducted on the Santa Barbara County population of California  tiger salamanders over the past 25 years have indicated that this  population has markedly different habitat requirements or life history  traits than other California tiger salamanders. While we did not  discuss the use of ponded areas within seasonal drainages as breeding  habitat, we do recognize that such use occurs in a limited number of  cases (about 2 to 10 percent across the entire range of the species  (Dwight Harvey, Service, Sacramento, California, in litt.)). Based on  aerial photographs going back to the 1930s, we recognized that the  ponds identified as Railroad and Pipeline are modifications of natural  features. The fact remains that the California tiger salamander is a  pond breeding, not stream breeding, species, and water must be  impounded, naturally or artificially, for a long enough period for  development from egg to metamorphosis to occur. In most of the small  seasonal streams in northern Santa Barbara County, flow rates are too  rapid and surface water duration is too short to allow tiger  salamanders to breed.     Issue 2: One commenter requested that we identify the range of  dates that a breeding pool must remain hydrated in order to qualify as  suitable California tiger salamander breeding habitat in Santa Barbara  County.     Our Response: The range of dates within which California tiger  salamanders breed varies from year to year depending on the timing and  amount of rainfall (see ``Background'' section). Therefore, we are  unable to provide specific dates within which a breeding pond must  remain hydrated. Also, researchers have found that female California  tiger salamanders will often forgo breeding in years with unusually  late rainfall. We do know that California tiger salamanders require a  minimum of 10 weeks to complete the transition from egg to  metamorphosed juvenile; larvae that have a longer time period before  metamorphosis are more likely to survive to adulthood and reproduce.     Issue 3: One commenter suggested that the salamanders may have  migrated to other areas as a result of habitat loss and degradation.     Our Response: We do not agree. We believe that most California  tiger salamanders in areas subject to habitat conversion are killed in  the process. Deep-ripping and repeated plowing of grazing or oil  production lands during conversion to vineyards and intensive cropping  destroys the burrows in which the salamanders spend most of their  lives. The mechanical actions kill burrow residents directly, or  unearth them, leaving them exposed to risks of being run over by  equipment, and death from dehydration or predation.     Issue 4: One commenter stated that the genetic data relied on were  insufficient, as all samples were taken from one pond, and none from  surrounding counties.     Our Response: While the data presented by Shaffer and McKnight  (1996) did incorporate samples from only one Santa Barbara County pond,  samples from three other counties were also included (Madera, Alameda,  and Solano). Clear differences were demonstrated among those four  sites. That paper also included data from 20 additional taxa (species,  subspecies, and populations) within the tiger salamander (Ambystoma  tigrinum) complex. Additional data cited in the emergency listing  (Shaffer and Stanley 1991; Irschick and Shaffer 1997; Shaffer et al.  1993; Shaffer in litt. 1998; H.B. Shaffer's unpublished mitochondrial  DNA sequence data) incorporated data from 56 localities representing 12  populations, including 3 sites from the Santa Barbara population, 15  sites in Monterey County, 6 sites in San Benito County, and 5 sites  representing 1 population along the San Luis Obispo-Kern County line,  the latter two being the only counties with California tiger  salamanders that share borders with Santa Barbara County. Samples from  populations in 8 other counties (Yolo, Sonoma, Solano, Alameda,  Stanislaus, Fresno, Tulare, and Madera) were also examined. It is clear  from Dr. Shaffer's and his colleague's data that the Santa Barbara  County animals are genetically distinct from other California tiger  salamander populations, including those in ``surrounding'' counties.     We submitted the emergency rule and Dr. Shaffer's published and  unpublished material to four additional reviewers in addition to those  who provided comment on the distribution, status, threats, and ecology  of the California tiger salamander. We received comments from a fish  and reptile geneticists and from a bacterial geneticist. Both stated  that they believe we interpreted Dr. Shaffer's data correctly, and  applied it appropriately and in accordance with our policy on distinct  population segments.     Issue 5: One commenter stated that it is questionable whether the  reduction in habitat in one county poses a threat to the species as a  whole.     Our Response: We did not emergency list nor propose to list the  California tiger salamander across its range. We emergency listed and  proposed for continued protection only the Santa Barbara County  distinct population segment of the California tiger  [[Page 57247]]  salamander. The reasons for recognition of this DPS are in accordance  with our policy and guidelines and are explained in the emergency rule  and in this document. The best available scientific evidence supports  our conclusion that the Santa Barbara County population of California  tiger salamanders is discrete, is significant to the species as a  whole, and is in danger of extinction throughout most of its historic  range. We are currently reviewing the status of the entire species  across its remaining range.     Issue 6: Several commenters suggested that we used insufficient  scientific evidence or did not use the best scientific and commercial  data available in making our decision. Several commenters implied that,  in making our decision to emergency list the Santa Barbara County  California tiger salamander, we relied on ``anecdotal information,  speculation, and scientific studies of dubious validity'' or stated  that the information was ``based on questionable science.''     Our Response: We respectfully disagree. We used the scientific and  commercial information available to us during our status review process  and at the time of the listing to make our decision. We based our  decision on museum specimens and the accompanying collection data,  aerial photographs documenting the land use changes over the last 60  years, reports produced by the County Agricultural Commissioner's and  Planning and Development Department, articles published in peer- reviewed, professional scientific journals, and additional work  conducted by the authors of some of those articles.     We have received and sought out additional information during the  public comment periods and public hearings, requested appropriate  professional peer review as required under our policies, reviewed all  the information available to us, and presented that information in this  document. As documented in the emergency listing and this rule, we have  considerable evidence concerning the rates of land use changes and the  inadequacy of regulatory mechanisms to protect the salamander, and  extensive scientific evidence documenting the uniqueness of the Santa  Barbara population, risks to amphibian species from habitat loss and  fragmentation, disease, and predation by and competition from non- native species.     Issue 7: Several commenters stated that insufficient data has been  collected to estimate the size of the Santa Barbara County population  of California tiger salamanders or that we must know how many  California tiger salamanders existed ``before, how many now, and what  has affected their sustainability''; and believed we should have  surveyed all possible ponds and contacted all landowners before  emergency listing the population. One commenter implied that the loss  of habitat may not have led to a decrease in population size.     Our Response: We agree that we do not have an estimate of the size  of the Santa Barbara County population of California tiger salamanders.  Our decision to list this population is based on significant threats  associated with recent habitat loss and expectations of continued loss  and fragmentation of the remaining habitat, as detailed in the  Background, Status and Distribution, and Summary of Factors Affecting  the Species sections (see factor E discussion, in particular), and not  on absolute numbers of animals. It is not necessary to know how many  individuals existed before habitat loss and degradation, etc., began to  take their toll, nor is it necessary to know precise numbers of  existing individuals. Amphibian populations naturally undergo large  fluctuations in population size as a result of random natural events  such as drought and fires. The loss of crucial upland habitats and the  loss of individuals through agricultural and development activities can  leave small populations that are unable to withstand decreases in size  as a result of such events. Additional information on the effects of  habitat loss and fragmentation that became available after the  publication of the emergency rule has been incorporated into this final  rule.     In our 12-month petition finding, published April 18, 1994, we  concluded that we had sufficient information to warrant proposing the  listing of the species as a whole, but that the preparation of a  proposal was precluded by the need to complete higher priority actions.  That conclusion was based on information provided in the petition and  in our files. We published Candidate Notices of Review in 1996 (61 FR  7596), 1997 (62 FR 4938), and 1999 (64 FR 57534) that included the  California tiger salamander and requested the submission of additional  information on the status and distribution of the species. We have  carefully considered information relevant to the status of and threats  to the Santa Barbara County distinct population segment that became  available since our 1994 12-month petition finding. The decision to  move forward with an emergency listing for this population was based on  the rapid changes in the quantity and quality of the habitat available.     We have documented the factors that led to the rapid loss of  habitat and increases in threats to the Santa Barbara County  population. As our efforts and those of other agencies in working with  landowners had failed to stem the rapid rate of habitat loss, and the  existing regulatory mechanisms were inadequate to ensure protection for  the population and its habitats, we believe that immediate protection  under the Act was necessary to protect the remaining California tiger  salamanders in Santa Barbara County.     Issue 8: Several commenters stated that the California tiger  salamander is more widespread in Santa Barbara County than we presented  in the emergency rule, and stated that they had seen them in a variety  of places.     Our Response: Service and other biologists investigated many of  these sightings. None of the sightings were verified as California  tiger salamanders. We concluded that most of the sightings were of  arboreal (tree dwelling) salamanders, Aneides lugubris, a smaller,  purple-brown colored salamander with very tiny scattered yellow spots.  We will investigate two other cases, one in an area where non-native  tiger salamander larvae have been found, and one in area that appears  to have suitable California tiger salamander habitat, when  environmental conditions are appropriate.     Issue 9: Two commenters stated that there are more than 20 sites  available and in good condition for the California tiger salamander,  not 14 as stated in the rule. One commenter stated that the emergency  rule did not give adequate attention to additional potential sites that  could supply breeding habitat for California tiger salamanders.     Our Response: At the time of the publication of the emergency rule,  the California tiger salamander was known from 14 current and  historical sites in Santa Barbara County. We acknowledged in the  emergency rule that other potential breeding ponds or pond complexes  may exist, but could not be surveyed by local biologists due to access  restrictions from private landowners. The rule also stated that  possible California tiger salamander breeding ponds were probably  facing types and levels of threats similar to those documented for the  known ponds. Since the publication of the emergency rule, surveys have  found new ponds. These findings are discussed in this final rule. Our  assumption at the time of the emergency rule that most of the potential  ponds face threats (e.g., conversion to intensive agriculture, impacts  from roads and exotic species)  [[Page 57248]]  similar to those affecting the known ponds has been substantiated. Only  one metapopulation appears to be relatively free of significant threats  and may be protected through conservation easements.     Issue 10: One commenter questioned the viability of the Tanglewood  Complex as a breeding site, as this was based on a record from one  larval California tiger salamander.     Our Response: The discovery of a larval California tiger salamander  in the vicinity of the Tanglewood Complex suggested the presence of a  nearby breeding locality, as juvenile California tiger salamanders do  not move great distances when migrating from breeding ponds in the  fall. We agree that in the absence of actual breeding pond surveys on  the Tanglewood complex, it is conceivable that the larvae had not come  from that location, but rather some unknown nearby location. Since  publication of the emergency rule, a survey of the vernal ponds on the  Tanglewood property has confirmed a breeding population of California  tiger salamanders, as represented by multiple larvae captured onsite.  Additional ponds within 2 km (1.2 mi) of the Tanglewood ponds also have  breeding California tiger salamanders (see ``Background'' section).     Issue 11: One commenter suggested that, as there was no recent  petition specific to the Santa Barbara population of California tiger  salamanders, we have no legal basis for listing the population.     Our Response: Receipt of a petition to list a species is not  required in order for us to undertake a status review and develop a  proposal to list or an emergency rule. We have the independent  authority to undertake assessments and status reviews of species  considered as candidates for listing, and to list those species where  their protection under the Act is warranted. Dr. Shaffer's 1992  petition was not rejected, as the commenter claimed, but was found in  the 12-month petition finding to be ``warranted but precluded,''  meaning that there was enough information to support a listing, but  that there were higher priority listings to complete.     Issue 12: One commenter suggested that we list the Santa Barbara  County California tiger salamander as threatened, rather than  endangered, to give the Service the option of proceeding with a special  4(d) rule that would exempt from the prohibitions of section 9 of the  Act certain activities that would otherwise constitute take of  California tiger salamanders.     Our Response: The criteria for designating species as threatened or  endangered are outlined in section 4(a)(1) of the Act and regulations  that we issued in (50 CFR part 424). Based upon information that we  have received regarding the status and distribution of the species, we  believe that the California tiger salamander is in danger of extinction  throughout all or a significant portion of its range in Santa Barbara  County, and therefore, fits the definition of endangered as defined in  the Act. This is discussed in detail in the ``Summary of Factors  Affecting the Species'' section.     Issue 13: One commenter suggested that in the absence of  information regarding specific threats to the distinct population  segment (e.g., overutilization, disease, predation), we should not have  based our decision ``solely on the conversion of native habitat. * *  *''     Our Response: Under section 4 of the Act and the regulations (50  CFR part 424) issued to implement the listing provisions of the Act, we  may determine a species to be endangered or threatened due to one or  more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). The rates of  habitat degradation and loss in Santa Barbara County are sufficient to  warrant the listing of the Santa Barbara DPS. However, we did not base  our decision solely on the rate of conversion of habitat, but also on  the inadequacy of existing Federal, State, and local regulatory  mechanisms to protect the salamanders and their habitat, and the risks  faced by salamanders due to intensified agricultural activities,  urbanization, and habitat fragmentation. As the threat of habitat loss  is still present, and neither the regulatory mechanisms nor their  enforcement has changed since the emergency listing, both factors still  threaten the continued existence of the Santa Barbara DPS.     Issue 14: Several commenters stated or implied that the threats to  salamander habitat do not exist, the Service has portrayed the threats  inaccurately, the County has received no applications for projects to  eliminate breeding pools, and threats to the breeding pools would be  subject to the Clean Water Act, the Act, and the Santa Barbara County  Grading Ordinance.     Our Response: We respectfully disagree that we have portrayed the  threats inaccurately. We have documented the threats based on aerial  photography and site visits. We agree that projects or actions that  would eliminate breeding pools would be subject to review under the  Clean Water Act and the Santa Barbara County Grading Ordinance, but  specific consideration of impacts to California tiger salamander  habitat would not necessarily be required under these laws if the Santa  Barbara DPS is not a listed entity. In addition, a primary factor cited  in the emergency listing was the conversion of the upland habitats  surrounding the breeding ponds to environments that will not support  tiger salamanders, and the fact that the salamanders would be killed  during the deep-ripping processes in preparation for vineyard  installation and other land clearing activities. Activities in upland  habitats are not normally under Corps Clean Water Act jurisdiction.  Implementation of the County Grading Ordinance has not resulted in  adequate protection of the salamander's upland habitats.     Issue 15: One commenter stated that information provided by the  County was incorrect and biased and was intended to mislead the  Service.     Our Response: As the commenter did not cite specific references, we  believe he was referring to the location and status information in  Santa Barbara County Planning and Development (1998) and Sweet, Collins  and Hunt (1998). The information was compiled by recognized scientists  with knowledge of the species, its habitat, and the threats to its  continued existence. Determinations of known, potential, and other  possible ponds were made based on specimens housed in museums in Santa  Barbara County and elsewhere, U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps,  Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetland Inventory maps, and aerial  photographs archived at the County of Santa Barbara Planning Division.  All of these sources are available to the general public, either  through public agencies or private commercial resources. We also used a  report prepared by Santa Barbara County Planning and Development  Department, the Agricultural Commissioner and the UC Cooperative  Extension (Gira et al. 1999), that provides information on agricultural  land use and trends in the county.     Issue 16: We received several comments that a potential range map,  that we released at the April 20, 2000, public hearing, constituted new  information as it increased the number of landowners affected by the  listing.     Our Response: Under the emergency rule and the proposed rule, all  California tiger salamanders within Santa Barbara County are protected,  whether they are found in the previously documented range or outside of  those areas. The emergency rule states that the known habitat for the  California tiger salamander in Santa Barbara County is vernal pools and  seasonal ponds and the associated  [[Page 57249]]  coastal scrub, grassland, and oak savannah plant communities of the  Santa Maria, Los Alamos, and Santa Rita Valleys in western Santa  Barbara County. The map released by us indicated the distribution of  possible suitable habitat for the California tiger salamander in Santa  Barbara County and was based on the best information currently  available to us. The map was designed to assist landowners in  identifying where these areas are, and to provide guidelines as to the  areas most likely affected by the listing. The map does not alter the  obligations or responsibilities of Santa Barbara County landowners and  land managers with respect to the Santa Barbara County population of  California tiger salamanders under the Act, under the emergency,  proposed, or final rules.     Issue 17: Several commenters believe that the Grading and Zoning  Ordinances are sufficient to protect the species; one provided  additional information in support of this belief.     Our Response: As detailed in the rule, we believe that the County  ordinances, the past implementation and enforcement of those ordinances  by County agencies, and the adherence to those ordinances by some  landowners were not sufficient to protect the salamander and its  habitat. This is further supported by the Santa Barbara County 1998-99  Grand Jury Report, released May 6, 1999, which found      ``The agricultural community * * * frequently proceeds with  grading or other agricultural conversions without permits. * * *  Members of the agricultural community choose to pay the fines and  suffer other consequences * * *'' (Pg. 9)      One commenter provided information on nine violations of County and  Federal laws, a letter from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) expressing concern over potential violations of the Clean Water  Act and asking for County assistance in reviewing those cases, two  letters to landowners requesting consultation with the County regarding  sensitive resources, and a memo to the Board of Supervisors regarding  enforcement of the Grading Ordinance. We believe the information  provided and additional information relevant to the cases under review  supports our conclusion that the existing regulatory mechanisms,  including their application and enforcement have been inadequate to  protect California tiger salamanders and their habitat in Santa Barbara  County. Adequate mechanisms, processes and enforcement, prevent illegal  actions from occurring in the first place. Once salamanders are killed  and their habitat is destroyed or severely degraded, the damage is  done, the loss of individuals and populations has occurred. It is very  difficult, as documented in the emergency and final rules, to  rehabilitate degraded habitat, particularly vernal pools and other  seasonal wetlands, when the hydrology has been altered by deep soil  disturbances.     Issue 18: Several commenters expressed the view that much of the  California tiger salamander's habitat is agricultural land that has  been in production since 1900 and suggested that if the salamander has  survived it shows how well farmers have taken care of the land.     Our Response: Although much of the acreage in Santa Barbara County  has been cultivated in the past, the scale and the nature of  agriculture has changed over time. Historically, land was dry farmed in  a patchwork, with fields laying fallow. This allowed California tiger  salamanders to persist over time, as they always had some upland areas  as refugia. However, as stated in our emergency rule and in this  document, intensive agriculture has increased greatly in Santa Barbara  County, and resulted in the permanent conversion of upland refugia to  land uses that are incompatible with the long-term persistence of  California tiger salamanders, including vineyards, intensive  agriculture, and urban development. The changes have included the  increased use of various chemicals that can have negative effects on  salamanders, as well as changes in crops and farming methods that are  not conducive to salamander survival.     Issue 19: Several commenters addressed the issue of roadkill,  assuming that the greatest impact is roadkill and that we have done  nothing to address that issue; another offered suggestions to reduce  roadkill. Commenters also stated that any impact from the conversion of  alleged habitat to crops is minimal at best compared to roadkill, that  no peer-reviewed study proves that farming and ranching is incompatible  with the protection of the species, and that we must eliminate losses  from roadkill before addressing losses from farming practices.     Our Response: We respectfully disagree with the comments, but  realize that we could have made our concerns more clear. The greatest  impact to California tiger salamanders in Santa Barbara County is not  roadkill, but the killing of all age classes of California tiger  salamanders in burrows when deep-ripping and other land-clearing  activities (such as conversion of grazing and oil production lands to  intensive cropping or housing developments) occur. The Twitty (1941)  and Launer and Fee (1996) citations in the emergency rule refer to  roadkills near ponds in northern California on Stanford University  property, and were provided as additional documentation of threats to  amphibians in general and California tiger salamanders specifically.  The only estimate of roadkill in Santa Barbara County is Sweet (in  litt. 1993), which states that an average of 40 percent of salamanders  seen on or along roads are dead. However, this does not mean that 40  percent of the mortality of California tiger salamander is due to  collisions with vehicles; the study did not investigate other sources  of mortality. Sweet's report concludes that ``the sizes of breeding  adults do not point toward a major influence by road-kill.'' (Emphasis  in original.) We have been working with CalTrans (beginning in May  1999) at one of the two sites of highest concern to undertake measures  to encourage California tiger salamanders to use alternate routes under  roads, to install more drains in berms so adults that do get on roads  have more options, and to prevent juveniles from getting up on roads in  the first place. Information on the rates of habitat loss and proximity  of breeding sites to roads are presented in the ``Status and  Distribution'' and ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species''  sections.     The conclusions we have drawn as to the impact of farming and  overgrazing on California tiger salamanders are based upon what is  known about how specific activities are conducted, the likely physical  and chemical effects of those activities on the landscape, and the  likelihood that these effects on the landscape will in turn have an  impact on California tiger salamanders, given what we know about their  biology. For example, deep ripping of soil is very likely to kill any  salamanders in the layers of soil being ripped, including those inside  burrows, at other locations in the soil, or on the surface. Other  alterations of the salamander's habitat, such as road-building and  conversion to fields of seasonal crops and vineyards, can also kill  salamanders directly during conversions (see factor E, below).     Such alterations can dramatically change the physical and chemical  structure of the habitat through which salamanders migrate to breeding  ponds or upland habitat. When considered in light of the biology of  California tiger salamanders, these alterations of the environment  reduce the chances that salamanders will be able to traverse these  habitats successfully. For  [[Page 57250]]  example, changes in the moisture regimes, microlandscape, and ground  cover could require migrating salamanders to cross rapid runoff; expose  animals to toxic levels of fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, and  herbicides; interfere with the ability of salamanders to travel the  distances necessary to make it to the breeding pond or upland habitat  while rain or moisture conditions are suitable; or increase their  susceptibility to predators. We do not have data generated from studies  that demonstrate such effects unequivocally. We are basing these  conclusions on our interpretations of what we do know about these human  activities, the biology and life history of salamanders, and studies  that have documented the changes in species numbers and abundances as a  result of land use changes (see factor E discussion).     Issue 20: Several commenters expressed concern that all rodent  control operations would have to be halted, with devastating effects to  agricultural operations. Some stated that halting such programs would  also jeopardize those ponds that have been created or modified by  damming and berming, as the burrowing activities could cause failures  of those dams and berms.     Our Response: Not all methods of rodent control are expected to  have the same level of effects on California tiger salamander  populations. We have recommended to landowners that they avoid  destruction of burrows or the release of toxic chemicals, including  pesticides, into burrows of ground squirrels and gophers within 2 km  (1.2 mi) of breeding ponds. As stated in the emergency rule, ``Rodent  control programs must be analyzed and implemented carefully in  California tiger salamander habitat so the persistence of the  salamanders is not threatened.'' Appropriate methods and timing of  control efforts can be determined through the Act's section 10  incidental take permit process as habitat conservation plans (HCP) for  the salamanders are developed, evaluated once implemented, and revised  if necessary. Likewise, the impacts of burrowing rodents on dams and  berms, and methods to reduce those impacts, can be addressed in HCPs.     Issue 21: The reasons for the emergency determination were not  clearly demonstrated.     Our Response: We respectfully disagree. We believe that, in both  the emergency rule and this document, we have clearly presented and  documented the status and distribution of this distinct population  segment, the threats facing the remaining subpopulations, and the  imminency of those threats.     Issue 22: Several commenters stated that several landowners were in  the process of developing habitat conservation plans, of which the  Service was unaware or chose to ignore. Another commenter stated that  the Service should offer farmers and ranchers a proposal to create a  habitat conservation plan for the area, and that to use the threat of  regulation to forward this plan only ensures its failure.     Our Response: Although we did not discuss it in the emergency  listing, we were aware of conservation efforts by several landowners.  We met with one vineyard manager in the Fall of 1998 to try to ensure  sufficient protection of California tiger salamander habitat following  violations of the Clean Water Act. The management plan that was  developed after that meeting, without further Service input, may not,  in our opinion, ensure protection for the salamander and its habitat  that is adequate to ensure the survival of the population in  perpetuity. In another case the Service has provided funds to assist  other agencies and landowners in developing conservation plans,  including the purchase of conservation easements. To date, no final  agreements have been reached.     We cannot defer or avoid listing a species that is at risk of  extinction on the basis of intentions to develop conservation  agreements or plans. We cannot assume that such plans will be developed  and implemented, or that they will be successful in providing long-term  protection.     A habitat conservation plan is a document required when applying  for an incidental take permit pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the  Act. Incidental take permits are required when activities will result  in ``take'' of threatened or endangered species. While Service  personnel provide detailed guidance and technical assistance throughout  the process, the development of an HCP is driven by the applicant. The  purpose of the habitat conservation plan is to ensure that the effects  of incidental take authorized under the permit will be adequately  minimized and mitigated.     Issue 23: Several commentors suggested that we should be focusing  on public, not private lands to conserve the Santa Barbara County  population of California tiger salamanders, and that we should move  salamanders onto government property. One commenter stated that  landowners have offered to set up preserves on their land.     Our Response: One purpose of the Act (section 2(b)) is to provide a  means to protect the ecosystems upon which threatened and endangered  species depend. Although species introductions may be a potentially  important recovery tool, they are less effective when they occur in  habitat that has not been occupied by the species in the past.  Vandenberg Air Force Base, the closest government property near the  range of the California tiger salamander in Santa Barbara County, has  been surveyed extensively for tiger salamanders; to date, tiger  salamanders have not been found there. Similarly, tiger salamanders  have not been found on Los Padres National Forest. This may be due to  differences in soil types and microclimate conditions, or it may be an  historical artifact of where California tiger salamanders were able to  disperse. Transplanting California tiger salamanders to lands where  they do not occur naturally would do nothing to protect the ecosystems  in which they evolved and are found, and probably would not be  successful. Therefore, the need to list the species would not be  precluded. We must address all causes of losses and threats to the  population, including those that occur on private lands.     Issue 24: One commenter states that the 2 km (1.2 mi) home range  reported in the emergency listing is too generous an estimate of how  far California tiger salamanders will actually migrate from breeding  ponds to summer retreat habitat. The commenter believes that it is more  important that the Service focus on (1) preserving the watersheds that  support California tiger salamander breeding ponds and, (2) ensuring  that adequate rodent populations occur within these watersheds so as to  provide adequate summer retreat habitat for particular California tiger  salamander breeding ponds.     Our Response: California tiger salamanders have been known to  travel 2 km (1.2 mi) or more from their breeding pond. We agree that 2  km overestimates the distance that most California tiger salamanders  are likely to travel from breeding ponds. As stated in the emergency  rule and this document, the distance traveled from breeding sites  depends on many site-specific factors, such as topography and  vegetation, the distribution of ground squirrel or other rodent  burrows, and climatic conditions. Although the likelihood of  encountering these salamanders tends to decrease with distance from  their breeding pond, we cannot provide a firm distance beyond which  there is no risk. No studies have been undertaken in Santa Barbara  County to determine how far California tiger salamanders disperse from  breeding ponds. The  [[Page 57251]]  colonization of a newly created pond in the Los Alamos Valley from a  pond approximately 227 m (750 ft) away suggests that California tiger  salamander regularly move large distances. Additionally, a 5 year study  at the Hastings preserve in Monterey found that a large portion (20  percent) of California tiger salamanders traveled to ponds that were  580 m (1900 ft) away (see the Background section).     We agree that preserving the watersheds supporting California tiger  salamander breeding ponds and maintaining adequate rodent populations  to supply refugia for salamanders is more important than establishing a  fixed boundary beyond which salamanders are likely to be found. It is  possible, in some cases, that a 2 km (1.2 mi) distance would not  incorporate all of the watershed, or that lands beyond that distance  should be evaluated as dispersal habitat. The exact configuration of  habitat necessary to protect the salamanders will be site-specific.     Issue 25: Some commenters believe farmers have helped salamanders  by building dams which prolonged optimum conditions for the  salamanders, giving the larvae the maximum opportunity to grow large  and healthy before completing metamorphosis.     Our Response: The enlarging of existing natural ponds or the  creation of new ponds within a grazing-dominated landscape may have  been beneficial to the California tiger salamander in many cases.  However, the creation and maintenance of permanent or nearly permanent  bodies of water within intensely cropped areas or vineyards has not  been documented as providing suitable habitat for tiger salamanders. In  many cases, California tiger salamanders are no longer found in ponds  within such systems (Shaffer et al. 1993). Management of such ponds for  agricultural uses, such as drawing down the ponds for frost protection,  which is likely to occur when California tiger salamander larvae are  present, can be in conflict with the needs of the salamanders.  Permanent ponds also provide breeding habitat for exotic fish and frogs  that can prey on and compete with California tiger salamanders.     Issue 26: Many commenters stated that the Service should compensate  private landowners for the loss of revenue that occurs when California  tiger salamanders are found on their land. Another reminded us that the  ``taking'' of land is unconstitutional without compensation.     Our Response: Listing under the Act does not imply that private  land would be ``locked up'' without the ability for reasonable use.  Recovery planning for this species may include recommendations for land  acquisition or easements involving private landowners. These efforts  would be undertaken with the cooperation of the landowners. We do work  with landowners to identify activities and modifications to activities  that will not result in take, to develop measures to minimize the  potential for take, and to provide authorizations for take through  section 7 and 10 of the Act. We encourage landowners to work in  partnership with us to develop plans that ensure land uses can be  carried out in a manner consistent with the conservation of listed  species.     Issue 27: Several commenters stated that we should take the  potential economic impacts of the listing into account in our decision- making process. One commenter stated that we must take into account the  economic impact of identifying any particular area as critical habitat.     Our Response: Under section 4(b)(1)(A) of the Act, we must base a  listing decision solely on the best scientific and commercial data  available. The legislative history of this provision clearly states the  intent of Congress to ``ensure'' that listing decisions are ``* * *  based solely on biological criteria and to prevent nonbiological  criteria from affecting such decisions * * *'' H.R. Rep. No. 97-835,  97th Cong., 2d Sess. 19 (1982). As further stated in the legislative  history, ``* * * economic considerations have no relevance to  determinations regarding the status of species * * *'' Id. at 20.  Because we are specifically precluded from considering economic  impacts, either positive or negative, in a final decision on a proposed  listing, we did not consider the economic impacts of listing the Santa  Barbara County population of the California tiger salamander.     We agree that we must take into account the economic impact of  identifying a particular area as critical habitat. We have not proposed  or designated critical habitat for the California tiger salamander. If  the decision is made to designate critical habitat for the Santa  Barbara County DPS of the California tiger salamander, we will publish  a proposed rule and a draft economic analysis of the proposed  designation, and accept public comments on both. Following the receipt  of public comments, we will complete the economic analysis of the  impact of the critical habitat designation and then publish a final  rule.     Issue 28: Several commenters believe that the issuance of permits  by the Service serves to unfairly restrict the number of people allowed  to conduct surveys and habitat assessments and thus limits public input  and avoids peer review.     Our Response: The Service does not require permits for conducting  habitat assessments and thus does not limit the number of people able  to conduct surveys for suitable habitat or to provide us with  information regarding habitat quality. However, in order to properly  assess the validity and reliability of such reports and information, it  is incumbent on us to examine the qualifications of people submitting  the reports and information. Relative to the issuance of recovery  permits under Section 10 of the Act, which allow sampling for larvae  and adults in suitable habitat, the law requires us to review all  applications for such permits to ensure that only those people with  appropriate training and experience conduct activities that will  actually ``take'' a salamander (e.g., netting, trapping, hand capture,  harassing). This requirement reduces the risks to the animals, and  promotes the conservation and recovery of the species.  Peer Review      In accordance with our July 1, 1994, Interagency Cooperative Policy  for Peer Review in Endangered Species Act Activities (59 FR 34270), we  solicited review from eight experts in the fields of ecology,  conservation, genetics, taxonomy and management. The purpose of such a  review is to ensure that listing decisions are based on scientifically  sound data, assumptions, and analyses, including input from appropriate  experts. Six reviewers sent us letters during the public comment  periods supporting the listing of the Santa Barbara County DPS of the  California tiger salamander. Several provided additional documentation  on the distribution of and threats to the salamanders; one provided  additional genetic data. Their information has been incorporated, as  appropriate. Two reviewers specifically evaluated the genetic data on  which the determination of the DPS was made; both stated that the data  clearly and strongly supported our interpretations and decision.  Summary of Factors Affecting the Species      After a thorough review and consideration of all information  available, we have determined that the Santa Barbara County population  of the California tiger salamander warrants classification as an  endangered species.  [[Page 57252]]  We followed procedures found at section 4 of the Act and regulations  (50 CFR Part 424) issued to implement the listing provisions of the  Act. We may determine a species to be endangered or threatened due to  one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These  factors and their application to the Santa Barbara County DPS of the  California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) are as follows:  A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment  of Its Habitat or Range      California tiger salamanders now occur in scattered subpopulations  within six isolated areas or metapopulations across the species'  historic range in Santa Barbara County. Based on the topography and  habitat type of the lands that have been converted to agriculture and  urban development, we conclude that the number of breeding ponds, the  extent of upland habitats, and the quality of the remaining habitats  have been reduced greatly since Europeans first settled the region.  While those areas remained in grazing lands or oil production, which  generally have relatively low effects on the subpopulations, the  species was relatively secure. However, based on aerial photography  from the 1930s through the year 2000 (archived at the Santa Barbara  County Planning and Development Department), the conversion to  intensive agriculture and urban developments has resulted in the loss  of breeding habitat from the destruction or alteration of natural  vernal pools and seasonal ponds, and the loss of upland habitat used  for estivation and migration.     Pools and ponds are destroyed when they are filled during grading  and leveling operations or deep-ripping. Deep-ripping or deep slip  plowing is a technique that uses a 4- to 7-foot deep plow to break up  the hardpan (layer of dense soil or material that prevents water  percolation) or compacted soil to allow water to drain deeper into the  soil and prevent water retention or ponding. Alternatively, seasonal  ponds may be converted to irrigation ponds, which are often managed in  ways that are not conducive to salamander survival (L. Hunt in litt.  1998). The repeated plowing and discing or deep-ripping of upland  habitats can alter the hydrology of the pools, thus destroying them  (Coe 1988), and can kill salamanders outright and destroy the small  mammal burrow systems in which they live most of the year.     Intensive agricultural practices began in the Santa Maria River and  San Antonio Creek Valleys more than 130 years ago (Elihu Gevirtz, Santa  Barbara County Planning and Development Department, pers. comm. 1999),  probably eliminating many breeding ponds and associated upland  habitats. The increasingly rapid conversion of these lands and those in  the Los Alamos and Santa Rita Valleys to intensive agricultural  practices is characterized by the increase, through 1997, in row crop  acreage by more than 9,900 hectares (ha) (more than 25,000 acres (ac))  since 1986 and the installation of approximately 4,000 ha (10,000 ac)  of vineyards from 1996 to 1999, more than doubling the acreage planted  to grapes (Gira et al. 1999). This is further supported by the fact  that, since 1992, irrigated cropland in Santa Barbara County has  increased by approximately 15,700 ha (38,850 ac) to a total of 47,700  hectares (118,270 acres), or a 49 percent increase; approximately 5,670  ha (14,000 ac), or 36 percent of the growth, occurred from 1997 through  1999 (Santa Barbara County Planning and Development Department 2000).  We noted in the emergency rule that these conversions have resulted in  the destruction of two breeding ponds (one suspected and one  documented) and the grading of 90 and 100 percent of their drainage  basins, and the grading of 50 to 100 percent of the drainage basins of  five documented and two suspected breeding ponds in the last 5 years  (Santa Barbara County Planning and Development Department 1998). Of the  ponds discovered since the emergency rule, a substantial portion of the  adjacent upland habitat of at least one has been graded in the past  year (B. Fahey, pers. obs. 2000; Santa Barbara County Planning and  Development Department aerial photography collection). There are  proposals to develop vineyards around 7 other documented breeding ponds  in 2 complexes, but we are involved in discussions with the landowners  and managers to provide for the protection of the California tiger  salamander and its habitat (Hunt 1998; G. McLaughlin, pers. obs. 1998,  2000; Santa Barbara County Planning and Development 1998; Sweet et al.  1998; S. Sweet in litt. 1998a,b, 2000b; Monk & Associates 2000a). The  threats from agriculture, urbanization, overgrazing, fragmentation, and  roadkill are severe in four metapopulations, moderate in one, and  minimal in the sixth. The current and potential threats are discussed  below by region (West Orcutt, Bradley-Dominion, North Los Alamos, East  Los Alamos, Purisima Hills, and Santa Rita).     The five known breeding sites in southwestern Santa Maria Valley  (west of Highway 101 and Santa Maria), comprising the West Orcutt  metapopulation, are on grazing and other agricultural lands. Vernal  pools in the area have been lost or adversely affected by rapid  development in the Santa Maria Valley (E. Gevirtz, pers. comm. 1999).  Thirty years ago, a housing development directly affected one breeding  site in this metapopulation; California tiger salamanders have been  reported from water meter vaults at residences within this development  (L. Hunt in litt. 2000). Ongoing agriculture within the vernal pool  complex can have negative effects on the hydrology, expose salamanders  to contaminants, and kill terrestrial phase salamanders outright. Two  sites are subject to mortality from roadkill due to their proximity to  roads: One is by the heavily-traveled Black Road and the other is near  a dirt road subject to yearly grading. Two remaining breeding ponds are  separated from each other by a railroad that may disrupt migration  routes and reduce genetic interchange. These sites are also threatened  by overgrazing, as evidenced by terracing of the hillsides and a lack  of vegetative cover (G. McLaughlin, pers. obs. 1998; Jones and Stokes  Associates, Inc., no date) (see discussion on grazing in Factors C and  E, below).     Before 1996, the four documented and three possible breeding sites  (Sweet et al. 1998) in southeastern Santa Maria Valley, which  constitute the Bradley-Dominion metapopulation, were surrounded by oil  production and grazing lands. This is probably the most at-risk  metapopulation, due to agricultural intensification. Since 1996,  agricultural land conversion for vineyards, vegetable row crops, and  flowers has destroyed one documented and one suspected breeding site,  possibly extirpated salamanders from two other documented sites and one  possible breeding site, and threatens the remaining possible breeding  site (S. Sweet in litt. 1993; 1998a,b). Although California tiger  salamanders were found migrating across roads in the vicinity of the  possible breeding sites throughout the 1980s, salamanders have not been  observed since the early 1990s, when the grazing lands were converted  to vineyards (S. Sweet in litt. 1998a). One documented breeding site  may not have held water long enough in 2000 to support successful  breeding (Bridget Fahey, Service, pers. obs. 2000), and although  surveys of two other breeding sites were not conducted, the uplands  surrounding one pond have been converted to intensive agriculture (S.  Sweet in litt. 1998a,b; G. McLaughlin, pers. obs. 1998, 2000). It is  likely that  [[Page 57253]]  the adult breeding population at that site has been greatly reduced.     A storage facility for agricultural products is within the  watershed of the remaining documented breeding site (S. Sweet in litt.  1998a; Theresa Stevens, Santa Barbara County Planning and Development,  pers. comm. 1999). Precautions have been taken to reduce the threats of  runoff and spills into the natural pond (Analise Merlo, Santa Barbara  County Planning and Development, pers. comm. 1999) that could make the  habitat less suitable for salamanders during the breeding or  development seasons. A road between this pond and a nearby pond, the  watershed of which was converted to gladiolus fields in 1998, disrupts  migration between the ponds and the uplands, has caused the deaths of  many salamanders, and contributes to potentially lethal contamination  of the ponds (S. Sweet in litt. 1993, 1998a).     The North Los Alamos Valley or Las Flores metapopulation, although  fragmented by Highway 101, was considered to be an important breeding  site for the species provided existing conditions could be maintained  (Stebbins 1989). However, recent changes in land ownership and  management have resulted in the conversion from grazing lands to  vineyards east of the highway. The direct effects of this conversion  resulted in the loss of one vernal pool and the severe degradation of  upland habitats surrounding that pool and another documented breeding  site (Hunt 1998). California tiger salamanders were not found during a  survey of the remaining pond in March 2000 (Walter Sadinski, Service,  pers. obs. 2000), although they were present in other ponds in the  metapopulation at that time (Monk & Associates 2000b). Additional  surveys and monitoring will be needed to determine if adult California  tiger salamanders are still present in the vicinity of the pool and if  the remaining upland habitat around the pond is sufficient to support a  California tiger salamander population. We still have concerns that  habitat around seven vernal pools and seasonal ponds on the west side  of Highway 101 that are documented breeding sites may be converted from  grazing lands to intensive agriculture (Santa Barbara County Planning  and Development Department 1998; S. Sweet in litt. 1998a; L. Hunt in  litt. 1999; Abe Lieder, Santa Barbara County Planning and Development  Department, in litt. 1999; Morgan Wehtje, California Department of Fish  and Game (CDFG), pers. comm. 1999), but we are involved in discussions  with landowners and managers regarding protections for the salamander  and its habitat. One of these ponds is in danger of being completely  filled in by siltation due to increased soil erosion from the vineyard  on the east side of the highway (P. Collins in litt. 2000a; Jeanette  Sainz, landowner, pers. comm. to B. Fahey 2000). Half of the uplands  adjacent to a recently-discovered California tiger salamander breeding  pond were converted to intensive agriculture in the fall of 1999,  probably killing many of the adult salamanders in the uplands  associated with that pond (P. Collins in litt. 2000a; B. Fahey and G.  McLaughlin, pers. obs. 2000). Continued farming of that area will  likely result in further losses.     The recently discovered Purisima Hills metapopulation, consisting  of six small ponds and surrounding upland habitats on the crest of the  Purisima Hills, is in an area previously identified as probable  California tiger salamander habitat (Sweet et al. 1998). The ponds are  probably satellites to the larger Laguna Seca pond, a reported although  unconfirmed California tiger salamander breeding site (S. Sweet in  litt. 2000b). Salamanders from this metapopulation may provide evidence  of an historic genetic link between the Los Alamos and Santa Rita  Valley metapopulations, although the intensive agriculture currently  along State Highway 135 in the Los Alamos Valley probably now  constitutes a barrier to gene flow. This metapopulation is the least  threatened of the Santa Barbara County California tiger salamander  metapopulations; the owner of the property has expressed interest in  working with the Land Trust of Santa Barbara County to establish  conservation easements protecting both the California tiger salamanders  and open land on the site (Van de Kamp 2000). The land use around these  ponds consists of cattle grazing.     The east Los Alamos metapopulation consists of three small ponds in  an open savannah grassland (Monk & Associates 2000a). Currently, the  property is used for cattle grazing (G. McLaughlin, pers. obs. 2000);  however, the site is proposed for vineyard installation (Tony Korman  and Susan Cagann, Kendall Jackson, pers. comm. 2000). The property is  bordered to the north by Highway 101, which, along with extensive  vineyards, probably serves as a barrier between this site and some  potential breeding ponds on the north side of the highway.     In the Santa Rita Valley metapopulation, the westernmost area  occupied by the California tiger salamander has been severely affected  by agricultural grading, conversion to row crops, and livestock  facilities (S. Sweet in litt. 1993, 1998a,b; G. McLaughlin, pers. obs.  1998, 2000; Service files). A site in the eastern part of the valley  has two vernal pools that have been deepened to create a permanent  water source for cattle and have had introductions of mosquitofish  (Gambusia affinis) and sunfish (Lepomis spp.). Bullfrogs also are at  the site (G. McLaughlin, pers. obs. 2000). The upland habitat to the  north of the pools is still in very good condition. The pools are  adjacent to Highway 246, resulting in considerable road mortality of  salamanders during their breeding migrations (S. Sweet in litt. 1993,  1998a). Efforts to reduce roadkill are under discussion. Upland  habitats around two possible breeding ponds northeast of the second  site were deep-ripped in 1998 in preparation for conversion to  vineyards (L. Hunt in litt. 1998; Santa Barbara County Planning and  Development Department 1998). Vineyards have been installed (G.  McLaughlin pers. obs. 1999, 2000), and one of the ponds was enlarged  and deepened in 1999 (E. Gevirtz, pers. comm. 1999; Jim Mace, U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers, pers. comm. 1999). This change may make the pond  less desirable for the California tiger salamander and more likely to  be inhabited by exotic fish, crayfish, and bullfrogs. The remaining  undisturbed habitat is probably insufficient to support California  tiger salamanders over the long term.     Oil production began within the range of the salamander  approximately 100 years ago, with the discovery of oil in the Solomon  Hills (within the range of the Los Alamos tiger salamander  metapopulation). By 1910, production had begun in the Santa Maria  Valley (E. Gevirtz, pers. comm. 1999). Although oil production is less  disruptive to the upland habitats than agriculture, oil sump ponds,  particularly those located where natural ponds and pools once existed,  may act as toxic sinks. While attracting salamanders seeking breeding  sites, these ponds may contain levels of contaminants that may kill  adults, eggs, and larvae outright, or cause deformities in the  developing larvae thus precluding their survival (see discussion on  contaminants in Factor E of this section).     The primary cause of the reduced distribution of the California  tiger salamander in Santa Barbara County is the conversion of native  habitat to intensive agricultural practices and urban development. In  addition, the largest remaining subpopulations are in areas most  severely threatened by human encroachment (Shaffer et al. 1993; S.  Sweet in litt. 1993, 1998a; E. Gevirtz in litt. 1998). Besides direct  loss  [[Page 57254]]  of habitat, the widespread conversion of land to agricultural and  residential uses has led to the fragmentation of the range of the tiger  salamander and isolation of remaining subpopulations in Santa Barbara  County (Shaffer et al. 1993; S. Sweet in litt. 1993, 1998a). Even  relatively minor habitat modifications, such as construction of roads,  pipelines, fences, and berms that traverse the area between breeding  and refuge sites, can increase habitat fragmentation, impede or prevent  breeding migrations, and result in direct and indirect mortality (Mader  1984; S. Sweet in litt. 1993, 1998; Findlay and Houlahan 1996; Launer  and Fee 1996; Gibbs 1998).  B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or  Educational Purposes      Although tiger salamanders have been used for bait and imported  larvae (``waterdogs'') are still sold in California, we have no  information indicating that California tiger salamanders are used for  this purpose (see discussion under Factor E of this section).  Therefore, we do not believe overutilization is a threat to the Santa  Barbara County population of California tiger salamanders.  C. Disease or Predation  Disease     The direct effect of disease on the Santa Barbara County population  of California tiger salamanders is not known and the risks to the DPS  have not been determined. Because California tiger salamanders are  found in so few sites in Santa Barbara County, and because the sites  are found across a relatively small area, disease must be considered a  potential threat to the persistence of the DPS. Sam Sweet (pers. comm.  1998) reported that one landowner in the Los Alamos Valley has seen  large numbers of dead and dying salamanders in a pond, but the cause  was not determined. Several pathogenic (disease-causing) agents,  including at least one bacterium (Worthylake and Hovingh 1989), a water  mold (fungus) (Kiesecker and Blaustein 1997; Lefcort et al. 1997), and  a virus (McLean 1998), have been associated with die-offs of closely  related tiger salamanders, as well as other amphibian species. Each of  these pathogens could devastate one or all of the remaining  subpopulations or metapopulations if introduced into Santa Barbara  County.     Worthylake and Hovingh (1989) reported on repeated die-offs of  tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) in Desolation Lake in the  Wasatch Mountains of Utah. Affected salamanders had red, swollen hind  legs and vents, and widespread hemorrhage of the skin and internal  organs. The researchers determined that the die-offs were due to  infection with the bacterium Acinetobacter. The number of bacteria in  the lake increased with increasing nitrogen levels as the lake dried.  The nitrogen was believed to come from both atmospheric deposition and  waste from sheep grazing in the watershed (Worthylake and Hovingh  1989). Acinetobacter spp. are common in soil and animal feces.  Overstocking of livestock in pond watersheds could lead to high levels  of nitrogen in ponds and contribute to increased bacterial levels.     Lefcort et al. (1997), in Georgia, found that tiger salamanders  raised in natural and artificial ponds contaminated with silt were  susceptible to infection by the water mold Saprolegnia parasitica. The  fungus first appeared on the feet, then spread to the entire leg. All  infected animals died. Die-offs of western toads (Bufo boreas),  Cascades frogs (Rana cascadae), and Pacific treefrogs (Hyla regilla)  also have been associated with Saprolegnia infections (Kiesecker and  Blaustein 1997). Saprolegnia spp. are widespread in natural waters and  commonly grow on dead organic material (Wise 1995).     High nitrogen and silt levels from overgrazing or other  agricultural or urban runoff may increase susceptibility to disease and  may interact with other risk factors (e.g., habitat loss, introduced  species) to jeopardize the persistence of a local population. Two of  the three ponds in the West Orcutt metapopulation area are in  overgrazed grasslands and are at risk of receiving runoff that has both  high nitrogen and high silt levels. Four ponds in the Los Alamos  metapopulation and the two ponds in the Santa Rita metapopulation are  on grazing lands; although the levels of grazing are not excessive,  silt and nitrogen levels must be considered when assessing the health  of these populations. One of the ponds in the Los Alamos Valley was the  site of a die-off of California tiger salamanders, but the cause was  unknown (S. Sweet pers. comm. 1998).     In addition to the Acinetobacter discussed above, an iridovirus  (viruses with DNA as the genetic material that occur in insects, fish,  and amphibians and may cause death, skin lesions, or no symptoms) has  been identified by the U.S. Geological Service (USGS), National  Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin, as the cause of deaths of  large numbers of tiger salamanders at Desolation Lake, Utah. Infected  salamanders moved slowly in circles and had trouble remaining upright.  They had red spots and swollen areas on the skin. Viruses associated  with die-offs of tiger and spotted salamanders in two other States,  Maine and North Dakota, have been isolated (McLean 1998). In 1995,  researchers reported similar die-offs attributed to an iridovirus in  southern Arizona and near Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada (McLean 1998).  Iridoviruses are found in both fish and frogs and may have been  introduced to some sites through fish stocking programs. Little is  known about the historical distribution of iridoviruses in salamander  populations. A virus could enter California via bait shops where  eastern tiger salamanders are legally sold in certain counties  (California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 14, Division 1, Subdivision  1, Chapter 2, Article 3, Sec. 4, 1999), or where they are illegally  sold in other areas. The virus may be carried by birds, such as herons  and egrets, that feed on the salamanders. Such a virus could be  devastating to the Santa Barbara County population of California tiger  salamanders. Predation     Predation and competition by introduced or nonnative species  potentially affect at least four of the six Santa Barbara County  California tiger salamander metapopulations. Shaffer et al. (1993)  consider bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana), mosquitofish, and other  introduced fish to be biological indicators of ponds that have been  disturbed to a degree that California tiger salamanders are excluded.  Competition is discussed under Factor E of this section.     Bullfrogs prey on California tiger salamander larvae (P.R. Anderson  1968). Morey and Guinn (1992) documented a shift in amphibian community  composition at a vernal pool complex, with California tiger salamanders  becoming proportionally less abundant as bullfrogs increased. Although  bullfrogs are unable to establish permanent breeding populations in  unaltered vernal pools and seasonal ponds, dispersing immature frogs  take up residence in vernal pools during winter and spring (Morey and  Guinn 1992) and may prey on native amphibians, including larval  California tiger salamanders. Lawler et al. (1999) found that less than  5 percent of California red-legged frog tadpoles survived to  metamorphosis when raised with bullfrog tadpoles (initially, ponds held  720 red-legged frog tadpoles and 50 bullfrog tadpoles; approximately 50  percent of the bullfrogs successfully metamorphosed). Due to the  documented effects of bullfrogs on other  [[Page 57255]]  amphibian species, we believe that they are likely to have similar  effects on California tiger salamanders and that the presence of  bullfrogs in salamander habitat threatens the persistence of the  salamander populations. Bullfrogs are found within 1.6 km (1 mi) of one  vernal pool complex in Santa Barbara County (S. Sweet pers. comm.  1999), and within two other pond complexes (L. Hunt in litt. 2000; G.  McLaughlin, pers. obs. 2000), posing threats to those three  metapopulations.     Mosquitofish, instead of pesticides, often are placed into ponds by  vector control agencies to eliminate mosquitoes. Mosquitofish are used  by every vector control district in the State and in some districts  represent the majority of their control efforts (Ken Boyce, California  Mosquito and Vector Control Association, in litt. 1994). These fish  were first introduced to California in 1922 and have since become well- established throughout the State's water systems (K. Boyce in litt.  1994). In general, mosquitofish are stocked in very small numbers  because they quickly reproduce to the maximum population levels that a  particular habitat may sustain. Mosquitofish are extremely tolerant of  polluted water with low levels of dissolved oxygen and have an  extremely wide range of temperature tolerance (Boyce 1994).  Mosquitofish prey on the California newt (Taricha torosa) (Gamradt and  Kats 1996) and Pacific treefrog (Goodsell and Kats 1999) larvae in both  field and laboratory experiments, even given the optional prey of  mosquito larvae (Goodsell and Kats 1999; Lee Kats, Pepperdine  University, pers. comm. 1999). Both newt and Pacific treefrog larvae  were found in stomachs of wild-caught mosquitofish (Goodsell and Kats  1999; L. Kats, pers. comm. 1999). Robert Stebbins observed mosquitofish  ingesting and then spitting out California newt larvae, causing severe  damage to the newts in the process (Graf 1993). Schmieder and Nauman  (1993) found that mosquitofish significantly affected the survival of  both prefeeding and large larvae of California red-legged frogs. Lawler  et al. (1999) did not find a reduction in survival rates of California  red-legged frog tadpoles raised in the presence of mosquitofish versus  controls with no mosquitofish, but those tadpoles that did survive  weighed less than control tadpoles and metamorphosed later, and most  were injured by the fish. Smaller size at metamorphosis may reduce  survival to breeding age and reproductive potential (Semlitsch et al.  1988; Morey 1998). Salamanders may be especially vulnerable to  mosquitofish predation due to their fluttering external gills, which  may attract these visual predators (Graf 1993). Loredo-Prendeville et  al. (1994) found no California tiger salamanders in ponds with  mosquitofish. Due to the documented effects of mosquitofish on other  amphibian species, we believe that they are likely to have similar  effects on California tiger salamanders and that the use of  mosquitofish in salamander habitat threatens the persistence of the  salamander populations.     In addition to mosquitofish, other introduced fish, both native and  non-native, threaten the California tiger salamander. The introduction  of bass and sunfish to many ponds that may have been breeding habitat  for California tiger salamanders has probably eliminated salamanders  from those sites. The distribution of the California tiger salamander  in the north Los Alamos metapopulation may be limited by catfish  (Ictalurus sp.) that were introduced several years ago into a pond that  appears to have suitable breeding habitat. Although a pond less than 76  m (250 ft) away appears less suitable for breeding, it is occupied by  California tiger salamanders (S. Sweet in litt. 2000b). If the  reproductive output from the smaller pond is not enough to sustain the  population and the fish are not removed, that breeding population could  be lost. Two other ponds in the north Los Alamos metapopulation had  bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), largemouth bass (Micropterus  salmoides), and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) in 1999 (P.  Collins in litt. 2000a). The introduced fish populations were  extirpated when the ponds dried in the fall, but they may have caused  the loss of most or all of the larvae produced that year. A number of  ponds in or near occupied California tiger salamander habitat in the  West Orcutt area have been home to introduced fish for 20 years (Brady  Daniels, Kiewitt Pacific, pers. comm. 2000), probably eliminating any  California tiger salamanders that may have bred there.     Louisiana red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarki) also apparently  prey on California tiger salamanders (Shaffer et al. 1993) and may have  eliminated some populations (Jennings and Hayes 1994). The crayfish  prey on California newt eggs and larvae, in spite of toxins that the  species has developed, and may be a significant factor in the loss of  newts from several streams in southern California (Gamradt and Kats  1996). These crayfish are found in two salamander breeding sites in  Santa Barbara County, but their effect on egg and larval survival is  unknown (S. Sweet pers. comm. 1999).     California tiger salamander larvae also are preyed upon by many  native species. In healthy salamander populations such predation is  probably not a significant threat, but when combined with other  impacts, such as predation by nonnative species, contaminants, or  habitat alteration, it may cause a significant decrease in population  viability. Native predators include great blue herons (Ardea herodias)  and egrets (Casmerodius albus), western pond turtles (Clemmys  marmorata), various garter snakes (Thamnophis species.), larger  California tiger salamander larvae, larger spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus  hammondii) larvae, and California red-legged frogs (Mike Peters,  Service, in. litt. 1993; Hansen and Tremper 1993).  D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms      The primary cause of the decline of the Santa Barbara County  population of California tiger salamanders is the loss, degradation,  and fragmentation of habitat from human activities. Federal, State, and  local laws have not been sufficient to prevent past and ongoing losses  of California tiger salamander habitat. Federal     Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) authorizes the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers (Corps) to issue individual or general permits for  the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United  States, which include perennial, intermittent, and ephemeral streams,  wetlands (e.g., vernal pools), and other seasonal ponds typically used  by breeding salamanders. Projects that involve only the excavation of  pools whereby the discharge is limited to ``incidental fallback'' of  fill material, and projects that alter the watershed and hydrological  regime of the pool but do not involve ``discharge'' into the pool do  not require a section 404 permit (Coe 1988). General permits include  both nationwide and regional permits and may allow projects to proceed  without the scrutiny afforded through the individual permitting  process.     Of particular concern relative to the persistence of California  tiger salamanders are activities conducted under Nationwide Permits  (NWP) (33 CFR part 330 Appendix A). Previously, NWP 26 covered fill of  wetlands up to 3 acres; as of March 9, 2000, new NWPs 39, 41, 42, and  43, and modifications to NWPs 3, 7, 12, 14, 27, and 40 replace NWP 26  (65 FR 12817). The new and modified NWPs authorize many of the  [[Page 57256]]  same activities that NWP 26 authorized, but are activity-specific. The  maximum acreage limits of most of the new and modified NWPs is 0.2 ha  (0.5 ac). Most of the new and modified NWPs require notification to the  District Engineer for activities that result in the loss of greater  than 0.04 ha (0.1 ac). These permits thus authorize less fill than the  previous NWP 26. Under several of the NWPs that authorize activities  that might impact California tiger salamanders, the filling of less  than 0.04 ha (0.1 ac) of isolated waters can be undertaken without  notifying the Corps of the proposed activity unless a listed species or  designated critical habitat might be affected or is in the vicinity of  the project (NWP General Condition 11). However, the determination of  the potential presence of and/or impacts to listed species or  designated critical habitat is left to the applicant, who may not have  sufficient expertise to make such a determination.     Under several NWPs, if the activity will affect between 0.04 and  0.2 ha (0.1 and 0.5 ac) of wetlands, an applicant is required to notify  the Corps, but the Corps is not required to notify resource agencies  unless the project may affect a listed species or designated critical  habitat. Because vernal pools are often small and scattered across the  landscape, projects, even very large development projects that fill  hundreds of vernal pools, can be authorized under NWPs. Numerous small  projects in a given area also could be authorized, cumulatively  resulting in the loss of significant amounts of wetland and associated  upland habitats, with significant negative effects on local and  regional biodiversity (Semlitsch and Brodie 1998).     Projects affecting more than 0.2 ha (0.5 ac) of isolated waters  also can be authorized under NWPs after the Corps circulates a pre- construction notification (PCN) to the Service and other resource  agencies for review and comments. For such projects, the Corps can  place special conditions requiring minimization of impacts and/or  compensatory mitigation on authorizations granted under NWPs. The Corps  must require an individual permit for these projects if it determines  the project will have more than minimal individual or cumulative  effects. However, the Corps generally is reluctant to withhold  authorization under NWPs unless a listed threatened or endangered  species is known to be present. Also, the Corps often confines its  evaluation of impacts to those areas under its jurisdiction (i.e.,  wetlands and other waters of the United States). One review of  ambystomatid salamander studies reported that 100 percent of post- breeding adults and newly metamorphosed juveniles were found outside  the federally delineated wetland boundary (Semlitsch 1998). Therefore,  existing federal regulations are inadequate to protect tiger  salamanders, as impacts to uplands and mitigation for upland habitat  losses usually are not addressed by the Corps. Preservation of existing  pools without protection of large blocks of suitable uplands is  unlikely to result in the persistence of viable salamander populations  because the salamanders require both aquatic and upland habitats during  their life cycle. Thus, even with the new limits on filling of  wetlands, section 404 is unlikely to provide sufficient protection of  small isolated wetlands and the surrounding watersheds.     An individual permit is required for projects that do not qualify  under the terms of a General Permit, and for projects that are  determined by the Corps to have greater than minimal impacts or to be  contrary to the public interest. Individual permits are subject to  review by the Service, other resource agencies, and the public. When we  review the permit, we may recommend measures to avoid, minimize, or  mitigate losses. In some cases, compensatory mitigation (e.g., the  creation of artificial wetlands) is incorporated in the Corps permit as  a Special Condition. However, problems associated with such  compensatory measures often decrease or eliminate the habitat value for  salamanders at the sites (DeWeese 1994).     The creation of artificial wetlands and ponds as breeding habitat  for tiger salamanders has been used as a compensatory mechanism for the  loss of natural wetlands and pools. However, the long-term viability  and suitability of artificially created wetlands has not been  established. In 1994, the Service completed a report evaluating 30  wetland creation projects authorized through the Corps of Engineers  section 404 program (DeWeese 1994). Twenty-two projects ranged in age  from three to five years old, and eight projects were greater than five  years old at the time of the study. We found that, although it appeared  our goal of ``no net loss of acreage'' was being met or exceeded, the  value of the habitat created, which included the local wildlife species  that would be expected to use the habitat, was low. This was especially  the case for vernal pools and seasonal wetlands that had a value of  only 20 and 40 percent (respectively) of what existed previously.  Particular problems were noted for these habitat types, which often  were inundated (flooded) for longer than natural systems or more  frequently. The study concluded that, of the 600 ac (243 ha) of  proposed mitigation, half were meeting less than 75 percent of the  mitigation conditions. Mitigation and compensation for impacts to  larger wetlands under section 404 have failed to reduce threats to  California tiger salamanders.     The conversion of grazing land to intensive agricultural uses that  may adversely affect the California tiger salamander generally is  unregulated at any level of government. For example, the Corps has  promulgated regulations that exempt some farming, forestry, and  maintenance activities from the regulatory requirements of section 404  (33 CFR 323.4). Therefore, not all activities that destroy or degrade  vernal pools require Corps authorization. Certain normal farming  activities, including discing and plowing to depths less than 16 in (41  cm), can degrade or destroy vernal pools without requiring a permit  because these activities are exempt under the Clean Water Act. However,  deep-ripping, which disrupts the water-retaining hardpan that underlies  vernal pools and other seasonal wetlands, of lands formerly used for  ranching (i.e., grazing) or dry-land farming (e.g., non-irrigated hay  production) represents a ``change in use'' of the lands and is not  considered a normal and ongoing farming activity. As such, the practice  triggers section 404(f)(2) of the CWA, and requires review by and a  permit from the Corps (R.H. Wayland III, EPA, and D.R. Burns, Corps, in  litt. 1996). However, as discussed previously, the Corps typically  asserts jurisdiction only over the actual wetlands, not over the  surrounding uplands. State     The State of California recognizes the California tiger salamander  as a species of special concern under the California Endangered Species  Act (CESA), and has placed this species on the list of protected  amphibians, which means that it may not be taken without a special  (i.e., scientific collecting) permit (CRC, Title 14, Section 41).  However, this protection applies only to actual possession or  intentional killing of individual animals, and affords no protection to  habitat. Activities that destroy habitat and kill salamanders in the  process are not regulated.     The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) offers some  opportunities to protect rare, threatened and endangered plants and  animals and declares that it is the policy of the State to ``(p)revent  the elimination of fish or wildlife species due to man's activities,  ensure  [[Page 57257]]  that fish and wildlife populations do not drop below self-perpetuating  levels, and preserve for future generations representations of all  plant and animal communities.'' (California Public Resources Code,  section 21001(c) 1999). Species do not have to be listed under the  Federal or California ESAs to meet the determination of rare  (California Code of Regulations (CRC), Title 14, Chapter 3, Section  15380(b)(2)). Species that have been classified as ``species of special  concern'' are considered rare for the purposes of CEQA. When the CEQA  process is triggered, it requires full disclosure of the potential  environmental impacts of proposed projects. However, the CEQA review  process is not triggered unless issuance of a permit associated with a  project is considered ``discretionary'' rather than ``ministerial.''  The public agency with primary authority or jurisdiction over the  project is designated as the lead agency and is responsible for  conducting a review of the project and consulting with the other  agencies concerned with the resources affected by the project. Section  15065 of the CEQA Guidelines requires a finding of significance if a  project has the potential to ``reduce the number or restrict the range  of a rare or endangered plant or animal.'' Once significant effects are  identified, the lead agency has the option to require mitigation for  effects through changes in the projects or to decide that overriding  social or economic considerations make mitigation infeasible. In the  latter case, projects may be approved that cause significant  environmental damage, such as destruction of rare species. Protection  of listed or rare species through CEQA depends, first, on whether  discretionary approval is required for a project and, second, where  such approval is required, on how the agency exercises its discretion.  The effectiveness of this statute in protecting California tiger  salamanders and their vernal pool and upland habitats has not been  consistent. Local     In Santa Barbara County, no specific regulatory protection exists  for vernal pools, surrounding uplands, and their associated species,  including California tiger salamanders. Some provisions are  discretionary and could provide some measure of protection. For  example, the Santa Barbara County Grading Ordinance (Ordinance 3937,  Chapter 14 of the County Code) states that the issuance of a grading  permit is discretionary (Section 14-6(a)), and that ``no person shall  cause or allow a significant environmental impact to occur as a result  of new grading as defined herein, including grading that is otherwise  exempt from these regulations.'' In one case in 1998, the Planning  Department required, after the fact, a permit, the preparation of an  environmental impact report, and mitigation for the discing of a vernal  pool and the deep-ripping of uplands associated with that and an  adjacent, larger pool in preparation for vineyard installation (Albert  J. McCurdy, Deputy Director, Santa Barbara County Planning and  Development, in litt. 1998a). Those requirements were overturned by the  County Board of Supervisors (A. McCurdy in litt. 1998b). The Corps did  require a small set-aside of approximately 5.7 ha (14 ac) to provide a  narrow buffer around both ponds, as mitigation for the discing of the  smaller pool (David Castanon, Army Corps of Engineers, in litt. 1999).  In another case, grazing lands surrounding another pool were converted  to row crops to the edge of the pool. Although discing and other  activities clearly degraded the wetland, no agency has required any  review, permits, or mitigation for the activities. Santa Barbara County  is developing new regulations to address the protection of various  components of California tiger salamander habitat, but those have not  been completed, nor do we know how effectively those regulations will  be implemented and enforced (John Patton, Santa Barbara County Planning  and Development, in litt. 2000).     A recent report on the status of agricultural grading and the  enforcement of the County's grading ordinance found that 93 percent of  the new cultivation since 1997 in Santa Barbara County has taken place  without the need for County permits (Santa Barbara County Planning and  Development Department 2000). This same report states that ``overall,  the County's enforcement of the Grading Ordinance appears to have had  little negative direct effect on the agricultural industry * * *'' and  that ``the program has not succeeded in encouraging operators of  agricultural expansion projects to consult with the agricultural  assistance team on whether permits are required prior to beginning  grading.'' Finally, a Grand Jury report published in 1999 states that  the Santa Barbara County agricultural community frequently proceeds  with agricultural conversions without a permit, preferring to suffer  the consequences later rather than undertake the time-consuming permit  process (Santa Barbara County Grand Jury 1999).     Typically, California tiger salamander habitat has been eliminated  without offsetting mitigation measures. Most mitigation plans that have  been required were designed specifically for vernal pool plants and did  not consider the upland habitats, including mammal burrows, needed by  salamanders, or their dispersal needs. As indicated above, the  artificial creation of vernal pools and seasonal wetlands as  compensatory mitigation has not been proven scientifically to be  successful over the long term (Zedler and Black 1988, Ferren and  Gevirtz 1990, Zedler and Calloway 1999). Race and Fonseca (1996)  reviewed numerous published and unpublished documents, which  collectively analyzed more than 2,000 permitted wetland mitigation  projects, and concluded that significant wetland losses will continue  unless compliance with existing regulations and permits is improved,  more habitat is generated, and more fully functioning wetlands are  created.  E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence      Several other factors, including habitat fragmentation,  contaminants, hybridization with and competition from introduced  species, and effects from oil production and over-grazing may have  negative effects on California tiger salamanders and their aquatic and  upland habitats. Fragmentation     Amphibian populations are prone to local extinction due to human- caused fragmentation (Findlay and Houlahan 1996, Gibbs 1998). This risk  is heightened for the California tiger salamander, as it is distributed  throughout the landscape in a metapopulation framework, with  salamanders at some sites temporarily extirpated and then recolonizing  from neighboring sites. Reducing the California tiger salamander's  distribution to a few isolated ponds greatly reduces the species'  ability to persist over time (H.B. Shaffer in litt. 2000b). The primary  factors that cause habitat fragmentation are road construction,  urbanization, and intensive agriculture (Mader 1984; Saunders et al.  1991). All documented localities of California tiger salamanders in  Santa Barbara County are affected by railroads, highways, or other  roads that have caused extensive fragmentation of the landscape. Even  the relatively pristine Purisima Hills ponds are either bounded by or  very close to a dirt road (S. Sweet in litt. 2000b). The dispersal and  migration distances of California tiger salamanders require a large  amount of barrier-free landscape (Shaffer et al. 1993; Loredo et al.  1996). Large roads and highways represent permanent physical obstacles  and can block  [[Page 57258]]  California tiger salamanders from moving to new breeding habitat or  prevent them from returning to their breeding ponds or estivation  sites. Roads can accelerate fragmentation by increasing mortality and  preventing recolonization of sites that would otherwise be only  temporarily extirpated (Trombulak and Frissell 2000).     Road construction can significantly reduce the breeding population  of a pond and, in some cases, cause the loss of a large portion of a  metapopulation. Road construction results in the death of slow-moving  animals and causes soil compaction underneath and adjacent to the road  bed (Trombulak and Frissell 2000). Any California tiger salamanders in  underground burrows in the path of the road or in the impact area are  likely to be crushed during road construction. Once the road is open to  traffic, salamanders are at risk of being run over on their first  dispersal migration from the pond, and on future migrations to and from  the ponds for breeding.     Two Santa Barbara County tiger salamander breeding ponds are within  0.4 km (0.2 mi) of a railroad that runs between them, possibly reducing  migration and genetic interchange between the ponds. In addition to the  barriers created by fill deposited in small canyons and watercourses,  the railroad tracks themselves can act as barriers to migrating  salamanders (Thomas R. Jones, Museum of Zoology, University of  Michigan, in litt. 1993). The animals have difficulty getting under the  tracks unless adequate holes are present.     All of the remaining breeding sites in Santa Barbara County are  near roads of various sizes. Eight are within 0.5 km (0.3 mi) of a  major U.S. highway, one is bounded by a State highway, two are adjacent  to secondary roads (as was the pond destroyed in 1998), and five are  within 0.5 km (0.3 mi) of secondary roads. Although the remaining ponds  are adjacent to or near dirt roads (Sweet et al. 1998a; Service files),  the threats to those ponds from roadkill and the effects of  fragmentation are less than the threats to ponds bounded by or near  heavily traveled paved roads. Findlay and Houlahan (1996) found that  roads within 2 km (1.2 mi) of wetlands adversely affected the number of  amphibian species in the wetlands. Roads alter many of the physical  characteristics of the environment that may be important to California  tiger salamanders, including soil density, soil water content, dust,  surface-water flow, patterns of runoff, and sedimentation (Trombulak  and Frissell 2000). The deleterious effects of roads on many ecological  factors reach an average of 0.6 km (0.4 mi) from the road itself and  are especially harmful to species such as salamanders that are often  genetically programmed to migrate in a certain direction for breeding  (Forman and Deblinger 2000).     Amphibians are especially vulnerable to being killed on roads due  to life histories involving migration between breeding and upland  habitats and their slow movements (Trombulak and Frissell 2000). Large  numbers of California tiger salamanders, up to 9 to 12 per km (15 to 20  per mi) of road (Joe Medeiros, Sierra College, pers. comm. 1993), are  killed as they cross the roads on breeding migrations (Hansen and  Tremper 1993; S. Sweet in litt. 1993). Of California tiger salamanders  found on roads, 25 to 72 percent are dead (Twitty 1941; S. Sweet in  litt. 1993; Launer and Fee 1996). However, Sweet's report states that  ``the sizes of breeding adults do not point toward a major influence by  road-kill.'' (Emphasis in original.) Curbs and berms as low as 9 to 12  cm (3.5 to 5 in), which allow salamanders to climb onto the road but  can restrict or prevent their movements off the roads, are of  particular concern, as they effectively turn the roads into death traps  (Launer and Fee 1996; S. Sweet in litt. 1998a). Such berms exist on the  State highway and the secondary road adjacent to three ponds in Santa  Barbara County.     Although few currently used breeding ponds are within 0.5 km (0.3  mi) of urban developments, the rapid expansion of Santa Maria and  nearby communities will continue to fragment the remaining habitat. The  urbanization of the Santa Maria River and Orcutt Creek Valleys divided  what was probably a large, relatively contiguous tiger salamander  population extending from the Casmalia Hills in the west to Fulger  Point in the east into isolated subpopulations (West Orcutt and  Bradley-Dominion) that are no longer capable of genetic interchange.  One pond in the West Orcutt area is adjacent to an urban development,  the owner of the other two ponds in that area has expressed a desire to  develop his property (E. Gevirtz, pers. comm. 1999), and home sites are  offered in the Bradley-Dominion area (G. McLaughlin, pers. obs. 1998,  2000). Contaminants     Hydrocarbon and other contamination from oil production and road  runoff; the application of numerous chemicals for agricultural  production, roadside maintenance, and urban/suburban landscape  maintenance; and rodent and vector control programs may all have  negative effects on tiger salamander populations, as detailed below.     Direct mortality is not the only risk factor associated with roads,  as oil and other contaminants in runoff have been detected in adjacent  ponds and linked to die-offs of and deformities in California tiger  salamanders and spadefoot toads and die-offs of invertebrates that form  most of both species' prey base (S. Sweet in litt. 1993). Lefcort et  al. (1997) found that oil had limited direct effects on 5-week-old  marbled (Ambystoma opacum) and eastern tiger salamanders (A.t.  tigrinum), but that salamanders from oil-contaminated natural ponds  metamorphosed earlier at smaller sizes and those from oil-contaminated  artificial ponds had slower growth rates than larvae raised in non- contaminated ponds. Their studies did not address effects on eggs and  early larval stages, where the effects may be more pronounced. Hatch  and Burton (1998) and Monson et al. (1999) investigated the effects of  one component of petroleum products and urban runoff (fluoranthene, a  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) on spotted salamanders (A. maculatum),  northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens), and African clawed frogs  (Xenopus laevis). In laboratory and outdoor experiments, using levels  of the contaminant comparable to those found in service station and  other urban runoff, the researchers found reduced survival and growth  abnormalities in all species and that the effects were worse when the  larvae were exposed to the contaminant under natural levels of  sunlight, rather than in the laboratory under artificial light.     Sedimentation from road construction, maintenance, and runoff is  another form of contamination that may affect California tiger  salamander breeding ponds. Roads alter the hydrology of slopes, in part  by diverting water into surface-water systems that can cause erosion,  create gullies, and deposit increased loads of sediments into wetland  systems (Trombulak and Frissell 2000). Road traffic can spread dust,  which can settle into ponds, affecting aquatic and emergent vegetation  and causing asphyxiation of eggs. Increased sedimentation could also  degrade habitat by filling pools otherwise usable by the species; there  is evidence that this is occurring at one pond in the Solomon Hills/ west Los Alamos metapopulation (P. Collins in litt. 2000a, J. Sainz  pers. comm. to B. Fahey 2000). The ability of the California tiger  salamander to detect aquatic food items could be impaired from  increased sedimentation, as can  [[Page 57259]]  susceptibility to diseases (see factor C, above). Agricultural Contaminants     Even though most of the crop lands in California have been in  agricultural production since 1900, the application and associated  effects of large amounts of pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and  nitrogen fertilizers on the landscape have been addressed only recently  (Burow et al. 1998a, b). The concentrations of these chemicals and  their immediate effects on various species have been difficult to  assess mainly due to lack of water sample data and lack of samples  close to the sources of application where the effects on wildlife are  most severe. In 1986-87 and from 1993 to 1997, USGS and California  Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR) personnel sampled well and  ground water at 156 locations throughout the range of the California  tiger salamander (CDPR 1998; Burow et al. 1998a, b). From these  samples, 29 different chemicals potentially toxic to amphibians in  general and California tiger salamanders specifically were detected.     In Santa Barbara County, more than 1 million kilograms (kg) (2.2  million pounds (lb)) of agricultural chemicals were used in 1994 on  strawberries, grapes, lettuce, broccoli, and carrots, which were the  five major crop types grown on or near tiger salamander sites at that  time (California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) Internet  Website). These chemicals included metam-sodium, methyl bromide, maneb,  fosetyl-aluminum, acephate, cryolite, chlorpyrifos, fenamiphos,  malathion, and endosulfan; some of these are extremely toxic to aquatic  organisms, including amphibians and the organisms on which they prey.  Many more agricultural chemicals may have lethal or sublethal effects  on California tiger salamanders; those discussed here provide only a  sample of the actual and potential threats.     Metam-sodium, a broad spectrum carbamate used for soil  sterilization, was one of the main chemicals applied on broccoli and  lettuce grown in 1994, when more than 114,000 kg (more than 250,000 lb)  were used in Santa Barbara County (CDFA). Metam-sodium is extremely  toxic to fish (Meister 1997). Although no test data are available for  amphibians, the effects are likely to be similar.     Chlorpyrifos is a highly toxic organophosphate insecticide applied  as granules, wettable powder, dustable powder, or emulsifiable  concentrate (EXTOXNET 1996a). Chlorpyrifos was detected at a  concentration of 0.006 micrograms/liter ( g/l) in domestic well  water close to vineyards at one location (Burow et al. 1998a); however,  animals migrating across recently treated fields may be exposed to much  higher concentrations. The compound is absorbed through the skin of  mammals (EXTOXNET 1996a); amphibians, with their more permeable skins,  absorb the chemical even more readily. General agricultural use of  chlorpyrifos is considered to pose a serious threat to wildlife  (EXTOXNET 1996a). More than 6,000 kg (13,000 lb) were used in Santa  Barbara County in 1994 (CDFA).     Fenamiphos, a phosphorothioate, is used on many crops to control a  wide variety of nematodes (roundworms). The compound is absorbed by  roots and translocated throughout the plant. The toxicity of fenamiphos  to aquatic species varies from moderate to high. Fish are extremely  sensitive to fenamiphos (EXTOXNET 1996b). Fenamiphos has been linked to  fish and bird kills and is known to have a high potential of leaching  into the groundwater. Nearly 12,000 kg (26,000 pounds) were used in  Santa Barbara County in 1994 (CDFA).     Malathion has caused effects such as mortality, delays in  metamorphosis, and decreased size at metamorphosis in several species  of frogs and toads at concentrations as low as 0.2 milligrams (mg/l)  (Devillers and Exbrayat 1992). Malathion was detected at concentrations  up to 0.1  g/l in test wells near fields on which it has been  used (Burow 1998a). More than 3,500 kg (7,800 lb) of malathion were  used in Santa Barbara County in 1994 (CDFA).     Although test data for amphibian species could not be found, methyl  bromide is extremely toxic and is used to kill weeds, insects,  nematodes, and rodents (Salmon and Schmidt 1984). Methyl bromide is  used primarily on strawberries in Santa Barbara County, which are grown  extensively in the eastern Santa Maria Valley (Bradley-Dominion  metapopulation). More than 225,000 kg (500,000 lb) were used in Santa  Barbara County in 1994 (CDFA).     Azinphos-methyl (AZM) is an organophosphate insecticide and  miticide used on many crops. The EPA (EXTOXNET 1996c) classifies this  pesticide as class I, which are highly toxic compounds. Harris et al.  (1998) reported a green frog (Rana clamitans) 16-day LC50 of >5.0 mg/L  for Guthion WP, a preparation of 50 percent AZM. Dolah et al. (1997)  reported that, in South Carolina streams, measured concentrations of  AZM at greater than 17  g/L have coincided with documented fish  kills. They reported that at a concentration of 20  g/L, 100  percent mortality occurs within a short time. The use of AZM in the  vicinity of the California tiger salamander could affect recruitment  and survival directly, or affect the food supply.     Endosulfan is a sulfur-containing organochlorine used for the  control of many insects on a wide variety of crops. Studies by Berrill  et al. (1998) reported severe toxicity to amphibians from exposure to  endosulfan, including extensive paralysis to several species of frog  and toad tadpoles, delayed metamorphosis and high death rates. Harris  et al. (1998) reported that green frogs exposed to Thiodan  (a  47 percent mixture of endosulfan) had a 16-d LC50 of greater than 5.0  mg/L. It is apparent that endosulfan is extremely toxic at low  concentrations to amphibians.     Five of the six metapopulations of California tiger salamanders  breeding sites in Santa Barbara County may be directly or indirectly  affected by toxic agricultural chemical contaminants because there is  intensive agriculture within their drainage basins. Even if toxic or  detectable amounts of pesticides are not found in the breeding ponds or  groundwater, salamanders may still be directly affected, particularly  when chemicals are applied during the migration and dispersal seasons. Rodent Control     California tiger salamanders spend much of their lives in  underground retreats, typically in the burrows of ground squirrels and  gophers (Loredo et al. 1996; Trenham 1998a). Widespread ground squirrel  control programs were begun as early as 1910 and are carried out on  more than 4 million ha (9.9 million ac) in California (Marsh 1987). It  is unclear how effective such control programs were in reducing ground  squirrel populations. According to Marsh (1987), when a ground squirrel  population is at or near carrying capacity, it must be reduced by at  least 90 percent annually for several years to significantly reduce the  population.     It may not be practical to attain such high reduction rates over  large areas typical of rangelands, but it may be possible to reduce  populations to low numbers (Salmon and Schmidt 1984). In some primarily  agricultural counties, the ground squirrel population has been reduced  and maintained at perhaps 10 to 20 percent of the carrying capacity.  Rodent control programs are conducted by individual land owners and  managers on grazing, vineyard, and crop production lands (Rosemary  Thompson, Senior Biologist, SAIC, in litt. 1998).     Until about 1990, ground squirrel control programs using compound  1080 (sodium fluoroacetate) were carried out  [[Page 57260]]  on lands in Santa Barbara County (R. Thompson in litt. 1998). Compound  1080 is extremely toxic to nontarget fish, birds, and mammals (EPA  1990) and may have contributed to reductions in salamander populations  in the areas where it was used.     Poisoned grains are the most common method used to control ground  squirrels on rangelands, and there is little risk of ingestion by  California tiger salamanders. However the use of these grains may  impact the California tiger salamanders indirectly if washed into  burrows or ponds used by the species. Two of the most commonly used  rodenticides, chlorophacinone and diphacinone, are anticoagulants that  cause animals to bleed to death. They can be absorbed through the skin  and are considered toxic to fish and wildlife (EPA 1985, EXTOXNET  1996d). Both, along with strychnine, are used in Santa Barbara County  to control rodents (R. Thompson, in litt. 1998). Zinc phosphide, an  acute rodenticide and a restricted material, turns into a toxic gas  once ingested. Although the effects of these poisons on California  tiger salamanders have not been assessed, use along roadways or  railways may result in contamination of salamander breeding ponds, with  undetermined effects. Gases, including aluminum phosphide, carbon  monoxide, and methyl bromide, can be introduced into burrows either by  using cartridges or by pumping. When such fumigants are used, all  animals inhabiting the burrow are killed (Salmon and Schmidt 1984).     In addition to possible direct effects of rodent control chemicals,  control programs probably have an adverse indirect effect on California  tiger salamander populations. Control of ground squirrels could  significantly reduce the number of burrows available for use by the  species (Loredo-Prendeville et al. 1994). Because the burrow density  required to support California tiger salamanders in an area is not  known, the loss of burrows as a result of control programs and its  affect on salamanders cannot be quantified at this time. However,  Shaffer et al. (1993) believe that rodent control programs may be  responsible for the lack of California tiger salamanders in some areas.  Active ground squirrel colonies probably are needed to sustain tiger  salamanders because inactive burrow systems become progressively  unsuitable over time. Loredo et al. (1996) found that burrow systems  collapsed within 18 months following abandonment by or loss of the  ground squirrels. Although the researchers found that California tiger  salamanders used both occupied and unoccupied burrows, they did not  indicate that the salamanders used collapsed burrows. Current risks to  the salamander in Santa Barbara County from rodent control programs are  unknown. Mosquito Control     A commonly used method to control mosquitoes, including in Santa  Barbara County (Kenneth Leanard, Santa Barbara County Vector Control,  pers. comm. 1999) is the application of methoprene, which increases the  level of juvenile hormone in insect larvae and disrupts the molting  process. Lawrenz (1984-85) found that methoprene (Altosid  SR- 10) retarded the development of selected crustacea that had the same  molting hormones ( i.e., juvenile hormone) as insects and anticipated  that the same hormone may control metamorphosis in other arthropods.  Because the success of many aquatic vertebrates relies on an abundance  of invertebrates in temporary wetlands, any delay in insect growth  could reduce the numbers and density of prey available (Lawrenz 1984- 85). The use of methoprene thus could have an indirect adverse effect  on the California tiger salamander by reducing the availability of  prey. In more recent studies, although methoprene did not cause  increased mortality of gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor) tadpoles  (Sparling and Lowe 1998), it caused reduced survival rates and  increased malformations in northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens)  (Ankley et al. 1998) and increased malformations in southern leopard  frogs (R. utricularia) (Sparling 1998). Blumberg et al. (1998) also  correlated exposure to methoprene with delayed metamorphosis and high  mortality rates in northern leopard and mink (R. septentrionalis)  frogs. Methoprene appears to have both direct and indirect effects on  the growth and survival of larval amphibians.     Other insecticides (e.g., temephos) have caused reductions in the  growth rates of gray treefrog tadpoles, increased mortality rates in  green frog (R. clamitans) tadpoles (Sparling and Lowe 1998), and  increased mortality rates in southern leopard frogs (Sparling 1998).  Few data are available on the effects of most insecticides on  salamanders. A bacterium, Bacillus thuringensis israeli (Bti), is also  used in Santa Barbara County for mosquito control (K. Leanard, pers.  comm. 1999). Its effects on the salamander prey base have not been  quantified. Because of a lack of information regarding which mosquito  control chemicals are used and where, and about the chemicals' effects  on salamanders, the degree to which the practices directly affect the  California tiger salamander in Santa Barbara County cannot be  determined at this time. Introduced Species     Introduced species can have negative effects on California tiger  salamander populations through competition and hybridization (Shaffer  et al. 1993; H.B. Shaffer in litt. 1999). Competition from fish that  prey on mosquito larvae and other invertebrates can reduce the survival  of salamanders. Both California tiger salamanders (Stebbins 1962; J. D.  Anderson 1968; Holomuzki 1986) and mosquitofish feed on micro and  macro-invertebrates; large numbers of mosquitofish may out-compete the  salamander larvae for food (Graf 1993). As urban areas continue to  expand, the introduction of mosquitofish into previously untreated  ponds may result in the elimination of California tiger salamanders  from additional breeding sites. The introduction of other fish either  inadvertently (fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas) (P. Collins, pers.  comm. 1999) or for recreational fishing (e.g., bass (Micropterus  salmoides, M. dolomieu), sunfish (S. Sweet, pers. comm. 1999) or other  purposes may also affect the prey base, reducing growth and survival  rates of salamanders. Fish such as bass, green sunfish (L. cyanellus),  carp (Cyprinus carpio), and bullhead (Ictalurus spp.) may also prey on  tiger salamander larvae, reducing or eliminating populations (Shaffer  et al. 1993). Introduced Tiger Salamanders     Various nonnative subspecies of the tiger salamander, Ambystoma  tigrinum, have been imported into much of California for use as fish  bait. The practice is still legal in California but is now restricted  to fewer counties and is regulated by the California Department of Fish  and Game (CCR Title 14, Division 1, Subdivision 1, Chapter 2, Article  3, Section 4 1999). Although importation into Santa Barbara County is  illegal, introduced tiger salamanders have been documented at one  locality west of the Santa Rita Valley (S. Sweet, pers. comm. 1998). A  recently discovered breeding population on the Lompoc Federal Prison  property are probably non-native tiger salamanders as well (Storrer in  litt. 2000); tissue from these larvae are being analyzed to confirm  their identity. Although they have not been documented in California  tiger salamander habitat, nonnative salamanders could potentially be  introduced into breeding sites or into nearby ponds. The introduced  salamanders may out-compete the California tiger salamander, or  [[Page 57261]]  interbreed with the natives to create hybrids that may be less adapted  to the California climate or are not reproductively viable past the  first or second generations (Bury and Lukenbach 1976; Shaffer et al.  1993). More recent evidence suggests that the hybrids are viable, and  that they breed with California tiger salamanders (H.B. Shaffer in  litt. 1999). With so few remaining subpopulations of California tiger  salamanders in Santa Barbara County, the loss of any to hybridization  with or competition from introduced species is of serious concern. Grazing     Grazing in many cases has positive, or at least neutral, effects on  the California tiger salamander (H.B. Shaffer and Peter Trenham, UCD,  pers. comm. 1998; S. Sweet, pers. comm. 1998; 1999). By keeping  vegetation shorter, grazing can make areas more suitable for ground  squirrels, whose burrows are used by California tiger salamanders. In  Santa Barbara County, the only remaining sites with large amounts of  suitable salamander habitat currently are being grazed. Although cattle  drink large quantities of water, sometimes causing temporary pools to  dry faster than they otherwise would (Sheri Melanson, Service, in litt.  1993) and possibly causing breeding pools to dry too quickly for  salamanders to be able to metamorphose (Feaver 1971), these rangelands  are the only undeveloped habitat in the area and thus provide the only  chance for salamanders to maintain large, sustainable populations.  Although Melanson (in litt. 1993) noted that vernal pool species  continued to reproduce under a November-to-April grazing regime,  California tiger salamanders were either absent or found in low numbers  in portions of pools that were heavily trampled by cattle. Continued  trampling of a pond's edge by cattle can increase the surface area of a  pond and may increase water temperature and speed up the rate of  evaporation and thus reduce the amount of time the pond contains enough  water (S. Sweet, pers. comm. 1998). Cattle hoofprints could trap  salamanders as water levels in pools recede, and reduction in water  quality caused by cattle excrement may negatively affect the animals  mainly by increasing potentially detrimental nitrogen levels. High  nitrogen levels have been associated with blooms of deadly bacteria  (Worthylake and Hovingh 1989), and silt has been associated with fatal  fungal infections (Lefcort et al. 1997) (see Factor C of this section).  However, grazing generally is compatible with the continued use of  rangelands by the California tiger salamander as long as intensive  burrowing rodent control programs are not implemented on such areas and  grazing is not excessive (T. Jones in litt. 1993; Shaffer et al. 1993;  S. Sweet pers. comm. 1998, 1999). Water Drawdowns     Many of the ponds in northern Santa Barbara County are subject to  drawdowns for agricultural uses, including irrigation and frost  control. Water is removed from the pond using submersible pumps. This  has a two-fold effect to California tiger salamander inhabiting these  ponds: (1) Salamander larvae and adults may be sucked into the pump  mechanism during drawdowns for frost control, killing them in the  process (P. Collins in litt. 2000a), and (2) ponds may be subject to  premature drying in the spring and summer, resulting in the stranding  of larvae before they are able to metamorphose.     In developing this final rule, we have carefully assessed the best  scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,  present, and future threats faced by the Santa Barbara County  population of California tiger salamanders. This DPS is one of the two  most genetically differentiated populations of the species, probably  deserving recognition as a separate species, and is restricted to very  few areas, all of which are threatened to some degree by agricultural  conversion, fragmentation, or urban development. As discussed under  Factor A of this section, ponds and upland habitats are being lost at a  rapid rate in five of the six regions of the county in which the  species occurs, and no preserves have been established to protect the  species. As discussed in Factor E of this section, this salamander is a  DPS and still occurs in a significant part of its historic range, but  the remaining subpopulations are becoming increasingly fragmented and  thus vulnerable to threats associated with isolation and small  population size. From the discussion under Factor D of this section, it  is clear that Federal, State, and local regulations and ordinances,  individually and collectively, do not provide adequate protection for  California tiger salamanders or assure that California tiger  salamanders will continue to survive in Santa Barbara County.     Of the 26 known breeding sites, 24 are located exclusively on  privately owned land and the other 2 are partially on Santa Barbara  County property. Upland habitats surrounding 25 of the ponds are  exclusively privately owned; the remaining habitat is a patchwork of  county and private lands. No conservation agreements or easements  adequate to ensure the long term viability of any metapopulation are in  place. Given the extremely rapid rate of recent and projected habitat  loss and degradation, this Santa Barbara DPS is in imminent danger of  extinction throughout most of its historic range, and may have been  eliminated from one area (Bradley-Dominion) in the last 2 years. The  survival of the Santa Barbara DPS of the California tiger salamander  now depends on protecting as many breeding sites and their associated  upland habitats from further degradation and destruction as possible,  and on the rapid rehabilitation of sites that have been seriously  degraded in the last few years. The remaining subpopulations in Santa  Barbara County are vulnerable to extinction from random natural or  human-caused events unless sufficient habitat can be protected and the  subpopulations increased in size. Immediately upon publication, this  final rule will continue the protection for this DPS of California  tiger salamanders, which began when we emergency listed this DPS on  January 19, 2000. Critical Habitat     In the last few years, a series of court decisions have overturned  our determinations regarding a variety of species that designation of  critical habitat would not be prudent (e.g., Natural Resources Defense  Council v. U.S. Department of the Interior 113 F. 3d 1121 (9th Cir.  1997); Conservation Council for Hawaii v. Babbitt, 2 F. Supp. 2d 1280  (D. Hawaii 1998)). Based on the standards applied in those judicial  opinions, we have examined the question of whether critical habitat for  the Santa Barbara County California tiger salamander would be prudent.     Due to the small number of populations the Santa Barbara County  California tiger salamander is vulnerable to unrestricted collection,  vandalism, or other disturbance. However, we have examined the evidence  available for Santa Barbara County California tiger salamander and have  not found specific evidence of taking, vandalism, collection, or trade  of this species. Consequently, consistent with applicable regulations  (50 CFR 424.12(a)(1)(I)) and recent case law, we do not expect that the  identification of critical habitat will increase the degree of threat  to this species of taking or other human activity.     In the absence of a finding that critical habitat would increase  threats to a species, if there are any benefits to critical habitat  designation, then a  [[Page 57262]]  prudent finding is warranted. In the case of this species, there may be  some benefits to designation of critical habitat. The primary  regulatory effect of critical habitat is the section 7 requirement that  Federal agencies refrain from taking any action that destroys or  adversely modifies critical habitat. While a critical habitat  designation for habitat currently occupied by this species would not be  likely to change the section 7 consultation outcome because an action  that destroys or adversely modifies such critical habitat would also be  likely to result in jeopardy to the species, there may be instances  where section 7 consultation would be triggered only if critical  habitat is designated. Examples could include unoccupied habitat or  occupied habitat that may become unoccupied in the future. There may  also be some educational or informational benefits to designating  critical habitat. Therefore, we find that critical habitat is prudent  for the Santa Barbara County California tiger salamander.     Critical habitat is not determinable when one or both of the  following situations exist: the information needed to analyze the  impacts of the designation is lacking, or the biological needs of the  species are not sufficiently well known to permit identification of an  area as critical habitat (50 CFR 424.12). We believe we understand the  biological needs of the Santa Barbara County California tiger  salamander sufficiently well to identify an area appropriate to  designate as critical habitat. However, our review of the comments we  received following the emergency listing of the Santa Barbara County  California tiger salamander indicates the potential impacts of a  critical habitat designation are not so well understood that we can  complete the analyses required under subsection 4(b) of the Act.  Accordingly, we have found that critical habitat for the California  tiger salamander is not determinable at this time.     When we find that critical habitat is not determinable, our  regulations (50 CFR 424.17) provide that, within one year of the date  of the final rule listing the species, we must publish a final rule  designating critical habitat, based on the best information available  at the time. We will undertake critical habitat determinations and  designations during FY 2001 as allowed by our funding allocation for  that year. As explained in detail in the Listing Priority Guidance (64  FR 57114), our listing budget is currently insufficient to allow us to  immediately complete all of the listing actions required by the Act. We  plan to employ a priority system for deciding which outstanding  critical habitat designations should be addressed first. We will focus  our efforts on those designations that will provide the most  conservation benefit, taking into consideration the efficacy of  critical habitat designation in addressing the threats to the species,  and the magnitude and immediacy of those threats. We will develop a  proposal to designate critical habitat for the Santa Barbara County  California tiger salamander as soon as feasible, considering our  workload priorities and available funding. Available Conservation Measures     Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or  threatened under the Act include recognition, recovery actions,  requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain  practices. Recognition through listing results in public awareness and  conservation actions by Federal, State, and local agencies, private  organizations, and individuals. The Act provides for possible land  acquisition and cooperation with the State and requires that recovery  actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required  of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities  involving listed species are discussed, in part, below.     Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to  evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or  listed as endangered or threatened, and with respect to the species'  critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing  this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50  CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to  confer with us on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued  existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse  modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species subsequently is  listed, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that  activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to  jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or  adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal agency action may  affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible  Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with us. Federal  agency actions that may affect the Santa Barbara County population of  California tiger salamanders and may require conference and/or  consultation with us include, but are not limited to, those within the  jurisdiction of the Corps, Bureau of Reclamation, Natural Resources  Conservation Service, Federal Farm Bureau, and Federal Highway  Administration.     Listing this species provides for the development of a recovery  plan, which would bring together Federal, State, local, and private  efforts for the conservation of the species. The plan would establish a  framework for agencies to coordinate activities and cooperate with each  other in conservation efforts. The plan would set recovery priorities  and estimate costs of various tasks necessary to accomplish them. It  also would describe site-specific management actions necessary to  achieve conservation and survival of the Santa Barbara County  population of California tiger salamanders. Additionally, pursuant to  section 6 of the Act, we would be able to grant funds to the State for  management actions promoting the protection and recovery of the  salamander.     The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set  forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all  endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for  any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to take  (including harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap,  capture, or collect; or attempt any such conduct), import or export,  ship in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of commercial  activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce  any listed species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver,  carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken  illegally. Certain exceptions apply to our agents and those of State  conservation agencies.     Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities  involving endangered wildlife under certain circumstances. Regulations  governing permits are codified at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. For  endangered species, such permits are available for scientific purposes,  to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and for  incidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities.     As published in the Federal Register on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34272),  it is our policy to identify to the maximum extent practicable at the  time a species is listed those activities that would or would not  constitute a violation of section 9 of the Act. The intent of this  policy is to increase public awareness of the effect of the listing on  proposed and ongoing activities within a species' range.     We believe that, based on the best available information, the  following  [[Page 57263]]  actions are not likely to result in a violation of section 9, provided  these actions are carried out in accordance with any existing  regulations and permit requirements:     (1) Possession of a Santa Barbara County California tiger  salamander legally acquired prior to the effective date of the  emergency rule, published on January 19, 2000, and being held  consistent with regulations at 50 CFR 17.4;     (2) Actions that may affect the Santa Barbara County California  tiger salamander that are authorized, funded, or carried out by a  Federal agency, when the action is conducted in accordance with an  incidental take statement issued by us under section 7 of the Act;     (3) Actions that may affect the Santa Barbara County California  tiger salamander that are not authorized, funded, or carried out by a  Federal agency, when the action is conducted in accordance with an  incidental take permit issued by us under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the  Act. To obtain a permit, an applicant must develop a habitat  conservation plan and apply for an incidental take permit that  minimizes and mitigates impacts to the species to the maximum extent  practicable; and     (4) Actions that may affect the Santa Barbara County California  tiger salamander that are conducted in accordance with the conditions  of a section 10(a)(1)(A) permit for scientific research or to enhance  the propagation or survival of the species.     We believe that, without appropriate authorization from us pursuant  to sections 7 and 10 of the Act, the following actions may result in a  violation of section 9; however, possible violations are not limited to  these actions:     (1) Unauthorized collecting, trapping, capturing, killing,  harassing, sale, delivery, or movement, including interstate, and  foreign commerce, or harming, or attempting any of these actions, of  Santa Barbara County California tiger salamanders without a permit  (research activities where salamanders are trapped or captured will  require a permit under section 10(a)(1)(A) of the Endangered Species  Act);     (2) Destruction or alteration of the Santa Barbara County  California tiger salamander occupied habitat through the discharge of  fill material into breeding sites; draining, ditching, tilling, stream  channelization, drilling, pumping, or other activities that interrupt  surface or ground water flow into or out of the vernal pool and  seasonal pond habitats of this species (i.e., due to the construction,  installation, or operation and maintenance of roads, impoundments,  discharge or drain pipes, storm water detention basins, wells, water  diversion structures, etc.);     (3) Discharges or dumping of toxic chemicals, silt, or other  pollutants into, or other alteration of the quality of waters  supporting Santa Barbara County California tiger salamanders that  results in death or injury of the species or that results in  degradation of their occupied habitat;     (4) Release of exotic species (including, but not limited to,  bullfrogs, eastern tiger salamanders, mosquitofish, bass, sunfish,  bullhead, catfish, crayfish) into Santa Barbara County tiger salamander  breeding habitat; and     (5) Destruction or alteration of uplands associated with vernal  pool or seasonal pond habitats used by Santa Barbara County California  tiger salamanders during estivation and dispersal, or modification of  migration routes such that migration and dispersal are reduced or  precluded.     Questions regarding whether specific activities will constitute a  violation of section 9 should be directed to the Field Supervisor of  the Ventura Fish and Wildlife Office (see ADDRESSES section).     Requests for copies of the regulations regarding listed species and  inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits may be addressed to the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Endangered Species Permits, 911 NE 11th  Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232-4181 (503/231-2063, facsimile 503/231- 6243). National Environmental Policy Act     We have determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined  under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969,  need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to  section 4(a) of the Act, as amended. We published a notice outlining  our reasons for this determination in the Federal Register on October  25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). Paperwork Reduction Act     This rule does not contain any collections of information that  require Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under the  Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. An information  collection related to the rule pertaining to permits for endangered and  threatened species has OMB approval and is assigned clearance number  1018-0094. This rule does not alter that information collection  requirement. For additional information concerning permits and  associated requirements for endangered wildlife, see 50 CFR 17.21 and  17.22.

ACTION: Final rule.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine  the northern Idaho ground squirrel (Spermophilus brunneus brunneus) to  be a threatened species under the authority of the Endangered Species  Act (Act) of 1973, as amended. This subspecies is known from 36 sites  in Adams and Valley counties, Idaho. It is primarily threatened by  habitat loss due to forest encroachment into former suitable meadow  habitats. Forest encroachment results in habitat fragmentation,  eliminates dispersal corridors, and restricts the northern Idaho ground  squirrel population into small isolated habitat areas. The subspecies  is also threatened by competition from the larger Columbian ground  squirrel (Spermophilus columbianus), land use changes, recreational  shooting, poisoning, and naturally occurring events. This rule extends  Federal protection provisions provided by the Act for the northern  Idaho ground squirrel.  EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective May 5, 2000.  ADDRESSES: The complete file for this rule is available for inspection,  by appointment, during normal business hours at the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service, Snake River Basin Office, 1387 South Vinnell Way,  Room 368, Boise, Idaho 83709.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert Ruesink, Supervisor, at the  above address (telephone 208/378-5243; facsimile 208/378-5262).  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Background      The northern Idaho ground squirrel has the most restricted  geographical range of any Spermophilus taxa, and one of the smallest  ranges among North American mainland mammals (Gill and Yensen 1992).  The first specimens, collected by L.E. Wyman in 1913, were described by  A.H. Howell as Citellus townsendii brunneus, a subspecies of the  Washington ground squirrel (Spermophilus washingtoni) (Howell 1938). In  1938, Howell subsequently classified the Idaho ground squirrel as a  full species, Citellus brunneus. Hershkovitz (1949) demonstrated that  Spermophilus is the correct name for this genus. Nadler (1966) first  presented chromosome descriptions and confirmed the systematics of  Spermophilus. Yensen (1991) described the southern Idaho ground  squirrel (Spermophilus brunneus endemicus) as taxonomically distinct,  based on morphology, pelage (fur), and apparent life-history  differences including biogeographical evidence of separation.     Both the northern and southern Idaho ground squirrels are found  only in western Idaho. Of the two subspecies, the northern Idaho ground  squirrel is the rarest (Yensen 1991). A relatively small member of the  genus Spermophilus, the mean length of northern Idaho ground squirrel  males and females is 235 millimeters (mm) (9.25 inches (in.)) and 226  mm (8.9 in.), respectively. In comparison, the mean length of southern  Idaho ground squirrel males is 241 mm (9.5 in.) and 235 mm (9.25 in.)  for females (Yensen 1991). Pelage in northern Idaho ground squirrel  differs from the southern Idaho ground squirrel in its mid-dorsal area,  which consists of long, dark guard hairs and shorter, dark guard hairs  with one paler-colored band on the shield (Yensen 1991). Most northern  Idaho ground squirrels are found in areas with shallow reddish parent  soils of basaltic origin, while the southern Idaho ground squirrel  lives on lower elevation, paler colored soils formed by granitic sands  and clays from the Boise Mountains (Yensen 1985, 1991). Marked  differences in pelage coloration between the disjunct subspecies are  related to soil color.     The baculum (penis bone) of northern Idaho ground squirrel is also  generally smaller than the southern Idaho ground squirrel. A principal  component analysis, which is a statistical analysis that proves  similarities or differences, indicated a striking difference among  bacula of the two subspecies (Yensen 1991). Genetic differentiation  between the two subspecies was also confirmed using enzyme restriction  analysis, blood allozyme analyses, and DNA protein sequencing, all of  which analyze blood constituents to determine genetic differences (Gill  and Yensen 1992; Sherman and Yensen 1994).     The northern Idaho ground squirrel emerges in late March or early  April, remains active above ground until late July or early August  (Yensen 1991), and spends the rest of the year in hibernation  underground (Eric Yensen, Albertson College, pers. comm. 1999).  Populations occur at elevations ranging from 1,155 to 1,580 meters (m)  (3,800 to 5,200 feet (ft)) in Adams and Valley counties of western  Idaho. In contrast, the southern Idaho ground squirrel occurs at  elevations ranging from 669 to 973 m (2,200 to 3,200 ft) in the low  rolling hills and valleys along the Payette River in Gem, Payette, and  Washington counties of western Idaho (Yensen 1991). The southern  subspecies emerges in late January or early February where snow melt  begins 1 to 2 months earlier in spring, and ceases above-ground  activity in late June or early July. The emergence of the northern  Idaho ground squirrel in late March or early April begins with adult  males, followed by adult females, then young of the year.     The northern Idaho ground squirrel normally becomes reproductively  active within the first 2 weeks of emergence (Yensen 1991). Females  that survive the first winter live, on average, nearly twice as long as  males (3.2 years for females and 1.7 years for males). Individual  females have lived for 8 years (Yensen 1991). Males normally die at a  younger age due to behavior associated with reproductive activity.  During the mating period, males move considerable distances in search  of receptive females for mating and often fight with other males for  copulations, thereby exposing themselves to predation by raptors  including prairie falcon (Falco mexicanus), goshawk (Accipiter  gentilis), and red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis). Significantly more  males die or disappear during the 2-week mating period than during the  rest of the 12- to 14-week period of above-ground activity (Sherman and  Yensen 1994). Seasonal torpor (a state of sluggishness or inactivity)  generally occurs in early to mid-July for males and females, and late  July to early August for juveniles.     Unlike many ground squirrel species, the northern Idaho ground  squirrel is not truly colonial. In this final rule, local areas where  this subspecies occurs are referred to as ``sites.'' In 1985, the  estimated population of northern Idaho ground squirrels at 18 known  sites was approximately 5,000 squirrels (John Woflin, Service, in litt.  1985). Subsequent surveys were conducted on a sporadic basis from 1986  through 1993; more intensive efforts to estimate populations at 10  sites began in 1994 (Sherman and Yensen 1994). While new population  sites were found during these surveys, several previously active sites  became extirpated (Paul Sherman, Cornell University, pers. comm.,  1997). In 1996, the total population had  [[Page 17780]]  declined to fewer than 1,000 individuals found at 19 sites (Sherman and  Gavin 1997). Only 1 of these sites contained more than 60 animals. In  1997 and 1998, additional locations with northern Idaho ground  squirrels were found for a total of 36 historic and currently active  sites. However the total population estimate still remains less than  1,000 individuals. Of the 36 sites, 14 occur on public lands (Federal  and State). At 3 of these 14 sites, the subspecies has been extirpated,  and at 1 site, the subspecies was extirpated but has been reintroduced.  There are 22 sites on private lands, but at 7 of the sites, the  subspecies has been extirpated. The number of squirrels in many of the  active sites has been decreasing for over 10 years (Yensen 1980, 1985;  J. Woflin, in litt. 1985; Sherman and Yensen 1994; Gavin et al. 1998).     Soil texture and depth can be a primary factor in determining  species distribution for most Spermophilus (Brown and Harney 1993). The  northern Idaho ground squirrel often digs burrows under logs, rocks, or  other objects (Sherman and Yensen 1994). Dry vegetation sites with  shallow soil horizons of less than 50 centimeters (19.6 in.) depth  above basalt bedrock to develop burrow systems are preferred (Yensen et  al. 1991). Burrows associated with shallow soils are called auxiliary  burrows. Nesting burrows are found in well-drained soils greater than 1  m (3 ft) deep, in areas not covered with trees or used by Columbian  ground squirrels (Spermophilus columbianus). Although Columbian ground  squirrels overlap in distribution with the northern Idaho ground  squirrel (Dyni and Yensen 1996), Columbian ground squirrels prefer  moister areas with deeper soils. Sherman and Yensen (1994) report that  the lack of extensive use of the same areas by the two subspecies is  likely due to competition, rather than to each subspecies having  different habitat requirements.     Nearly all of the meadow habitats utilized by northern Idaho ground  squirrels are bordered by coniferous forests of Pinus ponderosa  (ponderosa pine) and/or Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir). However,  this ground squirrel is not abundant in meadows that are surrounded by  high densities of small young trees (Sherman and Yensen 1994).     The northern Idaho ground squirrel is granivorous (eats small seeds  and grain) seasonally, similar to the Columbian ground squirrel (Dyni  and Yensen 1996), and ingests large amounts of Poa species (bluegrass)  and other grass seeds to store energy for the winter. The northern  Idaho ground squirrel will consume the roots, bulbs, leaf stems, and  flower heads of another 45 to 50 plant species that are major  components of the diet during key periods of the spring and summer. The  Columbian ground squirrel often inhabits areas with denser vegetation  than the northern Idaho ground squirrel (Dyni and Yensen 1996). Such  areas contain more abundant food resources than habitats occupied by  northern Idaho ground squirrel (Belovsky and Schmitz 1994). The  northern Idaho ground squirrel is found on lands administered by the  U.S. Forest Service (Forest Service), Idaho State Department of Lands,  and private property.  Previous Federal Action      In a status review published January 6, 1989, we determined that  the northern Idaho ground squirrel was a category 1 candidate (56 FR  562). Category 1 candidates were those taxa for which we had on file  substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats to  support preparation of listing proposals. Upon publication of the  February 28, 1996, Notice of Review (61 FR 7596), we ceased using  category designations and included the northern Idaho ground squirrel  as a candidate species. Candidate species are those for which we have  on file sufficient information on biological vulnerability and threats  to support proposals to list the species as threatened or endangered.  Candidate status for this animal was continued in the September 19,  1997, Notice of Review (62 FR 49398).     As a result of long-standing litigation with the Fund for Animals,  a lawsuit settlement of January 21, 1997, directed us to make a  decision (i.e., prepare a proposed rule to list or remove from Federal  candidacy) concerning the northern Idaho ground squirrel on or before  April 1, 1998. A proposed rule to list the subspecies as threatened was  published on March 23, 1998 (63 FR 13825).     The processing of this final rule conforms with our Listing  Priority Guidance published in the Federal Register on October 22, 1999  (64 FR 57114). The guidance clarifies the order in which we will  process rulemakings. Highest priority is processing emergency listing  rules for any species determined to face a significant and imminent  risk to its well-being (Priority 1). Second priority (Priority 2) is  processing final determinations on proposed additions to the lists of  endangered and threatened wildlife and plants. Third priority is  processing new proposals to add species to the lists. The processing of  administrative petition findings (petitions  filed  under section 4 of  the Act) is the fourth priority. This final rule is a Priority 2 action  and is being completed in accordance with the current Listing Priority  Guidance. We have updated this rule to reflect any changes in  information concerning distribution, status, and threats since the  publication of the proposed rule.  Summary of Comments and Recommendations      In the proposed rule (63 FR 13825), we requested all interested  parties to submit factual reports or information that might contribute  to the development of a final rule for the northern Idaho ground  squirrel. We contacted appropriate State agencies, county governments,  Federal agencies, scientists, landowners, and other interested parties  and requested them to comment. We opened a public comment period of 60  days on March 23, 1998, and closed it on May 22, 1998 (63 FR 13825). On  March 13, 1998, we sent legal notices that invited public comment and  announced a public hearing. The notice was published in The Idaho  Statesman, Council Record, Adams County Leader, and the Central Idaho  Star News on March 28, 1998. In anticipation of public interest, we  conducted a public hearing on May 5, 1998, in Council, Idaho at the  Council Elementary School. To consider new scientific information, we  reopened the public comment period for 30 days on October 21, 1998 (63  FR 56134). A legal notice concerning the public comment period was  published on October 27, 1998, in The Idaho Statesman. This comment  period closed on November 20, 1998.     During the 3-month comment period, we received a total of seven  comments. Of these comments, one supported listing, and two opposed the  listing. Four comments were noncommittal. We reviewed all of the  comments (i.e., written and oral testimony) referenced above. The  comments were grouped and are discussed under the following issue  headings. In addition, we considered and incorporated, as appropriate,  into the final rule, all biological and commercial information obtained  through the public comment period.  Peer Review      In compliance with our July 1, 1994, Peer Review Policy (59 FR  34270), we solicited the expert opinion of an independent scientist  regarding pertinent scientific or commercial data and issues relating  to the supportive biological and ecological information for the  northern Idaho ground squirrel. Information and suggestions provided by  the reviewer were considered in  [[Page 17781]]  developing this final rule, and incorporated where applicable.     Issue 1: One commenter believed there was a general lack of  adequate information about the squirrels or sufficient searches for  additional sites to publish a final rule. This responder was also  concerned that key Forest Service staff and the primary research  personnel involved in studying the northern Idaho ground squirrel  intend to leave the project.     Our Response: We, the Forest Service, and the Idaho Department of  Fish and Game have provided equipment, funding, and staff to support  surveys for new populations and monitoring of existing populations  since 1994. In 1998, additional surveys for the northern Idaho ground  squirrel were conducted on lands owned by Boise Cascade Corporation  (John Haufler, Boise Cascade Corporation, pers. comm., 1998). The  surveys used vegetation habitat analysis, historical references, and  anecdotal information from foresters, ranchers, engineers, and  biologists. Staff at the Payette National Forest collated and field- validated the information and placed it on a geographical information  systems (GIS) map. Analysis of GIS maps allows biologists to predict  potential habitat for the species throughout its present range. A team  of biologists spent several weeks in 1997 and 1998 surveying the  potential sites for ground squirrel activity. The known historic and  extant sites increased from 19 in 1996 to 36 in 1998. Of these 36  sites, 27 are currently occupied by northern Idaho ground squirrels.  However, most of these sites have less than 20 individuals, and the  total population numbers less than 1,000. Only by conducting annual  monitoring of sites where animals were translocated from other sites  and existing sites will we be able to document future population  trends.     Two scientists from Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, who have  overseen recent translocations, surveys, and annual monitoring notified  us that they will not be able to continue this work in the future.  However, one of these scientists agreed to assist with field surveys in  1999, and instructed a team of biologists from the Idaho Department of  Fish and Game, Payette National Forest, and the Service for 2 weeks in  survey and monitoring methods. This team will continue to coordinate  annual surveys for new populations, collect data on population trends,  and monitor habitat changes in coordination with the Payette National  Forest staff.     Issue 2: One commenter requested that the northern Idaho ground  squirrel not be listed because listing does not consider the impact of  human welfare, local economy, public value, and private property  rights.     Our Response: In accordance with 16 U.S.C. 1533(b)(1)(A) and 50 CFR  424.11 (b), listing decisions are made solely on the basis of the best  scientific and commercial data available. In adding the word ``solely''  to the statutory criteria for listing a species, Congress specifically  addressed this issue in the 1982 amendments to the Act (16 U.S.C. 1531  et seq.). The legislative history of the 1982 amendments states: ``The  addition of the word solely is intended to remove from the process of  the listing or delisting of species any factor not related to the  biological status of the species' H.R. Rep. No. 567, Part I, 97th  Cong., 2d Sess. 20 (1982).     Issue 3: One commenter asserted that constitutional powers were  being violated to list the northern Idaho ground squirrel under the Act  since there is no substantial and documented interstate commerce  involving this subspecies. This assertion is based on the belief that  the intention of the U.S. Constitution is to regulate only those  activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.     Our Response: The Federal Government has the authority under the  Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution to protect this subspecies,  for the reasons given in Judge Wald's opinion and Judge Henderson's  concurring opinion in National Association of Home Builders v. Babbitt,  130 F.3d 1041 (D.C. Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 1185 S. Ct. 2340 (1998).  That case involved a challenge to application of the Act's prohibitions  to protect the listed Delhi Sands flower-loving fly (Rhaphiomidas  terminatus abdominalis). As with the northern Idaho ground squirrel,  the Delhi Sands flower-loving fly is endemic to only one State. Judge  Wald held that application of the Act's prohibition against taking of  endangered species to this fly was a proper exercise of Commerce Clause  power to regulate: (1) Use of channels of interstate commerce; and (2)  activities substantially affecting interstate commerce, because it  prevented loss of biodiversity and destructive interstate competition.  Judge Henderson upheld protection of the fly because doing so prevents  harm to the ecosystem upon which interstate commerce depends, and  because doing so regulates commercial development that is part of  interstate commerce.     The Federal Government also has the authority under the Property  Clause of the Constitution to protect this subspecies. The northern  Idaho ground squirrel occurs on the Payette National Forest, Idaho  State lands, and private lands. If this subspecies were to become  extinct, the diversity of vertebrate life in the Payette National  Forest would be diminished. The courts have long recognized Federal  authority under the Property Clause to protect Federal resources in  such circumstances (See Kleppe v. New Mexico, 429 U.S. 873 (1976);  United States v. Alford, 274 U.S. 264 (1927); Camfield v. United  States, 167 U. S. 518 (1897); United States v. Lindsey, 595 F. 2d 5  (9th Cir. 1979).  Summary of Factors Affecting the Species      Section 4 of the Act and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated  to implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures  for adding species to the Federal lists. A species may be determined to  be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five  factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their  application to the northern Idaho ground squirrel are as follows:  A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment  of its Habitat or Range      The historic range of the northern Idaho ground squirrel is not  well known. However, it is thought that this subspecies was relatively  uncommon throughout its historic range (Forest Service 1997a). All  remaining habitat sites for the northern Idaho ground squirrel are  small in relation to those of other ground squirrels, ranging in size  from 1.2 to 16 hectares (3 to 40 acres), and all are threatened by one  or more of the following: forest encroachment into grassland meadows;  conversion to agriculture; residential construction; development of  recreational facilities such as golf courses; and road construction and  maintenance.     The primary threat to the northern Idaho ground squirrel is meadow  invasion by conifers (Sherman and Yensen 1994; E. Yensen, pers. comm.  1998, 1999). Fire suppression and the dense regrowth of conifers  resulting from past logging activities have significantly reduced  meadow habitats suitable for northern Idaho ground squirrels over the  past 40 years. As the amount of suitable meadow habitat on public and  private lands has been reduced, northern Idaho ground squirrel  dispersal corridors have been reduced or eliminated, further  constricting the subspecies into smaller isolated habitat areas (Truksa  and Yensen 1990). The loss of dispersal corridors has caused some  isolated populations to become extirpated in recent years (Sherman and  [[Page 17782]]  Yensen 1994; Service 1996). Small populations at several remaining  sites are likely to become extirpated as well (Sherman and Yensen 1994;  Mangel and Tier 1994).     The fragmented distribution of the northern Idaho ground squirrel  is a remnant of what may once have been a more continuous distribution  from Round Valley, Idaho, in Valley County north to New Meadows, Idaho,  and southwest to Council, Idaho, in Adams County. The forest structure  in the area has changed markedly over the past century due to logging  and fire suppression, resulting in denser, more even-aged younger  stands of trees with thinner and less heterogeneous (not uniform)  under-story plant communities (Burns and Zborowski 1996). Fire  suppression allowed conifers to invade once suitable meadow habitats,  thereby shrinking the size of forb/grass meadows or closing open grassy  dispersal/migration corridors entirely to nearby meadow sites. These  changes isolated the dry meadows with suitable shallow soils where the  northern Idaho ground squirrel finds refuge from the Columbian ground  squirrel, in addition to eliminating migration between northern Idaho  ground squirrel sites. Remaining dry meadow habitats supporting  northern Idaho ground squirrels are now being invaded by young conifer  trees, reducing availability of the preferred forage and burrow habitat  of this subspecies. Habitat dissection and reduced opportunities for  dispersal among habitats prevents gene flow and results in considerable  population differentiation (Sherman and Yensen 1994).     Agricultural conversion and rural housing developments near the  communities of Round Valley, north to New Meadows, and south to  Council, during the past 40 years have fragmented suitable habitats  formerly occupied by the northern Idaho ground squirrel. Various types  of developments continue to threaten remaining occupied sites in Adams  and Valley counties. Occupied ground squirrel habitat near New Meadows  was converted to a golf course and associated housing development  (Yensen 1985), which resulted in the eradication of northern Idaho  ground squirrels by poisoning because they were impacting the fairways  and golf greens (E. Yensen, pers. comm. 1999).     A 51.5 kilometer (km) (32 mile (mi)) gravel road from Council to  Cuprum, Idaho, is scheduled to be paved by the year 2001 (U.S.  Department of Transportation 1998). Approximately 6.4 km (4 mi) of this  project runs through historic and currently occupied habitat of the  northern Idaho ground squirrel. The road improvement project will  seasonally extend vehicle access to four occupied northern Idaho ground  squirrel sites. These four sites will be subject to increased mortality  risk from vehicular traffic, and possibly recreational shooting (Forest  Service 1997a). The Federal Highways Administration consulted with us  and the Forest Service in developing conservation measures as part of  their biological assessment for the Council to Cuprum Road paving  project (Forest Service 1997a). Conservation measures include actions  to attract northern Idaho ground squirrels away from the paved highway  to adjacent but suitable habitat to avoid passing vehicles. Funding for  these conservation measures was approved by the U.S. Department of  Transportation to monitor the measures before and after the road  improvements have been made. Monitoring was initiated in 1998 and will  continue through 2003. At this time, it is uncertain whether the  proposed conservation measures will be successful in protecting  remaining populations in the vicinity of the road improvement project.  B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or  Educational Purposes      Recreational shooting has contributed to the decline of northern  Idaho ground squirrels at various sites (Yensen 1985, 1991; E. Yensen,  pers. comm. 1999). Sites adjacent to housing developments, farms, and  roads, in particular, are subject to a high rate of recreational  shooting.     Four population sites have been documented as being subjected to  recreational shooting (E. Yensen, pers. comm. 1998). One site is  located next to a road on National Forest land. It was common to find  .22 rifle casings on the road from people presumably shooting the  ground squirrels. The subspecies has now been extirpated from this site  as a result of shooting. Another site on private land that had both  northern Idaho ground squirrels and Columbian ground squirrels was  routinely used by recreational shooters, and, as a result, the  population is now extinct there. Another site on private land at New  Meadows was periodically used by recreational shooters until a golf  course was put in at the site. The operators of the golf course then  poisoned the remaining population of northern Idaho ground squirrels to  eliminate them. The fourth site is partially located on private land  and partially located on Forest Service land and also is subjected to  shooting (E. Yensen, pers. comm. 1999).     Vandalism, either by shooting or poisoning, is a threat to most of  the populations. Many private landowners consider ground squirrels to  be a pest that requires elimination. In June 1998, Dr. Eric Yensen of  Albertson College, who has done research on the subspecies, approached  a private landowner for permission to check on a northern Idaho ground  squirrel population occurring on his land. The landowner told Dr.  Yensen he wanted to know where the population was so he could go out  and poison them. Since the landowner was threatening to eliminate the  population, Dr. Yensen declined to tell him exactly where the site was.  Dr. Yensen was then refused permission to check on the site by the  landowner. Other landowners have made similar threats against northern  Idaho ground squirrel populations to Dr. Yensen (E. Yensen, pers. comm.  1999). Since most of the population sites contain less than 20 animals,  and less than 1,000 animals overall, shooting and poisoning could have  significant adverse impacts (E. Yensen, pers. comm. 1999).  C. Disease or Predation      Disease is not thought to be a major factor affecting the northern  Idaho ground squirrel. The parasitic nematode, Pelodera strongyloides,  infects the eyes of the northern Idaho ground squirrel (Sherman and  Yensen 1994; Yensen et al. 1996). This eye worm is not currently known  to be a cause of mortality in existing populations (Yensen et al.  1996). Plague (Yersina pestis) a contagious bacterial disease in  rodents, has not yet been found in any northern Idaho ground squirrel  populations (Yensen et al. 1996.). The disease, once established, could  decimate these squirrels. Blood analysis to determine whether pandemic  diseases are present have not been done on the northern Idaho ground  squirrel.     The primary predators of the northern Idaho ground squirrel include  badger (Taxidea taxus), goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), prairie falcon  (Falco mexicanus), and occasionally red-tailed hawk (Buteo  jamaicensis). Predators may threaten many of the smaller, more isolated  populations of northern Idaho ground squirrel. Badger activity has been  noted at several of these sites (Sherman and Gavin 1997). Badgers are  efficient predators and could eliminate an entire population of 20 or  so animals in just a few days. Male ground squirrels, due to their  above-ground active behavior patterns, are particularly subject to  increased predation risk  [[Page 17783]]  during the mating period. Juveniles are also subject to a high degree  of predation during their first year (Sherman and Yensen 1994). Also,  domestic cat (Felis catus) predation has been documented at two sites  because the sites are located near residential housing (E. Yensen,  pers. comm. 1999).  D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms      The State of Idaho recognizes the northern Idaho ground squirrel as  a ``Species of Special Concern'' (Idaho Department of Fish and Game  1994). Because of this status, the northern Idaho ground squirrel is,  by State law, protected from taking (shooting, trapping, poisoning) or  possession. To date, however, protection from recreational shooting has  not been adequately enforced by the State, and the northern Idaho  ground squirrel remains vulnerable to this type of activity (Yensen  1985).     Local land use ordinances and other regulations are inadequate to  protect this subspecies. For example, in Adams County where 99 percent  of northern Idaho ground squirrel population sites are found, land use  regulations allow for single and multiple housing developments under a  permit system. There is no consideration under the existing permit  system for impacts that may result to northern Idaho ground squirrels  from housing or recreation developments in or adjacent to their  habitat. With no limitations on development of northern Idaho ground  squirrel habitat, it is anticipated that human population growth and  development in the foreseeable future will impact ground squirrel  sites.  E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting its Continued Existence      Other factors affecting conservation actions for this subspecies  include land ownership patterns, prelisting activities, and  conservation efforts on private and public lands. All active northern  Idaho ground squirrel sites occur on private, State, and Payette  National Forest lands. A conservation agreement (Agreement) was  finalized in July 1996, between us and the Payette National Forest  (Service 1996). The duration of the Agreement is 5 years. The Agreement  identifies conservation and land management actions that will provide  habitat favorable to the northern Idaho ground squirrel. These actions,  some already in the implementation phase, include controlled burning of  selected meadows to reduce over-story and to improve forage preferred  by the northern Idaho ground squirrel, timber harvest in select areas  to open meadows where active sites are found, and timber harvest to  provide dispersal corridors for improved connectivity between active  populations (Forest Service 1998). For example, 3.3 million board feet  of timber is proposed for harvest in the Lick Creek drainage from 1998  to 2000 (Forest Service 1997b). The sale is designed to reconnect an  active population with other nearby populations. It will also expand  the size of 12 meadow habitats on Federal lands that are favorable to  recolonization by the northern Idaho ground squirrel. Two units were  completed in 1999, and the rest will be harvested in 2000. Although the  Agreement does not currently remove or reduce threats to the degree  where listing may be precluded, the conservation actions implemented  will facilitate recovery.     A relocation plan, developed by scientists from Cornell University  and Albertson College, was initiated in the spring of 1997, and  continued in 1998 and 1999. A total of 76 squirrels were transplanted  to 2 sites on lands managed by the Forest Service that had been treated  through burning and timber harvest (Sherman and Gavin 1997; Gavin et  al. 1998). One site had a small existing population of northern Idaho  ground squirrels, and at the other site, the subspecies had been  extirpated. Initial results indicate that some translocated females  were lactating, and juveniles were observed at both sites, indicating  successful reproduction (Sherman and Gavin 1997; Gavin et al. 1998). A  report compiling the results of monitoring the transplant is expected  in the spring of 2000. Whether long-term benefits to ground squirrel  recovery result from these actions will be unknown for several years.     Habitat and resource competition with the Columbian ground squirrel  is a factor affecting the survival of the northern Idaho ground  squirrel. Competition from the Columbian ground squirrel could be an  important factor in the decline of the northern Idaho ground squirrel  (Dyni and Yensen 1996). The northern Idaho ground squirrel may have  been forced into areas containing shallower soils due to competition  from Columbian ground squirrels (Sherman and Yensen 1994). The  Columbian ground squirrel is larger and prefers deeper areas with soils  that provide better over-winter protection and higher nutrients. Where  both subspecies occur, the northern Idaho ground squirrel tends to  occupy the shallower soils but requires deeper soils less than 1 m (3.2  ft) for nests (Yensen et al. 1991). The Columbian ground squirrel is  not restricted by soil depth; typically, their burrow systems are  associated with degree of slope, well-drained soils, and number of  native forbs (Weddell 1989).     Winter mortality may be a contributing factor for northern Idaho  ground squirrel decline, especially when juvenile squirrels enter  torpor without sufficient fat reserves and snow levels are below  average (Paul Sherman, pers. comm., 1997). Soils tend to freeze to  greater depths where snow levels are shallow. When this occurs, ground  squirrels are unable to thermoregulate or maintain sufficient fat  reserves. Although the relationship between ground squirrels and  weather is complex, (Yensen et al. 1992) sites may have been adversely  affected by drought and over winter mortality in the early 1990's.  Winter mortality is of special concern since many remaining sites  contain few individuals. High winter mortality combined with the loss  of suitable vegetation conditions can result in the permanent loss of  isolated populations.     As a result of the factors discussed above, and due to the small  population sizes at remaining sites and the low total number of  individuals, the northern Idaho ground squirrel may have little  resilience to naturally occurring events (Gavin et al. 1993). Small  populations are often highly vulnerable to natural climatic  fluctuations as well as catastrophic natural events (Mangel and Tier  1994). Gavin et al. (1993) used a computer population viability  simulation program (VORTEX), using natality (birth) and mortality  (death) values recorded over 8 years from an intensively studied  northern Idaho ground squirrel population (Sherman and Yensen 1994) to  examine population viability. Variables in the model included no  natural immigration. The population viability analysis used 50  individuals, a figure that was 30 individuals lower than the actual  population size of 80 individuals (Sherman and Yensen 1994). The model  calculated that all but 1 of 100 populations would become extinct in  less than 20 years.     In developing this rule, we have carefully assessed the best  scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,  present, and future threats faced by the northern Idaho ground  squirrel. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to list the  northern Idaho ground squirrel as a threatened species. The subspecies  has declined from approximately 5,000 animals in 1985 to fewer than  1,000 animals in 1998. Although additional occupied sites have been  recently discovered, numerous extirpations have occurred. Most  remaining populations  [[Page 17784]]  consist of small numbers of individuals isolated from other  populations. Remaining occupied sites on private land are not protected  from threats to the species or its' habitat. Existing land use  regulations are inadequate to protect the northern Idaho ground  squirrel from habitat destruction resulting from development. Some  ground squirrel habitat improvement projects have been initiated at two  sites on Payette National Forest lands. While these efforts may be  important to the long-term conservation of the northern Idaho ground  squirrel, they are currently very limited in their applicability and  the threat of meadow loss still continues. Benefits to the northern  Idaho ground squirrel from current conservation actions may not be  realized or quantifiable for years. While the northern Idaho ground  squirrel is not in immediate danger of extinction because of ongoing  conservation efforts, the subspecies could become endangered in the  foreseeable future if remaining sites decline further. Not listing this  taxon would be inconsistent with the intent of the Act.  Critical Habitat      Critical habitat is defined in section 3 of the Act as: (i) The  specific areas within the geographical area occupied by a species, at  the time it is listed in accordance with the Act, on which are found  those physical or biological features (I) essential to the conservation  of the species and (II) that may require special management  considerations or protection and; (ii) specific areas outside the  geographical area occupied by a species at the time it is listed, upon  a determination that such areas are essential for the conservation of  the species. ``Conservation'' means the use of all methods and  procedures needed to bring the species to the point at which listing  under the Act is no longer necessary.     In the proposed rule, we indicated that designation of critical  habitat was not prudent for the northern Idaho ground squirrel because  of a concern that publication of precise maps and descriptions of  critical habitat in the Federal Register could increase the  vulnerability of this species to incidents of shooting and other forms  of human activity. We also indicated that designation of critical  habitat was not prudent because we believed it would not provide any  additional benefit beyond that provided through listing as endangered.     In the last few years, a series of court decisions have overturned  Service determinations regarding a variety of species that designation  of critical habitat would not be prudent (e.g., Natural Resources  Defense Council v. U.S. Department of the Interior 113 F. 3d 1121 (9th  Cir. 1997); Conservation Council for Hawaii v. Babbitt, 2 F. Supp. 2d  1280 (D. Hawaii 1998)). Based on the standards applied in those  judicial opinions, we have reexamined the question of whether critical  habitat for the northern Idaho ground squirrel would be prudent.     Due to the small number of populations, the northern Idaho ground  squirrel is vulnerable to shooting, colony destruction, or other  disturbance. We remain concerned that these threats might be  exacerbated by the publication of critical habitat maps and further  dissemination of locational information. We have examined the evidence  available for the northern Idaho ground squirrel, and have knowledge of  two separate incidents where northern Idaho ground squirrel colonies  were eliminated on private lands from poisoning and shooting. As stated  in threat factor D, northern Idaho ground squirrels are, by Idaho State  law, protected from taking (shooting, trapping, poisoning) or  possession, but protection from recreational shooting has not been  adequately enforced by the State, especially in those areas where  recreational shooting of nearby Columbian ground squirrels is popular.  However, we do not have any evidence that the publication of critical  habitat maps would provide additional location information that was not  already available and thus increase the threat to northern Idaho ground  squirrels from shooting and poisoning. Consequently, consistent with  applicable regulations (50 CFR 424.12(a)(1)(i)) and recent case law, at  this time we cannot make a finding that the identification of critical  habitat will increase the degree of threat to these species from taking  or other human activity.     In the case of this species, some benefits may result from  designation of critical habitat. The primary regulatory effect of  critical habitat is the section 7 requirement that Federal agencies  refrain from taking any action that destroys or adversely modifies  critical habitat. While a critical habitat designation for habitat  currently occupied by this species would not be likely to change the  section 7 consultation outcome because an action that destroys or  adversely modifies such critical habitat would also be likely to result  in jeopardy to the species, in some instances section 7 consultation  might be triggered only if critical habitat is designated. Examples  could include unoccupied habitat or occupied habitat that may become  unoccupied in the future. Designating critical habitat may also provide  some educational or informational benefits. Therefore, we find that  designation of critical habitat is prudent for the northern Idaho  ground squirrel.     As explained in detail in our Listing Priority Guidance for FY 2000  (64 FR 57114), our listing budget is currently insufficient to allow us  to immediately complete all of the listing actions required by the Act.  Deferral of the critical habitat designation for the northern Idaho  ground squirrel will allow us to concentrate our limited resources on  higher priority critical habitat and other listing actions, while  allowing us to put in place protections needed for the conservation of  the northern Idaho ground squirrel without further delay. However,  because we have successfully reduced, although not eliminated, the  backlog of other listing actions, we anticipate in FY 2000 and beyond  giving higher priority to critical habitat designation, including  designations deferred pursuant to the Listing Priority Guidance, such  as the designation for this species, than we have in recent fiscal  years.     We plan to employ a priority system for deciding which outstanding  critical habitat designations should be addressed first. We will focus  our efforts on those designations that will provide the most  conservation benefit, taking into consideration the efficacy of  critical habitat designation in addressing the threats to the species,  and the magnitude and immediacy of those threats. We will develop a  proposal to designate critical habitat for the northern Idaho ground  squirrel as soon as feasible, considering our workload priorities.  Unfortunately, for the immediate future, most of Region 1's listing  budget must be directed to complying with numerous court orders and  settlement agreements, as well as due and overdue final listing  determinations (like the one at issue in this case).  Available Conservation Measures      Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or  threatened under the Act include recognition, recovery actions,  requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain  activities. Recognition through listing encourages and results in  conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups,  and individuals. Without the elevated profile that Federal listing  affords, little likelihood exists that any conservation activities  would be undertaken. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and  cooperation with the States and requires  [[Page 17785]]  that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The  protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against  taking and harm are discussed, in part, below.     Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to  evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or  listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical  habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this  interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR  part 402. Section 7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to  confer with us on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued  existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse  modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species is listed  subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that  activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to  jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or  adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a  listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency  must enter into formal consultation with us.     The Act requires the appropriate land management agencies to  evaluate potential impacts to the species that may result from  activities they authorize or permit. Consultation under section 7 of  the Act is required for activities on Federal, State, county, or  private lands that may impact the survival and recovery of the northern  Idaho ground squirrel, if such activities are funded, authorized,  carried out, or permitted by Federal agencies. Federal agencies that  may be involved with this subspecies include the Forest Service,  Federal Highway Administration, BLM, Office of Surface Mining, and  Natural Resource Conservation Service. Section 7 requires these  agencies to consider potential impacts to the northern Idaho ground  squirrel prior to approval of any activity authorized or permitted by  them.     Federal agency actions that may require consultation include  removing, thinning, or altering vegetation; constructing of roads or  camping sites in the vicinity of active and historical sites;  recreational home developments; off-road vehicle use areas; gravel or  sand mining activities; campground construction; mining permits and  expansion; highway construction; and timber harvest.     Listing this subspecies as threatened provides for development of a  recovery plan. Such a plan would identify both State and Federal  efforts for conservation of the subspecies and establish a framework  for agencies to coordinate activities and cooperate with each other in  conservation efforts. The plan would set recovery priorities and  describe site-specific management actions necessary to achieve  conservation and survival of the subspecies. Additionally, pursuant to  section 6 of the Act, we would be able to grant funds to affected  States for management actions promoting the protection and recovery of  this subspecies.     The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.31 describe  general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all threatened  wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person  subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to take (including  harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, collect,  or attempt any such conduct), import or export, transport in interstate  or foreign commerce in the course of commercial activity, or sell or  offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. It  also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship  any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions  apply to our agents and State conservation agencies.     Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities  involving threatened wildlife species under certain circumstances.  Regulations governing permits for threatened species are at 50 CFR  17.32. Such permits are available for scientific purposes, to enhance  the propagation or survival of the species, and/or for incidental take  in connection with otherwise lawful activities. For threatened species,  permits are also available for zoological exhibition, educational  purposes, or special purposes consistent with the purposes of the Act.     As published in the Federal Register on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34272),  our policy is to identify, to the maximum extent practicable at the  time when a species is proposed for listing, those activities that  would or would not constitute a violation of section 9 of the Act. The  intent of this policy is to increase public awareness of the effect of  the listing on proposed and ongoing activities within a species' range.  We believe that, based upon the best available information, the  following action will not likely result in a violation of section 9:     (1) Activities authorized, funded, or carried out by Federal  agencies (e.g., logging, flood and erosion control, mineral and housing  development, off-road vehicle permitting or park development,  recreational trail and campground development, road construction,  prescribed burns, pest control activities, utility lines or pipeline  construction) when such activity is conducted in accordance with any  incidental take statement prepared by us in accordance with section 7  of the Act; and     (2) Clearing of a firebreak around one's personal residence.     Activities that we believe could potentially result in a violation  of section 9 include but are not limited to:     (1) Activities that directly or indirectly result in the actual  death or injury of the northern Idaho ground squirrel, or that modify  the known habitat of the subspecies by significantly modifying  essential behavior patterns (e.g., intensive plowing and conversion to  cropland, shooting, intentional poisoning, road and trail construction,  water development and impoundment, mineral extraction or processing,  off-road vehicle use, and unauthorized application of herbicides or  pesticides);     (2) Activities within the northern Idaho ground squirrel  hibernating period (mid July through early April) and near burrow areas  that include road, pipeline, or utility construction, herbicide  application, or other activities that would alter the burrow systems  and food sources of the northern Idaho ground squirrel; and     (3) Activities authorized, funded, or carried out by Federal  agencies (e.g., logging, flood and erosion control, mineral and housing  development, off-road vehicle permitting or park development,  recreational trail and campground development, road construction,  prescribed burns, pest control activities, utility lines or pipeline  construction) when such activity is not conducted in accordance with  any incidental take statement prepared by us in accordance with section  7 of the Act.     Questions regarding whether specific activities will constitute a  violation of section 9 or requests to obtain approved guidelines for  actions within northern Idaho ground squirrel habitat should be  directed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Snake River Basin  Office, Boise, Idaho (see ADDRESSES section). Requests for copies of  the regulations concerning listed animals and inquiries regarding  prohibitions and permits may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service, Endangered Species Permits, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland,  Oregon 97232-4181 (telephone 503/231-2063; Facsimile 503/231-6243).  National Environmental Policy Act      We determined that we do not need to prepare an Environmental  [[Page 17786]]  Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement, as defined under the  authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 in  connection with regulations adopted under section 4(a) of the  Endangered Species Act, as amended. A notice outlining our reasons for  this determination was published in the Federal Register on October 25,  1983 (48 FR 49244).  Required Determinations      This rule does not contain any new collections of information other  than those already approved under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44  U.S.C. 3501 et seq., and assigned Office of Management and Budget  clearance number 1018-0094. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a  person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless  it displays a currently valid OMB control number.

GX095-45-8639844	_doc_ _/doc_  [Federal Register: November 3, 2003 (Volume 68, Number 212)] [Notices]                [Page 62315-62316] From the Federal Register Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov] [DOCID:fr03no03-66]                           -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR  Fish and Wildlife Service    Southern Idaho Ground Squirrel Programmatic Candidate  Conservation Agreement With Assurances  AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.  ACTION: Notice of intent.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act, this notice  advises the public that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service),  in cooperation with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) and  the Idaho Governor's Office of Species Conservation, intends to gather  information necessary to prepare an environmental document  (environmental assessment and/or environmental impact statement)  regarding a proposed Southern Idaho Ground Squirrel Programmatic  Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances (CCAA) and enhancement  of survival permit under section 10(a)(1)(A) of the Endangered Species  Act of 1973, as amended (ESA). The IDFG is the proposed permit  applicant.     The Service is furnishing this notice in order to: (1) Advise other  Federal and State agencies, affected tribes, and the public of our  intentions; (2) announce the initiation of a 21-day public scoping  period; and (3) to obtain suggestions and information on the scope of  issues to be addressed in the environmental document.  DATES: Written comments from all interested parties must be received on  or before November 24, 2003.  ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to Carmen Thomas, Project  Biologist, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1387 S. Vinnell Way, Room  368, Boise, Idaho 83709; facsimile: (208) 378-5262.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Carmen Thomas at the above address or  telephone: (208) 378-5243.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Candidate Conservation Agreements with  Assurances contain a strategy for covered lands and activities that  constitute an applicant's contribution to avoid listing or remove the  need to list a covered species as threatened or endangered under the  ESA. In return, an applicant receives assurances that it will not be  required to provide additional conservation measures if any of the  covered species become listed under the ESA in the future.     The proposed CCAA planning document would cover approximately  1,000,000 acres in Adams, Washington, Payette, and Gem Counties, Idaho;  within this area, individual non-Federal landowners could voluntarily  enroll lands under the proposed CCAA. It is unknown how many landowners  would participate and enroll lands under the CCAA, however, we expect  the acreage of enrolled lands to be substantially less than 1,000,000  acres.     The primary goal of the proposed CCAA would be to implement habitat  and population conservation measures on non-Federal lands enrolled  under the CCAA for the southern Idaho ground squirrel (Spermophilus  brunneus endemicus). Habitat conservation measures would focus on  restoration or protection of native plant communities, including shrub/ steppe habitat, or other habitat management measures to benefit this  species. Other conservation measures could include: minimization of  impacts from land use activities in southern Idaho ground squirrel- occupied habitat to conserve ground squirrel populations; prohibition  of shooting, trapping, and poisoning of  [[Page 62316]]  southern Idaho ground squirrels; reintroduction of southern Idaho  ground squirrels into unoccupied suitable habitat; and authorization  for Service and IDFG personnel to access enrolled lands for purposes of  monitoring southern Idaho ground squirrel populations and habitat.  Potential covered activities include: crop cultivation and harvesting,  livestock grazing and production, farm equipment operation, and  recreational activities (e.g., hunting, fishing, camping, dog training,  and use of recreational vehicles on and off established roads).     The Service will conduct an environmental review of the proposed  CCAA and prepare an environmental document. The review will analyze the  CCAA, as well as a full range of reasonable alternatives, and the  associated impacts of each. Should information become available that  indicates significant environmental impacts from the proposed CCAA, an  Environmental Impact Statement will be prepared. Comments and  suggestions are invited from all interested parties to ensure the full  range of issues related to this proposed action are identified.  Comments or questions should be addressed to the Service at the address  or telephone number provided above. See ADDRESSES and FOR FURTHER  INFORMATION CONTACT.     The environmental review of this proposed project will be conducted  in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental  Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), National  Environmental Policy Act Regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), other  applicable Federal laws and regulations, and policies and procedures of  the Service for compliance with those regulations.
