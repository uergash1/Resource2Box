Yosemite Planning Page                  Chapter V:  Merced  Wild and  Scenic    River    Introduction    In 1987, the U.S. Congress designated the Merced River a Wild and Scenic River to protect its free-flowing condition and to protect and enhance its unique values for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations (16 United States Code 1271). This designation gives the  Merced  River  special protection under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and requires the managing agencies to prepare a comprehensive management plan for the river and its immediate environment.    After reaching a Record of Decision on the final environmental impact statement, the National Park Service released the  Merced Wild and Scenic River Comprehensive Management Plan  (referred to hereafter as the Merced River Plan) in February 2001, which outlines how the Merced Wild and  Scenic    River  corridor will be managed. The Merced River Plan applies seven management elements to prescribe desired future conditions, typical visitor activities and experiences, and park facilities and management activities allowed in the river corridor. The management elements include boundaries, classifications, Outstandingly Remarkable Values, the Wild and Scenic River Act Section 7 determination process, the River Protection Overlay, management zoning, and the Visitor Experience and Resource Protection framework.     The National Park Service uses the management elements as a set of decision-making criteria with which to evaluate projects in the Merced Wild and  Scenic   River  corridor, such as the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project. This chapter evaluates the consistency of the proposed action with the management elements of the Merced River Plan. An overview of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and of the Merced River Plan and its management elements may be found in the Merced River Plan (incorporated by reference) (NPS 2001a).    This chapter summarizes the consistency analysis with the Merced River Plan, including the findings of the Cascades Diversion Dam Project Wild and Scenic River Act Section 7 Determination, which is included in Appendix B, Merced Wild and Scenic River Section 7 Determination.    Consistency with Management Elements of the   Merced River  Plan    Relationship to the Boundary    The proposed action would occur within the Merced Wild and  Scenic   River  boundary in Segment 3A, Impoundment.    Classification Compatibility    The river segment at the dam from the top of the pool to 200 feet below the dam is classified as recreational, due to the human-made impoundment at the site. The river segments upstream and downstream of the dam are classified as scenic, a designation reserved for sections of rivers that are “free of impoundments, with shorelines or watersheds still largely primitive and shorelines largely undeveloped, but accessible in places by roads.” Upon implementation of the proposed action, the river segment through the dam site would be restored to a free-flowing state, near natural conditions. It would then be reclassified as scenic, as is called for in the Merced River Plan. The proposed action would reduce the aggregate amount and type of shoreline development. As a result, the proposed action is compatible with the resultant scenic classification.    Changing the classification from recreation to scenic would not affect visitor experience, natural, cultural, or social resources, or the associated Outstandingly Remarkable Values. Changing the classification is a technical adjustment consistent with the post-project site conditions, which will be “free of impoundments, with shorelines or watersheds still largely primitive and shorelines largely undeveloped, but accessible in places by roads.”      Outstandingly Remarkable Values    The proposed action would remove Cascades Diversion Dam and attendant structures, restoring the free-flowing condition of the Merced Wild and Scenic  River  and returning this portion of the river to a more natural state, thereby enhancing its integrity. Table B-2 (see Appendix B, Merced Wild and Scenic River Section 7 Determination) describes the effects of the proposed action on each of the Outstandingly Remarkable Values that apply to the Impoundment, Gorge, and El Portal river segments. As indicated in Table B-1, the proposed action would have a beneficial effect on the biological and hydrologic processes Outstandingly Remarkable Values. The proposed action would not result in any changes to the current level of protection and enhancement of the scientific, scenic, geologic processes, recreation, or cultural Outstandingly Remarkable Values. As a result, implementation of the proposed action would allow the National Park Service to protect and enhance the river’s Outstandingly Remarkable Values.    Wild and Scenic Rivers Act Section 7 Determination Process    Pursuant to the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, the National Park Service must carry out a Section 7 determination on all proposed water resources projects to ensure that they do not affect free flow and do not directly and adversely impact the Outstandingly Remarkable Values for which the river was designated. The proposed action would remove a human-made structure from the bed and banks of the Merced Wild and Scenic  River . Free-flow and natural fluvial processes (e.g., sediment transport, fish passage) would be returned to a more natural condition. Upon dam removal, the channel of the Merced Wild and Scenic  River  would naturally narrow and deepen. The floodplain in the immediate vicinity of the impoundment would be enlarged and stabilized. Riparian and floodplain extent, functions, and values would be enhanced. The proposed action would have a beneficial effect on the biological and hydrologic processes Outstandingly Remarkable Values. The proposed action would not result in any changes to the current level of protection and enhancement of the scientific, scenic, geologic process, recreation, and cultural Outstandingly Remarkable Values. The National Park Service concludes that the proposed action would enhance free flow of the Merced Wild and  Scenic   River  and would protect the Outstandingly Remarkable Values for which the river was designated Wild and Scenic. For additional detail, refer to Appendix B, Merced Wild and Scenic River Section 7 Determination.    River Protection Overlay    The proposed action would remove a human-made structure from the bed and banks of the Merced Wild and Scenic  River . Free-flow and natural fluvial processes would be returned to more natural conditions. One of the purposes of the River Protection Overlay is to protect and restore hydrologic processes within the river corridor. In the vicinity of Cascades Diversion Dam, the River Protection Overlay includes the Merced Wild and Scenic  River  channel itself, and extends 150 feet on both sides of the river, measured from the ordinary high-water mark. Presence of a nonessential facility within the River Protection Overlay is inconsistent with the River Protection Overlay purpose described above. Removal of the dam from the River Protection Overlay would rectify this inconsistency.      The proposed action is consistent with this management element of the Merced River Plan.    Management Zoning    The management zones applicable to the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project include:      §           Discovery (2B) north of the river in the Impoundment segment    §           Open Space (2A) south of the river in the Impoundment segment    The dam itself is located in management zones 2A and 2B. The Open Space (2A) zone allows for relatively undisturbed natural areas that receive only incidental or casual use, while the Discovery (2B) zone is characterized by relatively quiet natural areas, where visitor encounters are low to moderate. Because the proposed action would remove a human-made structure from the bed and banks of the Merced Wild and Scenic  River  and return this segment of the river to more natural conditions, the proposed action is consistent with this management element of the Merced River P

Search ALL of USGS   Feedback                     Estimating the Volume of Fine-Grained Sediments Behind Four Low-Head Dams, Kalamazoo River, Michigan            In cooperation with the  Michigan Department of  Environmental Quality,  Environmental Response  Division (MDEQ-ERD), the U.S. Geological Survey is estimating the volume of fine-grained materials within the impoundments of four low-head dams (Plainwell, Otsego City, Otsego, and  Trowbridge), located on the Kalamazoo River.         The restoration of natural flow regimes to rivers can have significant environmental and aesthetic benefits. In many cases, restoring the natural flow regime requires the removal of non-functioning low-head dams. A series of dams exists on the Kalamazoo River between Plainwell and Allegan, Michigan. All are under consideration for removal in the future. Removal of these dams will return the Kalamazoo River to its pre-dam flow, increase recreation uses and safety of the river, and improve aquatic habitat in this section of the river.    The removal of any dam comes with some risks. The two most common problems encountered are the movement of contaminated sediment downstream and the migration of invasive species from the Great Lakes upstream to the headwater areas. Since additional dams downstream of the project will remain in place, migration of invasive species should not be an issue; however, movement of contaminated sediments is a major concern. The USEPA has designated the Kalamazoo River from the city of Kalamazoo to where it discharges into Lake Michigan as a Federal Superfund site. The bed sediments are known to contain PCBs from paper-mill carbonless copy paper production (up to 150 ppm PCB--Blasland, Bouck, & Lee, 1994). Therefore, it is essential that the volume, grain-size distribution, degree of contamination, and potential for down-stream movement of sediments from behind these dams are known before dam removal can take place.    This ongoing multi-phase study will provide valuable information for dam removals on the Kalamazoo River and other dam removal projects in the Great Lakes watershed. This multi-year effort has provided estimates of volume of fine-grain sediment behind three dams; is currently collecting sediment coring data below the Plainwell Dam; plans to continue monitoring streamflow and sediment transport before, during, and after dam removals; and proposes an additional volume estimate at the Otsego City Dam. A sediment-transport model on the upstream Plainwell Dam could be designed and calibrated and would be useful in predicting downstream sediment movement before dam removal takes place.                 Objectives         Estimate the volume, grain-size distribution, and potential for down-stream movement of sediments from behind the Plainwell, Otsego City, Otsego, and Trowbridge Dams. Continue to operate two daily-discharge gaging stations; one above and one below this multi-dam reach. Continue to collect background suspended sediment data (before removals) using automatic samplers at the downstream Trowbridge gage. Design and calibrate a sediment-transport model at the upstream Plainwell Dam that will predict sediment movement from the City of Plainwell to the Otsego City Dam and possibly project similar effects at other dam sites downstream. Document the effects of removal of these dams on the Kalamazoo River environment, including suspended-sediment, bed load, and stream flow.      While the figures  depicted  illustrate the grids for the Plainwell dam, the procedure was identically applied to each dam in the study.                 Benefits    Although engineering studies and construction efforts have addressed the stabilization of some of these dams on the Kalamazoo River (CDM, 1999, 2000, 2001), the consequences of the removal of the dams are basically unknown. The study of these sites provide an opportunity to monitor the actual mobilization, transport, and ultimate fate of contaminated sediment and has substantial potential to advance the understanding of these hydrologic processes and transfer knowledge to other sites. Refinement and improved accuracy of mathematical approaches to contaminated-sediment transport and other impacts at the Plainwell Dam removal site may mean that future downstream dam removals may only require pre-removal “snapshots” of sediment availability and geomorphic assessments, rather than long-term monitoring, at substantial decrease in cost. Data from the proposed study will aid in making decisions regarding removal of the downstream structures more cost effective and scientifically based.          Products       Rheaume, S. J., C. M.

Study Goals, Objectives, End Product Fish Passage at the Price-Stubb Diversion Dam.  IV.  Past Performance During the preparation of the Draft EA for providing fish passage at the Price-Stubb Diversion dam several issues were identified. Dam removal appears to be the most cost effective passage alternative and is the most natural form of passage.  Before Reclamation could remove the dam, four outstanding issues would have to be resolved: 1) 2) 3) 4) Develop mitigation measures to resolve the Ute Water pumping plant issue Determine whether a hydropower plant will be developed at the dam site Obtain permission for dam removal from owners of the dam. The Mesa County Irrigation District has expressed support for dam removal, but the Palisade Irrigation District is currently opposed to removal. Preliminary geologic investigations indicate landslide stability is not an issue. However, if further investigation and monitoring show that dam removal would decrease landslide stability, this alternative would be eliminated from further consideration.  Ute Water Pumping Plant Intake Issue: Dam removal would adversely affect Ute Water's ability to pump water from the Colorado River. Existing Conditions: Ute Water provides water to about 60,000 residents of the Grand Valley. Their primary water supply is transported via a pipeline from the Plateau Creek drainage off the  CAP-5 - Page 1   Grand Mesa. Ute Water's pumping plant, located approximately 2,000 feet upstream of the dam, is normally used as an emergency backup water supply. Ute Water is currently reconstructing their primary water supply pipeline from Plateau Creek. Whenever the Plateau Creek pipeline is out of service during the next 3 to 4 years, the pumping plant will be used to pump water from the Colorado River. The pumping plant can supply about 15 cfs, which is about 60 percent of the peak daily demand during the summer. As a result, the pipeline reconstruction work will take place during lower demand periods in the winter and spring. Unfortunately, the schedule for this fish passage project coincides with Ute Water's pipeline replacement. Pumping operations require a water surface elevation of about 4,722 feet in the river (Collins, 1999). The dam helps maintain the required water elevation for pumping operations, especially during low flow conditions. Impacts Dam Removal: As discussed above, the Ute Water pumping plant requires a river elevation of at least 4,722 feet. With the dam removed, the river elevation would drop below 4,722 feet whenever the flow is less than 5,500 cfs. Review of historic flow data (average of monthly mean flows from 1933 through 1996) shows Colorado River flows are usually below 5,500 cfs for 9 months each year, from August through April. While the Plateau Creek pipeline is being reconstructed, the pump plant will be the primary water supply during the winter and spring. Consequently, until the pipeline project is completed, severe impacts to water supplies for Grand Valley residents could occur for 9 months each year. Even after the pipeline is complete, the pump plant will still be needed as a backup water supply. Ute Water and Reclamation have identified a number of options to mitigate im pacts to pumping operations caused by dam removal. Ute Water anticipates construction of their new Plateau Creek pipeline will be complete in the fall of 2002. The increased capacity, improved design, and better route of this pipeline will be a dramatic improvement over the existing Plateau Creek pipeline. Ute Water expects the new pipeline to be much more reliable, which will reduce their need to use the pumping plant. Consequently, Ute Water would be more receptive to mitigation measures for dam removal after the new pipeline is completed (meeting with Ute Water, 4/7/99).  Hydropower License Issue: The alternatives could affect the licensee's use of the site to generate hydroelectricity. Existing Conditions: The Jacobson Hydro No. 1 Project proposes to produce hydroelectric power using the Price-Stubb Diversion Dam. After 7 years of study, FERC issued a license on June 19, 1990 to allow non-Federal development of this hydropower project. The project's development has been delayed for several reasons, and plans are underway to amend development plans for the project. On August 7, 1996, the licensee filed an application to amend the project. Proposed amendments included: 1) reduce the installed capacity of the project turbines to 999 kilowatts; 2) locate the power house next to the dam (eliminating the need for a power canal);  CAP-5 - Page 2   3) dedicate up to 100 cfs of water to be used for a fish ladder, attraction flows, and larval separation in the endangered fish recovery effort; 4) dedicate construction and operation and maintenance easements for a fish passage structure. Allowing construction of a fish passage is a condition of the existing hydropower license (FERC No. 4515) to remove jeopardy of the development on the endangered fish. According to Article 411 of the existing FERC license, ""FERC reserves the authority to require the licensee to construct, operate and maintain, or provide for the construction, operation and maintenance of, such fishway as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior"" (FERC, 1990) . FERC prepared a Draft EA on the proposed amendment. The amended project specifically proposes to: ""dedicate a right-of-way or similar property easement to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) for the installation of a fish ladder which is being fully funded by the USBR as partial mitigation for reductions in habitat due to large dam projects below the Jacobson Hydro No. 1 Project on the Colorado River"" (FERC, 1996). The amendment's reduction in the installe d capacity corresponds to a reduced diversion requirement of about 1,000 cfs (FERC, 1995). Reclamation's implementation of any fish passage proposal at the Price-Stubb Dam would be affected by FERC's decision on the license for the Jacobson Hydro No. 1 Project and/or the licensee's decision to proceed with hydropower development. Impacts Dam Removal: Removal of the Price-Stubb Diversion Dam would preclude development of the dam site for power generation. Economic impacts related to dam removal, if any, would be considered following FERC's licensing decision. Reclamation contracted with a licensed appraiser to determine the value of the FERC license. The appraiser found that the project is not economic and that the license had no value. The developer contends that it is viable but his analysis is supported by power rates that are not currently available and construction costs that are very low.  Conclusion: Alternatives to solve the Ute Water pumping issue to Ute Water's satisfaction could easily approach an additional $1,000,000. However, if the Recovery Program delays pursuing passage at the Price-Stubb Dam until after their pipeline is complete, a more economical, but not as reliable solution would be acceptable to Ute Water. This option would costs about $150,000 $250,000 to implement. Even though the option is less reliable, Ute Water would be agreeable to this option since their pipeline is more reliable. The FERC hydropower license issue will be resolved in the ongoing NEPA process. An EA has been released by FERC. A final decision regarding which passage alternative to pursue is dependent on the resolution of the Ute pumping plant, Jacobson hydropower license and ongoing geologic monitoring and evaluations.  Recommendation: Wait until FERC makes a decision on the proposed license amendment. The only passage option that is compatible with hydropower development is a fish ladder similar to the Redlands Fish Ladder. Since the Reclamation's preferred alternative is dam removal, FERC would have to make a decision to revoke the current license. New Alternative: An alternative was identified during the comment period on the Draft Environmental Assessment that would permit construction of fish passage prior to the completion CAP-5 - Page 3   of Ute Water's pipeline. This alternative would be similar to the passageway constructed at Grand Valley Irrigation Company's Diversion dam. The existin g dam would be left in place and a passageway would be constructed downstream. Positive aspects of this alternative include no potential disturbance to the upstream landslide, no effect to Ute Water, and no potential threat to the upstream river siphon. This option would not be compatible wit h hyropower development. Costs estimates indicate that this alternative would cost 25 to 50 percent more than the delayed dam removal option. Recreational interest in the Grand Valley including the Grand Junction River Front Commission have indicated a willingness to pay for the increased cost due to the recreational potential. Fiscal Year 2000 activities include developing physical model to determine if this option is possible. V. Task description 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. VI.

May 1st was spent in a classroom setting. After introductions each Region and TSC gave an overview of the activities in their respective offices.           The Great Plains Region was not represented and they were missed. However, since TSC is within the GP Region boundaries they took the liberty of presenting those activities that they are aware of on behalf of the Region.           Ten technical papers were given. A list of papers and authors is appended to this review so that anyone wishing to contact authors for further information or discussion may do so. An attendance roster with phone numbers and email addresses is also attached.           The morning sessions centered around advances in computer technology in the ground water and drainage arena. After lunch Chuck Hennig, RSC Research Coordinator, gave a brief summary of Reclamation research activities and conducted a survey to get a sense of direction for future research needs as seen by the group.           This was followed by papers on plastic pipe drain issues, well drilling, and coupling of surface and ground water models.           The final presentation of the day was an introduction to the Elwha River Restoration Project. This laid the foundation for the field trip on May 2nd. There are numerous ground water components in the restoration project. Wells near the reservoirs may go dry as water table levels fall. Some wells within the flood plain may be subject to surface flooding after the dams are removed. A ground water collection system of some sort may replace Elwha Diversion Dam that supplies water to a local mill. Reclamation Ground Water and Drainage personnel have been addressing these issues.           The group toured the project with stops at Elwha Dam and Power Plant which was constructed from 1910 to 1912 and is still in operation. The power plant requires the operator to manually perform many tasks which is  different from the modern automated power plants of today.  The dam and power plant will be removed as part of the restoration project.           The next stop was at Glines Canyon Dam built in 1926 a few miles upstream from Elwha Dam and within the boundaries of Olympic National Park. Glines Canyon Dam will be breeched but the spillway structure will be preserved as an historic monument and tourist attraction. The tour of the dams was led by Rick Parker who operates the dams and power plant and will oversee their removal.           The third stop was at Elwha Diversion Dam where we observed drilling in preparation for aquifer tests to be used in decision making as to the type of replacement structure (i.e. infiltration gallery or Ranney collector) to supply municipal and industrial water during dam removal. .           The next stop was at the State Rearing Channel and City of Port Angeles Ranney Collector, where box lunches were provided. The final stop was on the Lower Elwha Reservation where we discussed ground water impacts to on-site septic systems from anticipated higher ground water levels after dam removal.           The TSC would like to thank Joe Spinazola and Kayti Didricksen for their super efforts in organizing and leading the workshop. WELL DONE!

GX250-64-13976878	State of California Regional Water Quality Control Board North Coast Region  Andrew Jensen September 12, 2002  EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S SUMMARY REPORT 8:00 a.m., September 26, 2002 Regional Water Quality Control Board Hearing Room 5550 Skylane Boulevard, Suite A Santa Rosa, California ITEM: SUBJECT: 9 Update on Request for a Report of Waste Discharge for Del Rio Woods Summer Dam DISCUSSION Current Status Staff of the Regional Water Board have requested a Report of Waste Discharge (ROWD) for the installation and operation of a summer dam in the Russian River near the Del Rio Woods Recreation Area near the City of Healdsburg, Sonoma County. At this time, no ROWD has been received from the Del Rio Woods Recreation and Park District (District) and, therefore, Regional Water Board staff has not prepared proposed Waste Discharge Requirements or a Waiver of Waste Discharge Requirements. Regional Water Board staff continue to work with the District and other resource agencies to find a suitable summer dam structure that will not result in violations of the water quality objectives of the Water Quality Control Plan for the North Coast Region (Basin Plan), or detrimental impacts to the beneficial uses of the Russian River. Project History and Overview For several years, the District has constructed a temporary dam in the Russian River to impound water during the summer months. The dam has been constructed between river mile 34 and 35.75 of the Russian River near Healdsburg, Sonoma County (Attachment 1). The District states that it has installed a dam in this area each year for over 50 years. The stated purpose of the annual dam construction has been to create an impoundment to improve recreational swimming, canoeing, and fishing opportunities for local and regional residents.   Item 9  -2-  The summer dam has been constructed by using heavy equipment to collect earthen material from the floodplain. This earthen material, consisting of river-run gravel, sand and fines, is pushed up by bulldozer on both ends of a permanent concrete weir structure (Attachment 2). Approximately 2,400 cubic yards of earthen material is pushed into stockpiles outside the wetted channel. During construction of the left bank berm (east berm), the bulldozer repeatedly pushes lifts of stockpiled material into the wetted channel, creating a work pad, until the flow of the Russian River is completely blocked. Following the construction of the left berm, the bulldozer is used to cut a low flow channel in the work pad downstream of the weir structure. The construction of the berms typically occurs around June 20th of each year, approximately one week prior to the installation of flashboards at the downstream Healdsburg Memorial Dam. The overall construction of the summer dam generally takes 4-6 days to complete. After the berms are constructed, the river flow is routed through the permanent weir structure. The volume of water impounded by the dam structure is gradually increased and deepened through the installation of flashboards on the weir structure over several days, until the impoundment ranges from 5-11 feet deep and extends upstream for approximately 5,800 feet. When complete, the berms have the following dimensions: the right berm (west berm) contains approximately 1,690 cubic yards (cu3yd) of earthen material, and is approximately 80 feet long, 15 feet high, and 20 feet wide with 2:1 sideslopes; the left berm contains approximately 445 cu3yd of earthen material, and is approximately 40 feet long, 15 feet high, and 20 feet wide with a 1:1 sideslope. Seasonal berm construction requires the discharge of approximately 1,800 cu3yd of fill material below the plane of ordinary high water, raising the substrate elevation up to 15 feet over the 0.12 acre of riverbed. The collection and stockpiling of floodplain material for the berm construction results in the lowering (dredging) of the substrate elevation by an average of six inches over 2.3 acres of riverbed. The dam remains in place throughout the summer and has then been breached beginning the week following Labor Day of each year. The breaching was historically achieved by driving a bulldozer across the river below the dam structure and up onto the east berm. The bulldozer was then used to create a trench through the berm to match the water level of the impoundment, which was completed by hand shoveling a small notch in the trench to allow water flow through it. Over a period of a couple of hours the water entering the trench would eventually erode the trench through the berm and finally resulted in a sudden blowout of the berm and a major turbidity release to the downstream river. All of the bermed material would be allowed to discharge downstream. Last year the District attempted to reduce the turbidity associated with the breaching of the summer dam. It spaced the removal of the flashboards out over several days time, to gradually lower the impoundment water level and minimize the effects of drawdown below the dam. In addition, the west berm was scraped down to wet sand, and a small trench was manually excavated in the berm alongside the permanent weir structure to daylight the water level of the recently lowered impoundment. The resulting flow velocity was allowed to erode and breach the remaining west berm material until a new low-flow channel formed, which took several hours. This protocol still resulted in a major turbidity release into the river.   Item 9 Regulatory Background  -3-  In 1979, the Regional Water Board requested that the District file a Report of Waste Discharge as the initial step in obtaining a permit for the dam. Subsequently, the Regional Water Board adopted Waste Discharge Requirements, Board Order No. 80-48, for the construction and removal of the summer dam. Order No. 80-48 required that there be no increase in turbidity by more than 10 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTUs) by the construction and/or removal of the District's summer dam structure as measured at a point 500 feet downstream of the dam site. The Notification, Monitoring and Reporting Program No. 80-48 required the District to monitor and report to the Regional Water Board whenever a visible turbidity event resulted during construction, normal dam operations, and removal of the structure. This self-monitoring should have resulted in reports of any turbidity problems, however Regional Water Board records indicate that only one report was ever filed (August 15, 1979) reporting visible turbidity. In 1995, during a routine review of all permitted facilities, the Regional Water Board determined that the District operations were a low threat to water quality, based in part on the lack of reported turbidity levels. Staff inspections did not occur during the construction or breaching of the dam, and staff relied on the District's self-reporting of turbidity releases. Based on the available information, and a lack of reports of any turbidity problems, staff recommended that the Regional Water Board rescind its Waste Discharge Requirements and allow the dam to operate under a categorical Waiver of Waste Discharge Requirements established by Regional Water Board Resolution 87-113. Conditions on the categorical waiver require compliance with the Regional Water Board Basin Plan and control of sediment discharges. Present Regulatory Posture While this dam has been constructed for many years, only recently has the magnitude of the sediment discharges become evident to the Regional Water Board. The Regional Water Board received complaints in 2000 and 2001 regarding excessive turbidity in the river attributed to discharges occurring from the removal of the summer dam. Regional Water Board staff investigated and learned that discharges from the 2000 breaching of the dam resulted in significant sediment discharges, and turbidity levels well in excess of those allowable in the Basin Plan for over a mile downstream of the dam, which persisted for several hours. The 2000 dam breaching was videotaped by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and a copy of the video was sent to the Regional Water Board as well as other permitting agencies. The video documents the catastrophic turbidity event associated with the dam removal. These discharges violate the Basin Plan, and result in detrimental impacts to the beneficial uses of the Russian River. In addition, they do not comply with the conditions of the categorical waiver contained in Resolution 87-113. Since the Russian River is listed under Section 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act as impaired due to sediment and concerns over impacts to endangered species have been expressed, there is a need to re-evaluate this discharge. Based on this investigation, the Regional Water Board staff advised the District in August of 2001 of the need to take corrective actions to eliminate the sediment discharges, which were in violation of our Basin Plan. During the meeting, which included the District and other   Item 9  -4-  permitting resource agencies, a detailed step-by-step plan to remove the dam to minimize sediment discharges was discussed and agreements were reached. During a site visit on August 15, 2001, the Regional Water Board inspector informed the District that they needed to conduct turbidity sampling during the removal of the dam. The District's consultant asked whether the Regional Water Board staff could conduct the necessary sampling instead because of the limited funds of the District. Although staff normally would not conduct the monitoring, we indicated in this case that the Regional Water Board could come and take turbidity samples during the removal of the dam provided that they coordinated with us to schedule it and provided us with sufficient advance notice for preparation. The District was to call us to coordinate the timing to ensure appropriate sampling, however the District never called Regional Water Board staff. Eric Shott of the NMFS called the Regional Water Board staff to inform us that the District was removing the dam, but our inspector was out of the office on business for a week, and sampling could not be mobilized. Regardless, the District did not follow through with our agreement on coordinating Dam removal with our agency to arrange turbidity sampling, nor did the District conduct the needed sampling. A major release of turbid water still occurred during the 2001 dam removal and the Regional Water Board received reports of excessive turbidity similar to the 2000 discharges. The Regional Water Board issued a 13267 Order on January 10, 2002, ordering the District to submit a report outlining the sediment discharges associated with the 2000 dam removal, notifying the District that a new Report of Waste Discharge would need to be submitted, and indicating that the previously issued Waiver of Waste Discharge Requirements no longer applied. In a letter to the District dated March 20, 2002, we reiterated this point. On April 1, 2002, the District submitted a letter regarding the sediment releases associated with the dam removal of 2000, but the letter lacked a new report of waste discharge. On April 29, 2002, the Regional Water Board staff issued a letter reiterating the need to submit a Report of Waste Discharge in response to the 13267 Order issued on January 10, 2002. Staff have also coordinated closely with other permitting resource agencies during this process. Staff has met with the District several times, on August 15, 2001, January 10, 2002, March 14, 2002, April 22, 2002, and on August 26, 2002. During these meetings, staff advised the District of its options, the permitting process, and has been working with the District to find a solution that satisfies all parties involved, while protecting the beneficial uses of the Russian River. Comment letters have been received regarding this issue, which have been forwarded to the Regional Water Board members. Recently received letters that have not been forwarded to the Regional Water Board members previously are attached for reference. The District submitted a request to appear before the Regional Water Board, and this agenda item was calendared. PRELIMINARY STAFF RECOMMENDATION: (EOSRDELRIOWOODSSUMMERDAM)  This is an informational item. No Board action is necessary at this time.

To date, there have been at least 469 dams                                        removed nationwide for reasons such as fish                                        passage, safety, erosion control, and habitat                                        restoration (American Rivers, 2000). In                                        California, at least 77 dams have been removed                                        since 1922. There are no centralized records,                                        so that number may be even higher. From                                        1990 to 1999, 10 dams were removed. And                                        in 2000, at least 18 dams were removed,                                        including Saeltzer Dam and several small                                        check and diversion dams. The  table                                          lists dams that have been removed                                        in California for which documentation was                                        located.                                                                         There                                      are many reasons for removing a dam. Some                                      lack economic benefits; others are taken down                                      to restore ecosystems or fisheries; and some                                      are unsafe. Many older dams are filled with                                      sediment and can no longer function or provide                                      the benefits for which they were built. In                                      addition, operators of some dams find it too                                      expensive to bring the structures into compliance                                      with the new laws and regulations. Coordination                                      and cooperation between all parties-including                                      resolution of key issues-is a key to successful                                      dam removal. key issues include funding, removal                                      techniques, construction logistics, sediment                                      disposal, configuration of new fish-friendly                                      water diversions, and how to avoid or minimize                                      environmental impacts of demolition.

Through restoration projects such as the Crocker Creek Dam Removal Project, the Agency strives to improve habitat for fish and other aquatic species and restore runs of salmonid species that have been negatively impacted by current and historic watershed uses.                                     Historic information relevant to the construction and use of the Crocker Creek Dam is limited.                       Long time residents believe that the dam was constructed to impound water for recreational use by the original landowners.  The exact year of construction is unknown, however field investigations by Agency engineers estimate the initial construction to have occurred in the early 1900s.  The dam appears to have been raised and widened at least three times.  The final configuration of the Crocker Creek Dam was a concrete buttress, flashboard dam approximately 30 feet high and 100 feet wide with two concrete spillways (one used and one abandoned), each approximately 150 feet long.  At no point in the dam's history were any attempts made to facilitate fish passage.                                     The current property owner acquired the property on which the dam is located in 1993. The dam began to show signs of impending structural failure as early as 1974, however,                      major structural failure did not occur until 1995.  In 1995, the entire northern side of the dam, with the exception of the original base, collapsed.                       Further failure occurred in 1997.  The impact to Crocker Creek as a result of the failures has been significant. The creek downstream of the dam was inundated with the sediment that had been trapped behind the structure.  The creek upstream of the dam has experienced major erosion and collapsing of banks as a result of the acute loss of the major grade control structure.  Currently, all that remains of the Crocker Creek Dam are the north and south abutments, both spillways, the original base, and a large pile of concrete and other structural debris directly below the base of the dam.  While the elevation of the base is significantly lower than the previous top of the dam, the structure and associated debris pile remains a potential barrier to anadromous salmonids.                                     Project Description                   There are three primary goals for this project: 1) provide upstream and downstream passage for anadromous salmonids, 2) remove the remains of the failed dam, and 3) prevent                      further bank erosion/re-establish riparian vegetation.                    The proposed project would consist of several restoration activities; including demolishing and removing the remaining structures and debris, bank recontouring, biotechnical                      channel adjustments, and revegetation.                   Restoration activities would occur at three locations within the project site.                       Areas 1 and 2 comprised of the remnants of the dam, the spillways, and the adjacent north and south banks.  Area 3 is located approximately 150 feet upstream of Area 1 on the north bank.  This site is an erosional scarp approximately 21 feet high and 170 feet long.  Area 4 is approximately 400 feet upstream of Area 3 on the north bank and encompasses an area that contains a previous bank stabilization project that has failed.                                     At Areas 1 and 2, the remains of the north and south bank abutments and the two concrete spillways would be demolished.  As a result of the dam failure, the north                      abutment has become unstable and is subject to collapse. Stabilizing the abutment would require removing the soil material and recontouring the bank to a 2:1 slope at the north abutment and upstream and downstream for                      approximately 150 feet to match existing grades.  The upstream extent of the recontoured north bank would terminate at the base of a culvert that is failing.                       A down drain would be installed on the culvert and rock would be placed at the base to dissipate stream energy.  Recontouring of the bank would require removal of an abandoned powerline and associated power poles, two transformers, and a concrete pad.                                     The south abutment and concrete spillways (Area 2) are only partially supported in the streambanks.  There are signs of significant erosion and undercutting of the                      banks around these structures.  The abutment and spillways would be demolished and removed.  Concrete rubble from the failed dam would also be removed from the stream channel.  Soil removed from the abutments                      would be used to recontour eroded portions of the spillway along the existing slope.                   The eroding bank at Area 3 would be recontoured to a 2:1 slope.  The slopes would be protected with stabilization fabric to reduce erosion and planted with native                      vegetation.                       An approximately 1,500 cubic yard bench would be created at the base of the slope to reduce stream velocity along the bank and to move the creek back to its original low flow channel.  Two redwood log spurs would be installed at the top and bottom of the constructed bench to deflect stream energy away from the bench.                                     Recontoured slopes at Areas 1, 2, and 3 would be planted with native vegetation based upon surveys of riparian habitat upstream and downstream of the project site.                       Planting of vegetation would help stabilize existing soil to reduce erosion and improve aquatic habitat quality by providing shade over the creek.  An irrigation system would be installed to water the vegetation at all three sites until it is well established.                                     At Area 4, concrete blocks installed during a previous attempt to stabilize the north bank would be removed.                       The bank would then be recontoured to a 2:1 slope and the toe of the bank would be reinforced with a willow revetment and four redwood log spurs.                   The access road leading to the staging area and construction site crosses an ephemeral stream.                       The stream would be surveyed at the crossing and clean drain rock and a culvert would be installed to provide access to the construction site.  The fill and culvert would be removed and the pre-existing grade would be re-established upon completion of the project.                                     Container plants will be contract grown using a local source of propagules.  Container plants will be planted in late fall/early winter 2002.  Willow sprigging                      will be conducted when willow trees are dormant (November- January of 2002/2003).  All planting materials have been collected from areas in or near the Project Site.                                                                                                                                       Back to top
GX001-33-8556735	Volcanic History of the Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field                                 Welded Huckleberry Ridge Tuff at Golden Gate above       Mammoth Hot Springs                 Y ellowstone's world-famous natural       history is marked by such colossal volcanic events that their reflections        in today's landscape are difficult to grasp and impossible to take in at        just a glance, even for those familiar with the signs of past volcanism.                         Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone slices through       thick accumulation of rhyolite                                                  The stunning features of Yellowstone National Park result from great            explosive eruptions and profound collapse of the ground, enormously            thick lava flows, uplift and extensive faulting, and the erosive power            of flowing water and ice. For more than a century, geologists have            discovered and analyzed evidence of the dramatic events that have shaped the            land here. When combined with growing knowledge about how volcanoes            work and the never-ending motion of Earth's surface, the evidence tells            a remarkable story of the Yellowstone landscape.                                                Top of six-sided column of basalt at Sheepeater         Cliff                           Columns of basalt lava flow at Sheepeater         Cliff, outside youngest caldera                           Toe of basalt lava flow, Kilauea Volcano, Hawai`i                                             The volcanism most directly identified with the Yellowstone region       has, during about the past 2 million years, built an immense volcanic       plateau that straddles a high mountain divide—the Yellowstone       Plateau volcanic field. This volcanic region has evolved through 3       cycles of voluminous outpourings of  rhyolite         lava and volcanic ash, each of them climaxing with one of Earth's greatest  pyroclastic-flow  eruptions and the resulting collapse of a central        area to form a large caldera. Other eruptions have poured out  basalt        lava flows around the margins of the volcanic field.                                                        Yellowstone's volcanism is only the most recent         in a 17 million-year history of volcanic activity that has occurred progressively          from southwestern Idaho to Yellowstone National Park. At least six          other large volcanic centers along this path generated  caldera -forming          eruptions; the calderas are no longer visible because they are buried          beneath younger basaltic lava flows and sediments that blanket the          Snake River Plain.  Click on image for larger size and explanation;          image is from  Smith and Siegel (2000) .                                           Three Volcanic Cycles of Yellowstone    Overview    Three extraordinarily large explosive eruptions in the past 2.1  million years each created a giant caldera within or west of  Yellowstone National Park with the spread of enormous volumes of hot,  fragmented volcanic rocks as pyroclastic flows over vast areas within  times as short as a few days or weeks. The accumulated hot ash,  pumice ,  and other rock fragments welded together from their heat and the weight  of overlying material to form extensive sheets of hard lava-like rock.  In some sections, these welded ash-flow tuffs are more than 400 m thick!  These ash-flow sheets—from oldest to youngest, the Huckleberry Ridge,  Mesa Falls, and Lava Creek Tuffs—account for more than half the  material erupted from Yellowstone. The enormous outpouring of magma,  280 to 2,450 km 3  during each explosive event, led to the  collapse of magma-chamber roofs, causing the ground above to subside  by many hundreds of meters to form the calderas.     Before and after these caldera-forming events, eruptions in the Yellowstone area produced rhyolitic and basaltic rocks—large rhyolite lava flows and some  smaller pyroclastic flows in and near where the calderas collapsed and  basalt lava flows around the margins of the calderas.                          Welded tuffs form capping layer on top of Mount Everts             Huckleberry Ridge and Lava Creek ash-flow tuffs         At the top of Mount Everts east of Mammoth Hot Springs, a brownish-colored cliff       held an important clue about the number of caldera-forming eruptions at       Yellowstone.  Click on image for the clue.                  A general sequence of events was repeated in the evolution of each of  Yellowstone's three volcanic cycles:        A broad area, larger than that which will become the caldera is slowly      uplifted. This uplift reflects the development and rise of large volumes of      rhyolite to form a magma chamber at shallow depths in the Earth's crust.      Stretching of the crust above the inflating magma chamber leads to concentric and     radial fracturing and faulting at the surface, typically accompanied by the      extrusion of lava flows from these fractures.         At a critical stage in the evolution of the magma chamber, enormous     volumes of the overpressurized rhyolite magma erupt explosively through      the ring-fracture zone created above the magma chamber during inflation      and uplift, producing extensive ash-flow sheets. As the eruptions partly      empty the chamber of its magma, the roof of the magma chamber collapses      along the same ring fractures to produce a large caldera.         Postcollapse volcanism includes the extrusion of rhyolite lavas and     smaller explosive eruptions of pyroclastic flows within or adjacent to the     the caldera. In the present-day Yellowstone caldera, lakes formed where streams      draining into or along the margin of the caldera were dammed by these thick      intracaldera rhyolite flows, including Shoshone, Lewis, Heart, and Yellowstone      Lakes. Shortly following collapse, the caldera floor may be uplifted by hundreds      of meters in a process known as resurgent doming; this uplift reflects      renewed pressure as magma rises again into the magma chamber. Hydrothermal      activity (such as hot springs and geysers) occurs during all three stages but,      in the third stage, it becomes the dominant or only visible sign at the      surface of magmatic activity below.                                 Thick rhyolite lava flows of the Madison Plateau                 Scientists infer that rhyolite lava flows (left photo) as          well as the caldera-forming ash-flow tuffs were fed from shallow magma          chambers filled by the melting of rocks of the lower continental         crust below Yellowstone. The heat needed to facilitate the melting         process was supplied by the repeated injections of basalt magma from the         mantle into the shallow crust                                      Click on images for a larger-sized       image and description.                                               Undine Falls spills over basalt lava flow                 Basalt lava flows (left photo), though subordinate in         volume to rhyolites, have erupted throughout the 2.3 million-year          volcanic history of the Yellowstone area. The magma feeding these          eruptions originated in the upper part of Earth's mantle and resided          only briefly in the crust before erupting at the surface.                                 The long-term nature of volcanism in this part of North America suggests that      more eruptions will occur as the Yellowstone National Park continues to evolve. The      most recent series of eruptions, 160,000 to 70,000 years ago, extruded      more than 20 thick rhyolite lava flows and domes, most of them within the      youngest caldera. Other postcaldera lavas are basalts, erupted around the margins      of the rhyolitic calderas. Based on Yellowstone's history, the next eruptions      are likely to expel lavas, which might be either rhyolites or basalts, possibly      accompanied by moderate explosive activity. Far less likely would be another      enormous outpouring of material that could lead to a fourth caldera.

The major ash-flow tuffs that erupted at the climax of each cycle are the primary rock units of Yellowstone in areas beyond the caldera complex.  The table below represents the work of geologists who identified, described,  and mapped the different volcanic rock deposits in the Yellowstone area and  determined the order in which they erupted during each of the three  cycles of activity. The units are shown in stratigraphic sequence  (the youngest at the top of the table, oldest at the bottom). Table is from  Christiansen  (2001).

Flows  of the contemporaneous basalts (Madison River basalt, etc.) range in age  from > 110,000 to < 640,000 years ago.    3    Part of the Big Bend Ridge Rhyolite comprises  postcaldera flows of the first cycle and part comprises precaldera  flows of the second cycle.         References    Christiansen, R.L., 2001,  The Quaternary and Pliocene  Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana : U.S.  Geological Survey Professional Paper 729-G, 145 p., 3 plates.

GX001-21-4722956	U.S. Geological Survey   Open-File Report 99-437   Online Version 1.0   Volcano Hazards in the Three Sisters Region, Oregon      By  W.E. Scott, R.M. Iverson, S.P. Schilling, and B.J.    Fisher     Vancouver, Washington   2001    U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR   Bruce Babbitt, Secretary    U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY    Charles G. Groat, Director    This report is preliminary and has not been reviewed for conformity with U.S.   Geological Survey (USGS) editorial standards or with the North American   Stratigraphic Code. Any use of trade, firm, or product names is for descriptive   purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government.                 Summary         Aerial view from southeast of Three Sisters volcanic center (South, Middle,  and North Sister left of center; Broken Top right of center). Light colored  areas on south flank of South Sister are 2,000-yr-old lava flows. Much of  area on lower flanks of Broken Top is mantled by pumice and ash erupted just  prior to emplacement of these lava flows.  Photo by William E. Scott, USGS            Three Sisters is one of three potentially active volcanic centers that   lie close to rapidly growing communities and resort areas in Central Oregon.   Two types of volcanoes exist in the Three Sisters region and each poses   distinct hazards to people and property. South Sister, Middle Sister, and   Broken Top, major composite volcanoes clustered near the center of the   region, have erupted repeatedly over tens of thousands of years and may   erupt explosively in the future. In contrast, mafic volcanoes, which range   from small cinder cones to large shield volcanoes like North Sister and   Belknap Crater, are typically short-lived (weeks to centuries) and erupt   less explosively than do composite volcanoes. Hundreds of mafic volcanoes   scattered through the Three Sisters region are part of a much longer zone   along the High Cascades of Oregon in which birth of new mafic volcanoes   is possible.      This report describes the types of hazardous events that can occur in the   Three Sisters region and the accompanying volcano-hazard-zonation map outlines   areas that could be at risk from such events. Hazardous events include   landslides from the steep flanks of large volcanoes and floods, which need   not be triggered by eruptions, as well as eruption-triggered events such   as fallout of tephra (volcanic ash) and lava flows. A proximal hazard zone   roughly 20 kilometers (12 miles) in diameter surrounding the Three Sisters   and Broken Top could be affected within minutes of the onset of an eruption   or large landslide. Distal hazard zones that follow river valleys downstream   from the Three Sisters and Broken Top could be inundated by lahars (rapid   flows of water-laden rock and mud) generated either by melting of snow   and ice during eruptions or by large landslides. Slow-moving lava flows   could issue from new mafic volcanoes almost anywhere within the region.   Fallout of tephra from eruption clouds can affect areas hundreds of kilometers   (miles) downwind, so eruptions at volcanoes elsewhere in the Cascade Range   also contribute to volcano hazards in Central Oregon.      This report is intended to aid scientists, government officials, and citizens   as they work together to reduce the risk from volcano hazards through public   education and emergency-response planning.

Rapidly developing areas   in Deschutes County occupy the eastern border of the region, and westward   several small communities dot the McKenzie River valley along its course   to the Eugene-Springfield metropolitan area. Three Sisters volcanic center,   one of three volcanic centers in Central Oregon along with Newberry volcano   and Mount Jefferson, has erupted repeatedly for hundreds of thousands of   years, most recently about 1,500 years ago. When a volcano erupts again   in the Three Sisters region, areas close to the erupting vent will be severely   affected. Even areas tens of kilometers (or miles) downstream along the   valleys that head near the vent may be at risk, as may be areas hundreds   of kilometers (miles) downwind. Moreover, areas along valleys that head   on slopes of large, steep volcanoes can be affected by landslides, floods,   and debris flows that can occur without eruptive activity. This report   describes the kinds of hazardous geologic events that have occurred in   the Three Sisters region in the past and shows, in the accompanying volcano-hazard-zonation   map, which areas will likely be at risk during future such events.       Past Hazardous Events      The last eruption in the Three Sisters region occurred before written records   were kept. Therefore, we rely on geologic study of deposits formed by prehistoric   events to assess the frequency, type, and scale of past eruptions, which   serve as a guide for forecasting the character of future eruptions  [1;   numerals in brackets refer to notes listed at the end of this report] .   We also use data from similar volcanoes around the world to gain a general   idea of possible eruption scenarios and hazards.       Two Types of Volcanoes      Two types of volcanoes are found in the Three Sisters region—composite   and mafic.  Composite volcanoes  are restricted to the Three Sisters volcanic   center, erupt episodically over tens to hundreds of thousand of years,   build large cones, and can display a wide range of eruption styles and   explosivity. Middle and South Sister are composite volcanoes that have   been active frequently during the past 100,000 years. Broken Top, a more   deeply eroded composite volcano, has probably not been active during this   period.  Mafic volcanoes   [2]  typically erupt for brief time intervals (weeks   to perhaps centuries), but some can grow almost as large as composite volcanoes.   Subsequent eruptions in the region typically issue from new vents and,   over tens to hundreds of thousands of years, build broad fields of many   volcanoes. Prominent mafic volcanoes in the Three Sisters region include   North Sister, Mount Bachelor, Belknap Crater, Black Butte, and Mount Washington.   Hundreds more mafic volcanoes form the High Cascades of central Oregon   between the neighboring composite volcanoes of Mount Jefferson, 60 kilometers   (40 miles) north of Three Sisters, Newberry volcano, a similar distance   southeast, and Crater Lake, 120 kilometers (75 miles) south (Figure 1).                        Figure 1. Regional setting of Three Sisters region in Central  Oregon showing major rivers, highways, cities, and counties.       Hazardous Events at Composite Volcanoes         All of the types of hazardous events depicted in the accompanying illustration   of a composite volcano (Figure 2) have occurred at South and Middle Sister   in the past and could occur in the future. Most are driven by the eruption   of molten rock, or  magma , but some, like debris avalanches and some lahars,   can occur even without eruptive activity.      As magma nears the surface, gases dissolved in the magma are released.   Rapid release can fragment the magma and propel it upward from the vent   in a rush of expanding hot gas. The resulting solidified rock fragments,   called  tephra , range in size from large bombs (fist-sized up to 1 meter   or more in diameter) to fine dust. Large tephra particles will fall back   to the ground within a few kilometers (miles) of the vent, but frothy pumice   particles and ash (ash is tephra that is sand-sized and finer) can rise   more than ten kilometers (30,000 feet) upward in an eruption cloud. As   the cloud drifts downwind, tephra falls out and blankets areas for tens   to hundreds of kilometers (miles) away. Unless tephra blankets reach thicknesses   great enough to collapse roofs, tephra falls offer little direct threat   to life or structures, but tephra clouds can create tens of minutes to   hours of darkness as they pass over a downwind area, even on sunny days,   and reduce visibility on highways. Ash suspended in air can irritate eyes   and respiratory systems, and prolonged inhalation of certain kinds of tephra   can cause chronic lung disease. Deposits of tephra can topple or short-circuit   electric transformers and power lines, especially if the tephra is wet,   which makes it adhere to surfaces. Tephra ingested by vehicle engines can   clog filters and increase wear. Tephra clouds commonly generate lightning   that can interfere with electrical and communication systems and start   fires. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, even small, dilute tephra   clouds pose great hazards to aircraft that fly into them.             Figure 2. Hazardous events at composite  volcanoes. Illustration modified from USGS Fact Sheet 002-97.      Lessons learned during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in downwind   Washington communities such as Yakima, Ritzville, and Spokane are now used   throughout the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere to prepare governments,   businesses, and citizens for future tephra falls. These three communities   experienced significant disruptions in transportation, business activity,   and community services as a result of fallout of from 0.5 to 8 centimeters   (1/4 to 3 inches) of tephra. The greater the amount of tephra that fell,   the longer a community took to recover. As perceived by residents, tephra   falls of less than 0.5 centimeters (1/4 inch) were a major inconvenience,   whereas falls of more than 1.5 centimeters (2/3 inch) constituted a disaster.   Nonetheless, all three communities recovered to nearly normal activities   within two weeks.      If all or part of a rising eruption column is denser than the surrounding   atmosphere, a slug of tephra and hot gas can collapse downward to form   a  pyroclastic flow , a mobile, hot (hundreds of degrees) mixture of rock   fragments, ash, and gas that surges down the flanks of a volcano at speeds   of 50 to more than 150 kilometers per hour (30-90 miles per hour). Most   pyroclastic flows are confined to valley floors, but accompanying clouds   of hot ash and gas rise higher and can overwhelm even ridge tops. Owing   to their great velocity and high temperature, pyroclastic flows are particularly   dangerous hazards to life and property, but pyroclastic flows would probably   not travel more than 10 kilometers (6 miles) except in extraordinary events.      Less explosive release of gas from ascending magma results in extrusion   of lava (magma that reaches Earth’s surface) from vents. Depending on its   viscosity and rate of discharge, lava will form a bulbous  lava dome  over   the vent or a  lava flow  that extends several to more than 10 kilometers   (6 miles) downslope. Observations of lava flows at similar volcanoes elsewhere   suggest that lava flows in the Three Sisters region would move down valleys   as tongues of liquid lava a few to tens of meters (10-100 feet) thick encased   in a thick cover of hardened lava rubble. Such lava flows can destroy all   structures in their paths and start forest fires, but they advance so slowly   that they seldom endanger people.  Lava domes that grow on steep slopes   are typically unstable and collapse repeatedly as they grow higher and   steeper. Such collapses are another mechanism by which pyroclastic flows   can form.      The latest eruptions on South Sister, which occurred in two closely spaced   episodes about 2,000 years ago (Figure 3), illustrate a relatively modest   scale of eruptive activity. Initial explosive eruptions produced small   pyroclastic flows and tephra fallout from several aligned vents low on   the south flank. Tephra fallout deposits more than 2 meters (7 feet) thick,   composed of pumice, rock fragments, and ash, blanketed areas within 2 kilometers   (1 mile) downwind of vents; at 13 kilometers (8 miles) about 10 centimeters   (4 inches) fell. Less than one centimeter (0.5 inch) of ash fell at least   as far as 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the vents (at Cultus Lake)   and east of the vents (at Bend). Following tephra eruptions, lava emerged   from two vent areas, forming a large lava flow, Rock Mesa, and several   small lava domes. Decades to a few centuries later, a similar eruptive   sequence occurred along a zone of vents that extended from just north of   Sparks Lake to high on the southeast flank of South Sister, as well as   along a shorter zone on the north flank near Carver Lake. Some of the lava   flows and domes of that episode are shown in the accompanying photograph   (Figure 4). Similar-style eruptions, but up to about ten times larger in   terms of volume of ejecta, occurred during and just before the last ice   age, about 30,000 to 15,000 year ago.            Figure 3. Volcanic activity in the Three Sisters region and  other Central Oregon volcanoes during the past 15,000 years [ 1 ]. Bars indicate  approximate age of events or age ranges of several events. Arrow indicates that  ages of eruptions are poorly known and may predate 15,000 years ago by several  thousand years.      The geologic record shows that even much larger eruptions with much wider   impact have occurred in the Three Sisters volcanic center. At least four   times in the past 700,000 years, explosive eruptions that were probably   sited near the present location of Broken Top and Three Sisters produced   pyroclastic flows that swept over a broad area from Sisters to south of   Bend. A tephra fallout deposit as thick as 13 meters (42 feet) composed   largely of fist-sized and smaller white pumice clasts from one of these   eruptions is exposed in numerous pumice quarries. Distal tephra deposits   from this event have even been found in northern California and in cores   from the northeast Pacific Ocean. Such an event today would be catastrophic   for Deschutes County, but, fortunately, events of this magnitude are infrequent.   Furthermore, there is no evidence that the large volume of magma necessary   to drive such an eruption is present in the Three Sisters region today,   nor would such a volume likely be generated in the near future.      Pyroclastic flows on volcanoes like South and Middle Sister can melt snow   and glacier ice and generate  lahars . Lahars are watery flows of volcanic   rocks and mud that surge downstream like rapidly flowing concrete. Lahars   can devastate valley floors tens of kilometers (or miles) from volcanoes.   Small lahars were generated by eruptions 2,000 years ago. Much larger lahars   swept down valleys during earlier eruptions, but their deposits have been   largely removed by erosion or buried by younger glacial and stream deposits.   During the past century, at least five small lahars were generated by glacier-outburst   floods or by failure of glacial-moraine dams that impounded small lakes   on each of the Three Sisters and Broken Top. Serious effects of these events   were largely restricted to undeveloped areas within 10 kilometers (6 miles)   of sources.          Figure 4. Aerial view of the south flank of South Sister  composite volcano showing numerous blocky lava flows erupted about 2,000 years  ago. Early eruptions formed Rock Mesa (just above center, far left), a broad  flat flow emplaced on nearly level ground. Subsequent eruptions formed a line of  lava domes and flows that extend from Sparks Lake meadow (lower right) to Green  Lakes (just above center, far right). Several small lava domes were also formed  on the northeast flank, out of view. Cratered cone in lower left is Talapus  Butte, a basaltic scoria cone.  Photo by William E. Scott, USGS      The steep upper flanks of volcanoes can collapse and spawn rapidly moving   landslides called  debris avalanches . Composite volcanoes are particularly   susceptible to debris avalanches because ground water warmed by residual   volcanic heat and acidified by volcanic gases circulates through porous   zones and weakens rock by transforming it to clay. Small debris avalanches   produced by failures of rock masses on steep cliffs can be triggered by   storms or rapid snowmelt, but the onset of volcanic unrest, with its earthquakes,   steam explosions, and intrusion of magma, greatly increases the likelihood   of debris avalanches and the probability of  catastrophic, large-volume   events. The largest debris avalanches involve failure of entire sides of   volcanoes, and some contain or acquire sufficient water to transform into   lahars that travel down valleys many tens of kilometers (or miles).     Lahars also affect downstream areas by filling stream channels with sediment   and by providing a source of sediment for continued erosion and valley   filling. Examples from many volcanoes, including Mount St. Helens, show   that these effects can persist for years or decades. In such situations   channels become unstable and shift rapidly. Channel capacity shrinks and   susceptibility to flooding increases.       Hazardous Events at Mafic Volcanoes      Mafic volcanoes typically erupt less explosively than do composite volcanoes,   so their eruption impacts are less widespread. Most mafic eruptions in   the Three Sisters region have produced limited tephra deposits and lava   flows that traveled typically 5-15 kilometers (3-9 miles) and rarely 15-20   kilometers (9-12 miles) from vents. Tephra deposits from such eruptions   locally have thicknesses of several meters (6-12 feet) within 2 kilometers   (1.2 miles) of vents, but seldom exceed 10 centimeters (4 inches) at distances   10 kilometers (6 miles) away from vents, and are typically much less. Some   eruptions built scoria cones (piles of volcanic rubble centered around   vents) with aprons of lava flows, like Pilot Butte in Bend. Others constructed   broad shield volcanoes like Belknap Crater (Figure 5) north of McKenzie   Pass, which has lava flows that cover 100 square kilometers (40 square   miles). At about 1,500 years old, Belknap Crater is one of the youngest   mafic volcanoes in the Oregon Cascades.  Some mafic eruptions constructed   only a single small volcano, probably in a matter of days or weeks, while   others involved eruptions along chains of several to tens of vents that   may have continued for decades or centuries. The cluster of scoria cones   and lava flows in the Sand Mountain area west of Santiam Pass was formed   during three eruptive episodes between about 2,000 and 4,000 years ago.    Mount Bachelor, a 1,000-meter-high (3,500 feet) mafic shield volcano,   lies at the north end of a 25-kilometer-long (15 mile) chain of scoria   cones and shield volcanoes that together cover 250 square kilometers (100   square miles). The entire chain formed over a period of several thousand   years that ended about 12,000 years ago.          Figure 5. Belknap Crater (on skyline, right of  center) and Little Belknap (right) mafic shield volcanoes lie just north of  McKenzie Pass. Both are formed of lava flows and scoria deposits that were  erupted about 1,500 years ago.  Photo by William E. Scott, USGS         Lava flows that dam or divert streams and rivers generate additional hazards.    Lakes formed behind lava dams can submerge large upstream areas depending   on dam height and topography. For example, about 7,000 years ago a lava   flow from Lava Butte dammed the reach of the Deschutes River just below   Sunriver and flooded much of the broad basin from Sunriver to almost La   Pine. Popular recreational lakes like Clear Lake in the upper McKenzie   valley and Sparks, Elk, and Lava Lakes in the upper Deschutes valley are   all dammed by lava flows. Lakes dammed by lava flows can also cause flooding   downstream if conditions favor rapid erosion of lake outlets.      The most hazardous events at mafic volcanoes occur when rising magma interacts   explosively with surface water or shallow ground water. Such explosions   form craters and can generate pyroclastic flows that sweep outward several   kilometers. North and South Twin Lakes, near Wickiup Reservoir, fill two   of a series of explosion craters formed in this way. Future mafic eruptions   in areas of abundant ground or surface water like the basins of Sparks   Lake, Crane Prairie, and Wickiup Reservoir might result in this type of   explosive activity.       Volcano-Hazards Zonation Map         The accompanying volcano-hazards zonation map shows areas most likely to   be affected by future hazardous geologic events in the Three Sisters region.   Individual events typically affect only part of a hazard zone. The location   and size of an affected area will depend on the location of the erupting   vent or landslide, the volume of material involved, the snow and ice conditions   around and down slope from the vent, and the character of an eruption,   especially its explosivity.      Hazardous areas around composite volcanoes are divided into  proximal  and    distal hazard zones  depending on distance from the volcano. Some zones   are subdivided further on the basis of their relative degree of hazard.   Zone boundaries are positioned on the basis of (1) the magnitude of past   events at the volcano, as inferred from deposits; (2) mathematical models   that use calibrations from other volcanoes to forecast the probable extent   of future pyroclastic flows, debris avalanches, and lahars; and (3) our   experience and judgment derived from observations and understanding of   events at other similar volcanoes. A regional hazard zone for lava flows   of mafic volcanoes is also shown. Hazard zones for tephra falls are shown   as small-scale inset maps.      Although the hazard map shows sharp boundaries for hazard zones, the  degree   of hazard does not change abruptly at these boundaries . Rather, the hazard   decreases gradually as distance from the volcano increases and decreases   more rapidly as elevation above valley floors increases. Areas immediately   beyond outer hazard zones should not be regarded as hazard-free, because   the boundaries can only be located approximately, especially in areas of   low relief. Too many uncertainties exist about the source, size, and mobility   of future events to locate the boundaries of zero-hazard zones precisely.       Proximal Hazard Zone         The proximal hazard zone includes areas immediately surrounding the three   composite volcanoes, Middle and South Sister and Broken Top, and the large   mafic volcano, North Sister. This zone, which extends outward from summits   for as little as 2 to as many as 10 kilometers (6 miles) depending on local   topography, is subject to several types of rapidly moving, devastating   flows including pyroclastic flows, debris avalanches, lahars, and dam-break   floods  [3] . Lava flows could also affect these zones, but they would move   much more slowly.      On the basis of eruptive activity during the recent geologic past, Middle   and South Sister are the most likely locations for explosive eruptions   that could generate pyroclastic flows. As in the past, vents may open anywhere   on these volcanoes, from the summit to lower flanks. Because such flows   are driven by gravity, those that originate at higher altitudes will generally   travel farther. Eruptions on these peaks would also melt sufficient snow   and ice to generate lahars large enough to extend into the distal hazard   zones.      The probability of future explosive eruptions at Middle and South Sister   is difficult to estimate from the geologic record owing to its fragmentary   nature. Since the last ice age ended, about 12,000 years ago, only two   episodes of explosive eruptions occurred at South Sister, and these were   so closely spaced in time about 2,000 years ago that we regard them as   a single eruptive period that lasted several decades to a few centuries   and encompassed numerous separate eruptive events. Erosion by ice-age glaciers   makes detailed identification and dating of explosive activity during and   prior to the last ice age difficult, but preliminary studies suggest that   at least several eruptive periods occurred at South Sister between about   30,000 and 12,000 years ago although none of these periods are well dated    [1].  This fragmentary record indicates that major periods of eruptive activity   may be separated by several thousand to as much as 10,000 years of dormancy,   which implies an annual probability of entering a new period of eruptive   activity at South and Middle Sister of one in several thousand to 1 in   10,000. However, any signs of restlessness at these volcanoes will increase   these probabilities dramatically. Annual probabilities would likewise rise   greatly if a volcano were to enter an eruptive period.      South, Middle, and North Sister as well as Broken Top are high, steep-sided   peaks that could also produce debris avalanches. Avalanches of modest volume   (less than about 10 million cubic meters) are the most probable and would   affect areas primarily within the proximal hazard zone. Nevertheless, even   modest-sized avalanches that contain sufficient water could transform into   lahars that travel well into distal hazard zones. Very large avalanches,   those involving hundreds of millions of cubic meters of rock debris would   likely be preceded by pronounced volcano deformation driven by intrusion   of magma. Such activity would be detectable by seismometers and volcano   surveys, and thus would elicit advance warning.      Failure of glacial moraine dams that impound high-altitude lakes around   the Three Sisters and Broken Top could release floods of water and debris   whose major impact would be restricted to the proximal hazard zone but   which could inundate parts of distal hazard zones adjacent to streams.   Carver Lake, which lies in the headwaters of the South Fork of Squaw Creek,   and the lake on the east side of Broken Top that drains to Sparks Lake   by way of Crater Creek and Soda Creek, are judged the most likely lakes   to generate future floods or debris flows large enough to affect areas   beyond the proximal hazard zone  [4] . Others of less hazard include several   small lakes in the headwaters of Squaw Creek and the basin (currently with   no lake) below Collier Glacier at the head of White Branch.       Distal Hazard Zones         Explosive eruptions or large debris avalanches on the volcanoes in the   proximal hazard zone can generate lahars of sufficient volume to travel   tens of kilometers (or miles) from source areas. The hazard-zonation map   shows that distal hazards from such events are concentrated in the valleys   of the McKenzie River and its tributaries (White Branch, Separation Creek,   and Horse Creek), the upper Deschutes River, and two Deschutes tributaries   (Tumalo and Squaw Creeks). Debris avalanches and lahars will tend to funnel   into these valleys as they leave the slopes of the large volcanoes within   the proximal hazard zone.      Eruptions 2,000 years ago did not melt enough snow and ice to generate   lahars that traveled much beyond the proximal hazard zone. Some previous   eruptions probably generated  lahars that inundated distal zones, but geologic   evidence of such events is scant and provides little guidance to forecasting   the extent of lahars that may be produced by future eruptions. Likewise,   we have no record of large lahars generated by debris avalanches from which   to assess potential hazards. We therefore use a mathematical technique   that uses data from other volcanoes to estimate the extent of distal inundation   by future lahars of various volumes  [5] .      For each of the major valleys draining the Three Sisters and Broken Top   volcanoes, we computed three nested distal hazard zones that depict anticipated   inundation by hypothetical lahars of three volumes. The largest of these   hypothetical lahar volumes yields the largest distal hazard zone in each   valley; it results from our estimate of the maximum quantity of debris   that might descend suddenly from South or Middle Sister. However, such   extreme lahars would require wholesale failure of a large part of an upper   volcano flank and are unlikely to occur without precursory volcanic activity.   The smallest distal hazard zone in each valley depicts anticipated inundation   patterns from lahars 25 times smaller, which might occur without volcanic   precursors. A hazard zone for only this smallest hypothetical event is   shown in the valley of Tumalo Creek on the east side of Broken Top, because   larger events are very improbable given the small volume of material available   in the drainage area upstream.      Because large lahars are less likely to occur than are small lahars, the   nested distal hazard zones show that the likelihood of lahar inundation   decreases as distances from volcanoes and elevations above valley floors   increase. On the basis of no prior events in the past 10,000 years, we   estimate that a lahar voluminous enough to inundate the largest of the   distal hazard zones in any valley has an annual probability less than 1   in 10,000. A lahar voluminous enough to inundate the smallest of the distal   hazard zones in any valley has a greater annual probability, perhaps between   1 in 1000 to 1 in 10,000. Still smaller lahars that result from phenomena   such as moraine-dam failures are much more likely to occur (annual probability   greater than 1 in 100 in potentially affected valleys), but are apt to   inundate only parts of the smallest distal hazard zones immediately adjacent   to streams. In such instances, some debris may travel farther downstream   but stay mostly confined within stream banks.          Figure 6. This house in a distal hazard zone of  Mount St. Helens was partly buried by lahars from the 1980 eruption. Note the  high mud line on the house and large amounts of woody debris carried by the  lahars.  Photo by Lyn Topinka, USGS.            McKenzie River Valley      White Branch and Separation Creek drain the west slopes of North, Middle,   and South Sister. Separation Creek joins the valley of Horse Creek, and   the valleys of both Horse Creek and White Branch enter the McKenzie River   valley near McKenzie Bridge. Smaller-volume lahars will largely come to   rest here as material is deposited in this broad and relatively gently   sloping reach of the valley. Parts of these lahars could continue downstream,   but be largely restricted to channels and flood plains. The potential exists   for deposits in the area around Belknap Springs or McKenzie Bridge to temporarily   impound water in the reach of the McKenzie immediately upstream. Breaching   of these temporary debris dams could send floods and lahars racing further   downstream. Larger-volume lahars will travel much farther westward.      Flushing of sediment from lahar-impacted areas in the years and decades   following eruptions could fill the McKenzie River channel, decreasing its   capacity to carry flood water and causing the channel to shift across the   valley floor. Depending on the volume of lahar deposits and degree of disturbance   to the watershed, such effects could spawn ongoing sediment problems in   the lower McKenzie valley and along the Willamette River below the McKenzie   confluence, far beyond the initial path of lahars.       Upper Deschutes River Valley      The upper Deschutes River valley, which heads on the south flank of South   Sister and the south and west slopes of Broken Top, consists of a series   of broad lava-dammed basins such as those containing Sparks, Elk, and Lava   Lakes and Crane Prairie Reservoir. These basins will effectively retard   the downstream advance of lahars by causing deposition. However, persistent   sediment problems could follow lahar emplacement as sediment is flushed   through these shallow basins, into Wickiup Reservoir, and farther downstream.   Large developed areas of Sunriver and Bend lie close to the flood plain   of the Deschutes River and could be affected by channel aggradation and   migration resulting from increased sediment loads.       Tumalo Creek Valley      Tumalo Creek drains the area east of Broken Top and is unlikely to experience   large lahars owing to lack of much volcano mass in its headwaters. Nevertheless,   small lahars might descend Tumalo Creek if rapid sedimentation in Crater   Creek accompanied a large landslide or failure of the moraine dam on the   east side of Broken Top and diverted debris over a low divide into Tumalo   Creek. Some debris might also enter Tumalo Creek by way of Crater Creek   Ditch to the south of Broken Top.         Squaw Creek Valley      Squaw Creek and its tributaries drain the east flanks of North, Middle,   and South Sister and the north flank of Broken Top. The headwater streams   join above a narrow valley that opens into a broad, gently sloping debris   fan occupied, in part, by the city of Sisters. Below Sisters, Squaw Creek   enters a narrow, deepening canyon that joins the canyon of the Deschutes   River just upstream from Lake Billy Chinook.      The broad fan of Squaw Creek around Sisters is of particular concern with   regard to potential lahar inundation because Squaw Creek drains a large   sector of the major volcanoes and the distance to Sisters is relatively   short (about 30 kilometers or 20 miles). Typical flow velocities for lahars   through terrain like that along Squaw Creek yield travel times to Sisters   of as little as 30 minutes to one hour, depending on lahar size and point   of origin.       Regional Lava-Flow Hazard Zone      The regional lava-flow hazard zone outlines the area of the Three Sisters   region subject to lava flows from eruptions of mafic volcanoes. The zone   is defined by the distribution of mafic volcanoes that formed during roughly   the past one million years. Hazards from thick tephra fall, ballistic projectiles,   and pyroclastic flows would be restricted to within a few kilometers of   vents, but lava flows could travel much farther. As past lava flows from   mafic volcanoes in the region  traveled typically less than 10 to 15 kilometers   (6 to 9 miles) and rarely 15-20 kilometers (9-12 miles) from vents, we   locate the hazard zone boundary about 10 kilometers downslope from the   margin of the potential vent area, but caution that exceptional lava flows   could extend farther. The hazard zone covers a broad area in central Oregon,   including Bend, Sisters, and La Pine.      The lava-flow hazard zone includes areas on the lower flanks of Newberry   volcano that are described in a report similar to this one (U.S. Geological   Survey Open-File Report 97-513, see References and Suggested Additional   Reading).      The annual probability of an eruption of a mafic volcano within the Three   Sisters region can be estimated from the frequency of past activity as   shown in the middle column of Figure 3. During the past 6,000 years, four   episodes of activity, each lasting up to several centuries long and consisting   of eruption of scoria and lava flows from several vents, have affected   the region. Such a frequency suggests that the average annual probability   of future mafic eruptions is roughly 1 in 1,500  [6] . Because most recent   activity has been concentrated in the area between the North Sister and   Santiam Pass, future activity is probably more likely there than in other   parts of the lava-flow hazard zone to the south and east, which includes   most of the settled areas in the region. Furthermore, because only a relatively   small part of the entire lava-flow hazard zone is affected during one eruptive   episode, the annual probability of any given point in the hazard zone being   affected is considerably less than the average annual probability of 1   in 1,500. We estimate the range of annual probabilities falls between 1   in 10,000, for some areas near the Cascade Crest around Three Sisters and   on the upper flanks of Newberry volcano, to 1 in 1,000,000 elsewhere.          Figure 7. Even a minor tephra fall can be  disruptive in populated areas. Visibility was reduced by this tephra fall of  less than 3 millimeters (1/8 inch) in Anchorage, Alaska, produced by an eruption  of Mount Spurr, which lies 130 kilometers (80 miles) away. Wind and vehicles  resuspended the tephra for days following the initial fall. The simple dust mask  worn by the bicycle rider is an effective way to minimize inhaling ash  particles.  Photo by Richard Emanuel, USGS.            Tephra Hazard Zones      Eruptions of composite and mafic volcanoes in the Three Sisters region   as well as more distant volcanoes in the Cascade Range are all sources   of potential tephra fall in local communities. In fact, since the last   ice age, the thickest tephra fall in the Bend area, probably about 30 centimeters   (one foot), originated from the huge eruption of ancient Mount Mazama that   created Crater Lake about 7,600 years ago.      The inset maps on the hazard-zonation map show the annual probability of   tephra fall affecting the central Oregon region from all major Cascade   volcanic centers. The maps are based on the combined likelihood of tephra-producing   eruptions occurring at Cascade centers, the relationship between thickness   of a tephra-fall deposit and distance from its source vent, and regional   wind patterns  [7] . Probability zones extend farther east of the range because   winds blow from westerly directions most of the time. One map shows annual   probabilities for a fall of one centimeter (about 0.4 inch) or more and   the other for a fall of 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) or more. The map   patterns illustrate clearly the dominating influence of Mount St. Helens   as a tephra producer. Because small eruptions are more numerous than large   eruptions, the probability of a thick tephra fall at a given locality is   lower than that of a thin tephra fall. The most densely populated areas   of Central Oregon have an annual probability of a tephra fall of 10 centimeters   or more of no greater than 1 in 10,000 and an annual probability of a fall   of 1 centimeter or more of about 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 5,000. The annual probability   of a fall of a few millimeters (fraction of an inch) of tephra is probably   greater than 1 in 1,000.       Hazard Forecasts and Warnings      Scientists recognize several signs of impending volcanic eruptions. The   upward movement of magma into a volcano prior to an eruption causes changes   that can usually be detected by geophysical instruments and visual observation.   Swarms of small earthquakes are generated as rocks break to make room for   rising magma or as heating of fluids causes underground pressures to increase.   Heat from the magma can increase the temperature of ground water and boost   temperatures and steaming from fumaroles; it can also generate small steam   explosions. The composition of gases emitted by fumaroles can change as   magma nears the surface. Injection of magma into the volcano can cause   swelling or other types of surface deformation.      A regional seismic network, the Pacific Northwest Seismograph Network,   operated jointly by the Geophysics Program at the University of Washington   and U.S. Geological Survey has located few earthquakes in the Three Sisters   region during the past two decades. The onset of earthquake activity would   quickly gain scientists’ attention and prompt deployment of additional   seismometers to better locate earthquakes. At monitored volcanoes elsewhere   in the world similar to those in the Three Sisters region, a notable increase   in seismicity has occurred days to months before eruptions. Earthquakes   associated with volcanic unrest are typically small (rarely exceeding magnitude   4) and generally pose little direct hazard to structures in surrounding   communities.      Scientists have conducted other studies aimed at developing baseline data   to help detect precursory activity at South Sister. A network of precisely   surveyed points has been remeasured several times. An increase in seismicity   would prompt the resurvey of this network or creation of new networks to   look for slight ground movements that might indicate upward movement of   new magma. Concurrently, ground-based and airborne techniques would be   employed to search for signs of volcanic gas release, another sign of magma   movement.      Periods of unrest at volcanoes are usually times of great uncertainty.   Although outstanding advances have been made in volcano monitoring and   eruption forecasting over the past few decades, scientists are often able   to make only very general statements about the probability, type, and scale   of an impending eruption. Precursory activity can go through accelerating   and decelerating phases, and sometimes die out without leading to eruption.   Government officials and the public must realize the limitations in forecasting   eruptions and be prepared for such uncertainty.         Protecting Our Communities and Ourselves From Volcano Hazards      Communities, businesses, and citizens need to plan ahead to mitigate the   effects of future eruptions, debris avalanches, and lahars. Long-term mitigation   includes using information about volcano hazards when making decisions   about land use and siting of critical facilities. For example, development   could avoid areas judged to have an unacceptably high risk or be planned   to reduce the level of risk.      When volcanoes erupt or threaten to erupt, appropriate emergency responses   are needed. Such responses will be most effective if citizens and public   officials have an understanding of volcano hazards and have planned the   actions needed to protect communities. Because an eruption can occur within   days to months of the first precursory activity and because some hazardous   events can occur without warning, suitable emergency plans should be made   beforehand. Public officials need to consider issues such as public education,   communications, and evacuations. Emergency plans already developed for   floods may apply, with modifications, to hazards from lahars.      Businesses and individuals should also make plans to respond to volcano   emergencies. Planning is prudent because once an emergency begins, public   resources can often be overwhelmed, and citizens may need to provide for   themselves and make informed decisions. The Red Cross recommends numerous   items that should be kept in homes, cars, and businesses for many types   of emergencies that are much more probable than a volcanic eruption. A   map showing the shortest route to high ground will also be helpful.      The most important additional item is knowledge about volcano hazards and,   especially, a plan of action based on the relative safety of areas around   home, school, and work. Lahars pose the biggest sudden threat to people   living in valleys that drain the Three Sisters. The best strategy for avoiding   a lahar is to move to the highest possible ground. A safe height above   river channels depends on many factors including size of the lahar, distance   from the volcano, and shape of the valley. For areas beyond the proximal   hazard zone, all but the largest lahars will probably rise less than 30   meters (100 feet) above river level.

[2]  Mafic refers to the type of lava erupted by these short-lived volcanoes.   Most are composed of basalt or basaltic andesite—a few are andesite. This   contrasts with composite volcanoes that erupt mafic lava as well as more   silica-rich lava such as dacite or rhyolite. Eruption of silica-rich lava   is typically more explosive than that of mafic lava.       [3 ] The proximal hazard zone was created by projecting so-called energy   cones described by  H/L  = 0.2 from the summits of four high peaks (South,   Middle, and North Sister and Broken Top) on a digital topographic base   map of the Three Sisters area ( cf. e.g. , Malin, M.C., and Sheridan, M.F.,   1982, Computer-assisted mapping of pyroclastic surges, Science, 217, 637-640;   Hayashi, J.N., and Self, S., 1992, A comparison of pyroclastic flow and   debris avalanche mobility, Journal of Geophysical Research, 97(B), 9063-9071;   Iverson, R.M., Schilling, S.P. and Vallance, J.W., 1998, Objective delineation   of lahar-inundation zones: Geological Society of America Bulletin, 110,   972-984). Here  H  is the vertical distance of descent from the summit, and    L  is the horizontal distance of travel from the summit. Pyroclastic flows   typically exhibit energy-cone slopes no lower than  H/L  = 0.2. Debris avalanches   of large volume (more than 100 million cubic meters) can exhibit lower   energy-cone slopes than do pyroclastic flows (travel farther for a given   drop), and most such far-traveled avalanches at Three Sisters would funnel   from the proximal hazard zone into valleys encompassed within distal hazard   zones.       [4]  Detailed assessments of floods and lahars associated with emptying   of moraine-dammed lakes in the Three Sisters region have been described   elsewhere (Laenen, A., Scott, K.M., Costa, J.E., and Orzol, L.L., 1987,   Hydrologic hazards along Squaw Creek from a hypothetical failure of the   glacial moraine impounding Carver lake near Sisters, Oregon, U.S. Geological   survey Open-file Report 87-41; O’Connor, J.E., Hardison III, J.H., and   Costa, J.E., in press, Debris flows from failures of Neoglacial moraine   dams in the Three Sisters and Mt. Jefferson Wilderness Areas, Oregon, U.S.   Geological Survey Professional Paper 1608). These assessments indicate   that moraine-dammed lakes in the Three Sisters region contain less than   1 million cubic meters of water each. On the basis of this water volume,   lake geometry, and the past behavior of dam-breach floods in the Three   Sisters region and elsewhere (i.e., Walder, J.S., and O’Connor, J.E., 1997,   Methods for predicting peak discharge of floods caused by failure of natural   and constructed earthen dams, Water Resources Research, 33, 2337-2348),   we estimate that water discharges resulting from future failures of moraine   dams in the Three Sisters region will probably not exceed 300 cubic meters   per second (10,000 cubic feet per second). Flood magnitude might increase   where substantial volumes of sediment are entrained to form lahars, but   the resulting lahar volume is unlikely to exceed several million cubic   meters. The resulting areas of downstream innundation will probably be   smaller than those shown for the smallest (inner) distal hazard zone shown   on the map.       [5]  Distal lahar hazard zones were constructed by assuming hypothetical   lahar volumes of 20 million, 100 million, and 500 million cubic meters.   Using mathematical and digital cartographic techniques described by Iverson,   R.M., Schilling, S.P., and Vallance, J.W., 1998, Objective delineation   of lahar-inundation zones: Geological Society of America Bulletin, v. 110,   p. 972-984, these three volumes were used to compute the probable extent   of inundation downstream from the proximal hazard zone. The largest assumed   volume (500 million cubic meters) represents the largest event that we   believe could occur at the Three Sisters, and it produces the largest distal   hazard zones. The smaller assumed volumes produce smaller nested hazard   zones.       [6]  The average frequency is one eruptive episode per 1,500 years (6,000/4   = 1,500). The average annual probability of the onset of a future episode   is therefore 1 in 1,500.       [7]  Tephra-hazard maps were generated by computer program developed by   R.P. Hoblitt (U.S. Geological Survey, Cascades Volcano Observatory, 1996).             To contact the author, email   William Scott  (wescott@usgs.gov).

The relative ages of lavas can be  readily established from morphological relations, with the oldest capping mesas or buttes, and the most recent  occupying present drainage valleys.  Many of these young flows have no soils developed on them and have well preserved  flow features and associated cinder cones.  The youngest measured age is 12,500 years ago for a young  flow at the Grand Canyon.      The  Uinkaret volcanic field  (1.2 million years ago  to 12,500 years ago) at the north rim of the Grand Canyon  in the Grand Canyon National Park is especially noteworthy.  The lavas are alkalic and commonly contain periodotite inclusions.           Vulcan's Throne , a    Quaternary cinder cone    on the rim of the Canyon is cut by recent fault movement on the  Toroweap fault . Late Cenozoic lava flows have repeatedly flowed down Toroweap Valley and  several adjacent valleys into the Grand Canyon, at times forming large lava dams.   Flows are exposed on the walls of the Grand Canyon, often interbedded with fluvial and lacustrine sediments, up to 600 meters  above present river level.  Several of the dams are estimated to have been at least 200 meters high.   The most recent flows in the Grand Canyon have cascaded over the rim of the Esplanade to the river 1,000 meters below.       Within the river itself is a volcanic neck,   Vulcan's Forge , 25 meters in diameter and rising 15 meters above the river.                       San Francisco Volcanic Field             From: Priest, Duffield, Malis-Clark, Hendley II, and Stauffer, 2001, The San Francisco Volcanic Field, Arizona: USGS Fact Sheet 017-01         Northern Arizona's San Francisco Volcanic Field , much of                           which lies within Coconino and Kaibab National Forests, is                           an area of young volcanoes along the southern margin of                           the Colorado Plateau. During its 6-million-year history,                           this field has produced more than 600 volcanoes. Their                           activity has created a topographically varied landscape                           with forests that extend from the Pinon-Juniper up to the                           Bristlecone Pine life zones. The most prominent landmark                           is  San Francisco Mountain , a      stratovolcano    that rises to 12,633 feet and serves as a scenic backdrop to the city of Flagstaff.      The San Francisco Volcanic Field, which covers about 1,800 square miles, is part of northern Arizona's spectacular landscape. Much of the field lies within Coconino and Kaibab National Forests. Forest life zones in the region range from Pinon-Juniper at lower elevations through Ponderosa Pine to Fir and Bristlecone Pine at the highest elevations. The varied forests and geologic features of the San Francisco Volcanic Field offer diverse recreational opportunities, including camping, hiking, mountain biking, wildlife viewing, and winter sports.      Almost all hills and mountains between Flagstaff and the Grand Canyon are geologically young but extinct volcanoes of the San Francisco Volcanic Field. Without the volcanoes, this region would be a flat, arid plateau. Instead, the area includes both Arizona.s highest mountain.San Francisco Mountain, with peaks rising to 12,633 feet.and the State's youngest volcano -- Sunset Crater, which erupted less than 1,000 years ago and has been a National Monument since 1930.      Why does Northern Arizona have so many geologically young volcanoes? Most volcanoes are located near boundaries of the Earth's tectonic plates, but Arizona is well within the interior of the North American Plate. Some geologists suggest that there is a site of localized melting, or ""hot spot,"" fixed deep within the Earth's mantle beneath northern Arizona. As the North American Plate moves slowly westward over this stationary source of molten rock (magma), eruptions produce volcanoes that are strung out progressively eastward.      The first volcanoes in the San Francisco Volcanic Field began to erupt about 6 million years ago, in an area where the town of Williams is now. Subsequently, a several-mile-wide belt of successively younger eruptions migrated eastward, to the area of modern Flagstaff, and even a bit beyond, toward the valley of the Little Colorado River. Today, this belt of volcanoes extends about 50 miles from west to east.      Although there has been no eruption for nearly 1,000 years, it is likely that eruptions will occur again in the San Francisco Volcanic Field. With an average interval of several thousand years between past periods of volcanic activity, it is impossible to forecast when the next eruption will occur. U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists believe that the most probable sites of future eruptions are in the eastern part of the field and that the eruptions are likely to be small. These future eruptions may provide spectacular volcanic displays but should pose little hazard because of their small size and the relative remoteness of the area.              Humphreys Peak             The peaks of San Francisco Mountain, an eroded                        stratovolcano.which includes Arizona's highest point,                        Humphreys Peak at 12,633 feet -- tower over the ruins of an                        ancient Native American pueblo in Wupatki National                        Monument. The ancient inhabitants of this area must have                        witnessed the eruption of nearby Sunset Crater, the State.s                        youngest volcano, which erupted in about A.D. 1064. San                        Francisco Mountain and Sunset Crater are only two of the                        hundreds of volcanoes in the San Francisco Volcanic Field,                        which covers about 1,800 square miles of northern Arizona.                                     San Francisco Mountain               Stratovolcanoes    have moderately steep slopes and form by the accumulation of layer upon layer of intermediate-viscosity (andesite) lava flows, cinders, and ash, interspersed with deposits from volcanic mudflows (lahars) at lower elevations. These tall, cone-shaped volcanoes, such as Mount Rainier, Washington, and Mount Fuji, Japan, normally rise to a central peak and are built up by countless eruptions over hundreds of thousands of years.  San Francisco Mountain is the only stratovolcano in the San Francisco Volcanic Field and was built by eruptions between about 1 and 0.4 million years ago. Since then, much of the mountain has been removed to create the ""Inner Basin."" The missing material may have been removed quickly and explosively by an eruption similar to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, Washington, or it may have been removed slowly and incrementally by a combination of large landslides, water erosion, and glacial scouring.             Eldon Mountain and Sugarloaf Mountain             The San Francisco Volcanic Field also includes several     lava domes .   Lava domes are formed by dacite and rhyolite magmas, which have high silica contents. Dacite and rhyolite are so viscous that they tend to pile up and form very steep-sided bulbous masses (domes) at the site of eruption. Domes can be active for decades or sometimes centuries. If a lava dome grows entirely by internal inflation, similar to a balloon, it is called an endogenous dome. If, however, magma breaks out through a dome.s flank during inflation and adds new lava layers to the outer surface, the final dome is called exogenous.  Elden Mountain, at the eastern outskirts of Flagstaff, is an excellent example of an exogenous dacite dome and consists of several overlapping lobes of lava. Sugarloaf Mountain, at the entrance to San Francisco Mountain.s Inner Basin, is a rhyolite lava dome. This dome is thought to be endogenous, but its forest cover hides direct evidence of its internal structure.               SP Crater             Most of the more than 600 volcanoes in the San Francisco Volcanic Field are basalt     cinder cones .   Basalt has the lowest viscosity of all common magmas. Cinder cones are relatively small, usually less than 1,000 feet tall, and form within months to years. They are built when gas-charged frothy blobs of basalt magma are erupted as an upward spray, or lava fountain. During flight, these lava blobs cool and fall back to the ground as dark volcanic rock containing cavities created by trapped gas bubbles. If small, these fragments of rock are called ""cinders"" and, if larger, ""bombs."" As the fragments accumulate, they build a cone-shaped hill. Once sufficient gas pressure has been released from the supply of magma, lava oozes quietly out to form a lava flow. This lava typically squeezes out from the base of the cone and tends to flow away for a substantial distance because of its low viscosity. SP Crater, 25 miles north of Flagstaff, is an excellent example of a cinder cone and its associated lava flow.          From: USGS/NPS Geology of the National Parks Website, Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument, August 2001        San Francisco Peaks  are the remnants of the only     stratovolcano    in the  San Francisco volcanic field . For decades, volcanologists suggested  that the mountain now called San Francisco Peaks had simply worn  away over time, eroded bit by bit to form its current bowl-shaped top.  Then, in 1980, the catastrophic explosion of Mount St. Helens forced  us to rethink our ideas about volcanoes.  Many volcanologists now feel that the scooped-out shape of the San Francisco Peaks  may be the result of a catastrophic sideways blast like that of Mount St. Helens.           From: U.S. National Park Service Website, Geology Fieldnotes - Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument, Arizona, April 2000          The cones and lava flows of the    San Francisco volcanic field ,   which covers about 2,000 square miles of the southwestern Colorado Plateau, result from several million years of volcanic activity. These powerful underground forces changed the landscape dramatically beginning in the winter of AD 1064-65.      Sunset Crater    appeared when molten rock sprayed out of a crack in the ground high into the air,  solidified, then fell to earth as large bombs or smaller cinders.  ...          From: Wood and Kienle, 1990, Volcanoes of North America: United States and Canada: Cambridge University Press, 354p., p.280-281,  Contribution by Stephen Self       The  San Francisco volcanic field  is one of several dominantly basaltic volcanic fields of late     Cenozoic age   near the south margin of the Colorado Plateau.  The volcanic field, which is predominantly of Pliocene and Pleistocene age, is just north of a broad transition zone between the Colorado Plateau and Basin and Range provinces.   K-Ar  ages indicate a general north-eastward progression of volcanism during the past 15 million years across the transition zone from central Arizona onto the plateau.      The  San Francisco field lavas , ranging in composition from basalt to rhyolite, erupted through Precambrian basement and the overlying kilometer-thick cover of nearly horizontal sedimentary rocks, mostly of Paleozoic age.  The volume of volcanic rocks is approximately 500 cubic kilometers; they cover an area of about 5,000 square kilometers. ...       Most of the  San Francisco field  is covered by basalt flows ranging in age from approximately 6 million years to less than 1,000 years.  Flows erupted from approximately 600 individual vents, most of which are marked by    cinder cones .    The basalt is predominantly alkali-olivine basalt and associated plagioclase-rich basalt of hawaiitic composition.  ...         The western centers consist of closely spaced silicic domes and some viscous flows.     Bill Williams Mountain  (4.2-2.8 million years ago),  the oldest of the western centers, is composed primarily of andesite and dacite.     Sitgreaves Mountain  (2.8-1.9 million years ago), consists almost entirely of rhyolite domes.     Kendrick Peak  (2.7-1.4 million years ago), consists dominantly of dacite and rhyolite domes and  flows that were intruded and partly buried by andesite. ...      Two additional intermediate to silicic centers,   San Francisco Mountain  and  O'Leary Peak   in the eastern part of the volcanic field ... and are mostly younger than the western centers.         The upper part of the  San Francisco Mountain  is a truncated    stratovolcano   built primarily of porphyritic andesitic and dacitic flows and pyroclastic deposits erupted approximately 1 million to 400,000 thousand years ago.  These lavas overlie still older dacite and rhyolite, however, that are as old as 2.8 million years.  Except for a small volume of plagioclase-rich basalt, basaltic lavas are conspicuously absent within  San Francisco Mountain , even though basalt of the same general age was erupted abundantly to the west, north, and east.  This virtual absence of basalt may reflect the presence of an evolved magma chamber beneath the stratovolcano that blocked ascent of basaltic magma to the surface. ...      The  Sugarloaf rhyolite dome  erupted on the northeast flank of  San Francisco Mountain  approximately 220,000 years ago.  About the same time, the  O'Leary Peak volcanic center , which includes a pair of dacite-porphyry domes, several dacite flows, an andesite flow, and small rhyolite domes, erupted approximately 9 kilometers to the northeast.  One of the dacite-porphyry domes has been dated at 240,000 years, and a dacite flow at 170,000 years.  The  O'Leary Peak volcanic center  and  Sugarloaf  are the youngest major silicic eruptives in the  San Francisco volcanic field .      A deep linear valley transecting the northeast quadrant of  San Francisco Mountain  was formed between 400,000 years ago, when the youngest unit of the composite cone was erupted, and 220,000 years ago, when  Sugarloaf dome  was emplaced at the valley's northeast end.  After the  Sugarloaf  eruption, glaciation further sculptured the valley. ...      The youngest (less than 200,000 years) basaltic lavas occur north and east of  San Francisco Mountain .  The most recent eruption, which began about 1065, A.D., produced the    Sunset Crater Cinder Cone ,  three lava flows, and an extensive air-fall tephra sheet.

From: U.S. National Park Service Website, Geology Fieldnotes - Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument, Arizona, April 2000          The cones and lava flows of the   San Francisco volcanic field ,   which covers about 2,000 square miles of the southwestern Colorado Plateau, result from several million years of volcanic activity. These powerful underground forces changed the landscape dramatically beginning in the winter of AD 1064-65.   Sunset Crater  appeared when molten rock sprayed out of a crack in the ground high into the air,  solidified, then fell to earth as large bombs or smaller cinders. As periodic eruptions continued over the next 200 years, the heavier debris accumulated around the vent creating a 1,000-foot cone. The lightest, smallest particles blew the farthest, dusting 800 square miles of northern Arizona with ash. Perhaps as spectacular as the original pyrotechnics were two subsequent lava flows: the  Kana-A flow  in 1064 and the   Bonito flow  in 1180. They destroyed all living things in their paths. ... In a final burst of activity, around 1250, lava containing iron and sulfur shot out of the vent. The red and yellow  oxidized particles fell back onto the rim as a permanent ""sunset"" so bright that the cone appears still to glow from intense volcanic heat.           From: Wood and Kienle, 1990, Volcanoes of North America: United States and Canada: Cambridge University Press, 354p., p.280-281,  Contribution by Stephen Self         Sunset Crater  is one of the youngest     scoria cones   in the contiguous United States.  The cone is named for the topmost cap of oxidized, red spatter which makes it appear bathed in the light of the sunset.  In the 1920's H.S. Colton saved the cone from severe damage by averting the attempt of a Hollywood movie company to blow it up in order to simulate an eruption.  This led to the establishment of the     National Monument at Sunset Crater .      The Sunset eruption products are a classic example of a monogenetic    strombolian volcanism .    The eruption began with the opening of a 15-kilometer-long fissure, accompanied by curtain of fire activity and the growth of a small lava flow at the southeast end.  Strombolian fountaining then localized near the northwest end and   Sunset scoria cone    grew, with the simultaneous deposition of a widespread scoria fall layer.  At the same time the 11-kilometer-long  Kana-a lava flow   issured from the cone.  This was followed by further cone building and the production of the   Bonito lava flow .  This flow may have come from the base of the cone, as it has rafted portions of the cone on its surface.  The last phase of the eruption featured low-level fountaining that repaired the cone and deposited the cap of scoria and spatter, which oxidized bright red due to retained heat. ...       The age of the eruption is known from an archaeological site in the vicinity of the crater.        How to get there:  From U. S. Route 66 in Flagstaff, take U. S. Route 89 north toward Cameron.

The consolidated deposits of pyroclastic flows, lava flows and domes, and lahars in the Superstition Mountains and adjacent areas testify to a period of intense volcanism about 17 to 25 million years ago in central Arizona.
