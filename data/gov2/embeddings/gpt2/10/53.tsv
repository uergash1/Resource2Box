If so, you have been solicited for an illegal pyramid. What is a Pyramid Scheme? Pyramid schemes are illegal money-making ventures used by individuals, businesses, and small groups of people. A typical pyramid scheme involves a few people at the top who recruit participants to recruit more participants to offer something of value (usually money, but in some cases, time) to the organization. Participants are promised large sums of money if they successfully recruit others to pay money to join the pyramid. Pyramid schemes focus on the exchange of money and recruitment; usually, no legitimate product is sold. How are Pyramid Schemes Disguised? Pyramid schemes may be disguised as games, chain letters, buying clubs, gifting clubs, motivational companies, mail order operations, or investment organizations. Some pyramid schemes also call themselves multilevel marketing operations, but not all multilevel marketing companies are pyramids. The sale of legitimate products is what distinguishes multilevel operations from pyramids. If you are told you will earn commissions for recruiting new members rather than for selling something of value, the organization is probably an illegal pyramid. How Are Pyramids Formed? Basically, a pyramid scheme is formed when a single promoter (or small group of promoters) collects money from a certain number of ""friends"" and instructs them to collect more money from their ""friends."" The cycle goes on from there. Why Do Pyramids Fail? For a pyramid scheme to profit, there would have to be an endless supply of willing participants. However, the supply of participants is limited, and each new level of participants has less chance of recruiting others and a greater chance of losing money. In fact, pyramids inevitably collapse because it is mathematically impossible to recruit the number of people required to support the pyramid. A nine-level pyramid, which is built when each participant gets six ""friends"" to join, would involve over ten million people! 1>6 2>36 3>216 4>1,296 5>7,776 6>46,656 7>279,936   8>1,679,616 9>10,077,696 What Laws Do Pyramid Schemes Violate? Pyramid schemes violate state criminal and civil laws. The Illinois Criminal Code makes it a Class A misdemeanor (prison sentence of one year and $1,000 fine) for any person to knowingly sell, offer to sell, or attempt to sell the right to participate in a pyramid sales scheme. Pyramid schemes also violate the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, which is enforced by the Consumer Fraud Bureau of the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. The law allows the Attorney General to ask the court to impose a civil penalty in the amount of $50,000 per violation. Pyramid Scheme Reality  Pyramids have been made illegal by the Illinois legislature. If discovered, pyramids will be closed down by police, leaving participants subject to fines and possible arrest.  Pyramids are deceptive. Participants in a pyramid, whether they mean to or not, are deceiving those they recruit. Few would pay to join if the odds stacked against them were fully explained.  Pyramids are risky. Pyramiding is based on simple mathematics: many losers pay a few winners.

GX241-03-7346166	Moving Forward with a Reverse Mortgage?                                       Printer-friendly PDF version                       No one  plans       to go broke during retirement. Most seniors fill up their retirements gas      tank and get ready to cruise. But with todays longer life spans, seniors      often need more cash to help them motor through their golden years. No one      can predict the financial roadblocks that may arise, such as the need for      expensive prescriptions or medical procedures. Just one major setback could      drain more of those hard-earned retirement dollars than anyone expects.      Fortunately,      seniors have some options to keep the financial engine running during retirement.      One option is the reverse mortgage. This loan allows senior Texans to liquidate      the equity in their homes for cash without selling the home or incurring a      monthly loan payment. The money can be used to supplement an income, make      a purchase, or cover upcoming expenses.     How does a reverse      mortgage work?      The borrower      typically chooses from three payment options: 1) one lump sum in cash, 2)      equal monthly payments for as long as both borrowers live in the home, or      3) equal monthly payments over time. Repayment is not required until both      borrowers move, sell their home, or are deceased. At that time, the lender      takes the house as payment for the loan. Sometimes families or heirs arrange      to pay off the loan in order to keep the home. Naturally, heirs may object      to a reverse mortgage for that reason.     Like any other      loan, a reverse mortgage accrues interest charges, beginning when the first      payment is made to the borrower. Usually a reverse mortgage is an Adjustable      Rate Mortgage (ARM), with interest compounded monthly.     Are you eligible?           To be eligible      for a reverse mortgage, a borrower must be 62 or older, own the home outright      (or have a low loan balance), and have no other liens against the home. A      borrower continues to be responsible for property taxes, homeowners insurance,      and upkeep of the home; failure to do so can result in foreclosure.      Borrowers are      also required to attend financial counseling before closinga crucial step      that helps a borrower avoid paperwork potholes and learn more about the loan.      You can view a list of local credit counseling agencies  here .     Using the equity      a homeowner has built up over the years can help a borrower detour away from      public assistance programs. Seniors who rely on public assistance need to      research the impact reverse mortgage payouts may have on their benefits.     What about your heirs?            A borrower should      discuss the reverse mortgage loan option with family or other heirs before      closing on the loan. An heir will need to be prepared to pay off the loan      balance if the heir would like to keep the home. Open communication, along      with strong monthly financial planning, is necessary to keep family affairs      running smoothly. One possible financial plan is for the family or heirs to      obtain and maintain life insurance on the borrower, with proceeds designated      for paying off the loan balance.     A reverse mortgage      is not for everyone     If you are running      low on cash, put on the brakes and carefully analyze cash flow before obtaining      a reverse mortgage. Because of the high closing costs, a reverse mortgage      is a bad idea if you plan to move in a couple years, or if you have a temporary      financial emergency that might be better resolved with a home equity loan.      Carefully weigh the pros and cons of all cash flow options. Folks in early      retirement should remember that the younger they are, the less money they      are eligible to receive because of the life expectancy factor in the loan      payment formula.     Consider      your alternatives     Because      these loans can be complicated and expensive, a reverse mortgage is not an      answer to every seniors situation. Consider other strategies before committing      to a reverse mortgage:           Take        out a home equity loan       Decrease        expenses by moving into a smaller home or an apartment       Seek         property tax credit or abatement based on your senior status         If you would like to learn      more about reverse mortgage lending in Texas, contact the Office of Consumer      Credit Commissioner, 2601 North Lamar Boulevard, Austin TX 78705; toll-free      Consumer Helpline (800) 538-1579.

Have you ever received a chain letter that asked you to mail one dollar to the top person on the list and to send the letter to 10 friends? If so, you were solicited for an illegal pyramid scheme.   Pyramid schemes are illegal money-making ventures for individuals, businesses, and small groups of people. A typical pyramid scheme involves a few individuals at the top who recruit participants who, in turn, recruit other participants to offer something of value (usually money, but in some cases, time) to the organization. Recruits are offered the promise of large sums of money if they successfully bring in others to pay money to join the pyramid. Pyramid schemes focus on the exchange of money and recruitment. Usually, there is no legitimate product being sold.   How are Pyramid Schemes Disguised?   Pyramid schemes may be disguised as gift clubs, games, chain letters, buying clubs, motivational companies, mail order operations, or investment organizations. Although some pyramid schemes call themselves multi-level marketing operations, not all multi-level marketing companies are pyramids. The sale of legitimate products is what distinguishes multi-level operations from pyramids. When the emphasis is on recruiting new members rather than selling something of value the organization is probably an illegal pyramid.   How do Pyramid Schemes Work?   Basically, a pyramid scheme is formed when a single promoter (or small group of promoters) collects money from a certain number of ""friends"" and instructs them to collect more money from more of their ""friends."" The cycle goes on from there. As the pyramid grows, the number of people involved becomes too large to sustain the pyramid. Some people will fail to send in their money, or recruit the required number of ""friends,"" and the pyramid crumbles. The majority of people end up on the ""bottom"" of the pyramid and inevitably will lose their initial ""investment."" They won't get their money back or earn their promised fortune because no one is beneath them in the pyramid adding new money to the pot.   Why do Pyramid Schemes Fail?   Pyramid schemes collapse when a few people drop out or refuse to pay, and new members are not recruited in their place. In order for a pyramid scheme to profit, there would have to be a never-ending supply of potential (and willing) participants. In reality, however, the supply of participants is limited, and each new level of participants has less chance of recruiting others and a greater chance of losing money.   How a Typical Pyramid is Organized   A simple pyramid - for example, a five level program built on recruitment by fours - might work like this:     A new recruit would pay $100 to ""join"" the organization.       That money would then be disbursed at regular intervals by the company - $25 to the recruiter, $25 to the company, and $50 to the recruiter's ""upline"" in the form of $10 payments to the recruiter's recruiter, and so on through five levels.       The new recruit would recover the $100 ""fee"" by recruiting four more people, each of whom would pay the recruiter $25.       From this point a participant would then make money from all recruiting done by the four recruits and their recruits.       Assuming successful recruiting by four people down through each of five levels, a participant could (but probably never will) make a cumulative total of $54,560:         $160 on the first level - e.g., four people each recruiting four others at $10 a person (4x4=16 x $10=$160);   $640 on the second level - e.g., 16 people each recruiting four persons at $10 each (16x4=64 x $10=$640);   $2,560 on the third level (64x4=256 x $10);   $10,240 on the fourth level (256x4=1024 x $10);   $40,960 on the fifth level (4x1024=4096 x $10).   $54,560 total ($160+$640+$2,560+$10,240+$40,960)       Pyramid Reality                                           Pyramids are illegal. Because pyramid sales plans are by their very nature deceptive, they are illegal. There is a real risk that a pyramid operation will be closed down by police and the participants subject to fines and possible arrest.                                               Pyramids are deceptive. Participants in a pyramid, whether they mean to or not, are deceiving those they recruit. Few would pay to join if the odds stacked against them were fully explained.                                               Pyramids are losers. Pyramid Schemes are based on simple mathematics: many losers pay a few winners.                                               Pyramids inevitably collapse because it is mathematically impossible to recruit the numbers of people required to support the pyramid. A nine-level pyramid, which is built when each participant gets six ""friends"" to join, would involve over ten million people!                       6  36  216  1,296  7,776  46,656  279,936  1,679,616  10,077,696   Why Would Anyone Pay to Join a Pyramid?   Pyramid promoters are masters of group psychology. At recruiting meetings they create a frenzied, enthusiastic atmosphere where group pressure and promises of easy money play upon people's greed and fear of missing a good deal. It is difficult to resist this kind of appeal unless you recognize that the scheme is rigged against you.   Multi-level Marketing Companies   Multi-level marketing companies differ from pyramid schemes because they are usually legitimate business opportunities. The sale of legitimate products is what distinguishes multi-level marketing operations from pyramids.   If the emphasis in a multi-level marketing company is to build a sales force rather than sell the company's products, it may be an illegal pyramid.   The Difference Between Pyramid Schemes and Multi-level Marketing   Many pyramid promoters attempt to make their schemes look like a multi-level marketing company by using a line of near-worthless products or newsletters and claiming to be in the business of selling them. In pyramid schemes, little or no effort is made to actually market the products. Often there is not even an established market for the products. Rather the ""sale"" of such merchandise is used as a front for the transactions which occur only among and between the operation's distributors.   In pyramid schemes, the emphasis in the sales pitch is on recruiting - building up the organization and the number of participants and on collecting the ""start up"" fee - not on selling the products. Pyramid schemes want to make money from you, not the product sales.   Pyramid Scheme vs. Multi-level Marketing                                           Compensation based on recruiting  vs.  Compensation based on sales                       Few or no sales to consumers  vs.  Sell legitimate products to established markets                       Substantial start-up costs  vs.  Generally small start-up fee                       Potential to be stuck with large amounts of unsold goods  vs.  Will buy back unsold goods if you decide to quit the business                       Make money from you  vs.  Make money with you                       Protect Yourself     Take your time. Don't be rushed into any business deal. Show your attorney any contracts you receive from the company. A legitimate business opportunity won't disappear overnight.   Ask questions about the competency and experience of the company and its officers; the products, including the potential market in your area; start-up fees; buy-back provisions; and actual earnings of current distributors.   Get written copies of all available company literature.   Check with others who have experience with the company and its products. Find out if the products are actually being sold to consumers.   Investigate and verify all information. Contact the Division of Consumer   Protection, your local Chamber of Commerce, or the Better Business Bureau if you suspect a company may be engaged in an illegal pyramid scheme.   If a pyramid promoter or recruiter tells you that the program has been examined and approved by the Division of Consumer Protection or any other state agency, know that the claim is  not true!  The Division of Consumer Protection does NOT approve any marketing programs. If such representations are made to you, please notify the Division."

GX235-02-3544566	Dear Fellow Pennsylvanians:  Pyramid schemes are illegal moneymaking ventures for individuals, businesses, and small groups of people, in which large numbers of people at the bottom of the pyramid pay money to a few people at the top. Each new participant pays for the chance to advance to the top and profit from payments of others who might join later. Recruits are offered the promise of large sums of money if they successfully bring in others to pay money to join the pyramid. Pyramid schemes focus on the exchange of money and recruitment. Usually, there is no legitimate product or service being sold. Pyramids and chain-letter schemes that require more than $25 as an investment are illegal in Pennsylvania. Participants are subject to civil penalties of up up $1,000 for each violation. All money obtained through the pyramid must be returned. Those who make any false or misleading statement to help promote or organize a pyramid are subject to fines and jail sentences.  How do Pyramid Schemes Work? A pyramid scheme is formed when a promoter or promoters collect money from a certain number of people and instruct them to collect more money from others. The cycle goes on from there. As the pyramid grows, the number of people needed to sustain the pyramid becomes too large. Some people will fail to send in their money, or to recruit others, and the pyramid crumbles. The majority of people end up on the bottom of the pyramid and inevitably will lose their initial investment. They wont get their money back or earn their promised fortune because no one is beneath them in the pyramid adding new money to the pot.  How are Pyramid Schemes Disguised? s Pyramid schemes may be disguised as games, chain letters, buying clubs, motivational companies, mail order operations, or investment organizations. s Some pyramid promoters try to make their schemes look like multi-level marketing operations. The sale of legitimate products may distinguish multi-level operations from pyramids. When the emphasis is on recruiting new members rather than selling something of value the organization is probably an illegal pyramid. s A pyramid scheme takes on a line of products and claims to be in the business of selling them to consumers. However, little or no ef fort is made to actually market the products. Instead, money is made in typical pyramid fashion, from recruiting. New distributors are pushed to purchase large and costly amounts of inventory when they sign up. s Pyramid schemes often choose products which are cheap to produce and have no established market value, such as new miracle products, exotic cures, etc. The best way to avoid a disguised pyramid fraud is to know what to look for in a legitimate income opportunity.  Why Would Anyone Pay to Join a Pyramid Scheme? Pyramid promoters are masters of group psychology. At recruiting meetings they create a frenzied, enthusiastic atmosphere where group pressure and promises of easy money play upon peoples greed and fear of missing a good deal. It is difficult to resist this kind of appeal unless you recognize that the scheme is rigged against you.  Mike Fisher Attorney General Commonwealth of Pennsylvania   If it seems too good to be true, it probably is! 8 64 512 4,096 32,768 In the typical pyramid scheme for every individual who collects money you need eight individuals to pay. So, if you are not one of the first individuals in, then it is going to be very difficult to recoup your money - not to mention benefit from additional gains!  How to Protect Yourself From a Bad Investment  PYRAMID SCHEMES If You Play... You Pay  Slow Down! Dont let anyone rush you. A good opportunity to build a business in a multi-level structure will not disappear overnight. People who tell you to get in on the ground floor are implying that people joining later will be left out in the cold.  Where to go for Help  s  Contact the...

Par t I  Be fore You Buy Every year the Consumer Federat ion of America and the Nat ional Associat ion of Consumer Agency Administrators sur vey government consumer prot ect ion of f ices to f ind out what transact ions generat e the most complaints. Auto sales, auto repair, and auto leasing are usually near the top of the list. Other f requent ""winners"" include home improvement, ret ail sales, credit and lending, and mail order. A recent addit ion to the list is the purchase of household goods such as appliances, comput ers and furniture. To avoid problems during these and other consumer transact ions, t ake the st eps and heed the warnings set out below.  Decide in advance exact ly what you want and what you can af ford. Don't buy on impulse or because a salesperson is pressuring you. Ask f riends and f amily for recommendat ions based on their experience. Get advice and price quot es f rom several sellers. Remember, their goal is to make a sale. Review product t est results and other informat ion f rom consumer exper ts. See Consumer Informat ion Sources on page 2. Check out a company's complaint record with your local consumer af f airs of f ice   (p. 84) and the Bet t er Business Bureau (p. 139). Ask about the number of complaints filed, and how the company responded. Compare the number of complaints to the company's volume of business.  Make sure that the company has all appropriat e st at e and local licenses. Occupat ional and prof essional licensing boards cover doctors, lawyers, home improvement contractors, and other businesses. See page 84. Read and underst and any contract you are asked to sign. Make sure there are no blank spaces and that any verbal promises made by the salesperson are in the contract. Get a writ t en copy of guarant ees and warrant ies. Compare their f eatures. Ext ended warrant ies or ser vice contracts are very prof it able for business. Decide whether the extra peace of mind is wor th the price. To find out more, cont act the Federal Trade Commission (p. 135) or your st at e or local consumer of fice (p. 84). Get the seller's refund and return policies. Consider paying by credit card. If you lat er have a legit imat e disput e with the seller, you do not have to pay a charge made on your credit card. See page 20.

A vehicle that gets more miles per gallon is good for your wallet as well as for the environment.  Use the Green Vehicle Guide (www.epa.gov/emissweb) to search for the most fuel-ef f icient and clean motor vehicle.

Shop in advance for the best f inance deal at your credit union, bank or f inance company.  CARS        Your Right s: Secret Warranties and Lemon Law s  On occasion, a company makes a mist ake in the manuf acturing of a motor vehicle. If dealers repor t a number of complaints about a cer t ain par t or vehicle, the maker may allow dealers to repair the problem at no cost to the customer even if the warrant y has expired. A ser vice bullet in not if ies the dealer of the problem and how to resolve it. Because these f ree repairs are not publicized, they are called ""secret warrant ies.""

Auto Service Warranties and Contract s Dealers may try to sell you an auto ser vice contract or ""ext ended warrant y"" when you buy a new or used car. A warrant y comes with a new car and is included in the original price of the vehicle. A ser vice contract is sold separat ely and is a promise to pay for cer t ain repairs or ser vices. Ser vice contracts are usually high-prof it add-ons, costing hundreds to more than $1,000. The ser vice contract may duplicat e warrant y coverage you get f rom the manuf acturer or dealer. Ask these quest ions:  Does the dealer, the manuf acturer, or an independent company back the ser vice contract? What happens to your coverage if the dealer or administrator goes out of business? How are claims handled? Can you choose among several ser vice dealers or repair cent ers or do you have to return to one dealer? Is your car covered if it breaks down on a trip or if you move out of town? Do you need prior authorizat ion for repair work? Are there any exclusions or situat ions when coverage can be denied? Common repairs for par ts like brakes and clutches generally are not included in ser vice contracts. Failure to keep up manuf acturer's recommendat ions for rout ine maint enance can void the ser vice contract. The contract may also prohibit you f rom t aking your car to an independent st at ion for rout ine maint enance or performing the work yourself.

In every used car and truck of f ered for sale, dealers are required by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to post a Buyers Guide that specif ies whether the vehicle is being sold ""as is"" or with a warrant y, and what percent age of repair costs a dealer will pay under the warranty. Keep in mind that privat e sellers generally have less responsibility than dealers for def ects or other problems. Privat e sellers generally don't have to post informat ion.

Agree in advance with the seller that you'll pay for the examinat ion if the car passes must er and the seller will pay if signif icant problems are discovered.

Dings that you may regard as normal wear and t ear may be billed as signif icant damage at the end of your lease. Find out how many miles you can drive in a year. Most leases allow 12,000 to 15,000 miles a year. Expect a charge of 10 to 25 cents for each addit ional mile. Make sure the manuf acturer's warrant y covers the ent ire lease t erm and the number of miles you are likely to drive. Ask the dealer about early t erminat ion charges. Expect to pay a subst ant ial charge if you give the car up before the end of your lease. Ask what happens if the car is tot aled six months af t er the lease is signed. Before you sign the deal, t ake a copy of the contract home and review it carefully away from any dealer pressure. Make sure you are get t ing credit for any trade-in.

Carefully inspect the vehicle and its t ires before rent ing. Check refueling policies and charges. Ask if there is a refundable charge being made to your credit card. At the t ime you pick up your car, a company may make a charge of hundreds of dollars to your credit card. Most companies do not process the amount unless you f ail to return the car as specif ied in your rent al contract. If it is processed, your credit card spending limit may be reduced by the amount of the deposit bringing you near or over your credit card limit and creat ing problems when you try to make other transact ions with the card.

Protect Yoursel f: Weight Reduction If you need to lose weight, t alk with your doctor about the weight loss opt ions that are best for you. Most health exper ts agree that the best and saf est way to lose weight is to modest ly cut calories, eat a balanced diet, and be physically act ive each day. St eer clear of harmful ""self help"" weight loss t act ics, such as smoking, f ast ing, purging, or abusing laxat ives. To make sure you saf ely lose pounds not just dollars, ask these quest ions:  How does the product or ser vice work? People usually do best when they reduce their usual calorie int ake or increase the calories they use by 500  1,000 per day. This allows you to eat enough for good nutrit ion and, if followed daily, helps you lose about 1 to 2 pounds a week. How much will it cost? Ask for an it emized price list that includes membership f ees, f ees for weekly visits, and costs for it ems such as diagnost ic t ests, food, meal replacements, diet ary supplements, and other products in the program. How well does it work? Ask to see studies that document success. Look for how many people complet ed the program, how much weight they lost, and how successfully they've kept the weight of f over a one-year period or longer. What are the risks? Get det ails about side ef f ects that can occur. Check with your doctor before you t ake prescript ions, over-the-count er weight loss drugs, or diet ary supplements. Diets that require drast ic food restrict ion should be under the super vision of a physician. How many calories will you eat each day? For diets under 1500 calories, be sure to check with your health care provider to make sure you meet all your nutrient needs. Does the program include regular physical act ivit y? What are the st af f qualif icat ions? Ask about their training, experience and credent ials. What t ype of a t t ent ion will you receive? For example, will you get individual counseling or group suppor t? How of t en?

Are specialists such as eye doctors and dent ists covered? Does the plan cover special condit ions or treatments such as pregnancy, psychiatric care and physical therapy? Does the plan cover home care or nursing home care? Will the plan cover all medicat ions my physician may prescribe? What are the deduct ibles? Are there any copayments? What are the maximum amounts I will have to pay out of my own pocket to cover expenses? Are there any caps on how much I can be reimbursed in a year? In my lif et ime? If there is a disput e about a bill or ser vice, how is it handled? In some plans, arbitration is mandatory.  HEALTH INSURANCE Most consumers have health care coverage from an employer. Others have medical care paid through government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, or the Vet erans Administrat ion. If you do not have insurance, look in your phone book under Medicaid, Social Ser vices, Medical Assist ance, Human Ser vices, or Communit y Ser vice. Informat ion about Medicare is available at 1-800-MEDICARE. If you have lost group insurance coverage provided by a privat e employer as the result of unemployment, a death, divorce, or loss of ""dependent child"" st atus, you may have the right to t emporary cont inuat ion of coverage under the Consolidat ed Omnibus Budget Reconciliat ion Act (COBRA). You, not the employer, pay the premium for this coverage. When one of these events occur, you must be given at least 60 days to decide whether you wish to purchase the coverage. Some st at es may of f er an insurance pool to provide insurance coverage for residents who are unable to obt ain medical insurance because of health condit ions. These pools may also provide health benef it portability coverage to individuals who have exhaust ed COBRA benef its and have no other por t abilit y opt ions available to them. To find out if a pool is available in your st at e, check with your st at e depar tment of insurance (p. 108). Children who do not have health insurance are likely to be eligible for f ree or low-cost health insurance through similar st at e programs.

Here are some quest ions to ask when considering one of these plans.  What t ype of care is covered? A policy may cover nursing home care, at-home care with the assist ance of visit ing nurses and therapists, or both. There may be restrict ions on assist ed-living f acilit ies that provide less client care than a nursing home. In some cases these f acilit ies are tot ally excluded. At-home care policies may provide coverage for homemaking assist ance such as food preparat ion and housecleaning. What will the benef it amount be? Most plans are writ t en to provide a specif ic dollar benef it per day. The benef it for home care is usually about half the nursing-home benef it. But some policies pay the same for both forms of care. Some pay only the actual charges you incur while others pay the full daily benef it no mat t er what your expenses are. What is the benef it period? It is possible to purchase a policy with lif et ime benef its but this opt ion can be very expensive. Other opt ions for coverage are f rom one to six years. The average nursing home st ay is about two and one-half years. Is the benef it adjust ed for inf lat ion? If you buy a policy prior to age 60, you f ace a signif icant risk that inf lat ion will render a set daily benef it inadequat e by the t ime you need it. Is there a wait ing period before benef its begin? A 20 to 100 day period is not unusual. What qualif ies you for benef its? Some insurers say you must be unable to perform a specif ic number of these act ivit ies of daily living: eat ing, walking, get t ing f rom bed to a chair, dressing, bathing, using a toilet and remaining cont inent.

If PMI is required, ask what the tot al cost of the insurance will be.

Consider ref inancing your mor tgage if you can get a rat e that is a t least one percent age point lower than your exist ing mor tgage rat e and if you plan to keep the new mor tgage for several years or more. Calculat e how much your new mor tgage (including up-f ront f ees) will cost and whether, in the long run, it will cost less than your current mor tgage. One way of saving on ref inancing f ees is to check f irst with the lender who holds your current mor tgage.

The int erest rate on adjust able rat e mor tgage loans (ARMs) can vary a great deal over the lif et ime of the mortgage. An increase of several percent age points might raise payments by hundreds of dollars per month. If a loan has an adjust able-rat e, ask how your rat e and loan payment will vary, including whether payments will be reduced when rat es go down. Ask whether prepayment of a loan is allowed and if there is a penalt y for doing so. Find out what down payment is required.

Prompt ly compare receipts with bank st at ements to be sure there are no errors or unauthorized transact ions.

Although a debit card looks like a credit card, the money for the purchase is transf erred immediat ely f rom your bank account to the store's account. The purchase will be shown on your bank account st at ement. Some stores are beginning to allow a new process of payment called electronic check conversion. With electronic check conversion, your check is used as a source of informat ion - for the check number, your account number, and the number that ident if ies your f inancial inst itut ion. The informat ion is then used to make a onetime electronic payment f rom your account - an electronic funds transf er. When you use a debit card or an electronic funds transf er, f ederal law does not give you the right to stop payment. You must resolve the problem with the seller.

The f ederal government typically backs up bank savings  loans of f ered by f inance companies. When comparing loan of f ers, read all mat erial and ask the following quest ions before you sign:        What is the minimum monthly payment? What is the annual percent age rat e? If the int erest rat e is adjust able, how much can it increase at one t ime? What is the maximum int erest rat e? What are the annual and transact ion f ees?

Insist that they f ill out a form and give you a copy, even if they say the bag will be in on the next f light. Also make sure you know:   the name of the person who f illed out the form; a phone number for follow up.  Airline delays caused by bad weather, air-traf f ic problems, and mechanical repairs are hard to predict or beyond the airlines' control. If your flight is canceled, most airlines will rebook you on their f irst available f light to your dest inat ion, at no addit ional charge. If you are able to f ind a flight on another airline, ask the f irst airline to endorse your t icket to the new carrier. This could save you a f are increase but there is no rule requiring them to do this. Each airline has its own policies about what it will do for delayed passengers; there are no f ederal requirements. If you are delayed, ask the airline if they will pay for meals or a phone call. Contrary to what many people believe, airlines are not required to compensat e passengers whose f lights are delayed or canceled. Overbooked Flight s  Conf irm that the airline will deliver the bag to you without charge when it is found; ask them about this as well. Some airlines will give you money to purchase a few necessit ies. If they don't provide you with cash, ask what t ypes of ar t icles would be reimbursable, and keep all receipts. If a suitcase arrives damaged  the airline will usually pay for repairs. If an it em can't be f ixed, they will negot iat e a set t lement to pay you its depreciat ed value. The same holds true for belongings packed inside. Of course, airlines may decline to pay for damage caused by the fragile nature of the broken it em or inadequat e packing, rather than the airline's handling. Los t Bags  Overbooking is not illegal, and most airlines overbook their scheduled f lights to a cer t ain ext ent in order to compensat e for ""no-shows."" Passengers are somet imes lef t behind or ""bumped"" as a result. When seats are oversold, the U.S. Depar tment of Transpor t at ion requires airlines to ask people to give up their seats volunt arily, in exchange for compensat ion. Airlines set guidelines for what to of f er passengers  money, a f ree trip, food, or lodging. Federal rules prot ect you if you have been bumped against your will on most domest ic flights or outbound int ernat ional f lights. The airline must give you a st at ement describing your rights. If the airline is not able to get you to your final dest inat ion within one hour of your original scheduled arrival t ime, you are ent it led to an onthe-spot payment as compensat ion. The amount depends on the price of the t icket and the length of the delay. An airline may of f er you f ree transpor t at ion on a future f light in place of a check for denied boarding compensat ion, but you have the right to insist on a check. However, to be eligible for compensation, you must have a conf irmed reser vat ion  an ""OK"" in the st atus box of your t icket. You must also meet the airline's deadlines for t icket ing and check-in. Delayed or Damaged Bags  If your bag is declared of f icially lost, you will have to submit a second, more det ailed form within a set t ime period est ablished by the airline. The informat ion you submit is used to est imat e the value of your lost belongings. Airlines consider the depreciat ed value of your possessions, not their original price or the replacement costs. They can invoke a ceiling of $1250 per passenger on the amount of money they'll pay. When your luggage and its cont ents are wor th more than that, you may want to purchase ""excess valuat ion,"" if available, f rom the airline when you check in. The airline may refuse to sell excess valuat ion on some it ems that are especially valuable or breakable, such as ant iques, musical instruments, jewelry, manuscripts, negot iable securit ies and cash. On int ernat ional trips, the airline's liabilit y limit is $9.07 per pound. Keep in mind that these limits are maximums. If the depreciat ed value of your property is worth less than the liabilit y limit, the airline will of f er this lower amount. If the airline's set t lement doesn't fully cover your loss, check your homeowner's or rent er's insurance to see if it covers losses away f rom home. Some credit card companies and travel agencies of f er opt ional or even automat ic supplement al baggage coverage.

Don't make the call if you don't know the cost. Be wary of promises for f ree minut es, gif ts or prizes. Watch out for phony of f ers of f inancial assist ance. Don't st ay on hold, you'll be charged for that t ime. Don't respond to messages to call pay-per-call numbers. Fraudulent pay-per-call ser vices may leave messages that claim to be about a f amily emergency, a prize or a debt. If you use a pay-per-call ser vice, look for new unauthorized monthly charges on your phone bill.  Your Right s: Pay-Per-Call Services Federal law requires adver t isements for pay-per-call ser vices to t ell you:  the cost of the call. It may be a f lat rat e, a per-minut e charge, or calculat ed on some other basis. The ad must also st at e the most you can be charged, if that can be det ermined, and any minimum or addit ional charges that you might have to pay; the odds of winning or the f actors that det ermine your chance of winning any sweepst akes, prizes or awards, and how you can ent er any cont est without calling the 900 number; if the privat e company of f ering informat ion about Federal programs is not endorsed, approved or authorized by the government; and if the ser vice is direct ed primarily to children under the age of 18, that they need their parents' consent to call the number.      The rules bar adver t ising pay-per-call ser vices direct ed to children under age 12 unless they are for legit imat e educat ional services. If the charge for pay-per-call ser vices will be more than $2, you should hear the following informat ion when you dial the number:     the company or organizat ion name and a descript ion of ser vices; the cost of the call; a not ice that you can hang up without any charge within a cer t ain t ime af t er a signal (you can't be charged for list ening to the introduct ion); and a warning to kids under the age of 18 that they need their parents' consent to st ay on the line.  36  For inf ormat ion about Federal programs and ser vices call 1 (800) FED-INFO or visit www.firstgov.gov   TELEPHONE SERVICE  Slamming and Cramming  Pre-Paid Cards  ""Slamming"" is the illegal act of switching your long dist ance, local toll or local telephone company without your permission. You may not know unt il you f ind a dif f erent company name on your bill, or your phone charges are much higher than normal. If you've been slammed:    ask your local phone company to switch you back to your original company at no charge; t ell the original company you're switching back, and ask to be enrolled in your previous calling plan; and cont act the company that slammed you, whose name and number is on the bill, to exercise your rights not to pay those charges.  !  Protect Yoursel f: Slamming and Cramming  If you're unable to resolve your complaint, cont act the Federal Communicat ions Commission (FCC) (p. 134). ""Cramming"" is when companies add charges to your t elephone bill for opt ional ser vices you never agreed to, such as voicemail or ""club memberships."" You may not not ice these monthly charges because they are relat ively small - $5 to $30 dollars - and look like your regular phone charges. To avoid being a vict im:  Consider put t ing a ""block"" on changes in your phone ser vice. Ask your t elephone ser vice provider if they of f er a blocking ser vice, which usually requires the company to not ify you before a change is made. Read the f ine print on cont est entry forms and coupons. You could be agreeing to switch your phone ser vice or buy opt ional ser vices. Watch out for impostors. Companies may f alsely claim to be your regular phone company and of f er some t ype of discount plan or bill consolidat ion. They may also say they are taking a sur vey or pret end to be a government agency. Beware of ""negat ive opt ion not ices."" You can be switched or signed up for opt ional ser vices unless you say no. Look at your t elephone bill carefully every month - especially the pages that show the det ails.        Your phone ser vice cannot be shut of f for refusal to pay for unauthorized ser vices.

For more information, contact SOCAP at 675 North Washington St., Suit e 200, Alexandria, VA 22314; 703-5193700; Fax: 703-549-4886; e-mail: socap@socap.org or on the web at www.socap.org. If you do not f ind the name of the company you are looking for in this sect ion, check the product label or warrant y for the name and address of the manuf acturer. Public libraries also have helpful informat ion. The St andard & Poor's Regist er of Corporat ions, Directors and Execut ives; Trade Names Directory; St andard Directory of Adver t isers; and Dun & Bradstreet Directory are four sources that list informat ion about most f irms. If you cannot find the name of the manuf acturer, the Thomas Register of American Manuf acturers lists the manuf acturers of thousands of products.  A AAMCO Transmissions, Inc.

GX264-31-7843580	"LOAN WORKSHEET #10  HOME EQUITY LENDING OVERVIEW Home equity lending in Texas was allowed by an amendment to the Texas Constitution approved by the voters on November 4, 1997 and became effective January 1, 1998. On November 2, 1989, Texas voters approved changes that corrected problems with reverse mortgages and the size of an urban homestead. The latest changes to the Texas Constitution were approved by the voters on September 13, 2003. These most recent changes authorize home equity lines of credit, allow lenders under certain conditions to cure violations of the home equity lending law, and enables borrowers to refinance home equity loans with a reverse mortgage. This amendment also permits the Finance Commission and Credit Union Commission to issue interpretations of home equity lending provisions at the request of an interested party or on their own motion. Home equity loans are defined as loans that are collateralized by a non-purchase money mortgage or deed of trust on the borrower's principal residence. The borrower's equity, relative to the value of the residence, provides protection for the loan and determines the maximum amount of credit that may be advanced. Traditionally, home equity loans have been used to fund home improvements or consolidate debt, however, their popularity has expanded considerably. Uses now include consumer purchases, personal investments, working capital for small business, and a supplement to personal income. Although home equity lending has existed for many years in other states, home equity loans made under Texas law will differ from these in two major respects: 1) The borrower may not be held personally liable for repayment of the loans; and, 2) The bank may forfeit principal and interest if it fails to comply with the many requirements of the enabling Constitutional Amendment and is not able to cure the violation under Section (6)(Q)(x). Because provisions of the Texas Constitution related to home equity lending have significant penalties to the lender for non-compliance, it will be necessary to evaluate the institution's compliance to the constitutional provision to adequately assess risk. Although many of the following procedures have characteristics of consumer compliance procedures, in reality the primary focus is one of safety and soundness. In addition, a complying loan does not necessarily mean that a loan will be considered low-risk by the examiners. Repayment capacity and history, collateral value and position, and all other traditional measures of loan quality will also be assessed. Although they share many attributes with consumer loans and may be administered by a bank's consumer loan department, home equity loans will be individually sampled by examiners and should be reported in the call report as ""loans secured by 1-4 family residential property.""  Specific policies and procedures: Review the bank's home equity policies and procedures to determine: _____ 1. Does the bank have a board approved policy for making and administering home equity & reverse mortgage loans? 2. Is the bank's documentation and funding system adequate to ensure full compliance with all aspects of the law prior to funding?  _____  f:\dob\proced\comrcl\RB14-Wksht10 - 11-17-03  1  Texas Department of Banking (11/03)   LOAN WORKSHEET #10 - HOME EQUITY LENDING (continued) _____ 3.

Does it seem reasonable? 7. How has the bank set loan pricing? Has it considered and calculated the cost of collection in the event of default? 8. What is the bank's collection policy? Does it evaluate the cost/benefit aspect of acquiring a superior lien? 9. Does the bank offer open-end lines of credit as described in Section 50(t) of the Constitution? If lines of credit are offered, complete the supplemental section in the back of this procedure. _____ 10. How will the bank monitor the property value? Ensure that policy does not deviate from Section 50(a)(6)(J) which prohibits the bank from accelerating the loan or collecting additional monies if the collateral value declines.  _____  _____  _____  _____  _____  _____  f:\dob\proced\comrcl\RB14-Wksht10 - 11-17-03  2  Texas Department of Banking (11/03)   LOAN WORKSHEET #10 - HOME EQUITY LENDING (continued) _____ 11.
