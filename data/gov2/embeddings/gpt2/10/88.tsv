The three-day battle ended with federal          troops surrendering to Commander of the State Guard Gen. Sterling Price.          In response to the state guard's victory, the Union rallied a massive          force and drove Price out of the Missouri Valley and back to the southwest          corner of Missouri.                   In May 1961,          between 20,000 and 25,000 spectators gathered to watch a reenactment of          that 1864 Civil War battle.

During the course of the battle, the house ­ which was considered one          of the finest west of St. Louis ­ changed hands three times.

Nine dangerous mine shafts will be closed using a variety of reclamation              techniques in the Webb City area. These shafts, located on private              property, are the result of lead and zinc mining in the area from              1848 to 1970 and pose safety hazards to landowners and citizens.              The department has been actively involved in reclamation on abandoned              coal mines since 1980. This is the first year the abandoned mine land              funds have been used for non-coal reclamation. The U.S. Department              of the Interior, Office of Surface Mining and Missouri's Land Reclamation              Commission authorized the use of Missouri abandoned mine land funds              for reclamation of dangerous non-coal mine shafts.              Funds for abandoned mine land projects originate from fees collected              from active coal mines by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Office              of Surface Mining. These funds are then disbursed to state and tribal              abandoned mine land programs that have problems associated with coal              mining that occurred prior to 1977.              Previous studies and inventories conducted on the lead and zinc areas              in southwest Missouri indicate the possible existence of many more              mine openings. The department is anticipating future abandoned mine              land funds will be available to close additional dangerous shafts.              For more information on abandoned mine land or to report open shafts              contact the Department of Natural Resources at 1-800-361-4827 or (573)              751-4041.

Nine dangerous mine shafts will be closed using a variety of reclamation              techniques in the Webb City area. These shafts, located on private              property, are the result of lead and zinc mining in the area from              1848 to 1970 and pose safety hazards to landowners and citizens.              The department has been actively involved in reclamation on abandoned              coal mines since 1980. This is the first year the abandoned mine land              funds have been used for non-coal reclamation. The U.S. Department              of the Interior, Office of Surface Mining and Missouri's Land Reclamation              Commission authorized the use of Missouri abandoned mine land funds              for reclamation of dangerous non-coal mine shafts.              Funds for abandoned mine land projects originate from fees collected              from active coal mines by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Office              of Surface Mining. These funds are then disbursed to state and tribal              abandoned mine land programs that have problems associated with coal              mining that occurred prior to 1977.              Previous studies and inventories conducted on the lead and zinc areas              in southwest Missouri indicate the possible existence of many more              mine openings. The department is anticipating future abandoned mine              land funds will be available to close additional dangerous shafts.

The three-day battle ended with federal          troops surrendering to Commander of the State Guard Gen. Sterling Price.          In response to the state guard's victory, the Union rallied a massive          force and drove Price out of the Missouri Valley and back to the southwest          corner of Missouri.                   In May 1961,          between 20,000 and 25,000 spectators gathered to watch a reenactment of          that 1864 Civil War battle. The photo at right shows students of Wentworth          Military Academy reenacting the battle for the Oliver Anderson House.          During the course of the battle, the house ­ which was considered one          of the finest west of St. Louis ­ changed hands three times. The 1853          mansion is now open to the public as part of the  Battle          of Lexington State Historic Site.

The goal is to educate people and provide              alternative options, such as obtaining commercial trash service or              using a  permitted landfill ,  transfer              station , or  recycling              facility  for environmentally sound disposal.              The evidence contained on the tapes resulted in 14 guilty pleas of              23 counts of littering. Some of those caught on tape were frequent              visitors to the roadside dumpsite that has plagued Saline County for              many years.

A grant provided by              the U.S. EPA Region VII and administered through the Department of              Natural Resources will be used to produce a series of educational              fact sheets about water quality and nonpoint source pollution in the              Peruque Creek watershed.             Fact sheet topics will include sediment and erosion, natural stream              corridors, wastewater, flooding and general water quality concerns.              These fact sheets will be made available to planning agencies and              commissions, city and county councils, legislators, government agencies              and the general public. For more information, contact John Johnson              with the department's Water Pollution Control Program at (573) 522-2740.             ""Outreach efforts like these can produce significant improvements              in our state's delicate watersheds,"" said Steve Mahfood, director              of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. ""Being informed              is an important first step in a community's efforts to protect its              water quality.""
